mhbufj,I want to reread The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins but I can't stand Miss Clack.,"I enjoyed Betteredge and the most of the other narrators but Clack is just a no. I actually stopped reading at first because she was so off-putting.

I like the writing style, the plot is interesting and the characters are fairly well developed.

I would almost say it's a favourite of mine but this one annoying character - who's barely in it - is making me not want to read it at all.

How do you get through difficult narrators?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mhbufj/i_want_to_reread_the_moonstone_by_wilkie_collins/,2021-03-31 18:01:48,16,9,books
vhv53r,The Maid is so bad. How is it ranked at #2 of Goodreads top Mystery/Thriller books for 2022 (so far)?,"Now this is just my opinion, but The Maid by Nita Prose was just awful. It’s one of the few books I’ve actively told my friends not to read. I was horrified when I saw a post earlier today of Goodreads ranking and saw that The Maid was ranked one of Top Books of 2022 (so far). I had two main issues with the book: it’s representation of people who are neurodivergent and a bad plot/mystery. 

First, my major issue with the book was the portrayal of the main character, Molly. While not explicitly stated, it is heavily implied that the main character is autistic (or neurodivergent as described in some other reviews). However, the author’s attempt at writing from the perspective of someone who is neurodivergent is just awful. The author writes the main character as childlike and dumb. 

The worst line in the whole book is near the end where the main character muses that she’s not good at understanding facial expressions, but if she really tries she’ll be better. The passage is written in a way that makes it seem as if someone who may be neurodivergent only has difficulties because they don’t try hard enough. I found it to be insulting. For the record, I am not on the spectrum myself, however, a very close family member of mine is on the spectrum . Based on my experience working with and being very close to a number of people with various special needs, I found the portrayal of Molly to be straight up ignorant. Again this is my opinion and others may feel differently based on their lives experiences. (Edited this paragraph for grammar)

Further, the author picks and chooses when the character is “high functioning.” The main character understands nuance when it’s convenient for the plot but not other times when she is easily tricked. Honestly, it’s just very bad representation.

My second issue with the book was the plot and mystery. Slight spoiler, but I’ve removed all names and major plot points >!There’s a failed attempt by the author to have the main character serve as an unreliable narrator, but it reads as if the author was just going for a gotcha moment without the set up. Basically, the main character narrates her day in great detail as her character is very detail oriented, but then at the end the of the book the author reveals that ~ surprise ~ Molly knew who the murderer was the whole time but Molly just didn’t include that information in her earlier narration for some reason.!< if you didn’t click on the spoiler, basically I said: it was a cheap attempt at a mystery that was not worth it in the end. 

I had other issues with the book but these were the two worst parts that ruined the book for me. IMO, it should not be on anyone’s to read list let alone Goodreads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vhv53r/the_maid_is_so_bad_how_is_it_ranked_at_2_of/,2022-06-22 03:16:21,288,1230,books
u555qk,"I love the romance described in older novels, where it isn't the main focus.","I read a lot of Agatha Christie, Sherlock Holmes stories and few old classics such as the Moonstone. I generally read suspense thrillers or slow mysteries. I generally focus on the mystery part. But I love how the romance and courtship was described in those books, where it isn't the main focus, just an extra part. Especially how the quiet, old English women were described and their blushing and accepting. Especially love how the relationship between Stephen and Alexandra was described in Sparkling Cyanide, that of the Why didn't they ask Evans or Bridget's second romance was described in Murder is Easy. Or like that of in Moonstone.

Anyone else feel they would like to stay in an idyllic village and have their own quite lives (with a bit of romance) described by Christie. Anyone else like how the blushing and romance has been described in the older books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/u555qk/i_love_the_romance_described_in_older_novels/,2022-04-16 19:25:12,29,54,books
7ab17x,"[DISCUSSION] Writing an annotated bibliography on ""The Moonstone"" by Wilkie Collins","So far, I am really liking this book. One of the more actual mystery books by Wilkie Collins. But I am writing an annotated bibliography on the book and I am not sure what type of scholarly topic I can write about it on. Should I focus on the message of the story or the author? Maybe I should look for patterns. This book really confuses me on what I should focus on for this paper.

yxcdgf,The lesser works of Wilkie Collins,"Anyone else here ever read Wilkie Collins beyond The Woman in White and The Moonstone ? Of what I've read of his other titles, I really enjoyed Man and Wife, The Law and the Lady, and No Name. I was a little less taken with Armadale and The New Magdalene.

I do appreciate Collins being a bit before his time as a male author concerned with women's social problems. I also don't think he can be touched for building suspense and tension, both of which The Moonstone and The Woman in White are rife with but are pretty much just as well written in No Name and Man and Wife.

Unrelatedly, my own head canon has me convinced No Name was a little bit inspired by Austen's Sense and Sensibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yxcdgf/the_lesser_works_of_wilkie_collins/,2022-11-17 01:19:20,15,20,books
9db4i,1st detective novel? The Moonstone ,,http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/aug/22/audrey-niffenegger-the-moonstone/print,2009-08-23 14:24:27,2,10,books
8a044k,"Fans of detective novels or classic mystery stories who have yet to read *The Moonstone* by Wilkie Collins, do yourself a favor: read it.","I'm currently enrolled in a British Literature Class at my university and this was the novel assigned for us to read periodically throughout the course.  Our teacher seemed extremely excited for us to go through it and gauge our responses after each section.  Despite a little skepticism on my part initially as I am not a huge mystery novel fan, I can say that this is one of my favorite books in a long time.

For a book that came out in the late 1800's, it reads surprisingly modern.  The wittiness of the several fleshed-out narrators gives the novel such a great flow and rhythm.  While the book is relaying the mystery of a stolen (possibly cursed) rare diamond after these events have already occurred, the narrators are relaying the story to the reader through journals and correspondence in sequential order, switching characters once their knowledge of what happened has run dry.  It creates this great sense of irony, having characters who already know how the story ends and make subtle hints or comments about how a certain moment or comment was overlooked by them and could have possibly stopped this whole mess from happening, whereas the reader is simply trying to figure everything out for themselves as best as they can.

Like I mentioned before, the book reads wonderfully for something written 150 years ago.  Not only does the pacing and writing feel modern, but many of the characters that Wilkie Collins created have since become archetypes for the classic detective novels we know today: red herrings, the most obvious suspect trying to clear their name, bumbling local police officers, the brilliant detective who sees the bigger picture before anyone else, etc.

While I have yet to actually read any Sherlock Holmes novels, I feel like this book has raised the bar for them, in a sense, once I finally get around to them.  While Sherlock Holmes is an iconic literary figure in and of himself, I just cannot get over the fact that Collins created so many memorable characters that practically leapt off the page.  From duty-driven and skeptical Head House-Steward Betteridge to the intelligent,yet ignorant Franklin to the fiery and compassionate Rachel to the misunderstood and tragic Rosanna.  The list goes on and on.

I cannot sing praises enough about this book.  The book is far from perfect and there are definitely some areas where the plot sort of stops for a bit out of nowhere, but overall this was a wonderful novel and foray into the first English detective novel ever written.  If you are a fan of classic British literature and have not read this, it is more than worth your time.  If you aren't sure that you enjoy British lit, yet enjoy ""Downton Abbey"" or even the film ""Gosford Park"" and want to read a mystery that simultaneously tackles social status in 19th century England, it is definitely worth checking out.

If you feel like you need to sample it before investing in it completely, [I'm posting a link here to Dickens Journal Online](http://www.djo.org.uk/all-the-year-round/volume-xix/page-73.html) directly to the first three chapters that Collins had published in the *All The Year Round* publication.  Collins continually submitted three or four chapters per issue to this publication for the public to read before compiling them together in book form.  You could actually read *The Moonstone* for free through this site and get to check out some awesome short stories and other publications of this era.  The interface takes a little getting used to, but you'll get the hang of it after a few minutes messing around with it.

Enjoy my friends and happy reading!  Message me and let me know if you are having issues with the site or just to let me know what you think!  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8a044k/fans_of_detective_novels_or_classic_mystery/,2018-04-05 14:24:17,4,13,books

83pao2,The Top 100 Crime Novels,"The list was created in 1990 by the Crime Writers’ Association. I love such lists, but sometimes it's better to trust redditors than some guys from CWA.

I know this post seems to look like a /r/suggestmeabook post, but because I've mentioned huge amount of books, I guess it would be nice to have big discussion here.

This list really represents an average of the top “Best Books of All Time” lists that show up in Google. You will notice there is no prejudice to separating fiction and non-fiction or restriction to books based on appropriate reading age. This is appropriate to me as fiction and non-fiction often have very blurred lines and differentiation between child and adult is sometimes as often blurred. The list has a lot of interesting results and it will be useful in helping me select which books to read. This is a great example of the power of the concept of averages.

Authors that appeared the most in my results are as follows.

1. William Faulkner
2. Ernest Hemingway
3. George Orwell
4. Charles Dickens
5. Vladimir Nabokov
6. James Joyce
7. Virginia Woolf
8. Fyodor Dostoevsky
9. Leo Tolstoy
10. F Scott Fitzgerald
11. Joseph Conrad
12. J K Rowling
13. Henry James
14. J R R Tolkien
15. J D Salinger
16. Raymond Chandler
17. John Steinbeck
18. Agatha Christie
19. Jane Austen
20. Toni Morrison
21. Mark Twain
22. Joseph Heller
23. Franz Kafka

I decided to also calculate the top books based on some genres that I am interested in by searching “best programming book of all time,” “best travel book of all time,” etc. in Google and taking the first page of results and summarizing. This led to the following lists.

Overall I am pretty happy to have some good reading lists that are fairly unbiased and reflect the popular opinion of the average. Of course I won’t read each book directly in order and I likely will read books outside of these lists, but I will use these lists as tools and pick and choose books that are of interest or of potential benefit to me to read throughout the year.

Once I tackle enough of these books I’ll likely look into poetry, plays, and the best books from many of the world’s cultures that are severely unrepresented in these lists.

I hope everyone has a great new year.

7xc64z,I'm currently reading The Woman in White (1859) by Wilkie Collins and it is one of the most amazing mystery novels I've read.,"The first 200 pages are slow, but once it sets itself up...just wow...what a page turner. What a mystery! The gloomy Elizabethan mansions feel real. The characters have memorable personalities, and you really root for the heroes of the story. 

One of my favorite scenes to describe how jaw-droppingly awesome this book is...(I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum): 

I'm reading, and all of a sudden this scene comes out of nowhere and lasts for 5 pages. A woman, a protagonist in the novel, travels to an insane asylum where she believes someone is being kept prisoner. She convinces the prison warden to let her in to interview the prisoner. During that interview, she bribes a nurse. The next day, she returns to the prison (near the ""north wall"" of the prison), on the outskirts, and hides in the lines of trees. The nurse drops off the prisoner to her in the trees. Her and the prisoner then both run through the forest, and easily make it to a train. The asylum guards have no clue what has happened.  

How goddamn awesome and *Gothic* a scene like that is. When I read it, I was just like, ""wow..."" The image of a woman showing up alone to an asylum, out of *nowhere*, and then deceiving the warden, breaking out a woman from there, and then running through the woods, ending up in a train travelling far away from the secluded little asylum in the woods...loved it. I'm at about page 400 and can't wait to see what else happens. It's one of those types of stories you just want to snuggle up inside with on a cold day, near a bonfire, and read, read, read.
