mhbufj,"The Woman in White has a similar narrative style to the Moonstone, if that's something you liked about the Moonstone. The Law and the Lady only has one narrator.",Amanda39,2021-04-02 01:52:47
mhbufj,"And yet it offended readers at the time for entirely different reasons. I saw a really horrible review from when the book was first published, where the reviewer was offended by Dexter's birth defect. I don't mean that they felt he was an offensive portrayal of someone with a birth defect, I mean they literally thought disabled people were an inappropriate subject for a book. At one point they imply that this isn't a safe book for pregnant women to read. [Here's the review, if you'd like to see it for yourself.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20637025)

I also remember reading somewhere that Collins' publishers initially refused to publish the scene where >!Dexter gropes Valeria!< because they felt it was indecent. Collins insisted that the scene be published because he wanted to be realistic about the sort of difficulties a female detective would face.

I've kind of been obsessed with Wilkie Collins for the past couple of months (so far I've read The Woman in White, The Moonstone, The Law and the Lady, and I'm almost done Poor Miss Finch), and I keep wishing I could go back in time and ask the original readers what they thought, because I feel like these books must have been completely different through the eyes of the average Victorian. I mean, Poor Miss Finch is about a racist blind woman whose fiancé is trying to prevent her from finding out that his skin has turned blue from silver nitrate poisoning, because she's literally afraid of dark colors. I'm pretty sure my views on both blindness and racism are drastically different from those of most of the original readers, and that's affecting how I interpret the book. (Although I have to say, Collins himself seems to be incredibly open-minded, which is something I appreciate about his writing.)

I wrote a [post on r/books about The Woman in White](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lb60vk/thoughtsquestions_about_anne_catherick_from_the/) a while back, because I was curious about what the original readers thought about Anne Catherick. I didn't get any answers to that question but, after seeing that review of The Law and the Lady, I'm wondering if I'm better off not knowing.",Amanda39,2021-04-02 17:09:24
mhbufj,"Thanks, I was worried that I was rambling too much.

I really need to read a biography of Wilkie Collins. I know that The Moonstone was influenced by his experiences with opium addiction, and I'm guessing there are probably other parallels to his life in his other books.

From what I do know about his life, I get the impression that he was kind of in this liminal state where he wasn't quite as ""other"" as the characters he wrote about (like you point out, he had privilege as a man), but he wasn't exactly ""normal"" either, due to his relationships and his medical/drug issues. I think that might explain something I find kind of weird about his books: he seems like he really has empathy for his characters, but he also has a sort of ""freak show"" mentality about them. Like half of him is going ""I want to make a serious statement about how society treats the disabled"" and the other half is going ""OMG what if Dexter jumped out of his wheelchair and bounced around on his arms while screaming that he's Shakespeare? That would be amazing!""

And I'm getting kind of meta, because I respect Collins but I'm also really enjoying finding him weird and psychologically dissecting him. I guess empathy and fascination aren't mutually exclusive.",Amanda39,2021-04-03 17:48:31

7ab17x,"The Moonstone was one of the first true ""mystery"" novels.  Wilkie Collins views towards women and relationships was quite exceptional for the time.  I think there is room to include both in your annotation. He is quite an interesting guy and a well known drug addict.  I highly reccomend reading ""Drood"" (can't remember the author but it's a neat piece of historical fiction based around the Moonstone, Collins, and Charles Dickens with an extensive research bibliography) it might help you get a starting point.

yxcdgf,"I've read No Name and loved it. I love a good revenge story. 

I've tried to get through the Moonstone but it was slow for me. I will get back to it sometime.

Loved the Woman in White of course.

I love Collins writing though, lyrical and detailed. I like how he gets you lost in the moment.",bluredditacct,2022-11-17 01:39:46
yxcdgf,"I read The Moonstone. If you don't know that it is written in epistolary fashion from multiple POV's, the first change-over can be jarring. But, it was entertaining and had some interesting social commentary.",,2022-11-18 00:13:28
yxcdgf,"No Name has one heck of a chess match between Lecount and Wragge.  That alone ought to have made it a classic.  

I do think The Moonstone isn't as tense or suspenseful as what one usually gets from Collins, but it's a really satisfying mystery and I love the Robinson Crusoe bits.",My_Poor_Nerves,2022-11-17 01:43:22
8a044k,"Thank you, OP, for this wonderful post. *Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, at the very least, should be read more widely than they are.

The different narrators all have their charms (though Betteredge leaves large shoes to fill!) and all of the characters tend to be endearing in one way or another.

And for being written in the 19th century, Collins' stuff is far more approachable to modern readers than they might think. I was surprised that a lot of the humorous moments and occasional jokes were easy to catch and appreciate, even without much specific knowledge of 19th century England. (Contrast that to Jane Austen, where I sometimes need annotations or something to point out to me that there's a joke based on what type of carriage or gig someone has - otherwise it would sail over my head. And that's not a criticism of Jane Austen, just saying that readers shouldn't be put off Wilkie Collins because they think they won't ""get"" the humor.)",3byeol,2018-04-05 14:47:09
8a044k,It was a recommendation from the podcast I heard yesterday and she did a good job of hyping me up in reading it. There's so many editions of The Moonstone in kindle or google play books. Please help me find the best one to buy and read. Thanks,rjualie,2018-04-19 12:20:15

83pao2,"So I would second The Moonstone (Wilkie Collins) but don’t miss his The Woman in White. (Sorry, didn’t see that t is on the list, but should be in my opinion more highly rated than The Moonstone.)",Goldaline29,2018-03-12 00:07:13
69pygi,"I am fascinated by 'Mystery Novels' set in the grand 1800's where wit and intellect ruled over tools of science and technology.  

A great read of this is Wilkie Collin's 'The Moonstone' and the incomplete but fantastic 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' by Charles Dickens.  Sadly Dickens passed away before finishing the murder mystery but it was his attempt at dipping his mighty pen into the field as well.

Any recommendations for a solid Victorian Mystery Novel that's fun, suspenseful and on par w Dickens, Collins or the like?",Tito_Mojito,2017-05-07 07:01:14

There can't be many that match the quality of The Moonstone or The Woman in White though.",,2017-05-07 10:25:40

7xc64z,"We read it, along with The Moonstone, and some other gothic/regional sort of stuff in one of my lit classes. It's really good. Semi-related: Check out Drood by Dan Simmons.  It's narrated by Wilkie Collins (as fictionalized by Dan Simmons). Spooky, meticulously-researched (I learned more about Dickens than I ever thought possible) and second only to The Terror as far as Simmons's books go.

BTW, a bonfire inside would almost certainly lead to a loss of property and/or injury or death; maybe just a fire in the fireplace:)",asromatifoso,2018-02-13 20:46:40
7xc64z,"I found The Moonstone to be the better novel of the two although I really enjoyed The Woman in White as well! I used both of those novels in my Masters degree dissertation, comparing them to the neo-Victorian genre. 

Collins' writing is one of my Victorian writers. Basil is my next Collins, I think. That or Armadale. 

Enjoy The Moonstone if you end up picking it up!",ambulancechased,2018-02-13 21:52:29
7xc64z,"I really enjoyed The Woman in White--more than I thought I would. Collins's style was surprising modern to me. The uncle (?) who is a very disagreeable aesthete and rarely ventures from his chambers is a wonderful character! So supremely annoying, yet entertaining. I'll not hesitate to try The Moonstone someday.",,2018-02-14 02:32:16
7xc64z,Def gonna look into *The Moonstone*. Even T.S. Eliot said on the record that it was a page turner. ,AChocolateHouse,2018-02-13 22:21:09
7xc64z,"Armadale is good.  

I love the way The Moonstone presents the highly idiosyncratic points of view of all the witnesses - the churchy lady, the guy who only reads Robinson Crusoe, etc, each putting their own slant on the story.",sd_local,2018-02-14 06:02:03
