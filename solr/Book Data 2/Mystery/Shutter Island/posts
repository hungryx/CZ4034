y0frts,Shutter Island Question,"Hi everyone,

I recently finished Shutter Island (late to the game, I know) and I have some questions/ideas that I’d like to discuss which I haven’t seen circulating anywhere. 

The general agreement is that Teddy is actually Andrew and he ends up regressing in the end, resulting in the lobotomy; however, I have a few loose ends I don’t understand. For starters, who was the second Rachel that he met in the cave? I found a few people saying it was him hallucinating, but teddy returns to the same cave the following night and makes notes of the lingering embers from when he was with the real Rachel the night prior, suggesting she was actually real. 

Next, I can’t figure out the conversation Trey Washington had with Teddy if the entire thing was an act. Why would Trey assist him in his plan to leave if Trey knew the entire thing was an attempt for Teddy to have a breakthrough to reality? He literally told Teddy to run and get himself off the island, and that he couldn’t fathom the experiments they did on the island. 

These two points made me consider the possibility that what the real Rachel said was, in fact, the true reality of the situation. Maybe Teddy did know too much, and they were slowly sending him into this psychosis which prohibited him from leaving, just as she said. I noticed that at towards the end Teddy seemed as though he was going to make a breakthrough and discover the true actions on the island, and then he decided to smoke a cigarette despite knowing the effects they had, and then he falls deeper into the psychosis and believes what Cawley tells him at the end.

This might all be a long stretch, but the book always had me questioning if Rachel was right all along, because I couldn’t understand those two parts of the book if the entire thing was made up. 

Any thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0frts/shutter_island_question/,2022-10-10 14:10:25,1,12,books
tfuo3c,I think people have been misinterpreting the ending to Shutter Island [SPOILERS],"So I know literature is subjective and plot points, particularly endings, are often ambiguous. So I certainly don't mean to step on any toes and tell people that their interpretation is ""wrong"". But there is often an ""official"", generally accepted take on stories, what makes the Wikipedia pages etc.

In the case of Shutter Island, I believe the general consensus take is different than Dennis Lehane's intended ending. For those of you who haven't read it, or seen the film adaptation, first of all, stop reading this and go read it. But secondly, the book is about a US Marshall who travels to an insane asylum in search of a missing patient. At the end of the book, it is revealed he himself is a patient and has been for two years since his wife murdered their three children and he murdered her in turn, and that his experiences throughout the book have just been a roleplay staged by the doctors in a last-ditch effort to bring him back to sanity before he is given a lobotomy.

In the penultimate chapter they are successful and the Marshall ""Teddy"" (real name Andrew) accepts who he is and everything that has happened. However in the final chapter, he has seemingly regressed back into his fantasies and is acting like Teddy again, before being approached by staff, the book ending as he is about to be restrained and, seemingly, lobotomised.

Now in most discussions that I've found about this, the general consensus seems to be that Andrew *hasn't* really regressed back to his fictitious persona and is faking insanity in order to receive the lobotomy and forget all the horror that's befallen him. It's even what it says in the [plot summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island).

However, I found [this](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/02/shutter-island-ending-lobotomy-anniversary-1202212647/) article about the movie adaptation of Shutter Island. Now in the movie adaptation, he likely *is* faking insanity for the lobotomy at the end, as director Martin Scorsese includes the movie-only line spoken by Andrew/Teddy “Which would be worse: To live as a monster, or to die as a good man?”, suggesting he is lucid.

However this article contains the following comments from author Dennis Lehane, who disagrees that Andrew is lucid, on the movie change:

> Lehane approved the line during the film’s script process and told MTV in an interview a couple weeks after “Shutter Island” opened in theaters that to him the question is just a “momentary flash” of sanity within Andrew/Teddy’s delusion.

> ‘If he were to say it as a statement [and not a question], then there’s no solution here but to stop the lobotomy,” Lehane said at the time. “Because if he shows any sort of self-awareness, then it’s over, they wouldn’t want to lobotomize him. My feeling was no, he’s not so conscious he says, ‘Oh I’m going to decide to pretend to be Laeddis (OP EDIT: I think he means ""Daniels"" here, as Laeddis is Andrew's actual surname whereas Daniels is the surname of his alter ego) so they’ll finally give me a lobotomy.’ **That would just be far more suicidal than I think this character is.** I think that in one moment, for a half a second sitting there in that island he remembered who he was and then he asks that question and he quickly sort of lets it go. That was my feeling on that line.”

Anyway, just found it interesting that the general interpretation of the book seems not to align with the author's intention and it seems to have gone under the radar somewhat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tfuo3c/i_think_people_have_been_misinterpreting_the/,2022-03-16 22:15:08,29,64,books
ndpet3,Kindle X-Ray spoiled Shutter Island for me,"Edit: for those who are unaware, X-ray on Kindle is a reference tool that you can use as you read a book. Typically it'll allow you to remind yourself about characters and locations by highlighting a name or place, similar to how you use the dictionary feature on the device. 

I use Kindle X-ray multiple times during every book help help with remembering the names of characters or other details. And it's been great for the five or so years I've been using my kindle. A genuine boon to my reading experience. But this time I've been caught out, as it spoiled a key plot point midway through the book that wouldn't come up until very close to the climax of the story. 

Shutter Island is a great fucking book. I'll post specifics under a spoiler tag but please don't click it if you haven't read it!

>!So I wanted to double check the surname of Teddy's partner Chuck, and it kept coming up with the name of the warden of the facility... at first I thought it was a bug of some sort but over a short while it dawned on me that it was actually true, and I inferred some (thankfully not all) of the big reveal from this information!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ndpet3/kindle_xray_spoiled_shutter_island_for_me/,2021-05-16 14:24:13,20,103,books
15es29y,"[Series Review] Kenzie & Gennaro series by Dennis Lehane (author of Shutter Island, Mystic River, etc.)","I figured I should mention Shutter Island and Mystic River because people will recognize the movies, if they don't recognize the author. He's also behind The Drop, and Gone Baby Gone (which is part of this series). Plus several episodes of The Wire. The Kenzie and Gennaro books are his main series.

---

These books are a modern take on private detective novels. Even though there's plenty of dated 90's references (the driver popping in a Pearl Jam cassette!), it still feels pretty fresh. If you say ""detective novels"", people either think of police procedurals (Michael Connelly, for example) or crusty classics like Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Somewhere in between we have stuff like this.

Patrick Kenzie is the son of well-respected fireman who taught him how to be tough, by beating him and his mother blue. There's a lot of references to ""The Hero""... his dad's public image, of a working-class good guy. What Kenzie saw is the crazy guy who stayed up late holding his palm over a flame and saying ""it can be contained"". When Kenzie and sister accidentally start a small fire, even though there was minimal damage (thanks to dad's obsessive fireproofing)... 'the hero' burns him with an iron.

Somehow, Kenzie ends up being a pretty decent guy in spite of this.

His partner, Angie, has a less fleshed-out past. An uncle in the mob is mentioned a few times but we don't meet him. She's described as the sort of smart, gorgeous, confident woman who should have gotten away from The Neighborhood and been destined for something better, but somehow she stays in Patrick's orbit. 

At the start, she's married to an asshole who beats her regularly. You can tell that this arrangement is unsustainable, because she has self-respect and Patrick hates bullies. It creates an interesting tension in the first couple of books. It's probably not spoiling much, to say that she and Patrick become more than business partners. 

I like that the agency is run by a couple. That's sort of unique to this series. Kenzie still feels like the main protagonist, but his other half is not a disposable lay or kidnap-bait. She's got equal billing in every book.

---

Still, there's plenty of familiar tropes. Like Spencer, Patrick has a handful of friends on the police force, and a sidekick who can play the 'heavy'... the guy willing to go to lengths, morally, that the hero won't.

The appeal of Lehane, for me, is he's got style but his books don't feel ""stylized"", like noir. The protagonist is not 'quippy'. Nobody has scary tracking skills from Vietnam, or punches like a pro boxer, or nails pistol shots at 30 yards. Kenzie struggles to pay bills, Genarro drives a beater, Bubba (the sidekick) gets pinched on a gun charge and goes to prison for a year. 

They're realistic, and that includes some uncomfortable realities. Patrick has to work for a big company when money gets tight, do work that makes him feel compromised, and figure out how to rein in his class rage and hatred for the morally bankrupt clients who pay his bills. His friend Bubba is tough, absolutely loyal, and openly racist. Patrick fights with Angie, and they separate for a while. He doesn't beat up his dad and tell him ""if you ever do that again I'll kill you""... Patrick has to endure him until cancer takes him.

When Patrick and Angie get out of close calls, it doesn't feel like they've got plot armor, it feels like they got lucky.

---

Lehane grew up in Dorchester (not Southie, but comparable), and he writes what he knows. The author has this time and place nailed down, and you swim in that vibe throughout. Think The Departed, Good Will Hunting, a bunch of Mark Wahlberg movies. Broke blue collar workers, old Catholic churches, 1st generation immigants with Irish accents, their kids growing up with thick Boston accents. Harvard Square, Beacon Hill, pizza joints and dockworkers.

It helps, in my case, to have listened to audio books with the accent included, though the first time I heard something like ""I followed the cah to the pahkway"" I kinda rolled my eyes. Some narrators are better than others. 

---

I would recap the actual books, but this is already pretty long for a reddit post. The books are all nicely fleshed out. Each is memorable, there's no repetitive ""this year's filler"" feeling. 

The 6-book arc is roughly the story of Patrick and Angie falling in love, breaking up, and getting back together again. In between, we get some pretty entertaining cases with bad guys who are actually disturbing... the friendly guy at the bar who's been torturing and murdering women for decades. The charming blonde sociopath who drives someone to suicide, and loves to play mind games with whoever he's targeting. The femme fatale who disguises her role as the bad guy, because her father might be even worse. 

The most memorable book, for me, is Gone Baby Gone. It features a genuine moral quandry, which is sort of Lehane's specialty. I won't spoil it. It's a major point in their lives, and it gets revisited in the final book of the series, which is unfortunately my least favorite. 

Moonlight Mile was written ten years after the 5th book, with the characters having aged appropriately, and it feels like there's a shift in how Lehane sees the world. He writes the characters as exhausted, sick from their constant contact with the worst people in society, struggling with bills and parenthood, and clearly having lost a step. They get in touch with someone they'd helped in an earlier book (though ""helped"" is debatable) and it's kind of gone to shit. 

The book is depressing, and there's a couple of scenes where it feels like Lehane has embraced a sort of bitter old guy mentality. He depicts a group of kids as unable to say anything other than ""like, ya know"", and in another scene there's a teen waitress portrayed as sullen and stupid, and Patrick rants about how kids today are vapid and new music sucks... it's feels like the boomers vs. millennial culture war you see on Facebook. 

The end of the book is relatively posivitive, with Patrick embracing his role as a father and husband, telling the boss to KMA, and hanging up his gun to go back to school. But the overall vibe felt like a less-than-happy end to an otherwise great series.

lxlmfi,Shutter Island: The Book Vs. The Movie,"One of the mods told me I should add more detail to my post, so I honored her request and did just that. I also deleted the original post to avoid confusion, so here goes!  


Heads up: I'm also being somewhat vague about the characters to avoid spoiling anything for folks who have neither read the book nor seen the movie. I will say each one is gripping and Dennis Lehane manages to make each one relatable, even though their situation is unique! Be warned: you may walk away feeling uncertain how to perceive the book. You'll probably want to read more of Dennis Lehane's work, too, as I did!

  
That said, I read the book recently due to my interest in psychology, psychological thrillers, WWII history, and Max Richter's music being featured in the movie......wow. Dennis Lehane left me not knowing what to think and I am still pondering the book!!   


What did y'all think for those who have read it? For those who have not, do you plan to read it and why or why not? How does the movie compare, as I have not seen it? If you haven't seen the movie like I have not, do you plan to do that? If you have, what did you love and hate about it? How accurate was it to the book, really?

I think particularly of the surprising character of Teddy and how one could root for him and hate him simultaneously towards the book's end. Chuck's ability to keep his true identity a secret from Teddy until midway through the book when telling the truth became necessary surprised me. At that point, I wasn't sure who to support! That is to say that I liked Teddy, but I could also understand Chuck's concern for him!  


 Dolores also intrigued me and I would have loved to see her character more developed. Rachel's story broke my heart especially, since she trusted her parents to care for her in all things. I can only imagine what she was thinking when her mother committed an unthinkable act against the family as a whole, especially Rachel and her siblings.  What do y'all think?   


A few other questions that come to mind include:

Who were your favorite and least favorite characters and why is that?

By whom were you intrigued most and were there any characters you wished Dennis Lehane would have developed more? Were there any characters you thought were irrelevant to the story and best left out or left as naught more than worth a mention?

What do you think the movie should have kept in or left out that was in the book and why?

Feel free to discuss the topic and let me know if I am missing something!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lxlmfi/shutter_island_the_book_vs_the_movie/,2021-03-04 14:23:52,17,27,books
mkqpo0,Question about the ending of Shutter Island,"So, in the ending it is revealed that Teddy was in fact Andrew all along and everything was an elaborate plot for him to snap out of his hallucinations. So by the final pages, he seems to, indeed, realize who he really is and accepts what his wife has done and why he killed her, and etc. But then, in the very end, he wakes up and goes to talk to Chuck (who we now know is actually doctor Sheehan), and while they're talking, Andrew refers to him again as being Chuck, and then doctor Cawley walks towards them with a few workers holding some sort of bundle, and Andrew describes it as having some sort of metalic things inside. 

So, what is going on, here? Is Andrew insane again and still thinking that he is Teddy, or was he just joking around? And what was that bundle? Was he going to be lobotomized, after all? I'm a bit confused :s

83uji7,Shutter Island Spoilers,"So I finished Shutter Island last night and enjoyed it immensely. This is my first Lehane book and I found myself reading the book at a rapid pace, trying to figure out the mystery before the closing chapters. Not only was there twists abound, I cared for the characters and the dialog had a rat-a-tat style that was enjoyable.

I did want to talk about the ending; I haven't seen the movie but looked up the ending for that and found it to be interpreted differently from the book. For my money, Andrew/Teddy relapsed at the end after admitting he killed his wife because his body was mentally and physically COULD NOT accept his reality. I feel this is pretty clear cut, no matter how bad Teddy wanted it all to end. My reasoning is that many times throughout the book he explains that it's too weak to commit suicide and many times he describes the 'strength' and grit he and his generation group up with. Thoughts?

This isn’t a very important issue to ponder but I can’t help it. 

~~I’m at the part where teddy and chuck are in the mausoleum talking about George Noyce.~~ Now, the way I understand it, the timeline of a Noyce went as so: was a college student who got a little stressed > punched a window > talked to psych department, where he was told about a experiment he could get some money for participating in > a year later, he’s super fucked up from it > he attacks a guy who he thought was the guy that recommended this trial > he gets sent to ashecliffe > he gets transferred to ward c > he gets experimented on with drugs and surgery 

But then chuck asks “but if the point of that [surgery] is to calm someone down, how’d he manage to go fuck some guy up in Park Square?”
