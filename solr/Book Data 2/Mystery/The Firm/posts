wv45bg,"The Firm, Grisham","I'd love to hear what other people thought of this book. I'm sure nothing I'm saying here hasn't been said before, and I know this author has a mass audience.

In my opinion this story was like a yuppie WASP's wet-dream of the 1980s. It read exactly like it was written by someone who wanted to sell novel-adaptations to Hollywood, which was apparently successful. Its way of being ""immersive"" was constant references to popular brands-- I wanted to take a drink every time it mentioned a Mercedes. It had every opportunity to be an intelligent, thrilling satire on American institutions of power and the pathetic rat-race that people put themselves through to join the elite parasites. Instead it was just another boring anti-thriller that was so embedded in the dominant established ideology of its time that it's comical to read now. Rich guys doing bad things getting taken on by a slightly less rich, slightly less bad guy. In some ways it was like American Psycho without the satire. Even the protagonists seemed sociopathic at best.

The Firm was probably the worst novel I've ever read, but I have to say it was interesting to read something so potently and uncritically steeped in the American dream. Most of the profound American novels I've read have some critique of society woven in, which is partly what makes them so compelling and keeps them relevant. There are general themes of corruption and scandal to set the story, but it's so generic and stereotypical and it doesn't get to the heart of anything. Was there something deeper here that I missed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wv45bg/the_firm_grisham/,2022-08-22 20:24:20,26,6,books
12g6zzb,I just read “The Firm” by John Grisham and I need to vent,"So I finished John Grisham’s The Firm. I’m a fan of Lee Child and Harlan Coben so I figured I’d give one of their contemporaries a shot. 

Positives first: the plotting was well done. Pretty sluggish at the start, with a bit too much super-ominous villain mustache twirling, but the third act was really well-done from a plot perspective.

Now the negatives: this book has aged TERRIBLY. I’m not one for the whole, “This book published in the past doesn’t fit my modern sensibilities exactly!” routine; I find that a bit reductive. Still, though, this book was exhausting to read.

First, the sexism. There are two types of women in this book- ultrafuckable (Mitch’s wife, Tammy, the beach woman) or unfuckable (the secretaries). Somewhat tied in- unlike, apparently, the film version, Mitch never tells his wife that he’s had an affair. He’s also apparently had another affair in the past that he never disclosed to her. The book ends with a moment where he looks like he might confess to her, but then just doesn’t. His wife goes on in ignorance of the fact that her husband cheated on her.

Then the racism. This book made me wonder if John Grisham has some problem with black people. Within two pages, John Grisham describes a woman as a “well-mixed mulatto,” says a black man is dressed like a “typical island Negro,” then describes how the women of the Cayman Islands, despite being black, struggle to cook fried chicken. Every inhabitant of the Cayman Islands uses the word “mon” incessantly. There’s a waiter described simply as an angry black man. And then there’s the two servants the firm has, who are, of course, an overbearing black woman (who cooks greasy Southern food) and her servile husband. The husband’s cousin, a pianist, is called “Little Bobby Blue Baker” and plays piano for the rich white lawyers.

This book is a little over thirty years old but God damn has it aged terribly. While the plotting was good, and I can appreciate a good thriller, the racism and sexism (as well as the douchey main character) made it a chore. It’s unlikely I’ll pick up another John Grisham book any time soon. 

What do you think? Have you read any John Grisham? Is he typically better/worse than this? Is there another book you’d say better displays his writing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12g6zzb/i_just_read_the_firm_by_john_grisham_and_i_need/,2023-04-09 03:07:18,16,16,books

mj9pew,The Dresden Files is unreadable because of how women are described,"I got through 3 of the Dresden Files books before I had to put them down. The author just cannot keep from commenting on how sexy every single female character is and how chivalrous and misogynistic Harry is. 
An example from the book:
 ""She pushed back her asphalt-colored hair with one hand and gave me a look of pure calculation. Then she simply crossed her legs, so that the cut of her dress left one pale leg bare to midthigh. A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric. “Of course, Mr. Dresden. I’m sure we can do business.” The look she gave me was direct, sensual, and willing."" 

Every single woman is portrayed exactly like this and I think it represents the worst in Urban Fantasy.

167hl63,"Robert Kiyosaki's ""The Business of the 21st Century"": How on God's green earth is ""network marketing"" NOT firmly under the ""E quadrant"" and the ""S quadrant"", much less anywhere NEAR the ""B"" quadrant? (Spoilers)","In fact, one could argue it barely even reaches S quadrant-level...

Just like in the E quadrant, you can be ""terminated"" (as in, ""fired""), something that doesn't apply to either of the B or I quadrants.

Hell, it doesn't even apply to the S quadrant people.

This is because, just like in the E quadrant, you're still ""working for"" someone.

Even without termination, if the company goes belly up, you still end up losing your job, just like someone in the E quadrant. But even if the company an E quadrant person works for goes bankrupt, at least they don't lose money like a network marketer working for a bankrupt MLM company would.

Like an S quadrant person, a network marketer can work their own hours. But just like the E quadrant, a network marketer still has to follow the company's guidelines, unlike an S quadrant person who doesn't because their the ones in charge of their own company that they have full control over. 

Unlike the S and B quadrants, you have no control over the product itself, and sometimes you have no flexibility over how you even market the product, especially when product differentiation or differentiation in service is important. You just barely control or often don't have control over the pricing either. Oftentimes, you can't sell competing products either. In fact, you don't really control anything, outside of maybe your work hours.

In fact, as opposed to someone in the S and B quadrants, do you even actually ""own"" a company? 

Do you actually ""own"" anything?

Outside of the product itself, where are the ""assets"" you're supposed to own?

And wouldn't that product turn into a ""liability"" of it's just sitting in your stock and you're unable to sell it, thereby not generating income?

Also, unlike someone in the S, B and I  quadrants, but like someone firmly in E quadrants, you don't even control your full income, because both your uplines and the MLM company itself are getting a sizable cut of your profits.

And aren't you still basically working for commission, like many S quadrant people are, except a network marketer has no control over the commission they can charge?

Unlike the the S and B quadrants, where are the ""employees"" in your ""business""? Are they the downlines? But I thought they were supposed to be ""business owners"" as well, and not working for someone else.

The struggles the book lists for people in the S quadrant, how do they still not also apply to network marketing?

How are you simply not anything more than just a sales rep, the wide majority of whom are in the E quadrant, or anything more than an independent contractor at best, like some S quadrant people but not the majority? And which doesn't match up with B quadrant at all?

How is the book not one giant self-contradiction?

s81qex,"My dad wants to strip the entire fiction genre from school libraries because fiction is ""nonsense""","My dad doesn't believe that fiction has any value (period.). It's not just that he prefers non-fiction-- he gets mad at Greek mythology because it is ""full of nonsense creatures not based on biology."" He dislikes the Orient Express because none of the events actually happened.

And it's not just novels: he hates anything written which is not firmly grounded in reality (Just for example: refused to finish reading the satire ""A Modest Proposal"" because it's ""nonsense"" and ""could never work in real life""). Like, I'm sure the guy would hate the Declaration of Independence if he wasn't such a die-hard patriot.

He also doesn't recognize writing as a valid art form. He doesn't think it takes any particular skill, that authors only have to ""talk out of their ass,"" make the prose flowery and unnecessarily complicated (I tried to explain what imagery was to him once, and he cited the entire technique as emblematic of poor, cheap writing). Specifically, he compared it to scientific writing, which is entirely precise and unadorned. This bit ticks me off in particular since writing is a passion of mine.

The only book he's ever liked was Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"" he read when he was 8.

And now he thinks schools should pull everything but nonfiction off of the shelves. He's worried that fiction makes kids more prone to misinformation and more likely to become flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers, etc.

How would you explain that that's not the case? That almost NONE of this is the case???

edit: he likes music and art too. It's not a vendetta against entertainment-- just THIS specific form of entertainment.

edit: he's also not religious at all, i dont know where people are getting that from. like, he actually has some kind of grudge against every god and main religious text of every culture

2gkpid,The Intern's Handbook and its prestigious law firm...,"I need help!

I recently discovered a novel called The Intern's Handbook (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DPM7VR0/ref=amb_link_424825842_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0J894W3SKD8VMSDJ0CF4&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_p=1920909282&pf_rd_i=1000677541). I have not yet read it, but in a synopsis about the book, the firm that the main character apparently infiltrates is called ""Bendini, Lambert, and Locke"". 

I am also currently reading The Firm, by John Grisham, in which the evil firm's name is, you guessed it, Bendini, Lambert, and Locke.

nsza9t,"Where are you on the scale of the writer's responsibility to the reader's experience? As an writer, it's my firm belief the writer should do everything they can to make the videotape clear, whereas my friends who are writers say the exact opposite.","If you're a teacher and/or writer like myself, you've probably grappled with this. What I didn't realize is perhaps I am in the minority rather than the majority.

I find obfuscation or 'literary asides' often the hallmark of bad writing. I find moments of text that seek to 'make the reader work' should be typically avoided. These are generalisations, of course. House of Leaves is a masterpiece despite being so far up its own arse it can't breathe, and some hyper-clarity King-esque action romp can be terminally dull. But overall, it's on the writer in my opinion. 

But where are you on the scale? I have found over my years that I am aligned with some of my students in my class when they say 'I don't get it'. Often I do 'get it', and can 'explain it', by virtue of practice and formal education - but my instinct is that is broadly wrong and generally 'poor art', and I waste no time gutting classics publically for it.

You shouldn't need an good education to read a book - right? Should the reader be required to mentally dig to evocate themes and plot? Or is it the writer's responsibility to make it all as easy as possible. In my opinion, it is. The videotape clarity should be king.

Note the exceptions to this in my own thinking is vocabulary, which I don't have a problem with being virtuoso as long as isn't pretentious (very easy to spot in student writers!) and historicity. But I mean, look at Don Quixote or Jane Eyre, which are super easy to read. 

I am referring more to some writer's tendency to weave so much they obscure the lens. Gibson is a great example. Phenomenal writer, Neuromancer an all time classic, but goddamit I could throttle him for some of it.

But maybe I've just been buried in intellect too long and just want to roar along the hyper lens of a damn good story - something a bit short in supply these days?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nsza9t/where_are_you_on_the_scale_of_the_writers/,2021-06-05 16:17:50,29,1,books

gvt82y,"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points.","I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism’s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

1bzhwg4,The Exchange - John Grisham,"I really did not like this book. Loved the movie of The Firm and thought I’d give this a shot as I was in a reading slump and had never read John Grisham. I assumed it would be similar to other popular writers like Michael Crichton. Plot driven, expertise turned acceptable prose. Now, I love a great sentence and savor great writing. But I can also enjoy Dan Brown while also preferring Didion. The Exchange was just so terribly written and tough to hear my inner voice saying these sentences that I think I found my limit in what constitutes non-enjoyable reading. So. Many. Tropes. Gender stereotypes, and generally treating the audience as dumb. If you used the word souk in a paragraph set in Morocco, using an expository sentence to explain what a souk is explicitly just… something.

u1cbt1,The haunting of hill house is sublimely magnificent,"I must start by saying that I had different expectations about the work; I was expecting a common story of ghosts haunting the house and haunting its guests. Something similar to Hell house but without the sexual and visceral horror (I knew that beforehand). I also thought I knew what direction the story would take because I had seen the Netflix series a long time ago. 

But it was totally different and it completely grabbed me. Shirley Jackson's prose is charming. The fact that Hill House becomes just another character in the play and that Eleanor is such an unreliable narrator is something that I just loved, because Shirley leaves the events to your guess, you decide what to believe about it, was the house really haunted or was it all Eleanor's mind?

Little by little and in a subtle way we see how Eleanor distances herself from the other characters and her crazy narration makes us do it too so much that it even seems that we know much less about them than at the beginning of the story.

It is not a common horror and I liked that. Something that I also loved was that the house had no origin (origins are good but from time to time it is okay not to receive a context behind something, let the imagination run wild), it was simply born bad, rotten; built with those tricky angles that end up telling you that absolutely nothing is right there.

Something that I could never resolve about the work was the meanings of the colors. They were always there present. Eleanor has the blue room but the red was always attached to her. Theodora had the green room and then she moves to the blue room and starts wearing Nell's red sweater. Luke with the pink room and the doctor with the yellow one. I have been looking for the symbolism of the colors in the work but there seems to be nothing, perhaps Jackson also wanted to leave it to our imagination.

To complete I want to say (it deserves to mention) the amazing presentation that Jackson wrote for Hill house: 

«No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against the hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone»

14lav52,Why you should read Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"Everyone and their mother has read *Jane Eyre* and *Wuthering Heights*, but if you haven't read *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall*, you are truly missing out.

*The Tenant of Wildfell Hall* is a novel written by Anne Brontë, the youngest and least-celebrated Brontë sister. It's about a young woman stuck in an abusive marriage trying to maintain her own autonomy in the face of patriarchal Victorian society. It's realistic, powerful, and thought-provoking.

What makes this novel so good is how ahead of its time it is. Anne Brontë was a firm believer that literature should reflect life as honestly as possible, and she didn't hesitate to write about ""taboo"" topics such as domestic abuse, alcoholism, and sexism. *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall* discusses these themes openly and honestly, and doesn't sugarcoat anything. The novel also features a headstrong female protagonist who matures through her struggles and eventually succeeds in freeing herself from her situation. When it was initially published, *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall* shocked and disturbed critics for how radical it was. But when you read it today, it's a compelling story of empowerment and the realities of domestic abuse. The fact that a young woman wrote this book almost 200 years ago, and it reads like it was written yesterday, is brilliant.

Also, I think it's the most readable of the Brontë novels. While I love Charlotte's and Emily's novels, they can be difficult to read for people who aren't familiar with classic literature. *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall*, despite being a work written in the 19th century, is super accessible and easy to read. Readers who struggle to connect to the elaborate prose and Gothic romanticism of Charlotte's and Emily's novels will appreciate the straightforward prose and honest realism of *Wildfell Hall*.

I know a lot of people who love the Brontë sisters, but not many have read Anne Brontë's works. If you've read *The Tenant of Wildfell Hall*, please share your thoughts..

alqb9f,"Hi Reddit! I'm S.A. Chakraborty, fantasy author and history nerd. My books are The City of Brass and as of last week--The Kingdom of Copper. Ask me anything!","Hi! My name is S.A. Chakraborty and I'm a speculative fiction writer from New York. I'm the author of THE CITY OF BRASS and THE KINGDOM OF COPPER, books one and two respectively of The Daevabad Trilogy, an epic fantasy about a con-woman from 18th century Cairo, a deeply idealistic djinn prince and utter political chaos. 

Most of my work is inspired by the medieval Islamicate world. I originally wanted to be a history professor and the books themselves started as this weird little world-building project I began while waiting to go back to grad school. I know the Reddit Book Club has been reading THE CITY OF BRASS, so I'm happy to talk about that, the sequel, writing/world-building, the history of fantastical tales, scheming Abbasid royals, medieval culinary competitions (I've got some excellent recipes), or according to Twitter interest: Shah Jahan's massive wine cup. Since THE KINGDOM OF COPPER has only been out a week, I'm going to try and keep things spoiler-free. Online you can find me at [sachakraborty.com](https://www.sachakraborty.com/) or more frequently on Twitter at @SAChakrabooks. 

Ask me anything!

It has such a simple premise. An alien species visit our planet not to conquer it, but just as a pitstop before disappearing again, leaving ""litter"" for humans to discover.

Redrick ""Red"" Schuhart is one of those humans - a Stalker - who specialises in illegally exploring these littered ""Zones"", and sells his discoveries to scientists, corporations and the criminal underworld.

Even though he's trying to clean up his act, he can't get away from the consequences of his early career choice, and the Zone keeps a firm grip on his life.

Did you find it pretentious or horrifying? Transporting or deranged? It seems to be all of these things. I need some companionship in this post secret existence I find myself in. 

And I have questions. 

Not the least of which is, how long is the typical recuperation?

1) What exactly was going on with Henry's car at the end?  I can't decide if Henry really is an irredeemable emotionless bastard and it was a plot to throw Richard under the bus. But what else could it be?

2) Were any of them really Richard's friends, as elitist as they all were? I can't imagine Richard's attempts to appear privileged were as successful as the character thinks. There was never a dramatic reveal of Richard's lowly origins.

3) Do you think the casual attitude on drugs was a deliberate potshot (pun intended) at the stuffy egos of New England liberal arts colleges like Hampden? Any author who could write these characters is familiar with insecurity. Maybe it's a 'I'm a cool kid' front, and the author's ego showing. I read she went to Bennington. 

4) How did a book with the murder at the beginning stay so suspenseful? Did anyone else expect it to all turn out okay? I think I was so firmly on the hook because I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15v4wbq/jaysus_what_have_you_done_to_me_donna_just/,2023-08-19 03:21:24,41,42,books
a263ff,An Open Letter to Libraries and The People That Run Them,"As a kid I loved going to the library, getting a bunch of books and reading them, and returning for more. I loved them to the point that one of my “saddest” moments as a child was my mom breaking a promise to take me to the library. We went the next day, but as a kid who had nothing to judge it against, it was rough. Eventually I began growing up and like many people my library usage dwindled. I still had positive feelings towards them, but it wasn’t convenient for me or I was distracted by other things. I just stopped having a need for it. Since I stopped going to the library, my reading dwindled. While my family got the Harry Potter books as they came out, I didn’t do much reading beyond that and required reading for school. 

Fast forward to 16 years old and me moving from California to Canada, and I was nearly cut off from reading completely, that is until I learned my school had a library, and I began reading at a pace I had never done before. I read 31 books in 3 months, a couple I had read before but most were new. My school had AR reading Points, and while we were required to get 25 points, I got 469. However girlfriends, videogames, and reddit took me away from reading. I read very little after that for a few years. Until I learned of Overdrive (now Libby), which allowed me to download books from my local Library straight to my phone. Again my reading use climbed. I think at this point I should mention that while I grew up middle class, by this point I was firmly poor, as I continue to be today. 

At the end of High school I had a crazy idea. I decided to walk across the US. 4,500 miles of walking over the course of roughly a year. I spent anywhere from 8-16 hours a day walking and would often go a few days without talking to people. My journey was about more than travel it was about self-improvement and experiencing things I’d never gotten to before. To that end I would download audiobooks and I listened to many of the classics I had never read before. It made many days pass by quicker and helped me retain my sanity. I would have never been able to afford those audiobooks myself. When I finished my trip, I had crossed 18 states, worn out 8 pairs of shoes, and listened to/read over 40 books from The Count of Monte Cristo to His Dark Materials, to the Art of War. 

When I returned home I began to follow my local library and would occasionally see new programs it would have in the news. A couple years ago they got 3D printers and so, redditor that I am, printed off a Snoo to bring to meetups. While I was there, there was about an 8 year old girl who was 3D printing some little plastic keychain tags for her friends. I was amazed that she even knew how to do that. Then earlier this year they started loaning out GoPro Kits and so on Labour Day, a friend and I hitchhiked up north a bit to go camping and made a video of the trip. As someone who is low income, the Library has helped me to do things I would never have been able to do, and in some cases, never would have thought to do. My library has also put a recording studio in one of the branches and has many other programs such as a podcast listening club (book club but for podcasts), they allow you to digitize old photos, move VHS and CD’s to digital files, give help on research, allow you to read magazines and newspapers from around the world (literally as the stuff is published), borrow museum/regional park passes, and so much more. While I had thought that being able to download ebooks/audiobooks to my phone would mean I’d never have to go to the library again, all of the other offerings my library has makes me keep going back. My life has had many periods of off-and-on again library usage, and it may continue, but I know that when I need it, it will be there for me. 

I would like to say thank you to all the librarians (and library technicians!) that have helped me. Some have helped me find books, some have kept the library organized, some have gotten added books I recommended to the collection, and some have ensured the Library continues to grow, evolve, and keep bringing me back. I can say with certainty that my life would be genuinely worse without the Library. Keep up the good work and I’ll see you tomorrow when I have to return The Marrow Thieves.

10fpq3w,Fifty Shades Darker by E.L James is the worst book Ive ever read and that's saying something because..,"I used to believe there was \*no such thing\* as a bad book, i had a firm appreciation for \*\*ALL\*\*  authors and publishers because to print your ideas for others to critique and read garnered a lot of respect from me. 

that was until i read this book (let me preface this by saying I never read the first book in the series and am only reading this book because someone gave it to me for free). the entire book had no flow and no believable plot. I could not suspend my common sense long enough to believe the plot that a rich millionaire dates a young virigin (which is already a story line beat to death in literature) , they get married and move in together in less than 5 weeks. then random plot lines were thrown in and resolved in less than 20 pages, leaving no reason to care about the thin plot in the first place. 

the sex scenes were very dull and lackluster, I've read better smut written by teenagers on tumblr then the stuff this woman put in the book. i had some hopes for the book because it was so talked about and controversial when the movie adaptions were made, yet it was 531 pages of disappointing non-sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10fpq3w/fifty_shades_darker_by_el_james_is_the_worst_book/,2023-01-19 02:17:51,48,29,books
136tvr2,Disappointed by The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker,"I’ve heard nothing but good things about this book so I was excited to read it, but I’m pretty disappointed :( I’m sure it was really revolutionary in the 90s, but at best it has aged incredibly poorly. 

First of all, what are De Becker’s qualifications/ education? Everything I read online skips from the abuse he suffered as a child to starting his consulting firm. Personal experience is important, but he has no background in psychology/criminal justice/ social work? I am truly curious what his authority is. 

 I don’t doubt De Becker is a highly intelligent person either. It’s clear he’s great at explaining social concepts in understandable terms, and relating them using storytelling, but I wish he included some more relevant data/evidence as well. There is lots of data regarding the prevalence of violence against women in the book, but not much relating that to his theories. At that, much of the data is unsourced. It’s true that 1 in 4 women experience intimate partner violence, but citing something would give him a lot more credibility.

He even parrots the Margaret Atwood quote “men are afraid that women will laugh at them, women are afraid that men will kill them” as basically just something he heard once. Doesn’t mention her by name, or that it was from another author. 

I also caught on to quite a victim blame-y attitude early on , but figured that the was kind of the nature of the book. I had to stop reading for my own sanity during the chapter on DV however. “The first time a woman is hit, she is a victim and the second time, she is a volunteer.” Are you fucking kidding me? 

I also wanted to provide and look for other women’s perspectives on this, since most of the negative reviews i’ve read have been from men. 

Im about 3/4 through the book, is it even worth finishing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/136tvr2/disappointed_by_the_gift_of_fear_by_gavin_de/,2023-05-03 17:32:30,50,103,books

Unfortunate that was my introduction to the book and, upon reading it, how much misconception I was given about. Especially when it came to The Godfather himself, Don Corleone.

This character has the respect of an old scarred lion and the subtle brutality of a calculating cobra. But he is one of the most compassionate character I’ve ever read and how he responds to each person who comes to him is with a firm understanding that, while he understands your strifes. what you ask for will be paid in retribution to him.

With how it is written you see the pieces of his character split between his three sons, four if you count the ever dependable Tom Hagen as his in-house lawyer. I plan on seeing the movie soon and I just picked up the second book written in this line.

uvfnsm,thoughts on The Midnight Library ?,"I've only started reading it. Stopping now to write because I'm absolutely sunburned and the train ride home is too loud to continue reading.

In the last 9 years I've lived in 7 different cities. I finished writing my PhD recently but I spent a year trying to decide in my next steps in life. I was offered an amazing  post doctoral position, I rejected it last minute - it was in the middle of nowhere. I was offered a great industry job in a city where I have friends, doing exciting work, I rejected it the day before I was going to sign my contract because the wage was horrible. I was offered a position in London, working for a great, prestigious firm, also where I have friends. I turned it down last minute also because I realized my pay would only be enough to cover my apartment and live pay cheque to pay cheque. My partner moved to the States, I didn't want tocgo because it's too far away for me. So here I am now. Single, still in love with my ex, and in 2 weeks I'm moving to a tiny village , also in a new country. Where I know nobody, but it's a great job opportunity. 

Suffice to say, I've been suffering from loads of anxiety, particularly dealing with ' oh, I should have taken offer A, id be surrounded by friends . Which turns to, if I took offer B, I'd be working on so many cool projects...I should have gone to the states to be with her... why am I moving around so much, I should have just settled 9 years ago .'. It put me into quite a depressive state to be honest.

1774szb,Abusive behavior depicted in the Dollanganger series,"I’m almost done with Petals on the Wind and I noticed that multiple other people who enter Cathy’s life are also awful. While Paul genuinely cared for the kids, he was still pretty awful as he raped his wife, and statutorily raped Cathy. Yes, Cathy did try to seduce Paul, but he didn’t remain firm on rejecting her advances. 

Julian was obviously controlling and abusive towards Cathy as he basically coerced her into marrying him and gaslighted her into feeling she put him in an awful position by not loving him enough when he died. He also sexually assaulted Cathy multiple times throughout the relationship.

Bart Winslow also sexually assaults Cathy in Petals on the Wind, and this part was disturbing for me as this was not the first time Cathy has been sexually assaulted and it almost seems like a common occurrence that the men she trusts (minus Julian as she never had much love for him) have all taken advantage of her, including her own brother.

Julian also groomed Carrie and it was noted that he would prey on underage girls. The topics of grooming and sexual assault seem to be normalized in the series as Cathy seems to be able to look past these things while she cannot look past the abuse of her mother, so much so that she blames every bad thing that’s happened to her - even at the hands of someone else - on her mother. 

Is Cathy more forgiving of grooming and sexual assault because to her this doesn’t compare to the abuse of her mother, or is she desensitized as a result of the three years of abuse and neglect she dealt with?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1774szb/abusive_behavior_depicted_in_the_dollanganger/,2023-10-13 18:06:01,12,13,books
r5lses,The Power of The Dog - Thomas Savage (1967),"What an incredible read. 

Phil Burbank is one of the most subtlety vicious yet electrifying characters I have ever come across. This book feels like a psychological thriller masquerading as a Western Drama.  

I personally felt that the plot was more of a vehicle for Savage to study masculinity and masochism, rather than delivering a firm conclusion. This isn’t to say that the story feels incomplete, because I personally found the ending satisfying. 

Most important of all, Savage’s ability to interweave subtext upon subtext within his illustrative writing is a testament to this book’s timelessness.

I cannot wait to watch Jane Campion’s adaption, who couldn’t have chosen a better actor than Benedict Cumberbatch to play Phil.

> “Am I a person?” Borne asks Rachel, in extremis.
“Yes, you are a person,” Rachel tells him. “But like a person, you can be a weapon, too.”

> A ruined city of the future lives in fear of a despotic, gigantic flying bear, driven mad by the tortures inflicted on him by the Company, a mysterious biotech firm. A scavenger, Rachel, finds a creature entangled in his fur. She names it Borne.

> At first, Borne looks like nothing at all― a green lump that might be a discard from the Company. But he reminds Rachel of her homeland, an island nation long lost to rising seas, and she prevents her lover, Wick, from rendering down Borne as raw genetic material for the special kind of drugs he sells.

> But nothing is quite the way it seems: not the past, not the present, not the future. If Wick is hiding secrets, so is Rachel―and Borne most of all. What Rachel finds hidden deep within the Company will change everything and everyone. There, lost and forgotten things have lingered and grown. What they have grown into is mighty indeed.

14b9mmq,Dracula. The king of all vampire stories. Bram Stoker is really good at painting a secne.,"I've been hesitating to post this cause Dracula is one of the most reoccuring books on this sub, and it's porbably irratating. But I just wanted to share some hype with people who might appriciate it and feel the same way I do. I've been on a book marathon for a month or two now. A while ago I read Carmilla & The Vampyre in preparation to get a grasp on some early vampire fiction before starting Dracula. I'm now 9 chapters, about 100 pages into Dracula and I'm on cloud nine. Although the PDF scan I'm reading is the ancient Country Life Press. The text is so compressed and condense on the page. It feels like I've read way more than 100 pages.

Anyway, what an amazing book. I adore how Stoker can describe things so vividly. It might be a screenplay for how exact and life like everything is. I have a habit of looking up things when i'm reading. Locations, tools, clothing etc. When I got to the Whitby chapters I decided to look up some 360 videos of Whitby Abbey, the town and the church steps. It's exactly the way the book described it a 125 years ago. It was a surreal experience.

I have had a lot of excited moments so far into the story.

The Calache ride to castle Dracula. Meeting the devil himself and speaking to him sitted beside the fireplace. 

I got shivers running up my arms when he was passionately speaking about transylvanians history, his lineage and the Dracula pride. Fucking poetic. I love how there are implications that he was Vlad The Impaler himself. Even the descriptions of his appearances match up with that famous portrait painting of Vlad. Domed and high forehead, high and boney cheeks and pronounced browline, aquiline nose and weird nostrils and of course long and thick mustache and broad, firm jawline. The man himself.

I have to admit the Whtiby chapters have been my favourite bits so far. Reading the described typhoon that preluded his arrival in the Demeter was a mesmarizing experience. The Demeter itself, a short horror story on it's own. The imagery of man tied to wheel. Wicked.

And oh my god the terrifying scene of Lucy getting bled on the seat in the church yard.


There's a reason Dracula reigns high and mighty above all other famous vampires. Other vampire stories are like ghost hauntings or succubi. Creepy demons that haunt you in the night and drive you mad slowly.

Dracula is a centripetal force of darkness and evil. He is beyond powerful and so evil he effects the world around him. He commands the weather, the beast and the souls of man. He drinks the blood of children. He drinks blood excessively. He's extremely charismatic and polite. He is above you. He makes you feel small before him. He was a menace in both life and undeath. 

I'm baffled that such a magnificent character could be so...misinterpreted in pop culture.

I like the Bela lugosi version, but it's so...underwhelming compared to the grim and ghastly nature of the book.

The 92 Gary Oldman Dracula is a close adaptation. But they sexualized the story a bit a much and too much focus on romance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14b9mmq/dracula_the_king_of_all_vampire_stories_bram/,2023-06-16 22:20:27,41,180,books

Reading is draining for me because I have this mentality where I have to make sure I remember every single information in the book.

Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more.

1aj0yjr,Excerpts from The Red Pony,"The Red Pony is a novella written by John Steinbeck in 1933. Being a slice of life book, there really isn’t a whole lot to say about the story. It’s just a series of little stories revolving around a boy living on a Ranch in California, followed by a short story called “Junius Maltby,"" about an accountant who left San Francisco to live on a farm.

Throughout the book, there is a scattering of brilliant little passages where Steinbeck employed evocative metaphors to illustrate everyday things. As I read, I felt compelled to sticky note my book so that I could go back and reflect on some of these passages for inspiration, something I rarely feel like doing as I read.

Here are some of my favorites. (All of the page numbers reference my Bantam Pathfinder Edition of the book. )

Chapter 2, “The Great Mountains”, page 37.

“Then he lay on his back in the grass and looked up at the dumpling summer clouds. By closing one eye and destroying perspective he brought them down within reach so that he could put up his fingers and stroke them. He helped the gentle wind push them down the sky; it seemed to him that they went faster for his help.

r3r4fi,The drawback of reading a book,"People have only glorified reading a book.

But most people agree that everything has benefits and drawbacks.

Does reading a book give only benefits?

Why have we shed a light on only the advantages?

What is the disadvantage of reading a book?

I have a firm opinion about it, but I am not going to elaborate on it for now.

I want to see how people think about it first.

After that, I will leave comments down below.

What do you think about it?

&#x200B;

Edit: From my perspective, reading a book costs an enormous amount of time incongruous with fast-paced modern society. It helps develop insight, though it is not a good method to research within a limited time.

In addition, it makes me too discreet in socialization. I feel like it sometimes contradicts my social skills because it takes a few extra seconds to respond. When I read a book, I usually try to figure out the underlying intention of the author. Consequently, it makes me react a little bit slower than other people. Particularly, I found myself struggling with a group conversation and being unable to catch up on the conversation.

Some of you might have experienced reading absurd books.

I usually check reviews on Goodreads before reading it, but still, I occasionally can not resonate with the popular book. I doubt whether it is truly considered a best seller.

I don't like playing devil's advocate, yet, it makes me feel bad when I realize that I am an iconoclast. Sometimes I have questioned myself  'Am I antisocial?'

Idk how other people think about it, though I hope we can share views on this topic.

17k4bcg,A criticism of the White tiger by Aravind Adiga.,"This criticism purely deals with the author and the way he depicts the caste situation in India.The protagonist Balram Halwai is described to be of a confectionary caste which makes sweets, This caste is given affirmative action in India""s caste based reservation system but is not a a ""Lower caste"" it is in fact a socially well positioned caste that is economically poor. Since Indians sacrifice sweets to temples the Halwai caste is considered a pure Job for which very few people are discriminated against.

Second clue that the author is clueless about caste in North India is by the fact Halwais never use Halwai as their surname, Most of them use Sah,Shaw, or Sae (all are variations of the word merchant in sanskrit), This surname is common to almost all artisan/merchant castes of Bihar.

Third is the fact that people would care enough about caste to discrminate against a halwai in Delhi and would ask if halwai is lower or upper caste. (Most people in Delhi would know halwai as a proffesion and not as a caste as normal merchant castes do the work halwais do in eastern parts of India.

The protagonist is from Gaya bihar which is a part of terai and since Indian govt does not calculate economic indicators by caste I will use a proxy of terai region in nepal which is culturally extremely similar to the region the protagonist hails from, The literacy rates of Halwais may not be on par with upper castes but it is on par with castes that are not discriminated against at all in urban settings. For example goldsmiths have a lower literacy rate than Halwais. And the literacy rate for halwais is on par with Chetrees (warrior caste of nepal).(67% vs 71%).

[https://nepal.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Population%20Monograph%20V02.pdf](https://nepal.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Population%20Monograph%20V02.pdf)

All of these things combined show that the author does not have a firm grasp of caste system in bihar and how People discrimiated against lower castes, In the book the employer literally asks balram halwai if Halwai is a lower or upper caste. Most caste discrimination arises in India due to in caste nepotism or discrimination against lower castes because their proffession is seen as impure. Their is almost no High caste solidarity or Low caste solidarity.

I would also like to add that I am from the caste of halwais that the protagonist belongs from and this is not some upper caste person turning his head away from realities in India

Most people from lower caste even when directly asked say they face little discrimination.  


According to pew research only 13% of OBC's (category of castes balrama belongs to) say they have face discrimination due to their caste. If people from the caste when directly asked say they face little discrimination how can a man who cant get the surnames of the protagonist correct be praised worldwide for showing the prevalence of casteism in India.

zc656k,On Inheritance Games - the love triangle (full of spoilers),"I’m not normally one for love triangles, but the one depicted in The Inheritance Games was really up my alley. I’ve noticed some discourse over the endgame being wJameson because many people preferred Grayson. As someone who really wanted Grayson and Avery to be endgame, I’m actually glad that Jameson was endgame. 

1) I’m happy that avery stuck to her choice. One thing that irks me is when characters just can’t choose who they want and play with both. Especially in this scenario when both boys were played by Emily, I really think it was important that Avery remained firm. It was to show that she wasn’t like Emily; she wouldn’t hurt either of them that way. She made a choice and she stuck to it. I believe that love is more than just a feeling and the series showcased it amazingly; it’s about choosing somebody again and again, and always choosing to love them. 

2) Grayson wasn’t ready. This is a fact that everyone can see, but he was grieving for Emily. He was hallucinating, he was not mentally stable, and he couldn’t have been a good partner for Avery anyways. Even at the end when he has ‘gotten over her’c trauma doesn’t just go away like that. You don’t get over your grief in an instant

3) Jameson was there throughout. He’s the one who spent more time with Avery. And as she said, he’s the one who made her who she was. Avery as a character wouldn’t be the same if not for him

Of course, this isn’t to say that Grayson shouldn’t have been endgame. I rooted for him the whole time and wanted to throw my book away every time he sided with Eve/ pushed Avery away. I felt that the chemistry between Avery and Jameson wasn’t as poignant the way it was between Avery and Grayson. 

But I can see why the author chose this route. But I will definitely be writing my own angst fanfics for Grayson moving forward because there’s so much that could’ve been explored with their explosive chemistry",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zc656k/on_inheritance_games_the_love_triangle_full_of/,2022-12-04 10:18:35,2,9,books

apaglo,I can't stop raving about The Haunting of Hill House,"I opened this book expecting a run of the mill haunted house story until the first paragraph immediately changed my expectations: 

""No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.""

The prose is beautiful but tense -- you can almost hear a cryptic moody piano playing as you read. 

And then there was more: Subtle, nuanced psychology. Complete characters. Secrets hidden in the plot that require vigilance from it's readers.  Mysteries abound that do not call attention to themselves; connections slide into place from the most innocuous sentences.   

I loved reserved Eleanor and her fragile psyche. I loved brash Theo and the kindly doctor and even Luke but most especially I loved Hill House. It had its own brooding evil personality that I have seen replicas of (we all have), but the original is something special. It terrified me and it charmed me, putting me under the same spell it enchants its inhabitants with. I paced through its halls; I peered into its mono-colored bedrooms; I wondered about the locked doors and the whispers and the shadowy corners that the brightest fires do not seem to touch.

Already I long to return for a re-read. The Haunting of Hill House has inspired me as it has so many others, along the way creating its own sub-genre in horror. Shirley Jackson was a uniquely tortured genius trying to communicate with us all, and that spirit will resonate forever within the pages of her writing.

sy7s5w,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"This book was a fantastic read! It was my first, real enjoyable experience with historical fiction. 

Early Hollywood has so many stories and such a deep nostalgia as well. The story unfolds in an interview fashion where Evelyn, starting from the beginning of her life, tells her story…and what a story it is.

This book does an amazing job covering so much detail of her life. From each husband, what they meant to her and who her true love really was. It was absolutely beautiful to read and I don’t want to give away too many spoilers. I really think anyone who is a fan of fiction in general would be absorbed by this book. 

There is one minor thing that I feel was kind of unnecessary and perhaps this will spark a controversy. But the interviewer, the journalist who sits down with Evelyn is half black. Now before people jump out of their computer chair and scream, the half black is not the problem. It’s a white author writing from a first person perspective of a half black woman. 

It’s not her story to tell really, or her experience. Again I don’t want to spoil anything but her being half black has barely anything to do with the overall story. It’s used I would say twice throughout the 300 something pages? Like I get why, I do. But it wasn’t needed at all. Which then begs the question of fiction authors in general. And I am a firm believer in writing what you know, or at least, what you have experienced. 

I’m Arabic. I write from that perspective, it’s what I know. Im not going to write from a black perspective even though, being Arabic, I can relate to some experiences that black people have had in the US. 

Again, this is my personal opinion on the matter. 

Did it change my rating of the book? No I absolutely loved the book and recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction. Just something that stood out to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sy7s5w/the_seven_husbands_of_evelyn_hugo/,2022-02-21 23:20:58,9,7,books
184ov3x,The Secret History & If We Were Villains Comparison,"Before I get into this I want to say that I enjoyed both books, so I'm definitely out for genuine discussion, not a fight! We can agree to disagree. I compare them with love and genuine interest.


I'm in the minority but I think IWWV was a better book. TSH is far better written- Tartt is an amazing writer, no doubt about that, it's long as hell with plenty of scenes that don't directly pull the action one way or the other, yet only once or twice did I find the story dragging. That's the only reason the book is SO beloved IMO, because as literature, it was shallow. When I'd finished, I felt like I'd read a fun, gripping thriller, but for all the literary merit people had ascribed to it, I had high expectations and was disappointed by the delivery.

I know that a big theme is supposed to be the dark side of an obsession with beauty/aesthetics and academics, but I barely perceived that throughout the book. The first third or half delivered on this, but once murder was a thing out in the open, most of the character's conversations and actions revolved around calling each other, driving around together, giving each other money and favors, and terse conversations about calling, driving around together, and giving each other money and favors. This was all as a result of their paranoia and bonding over secrecy, so sure, it's related, but Greek, academia, aesthetics, etc. were hardly a blip on the radar compared to the murder and its aftermath. Which is fine! But that doesn't exactly scream ""students falling into a dark obsession with philosophy and Greek culture/art"" to me. Once shit got real they pretty firmly had both feet in the present day real world for the rest of the novel. If anything the themes I'd get from the story sum up to ""fuck around and find out"", with the whole thing surrounding the Dionysian ritual being more of a delivery vehicle than maintaining any deeper thematic relevance of its own. Maybe I just don't know enough about Greek classics and I'm missing connections- if you have more information or simply want to share your perspective on this I'd love to know!

With that in mind, I think it's interesting that the biggest complaint I see about IWWV is the devotion of the main cast to Shakespeare: they quoted it too much, too accurately, they cared too much about it, they made it their whole personality, etc. For one, I wonder if people who say this have ever hung out with a group of serious theater people who do shows together, because I thought it was pretty damn accurate. If you're not in the cast with them it can get unbearable.

But more importantly, that's exactly what people say they like about TSH, and which I found so lacking in TSH! The characters' obsession with Shakespeare was deeply entwined with the drama that unfolded. They DID take their academics, their elite group, the philosophy behind their studies, too far. They WERE pretentious where TSH's cast was simply bourgeois and cold. I think IWWV did a much better job thematically. I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts on this.

I thought the characters in both books were pretty two-dimensional, but that both did unreliable narrators in an engaging enough way that I can blame it on the protagonists, lol. Neither had much in the way of true mystery, but still managed to be tense and thrilling. TSH did a better job fleshing out the world ""beyond"" the exclusionary group, which made it feel more real and lent to some funny passages, but the lack of that in IWWV supported the isolated and codependent feeling of the main cast. I thought TSH did romance better, by which I mean there was less of it, lol.

Any other thoughts on comparing the books? After reading them both it's obvious why they always get brought up together, but I like them for such different reasons!

Scott Johnson (I go by my middle name. By the time I thought to ask my parents why they’d forgotten the reason), and my first book is Gemini Gambit. It’s the story of a cyber-thief in hiding who gets outed by an AI who thinks people are just as good in real life as they are in video games. Now she’s on the run from the Bolivian mafia, the FBI, private security firms, and her mom. Publisher’s Weekly called it “a cheerfully nerdy caper.” It has matrix-like video games, deadly villains, an AI on a mission, and a woman at the center of it all who isn’t even supposed to be there. If you think any of this is interesting, it’d be great hearing from you today. This is my first novel and I’m hoping to get everyone as excited about reading it as I was about writing it, as well as answer any other questions, and maybe learn a thing or three as well.

I’ll be doing this author spotlight from 11 am to 6 pm today. Please feel free to ask me anything you want. Proof of my identity is here: https://www.facebook.com/D-Scott-Johnson-1422185074739504

kuhffb,Cold Comfort Farm: Something wonderful in the woodshed,"Stella Gibbons' Cold Comfort Farm is a classic that completely passed me by. I had never read it, never seen it, perhaps never even seen mention of it, until someone recently recommended it to me. When I read that it was a funny parody on books I like, I bought it and gave it a go. It is absolutely brilliant. I can't recommend it highly enough.

The book is about a young, and very sensible, girl from London, who decides to live with her relatives on Cold Comfort Farm. When she arrives, she discovers a cursed farm, inhabited by a doomed family, controlled by their domineering yet rarely seen matriarch (who, as a child, saw something nasty in the woodshed). Undeterred, she sets about setting the place right. Think Mary Poppins meets Wuthering Heights.  
It's a delightful parody on rural melodramas from the 20s/30s, which have fallen out of fashion, but the tropes are all easily recognisable from the likes of Wuthering Heights or even East of Eden, and while the overly dramatic writing and thick country accents are written with a tongue firmly planted in her cheek, they're never mocking, or overly silly or even too referential. The writing holds up excellently on its own, and you don't have to be familiar with the genre to enjoy the story and the excellent take on that kind of book.

With the excellently drawn characters, the witty, subtle imagery, the strange and appealing world of a ""near future"" that feels a lot like a near past with a few more planes, and the actually funny story, its a book which immediately shot into my top five books. Do we have any more fans of this great classic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kuhffb/cold_comfort_farm_something_wonderful_in_the/,2021-01-10 16:24:35,13,22,books

g57bx8,Just finished Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse. Can't figure something out - did I miss the explanation? (spoilers),"I recently started a quest to read all of Agatha Christie's books. I just finished The Pale Horse (the 7th I've read). I enjoyed the book overall, though it had a somewhat slow start. However, I can't figure out a certain point, but perhaps it's something I missed when I was reading while tired one night.

At the beginning, the list of names is found in the priest's shoe. Two have question marks by them: Delafontaine (which is the narrator's aunt/godmother if I remember correctly) and Corrigan. My understanding was that this list from the dying woman consisted of the names of the people she had been instructed to go to for the ""research"" firm, gathering the information needed for the poison to later be planted in their houses.

I had assumed that the non-question mark names were ones that had already been killed, and the two question marks had been arranged, but were not yet necessarily dead. 

Going with the assumption that the Corrigan on the list was Ginger, how would the dying woman have her name if the ""arrangement"" involving her had not yet been made? Or did it refer to a different Corrigan, since Ginger was using Easterbrook's name in their plan?

4dmloc,"Hi everyone! I’m Adam Mitzner, the author of The Girl From Home (AMA)","I’m Adam Mitzner, the author of The Girl From Home, which came out yesterday, and three other legal thriller novels – A Conflict of Interest (2011), A Case of Redemption (2013) and Losing Faith (2015). In addition to writing legal thrillers, I’m a full-time practicing lawyer at a New York City law firm.

I’m happy to talk with you about anything – writing, the law, Batman, how to start a novel, how to get it published, you name it.

First, a tiny bit about my books. I write thrillers with a legal bent, but I prefer to think about them as first and foremost, character driven stories.In my first book, A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, I wrote about a man who was on the path to success, and then through a series of bad decisions lost his way. For my sophomore effort -- A CASE OF REDEMPTION -- I started out the other way – focusing on a character that had lost everything before the book opens, and was trying find his way back. LOSING FAITH is about a man who has reached the pinnacle of his professional, and explores how fragile such a high perch can be, and the lengths he and those who love him will go to hold on to it. Finally, in my most recent book – THE GIRL FROM HOME – the protagonist is a man who’s willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, and through the course of the novel he’s confronted with the price to be paid for such life choices, and whether he’s capable of changing his ways.


I'll be on Reddit for the next three hours or so, and I’ll answer questions about writing, the law or Batman (or something else if I know anything about it), so just ask!

yadwyn,A bit confused about how I'm supposed to interpret Bunny's character from Donna Tartt's The Secret History,"Bunny's rampant bigotry and especially homophobia was a large part of his character in the novel. Richard noted this at one point and indicated that he didn't think it was reminiscent of any kind of internalized hatred, but was simply a prejudice with a lack of nuance. However, something that I always found intriguing about Tartt's books specifically is her utilization of unreliable narrators. This was more obvious in The Goldfinch with characters later bringing up events in more detail than Theo wanted to write about initially.

However, with Richard it seems to be moreso a lack of knowledge and context. Later as he learns more, this changes the narrator's perception of the characters and events as the story progresses. Due to this, I don't know how much faith we are supposed to place in Richard's initial assumption. I won't lie and say I have a whole lot of evidence to back this up with, I don't. It was just this one scene that confused me a bit regarding the nature of Bunny's hatred.

During their lunch at the beginning of the book, Bunny said on page 54 (they start off talking about Camilla):

>""Come on,"" I said, still laughing. ""She's really pretty."" ""That she is, that she is,"" he agreed, holding up a conciliatory palm. ""Lovely girl. I've always said so. Looks just like a statue of Diana in my father's club. All she lacks is a mother's firm hand, but still, for my money, she's what you call a bramble rose, as opposed to your hybrid tea. Doesn't take the pains she ought, you know. And runs around half the time in her brother's sloppy old clothes, which maybe some girls could get away with-well, frankly I don't think any girls can really get away with it, but she certainly can't. Looks too much like her brother. I mean to say, Charles is a handsome fellow and a sterling character all around, but I wouldn't want to marry him, would I?""  
>  
>He was on a roll and was about to say something else; but then, quite suddenly, he stopped, his face souring as if something unpleasant had occurred to him. I was puzzled, yet a little amused; was he afraid he'd said too much, afraid of seeming foolish? I was trying to think of a quick change of subject, to let him off the hook, but then he shifted in his chair and squinted across the room.  
>  
>""Look there,"" he said. ""Think that's us? It's about time.""

The way this is written makes it seem as if Bunny made an uncomfortable realization in relation to marrying Charles. The obvious thing I came away with was that maybe he did like the idea and wasn't happy about that? It feels like the only conclusion I can really draw, but I almost feel stupid for saying it. It really isn't built upon at all in any other part of the book unless you count the fact that Donna Tartt didn't really seem to have a problem making practically every character ambiguously gay/bisexual, so in an odd way, why wouldn't he be?

That just isn't good enough for me though, I want to know what the common interpretation of this is, because honestly this is the only way I was able to read it. However it didn't seem to be alluded to in any other way, so I'm confused.

Was there instead a connection to a completely unrelated event that I missed? Perhaps it's something meant to be ambiguous? I am unsure.

And yes, if it turns out that some piece of information I forgot about shows an obvious answer, I will feel extremely stupid for writing this post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yadwyn/a_bit_confused_about_how_im_supposed_to_interpret/,2022-10-22 04:22:42,16,42,books
64ax5j,Biff is the salesman in Death of a Salesman (DoaS),"SPOILERS for DoaS!!

I have no idea where to put this. I firmly believe that the salesman in the title refers not to Willy Loman, but his son, Biff. The death, then, refers not to Willy's literal death but to the metaphorical death of Biff's misguided dream of becoming a salesman.

The entire family lies to themselves consistently. Biff and Happy act like they are hot shots at work, when in fact they were just one ""cog in the machine."" Willy is hallucinating, steeped in guilt about his cheating on Linda; Linda tells her sons to just act like everything's good for the sake of Willy. At the end, when the family is standing over Willy's grave, Biff mentions that Willy had his dreams in the wrong place. Biff is the only one who realizes that maybe he isn't cut out to be a salesman, to just follow the path of the American Dream, from rags to riches. He accepts that he won't be successful, that he won't build up a fortune or something, but that he will lead a happy, perfectly normal life. 

DoaS can be a happy ending and a happy message. Yes, the American Dream dies, but Biff relinquishes it willingly. It need not be the only path to happiness.

8s4zxw,The Asshole Protagonist,"By and large, I think, authors try to write a protagonist that is fallible but still loveable, or at least likeable.  That said, there are exceptions (sometimes stunning exceptions) to every rule, and my personal favourite breaker of this rule is Edwin de Valu, protagonist of *Happiness^tm* by Will Ferguson.

Edwin is an objectively bad person.  He condescends to and cheats on his wife, with his department head, who is actually in love with him, and to whom he is a callous and insensitive fuck.  He condescends to and sabotages his despised coworker, whose primary offences are being a bit of a brown noser, and, subsequently, more successful than Edwin.  He condescends to and undermines his boss, who *is* admittedly an insufferable buffoon.  Edwin feels and acts superior to pretty much everyone around him, he is perpetually miserable, he is pessimistic and he projects his own dissatisfaction with the mediocrity of his existence onto everyone and everything he encounters.  In short, Edwin de Valu is a terrible person with no redeeming qualities.

I love Edwin.  He's possibly my favourite character in all the fiction I've ever read.  He's a giant piece of shit and I wish I could hang out with him and bitch about things we both hate.  He's a stellar example of the dickwad protagonist who still gets the reader firmly on-side.

I don't know *exactly* what it is that makes me so fond of him.  Maybe I feel better about myself in comparison? Maybe he appeals to my own less favourable opinions of myself and makes me feel less alone in them.  I don't know.  What I do know is that, even as I know Edwin *deserves* the awful things that keep happening to him in waves, I am still rooting for him to make his getaway and come out on top.

Started reading The Fountainhead recently; came across this passage where Peter Keating is in his boss's (Guy Francon) house. Keating becomes a favorite of Francon after joining the prestigious architectural firm. Francon takes him around to parties a lot:


""""""
""Well,'' said Keating, ''I couldn't quite work it to ask her to
lunch, but she's coming to Mawson's exhibition with me day after tomorrow. Now what?"" · He sat on the floor, his head resting against the edge of a couch, his bare feet stretched out, a pair of Guy Francon's chartreuse pyjamas floating loosely about his limbs.
Through the open door of the bathroom he saw Francon standing at the washstand, his stomach pressed to its shining edge,
brushing his teeth. 


""That's splendid,'' said Francon, munching through a thick
foam of toothpaste. ''That'll do just as well. Don't you see?""


""No.""


""Lord, Pete, I explained it to you yesterday before we started.
Mrs. Dunlop's husband's planning to build a home for her."" . ""Oh, yeah,"" -said Keating weakly, brushing the matted black
curls off his face. ''Oh, yeah... I remember now .. Jesus, Guy,
I got a head on me!""


He remembered vaguely the party to which Francon had taken
him the night before, he remembered the caviar in a hollow ice- . berg, the black net evening gown and the pretty face of Mrs. · Dunlop, but be could not remember how be had come to end up
in Francon's apartment. He shrugged; he had attended many parties with Frimcon -in the past year and had often been brought here like this. ""

66yy0r,"As someone who has struggled with mental illness for the past 10 years, I absolutely love reading the Wheel of Time series. Seeing Rand's determination to do what must be done while retaining his humanity and the foundation of his character is very inspirational and relateable.","Having dealt with some mental health issues of varying severity over the past decade, I've tried to use reading as a great way to relax and momentarily escape from my psychological bullshit. For the past year or so, I've been reading the Wheel of Time series which I have found to be extremely relatable and motivational.  Watching Rand's development from an ignorant and innocent farmboy into the tough and determined dragon reborn has coincided well with my transition to adulthood. More than that however, seeing Rand struggle with his sanity, while attempting to keep a firm grasp on the core of who he is has really resonated with me.  While those around him understand that his mental stability will eventually deteriorate, ultimately leaving him insane like every other man who has channeled, Rand never allows himself to give in.  Despite prophecy, his duties as a leader, and the constant temptation to stray from his goal, Rand is able to hold onto his core characteristics, those that he developed in the Two Rivers, most notably his respect for women, his love for his family and friends, his work ethic, and his desire for a simplistic lifestyle.  He constantly pushes forward, doing his duty as the dragon reborn as he knows he must, all the while fighting his own mental skirmishes.  Anyway, on days when I'm really struggling and feel like throwing in the towel, it's nice to have such a motivational character to read about, even if he is fictional.

2e2wfk,"Which books have most fundamentally altered the way you perceive yourself and the world, altered your behaviour and improved your life?","Mine:

*Sam Harris's* **Free Will** (super short & easy read)

(empathy, understanding, zen)

Although I was familiar with the philosophical concept of [determinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), I never really actively included it in my general thought process. Being forced me to read and think about its implications in everyday life. It helped me to see people as 'robotic' and focus less on an individual's behaviour and their accountability and more on the systemic or contextual issues that caused it. Even when an individual may be considered accountable, they never 'chose' their psychological disposition. It has also helped me be always aware that actions don't start and end with a single person and to understand that everything that happens has to have happened; there is little value in grieving or frustration.

*Walter Isaacson's* **Steve Jobs**

(pragmatism in creativity - steal like an artist, belief in self, vision, focus on the product as a cohesive whole, rarely concede to delivering a product with flaws and always think about the human using the product)

Steve Jobs is a very divisive figure and a lot of people read a few hundred pages in and denounce him as an asshole who takes credit for other people's work and denounce him for having no discernible talents beyond maybe marketing. This is partially true but absolutely misses the point. Steve Jobs had a combination of a forceful personality, an almost prophetic understanding of the optimal future of human-tech interaction (even if some of it was 'borrowed') and the ability to firmly believe that he could create the products to facilitate it. Although he didn't physically build and design the products, he forced others to believe in themselves and in his vision and created the settings in which they could be built. This might reek of fanboyism but with the exception of an iPad mini, I've never owned an Apple product. My web development work and design process has been transformed thanks in part to this book and I am so much more proactive about making shit happen and importantly, getting help from other people.

Bonus round: Ivan Illich's *Deschooling Society* (autodidacticism, deconstruction of the importance of institutionalised education most of the world takes for granted)

mbrdua,My Partial Review of FRED THE VAMPIRE ACCOUNTANT.,"Are you a fan of David Wong and Douglas Adams novels?

Then you'll get a kick out of this series. Yes, it was Graphic Audio that turned me onto this series. 

But what really impressed me is the incredibly realistic approach to the concept of vampire lore and poking fun at all aspects of fantasy concepts.

To keep it simple, a painfully shy introverted guy named Fred worked as an accountant for a law group in colorado and was attacked one night traveling back to his apartment.

When he wakes up, he finds out that he has been turned into a vampire, since he has no clue who turned him and has an extensive movie collection to fall back on as a frame of reference.

He decided to quit his job, move into a windowless apartment, and start his own accounting firm. Since he's terrified of hurting someone and absolutely avoids violence, he works out a deal with a shady doctor who he helped cook the books for his practice in exchange for blood.

And THEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!, nothing, he just goes on being a normal accountant.

NOW don't leave just yet, this was just an elaborate pretext to set up the character.

The first book *""The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant""* is excellent, it sets up all the major characters and does really good world-building that helps the reader absorb fantasy/horror tropes into a relatable way.

I give the author Drew Hayes credit, he has thoroughly thought out every aspect of this universe he has created.

Because book two *""Undeath and Taxes""* Is escalation, Fred has now started to gather a nice friendly circle of friends, deal with magical weapons, complex political intrigue with various supernatural forces and top it off with a nice haunted house yarn.

Book three ""Bloody Acquisitions"" deals with a humorous perspective of hostile corporate takeovers, small-town paranormal charms, magical sibling rivalry, and a new take on vampire clans as mafia groups.

If I'm being vague about character or story details, that's intentional, because anything I would say would end up spoiling a lot of future plot points.

I highly recommend this series, it's a breath of fresh air in an already oversaturated horror/fantasy market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mbrdua/my_partial_review_of_fred_the_vampire_accountant/,2021-03-23 23:04:54,2,17,books
7tb2p7,Just finished The Little Stranger by Sarah Waters. What are your thoughts?,"I feel as though Faraday had split personality disorder. He was so adamant about diagnosing ""nervous disorders"" that it seemed he was projecting his own mental illness onto the Ayres. Of course, Roderick was actually mentally ill, but I immediately got PTSD vibes from him and nothing more. He did his best to convince Caroline that she was also ill directly after she called off the wedding, and reacted in extreme anger and persistence when she wouldn't succumb to his manipulations. His personality was so ""good cop bad cop"" and the change would be so sudden that it really was like reading from two different characters.

I firmly believe Faraday killed Caroline, just like he killed Gyp, took Roderick away, and convinced Mrs. Aryes that she was so incredibly ill that she destroyed herself. When he couldn't control Caroline, he destroyed her too. And, ultimately, got what he wanted all along; the house.

c8lk44,"Just finished ""The Stand""","I read the unabridged version and it did drag in the middle. Particularly the sections with committee meetings (ugh). However, it has some amazing sections of prose that showcase the best King ever had to offer. Also the opening scenes of the flu actually ravaging the population are some of the best of any survival genre. 
I enjoyed the book even if it was a bit of a slog and would recommend it to King fans or those reading the Dark Tower series as it offers some more information about ""the dark mans"" nature. 
Also by the middle of the novel I firmly pictured the character of Glen as looking identical to Bernie Sanders. The character of Harold also showcases an ""incel"" long before that became a thing. I am slightly disappointed though, it didnt exactly live up to my own expectations as I was told it was Kings ""best novel"" personally ""Wizard and Glass"" in the Dark Tower series, ""Firestarter"" and ""The Shining"" (including the sequel believe it or not) have much better pacing and character arcs. A lot of empty characters that seemed to just offer very little substance.

I think my group will like the the underlying murder mystery story, but will certainly be confused by  heavy mention of the feud going on between the pope, the emperor, and the various monastic orders and their branch sects. Hell, even I'm a little lost, finding myself re-reading sections to get a firm grip on the situation. 

I would like to be able to provide a primer of sorts for the group, the month before they begin reading, to prepare them for what's important and try and clarify some of the history before they go in blindly. I'd look online, but as I haven't actually finished the book myself yet, I didn't want to spoil the plot. Basically, I'm asking for those of you who have read the book to provide the most essential bits of this whole historical context, in the frame of not ruining any part of the actual plotline, so that I can give my group a quick lesson on what's important for them to know to give them a fuller understanding the story. For example, I know I'll need to explain the relationship between the Franciscan/Benedictine orders as I'm sensing the significance it will have on the conflicting ideologies of William and the other monks.

As much as I would love to do a comprehensive history lesson, teaching my group about the complexities of 14th century secular vs. religious powers in Europe, it'll simply be too much. They typically only want to read CJ Box stories, so this whole literary historical murder mystery is a bit ambitious.

6dejwa,East of Eden & The Significance of Love,"Currently reading East of Eden, as it is a part of a list of books I wanna tackle this summer. I've gone as far as chapter 34 and am very near the novels end but as I slowly reach the conclusion I'm left reflecting on a theme that has been rattling my mind since Part 1 of the novel. Love, and its effect on humanity.

  A memorable moment of the novel is Charles and Adam's conversation following the death of their father. I find this moment to be pivotal because it conveys the idea that love instills irrationality. 

 Charles: ""How can you have faith in him if you didn't love him?""
  Adam: ""Maybe That's the reason...Maybe if I had loved him I would have been jealous of him. Maybe love makes you suspicious and doubting."" 

  What are your thoughts? I found it very interesting how firm Adam's faith in his father was despite not loving him like Charles. I think part of the reason I'm so focused on this is because of my own strained relationship with my father. East of Eden really illustrates certain aspects of human nature so vividly that it's like staring into a mirror.

4jhc5u,Just finished The Brothers Karamazov. Can we talk about it?,"Spoilers for the book ahead.

What were your guys thoughts on the book in general?

This book really hit me for some reason. There were so many things that I liked about it, I'd often end up reading certain passages from the book over and over again because of how much I loved the way it was written. 

There were some parts that made me genuinely tear up, specifically any of the parts dealing with Alyosha and the children, and I rarely have given that sort of emotional response to anything fictional, ever. 

My favorite character was probably Dmitri, simply due to the way he was characterized. I guess I could really relate to that character somewhat, and I really loved the whole segment in the book that focuses on him before the murder. 

My favorite parts of the book had to be Zosima's teachings, Mutiny, and The Grand Inquisitor, the whole 'Cana of Galilee' segment, the entire part going over what Dmitri did before the murder and afterwards, and any of the scenes with Alyosha and the kids. Honestly, from the whole Mitya chapter to the ending, the book practically read itself. That's not to say the parts previously were bad, because I still really liked it, but that's when the book definitely started to pick up its pace, in my opinion.

There were a lot of passages I really liked, but one that really hit me personally was the one from Cana of Galilee:

>“He did not know why he was embracing it, he did not try to understand why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss all of it, but he was kissing it, weeping, sobbing, and watering it with his tears, and he vowed ecstatically to love it, to love it unto ages of ages. “Water the earth with the tears of your joy, and love those tears ... ,” rang in his soul. What was he weeping for? Oh, in his rapture he wept even for the stars that shone on him from the abyss, and “he was not ashamed of this ecstasy.” It was as if threads from all those innumerable worlds of God all came together in his soul, and it was trembling all over, “touching other worlds.” He wanted to forgive everyone and for everything, and to ask forgiveness, oh, not for himself! but for all and for everything, “as others are asking for me,” rang again in his soul. But with each moment he felt clearly and almost tangibly something as firm and immovable as this heavenly vault descend into his soul. Some sort of idea, as it were, was coming to reign in his mind—now for the whole of his life and unto ages of ages. He fell to the earth a weak youth and rose up a fighter, steadfast for the rest of his life, and he knew it and felt it suddenly, in that very moment of his ecstasy. Never, never in all his life would Alyosha forget that moment. “Someone visited my soul in that hour,” he would say afterwards, with firm belief in his words . . .”

This passage was really powerful to me, just the way it's written. 

The only major problem I had with the book was with the character of Smerdyakov. I feel like we never got to really know him, yeah we got scenes with him, we had a general idea of what his past was like, and the kind of person he was, but we were never really in his head like we were with the other characters. We never even got a full explanation for why he killed Fyodor except because of Ivan's 'without God, everything is lawful' idea. And then he commits suicide at the end and I'm at a struggle as to how to interpret the character. What did you guys think about it?

77mbk4,Do you think 'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro is a masterpiece?,"I just finished this book. I started it after I saw multiple people on a reddit thread calling it a masterpiece. I...am not sure how far that's true. 

Without doubt, Ishiguro is the master of subtext. There's beauty and magic in the way he conveys two distinct, often contradictory layers of information with the same words.

Further, the way the book portrays the picture of a man who secretly wished to be so much more than a butler but had come to find a false satisfaction by teaching himself otherwise is brilliant. The story of this one insignificant man's personal conflict amidst the backdrop of far greater conflicts raging all about him is somehow both cozy and compelling.

And the ending is absolutely incredible. It made me want to stay with the book, to not let it end, and that's definitely commendable.

But despite all this, one great flaw consistently hampered my enjoyment of the book. The story is written in first person by a butler, as basically his memoir. But all the while I was reading, to me it was always Kazuo Ishiguro writing about a butler's life. I could notice the research and the effort, when I felt I never should have been able to.

There was a lack of detail in general that would be present if an actual butler would narrate his life, a 'background buzz' in the narration that was absent. Further, the content that WAS there as a means to provide authenticity to the character's life as a butler was highlighted too much, as if the author was holding it up to me and saying 'look, this detail feels real and authentic, doesn't it?', a prime example being the whole silver polishing reference. Details like this are also repeated frequently enough to break immersion and exacerbate the issue.

I feel that the job of a good writer of fiction is to appear to be simply the chronicler of a story, rather than its creator, and Ishiguro missed the mark here.

I don't mean to say that he failed with the book. It's a damn fine story told well. Maybe he wasn't able to find enough research to bring the authenticity the book needed, and that's a shame, but the end result is that 'The Remains of the Day' remains firmly in the zone of 'a good book that could've been much better' for me.

gp9r9h,Symbolism of the West in Animal Farm (Discussion),"\- Finished Animal Farm for the first time since I skimmed the book HS some 16 years ago. I was always led to believe, or maybe just had the impression, that it lampooned Stalin and Communism and was a satire of the Russian Revolution. Those things are all true, however I came to realize during my reading, that it doesn't glorify the West either. That was a truth I hadn't realized before.

\- Throughout the novel I was attempting to make connections as to which character represented which historical class or figure. Napoleon is clearly Stalin, Old Major represents Lenin/Karl Marx.  Snowball is Leon Trotsky. The dogs are Stalin's secret police. After these characters the connections become a bit more difficult. The sheep I associated with blind followers of any idea or institution. The Raven is always a symbol for death or finality in a story. The animals were divided into classes or castes. And, then I got to the other human farmers.

\- Mr. Jones would have to represent the old autocratic (?) regime of Soviet Russia overthrown by Lenin, Stalin and Communist ideals. But, Whymper, Pilkington and Frederick, in my mind, would all have to be other governments cooperating or resisting Stalin's Russia. Animal Farm being written in the World War II era, and with Pilkington and Frederick always at odds themselves, one had to represent Hitler's Germany and the other the Allied Powers of France, England and the U.S.  Friedrich being a German name (and also whispers of his cruelty to his animals) had to be Hitler's Nazi State, and thus Pilkington, who ultimately allies himself with Napoleon, the Allied Powers. The problem is NONE OF THESE CHARACTERS SEEM REMOTELY GOOD OR HEROIC, only merciless and full of greed. If anything, it can be argued, Animal Farm delivers a backhand to western culture and philosophy that Communism strove to break free from and ultimately, in Orwell's eyes, ended it up being indifferent from. Am I reading that correctly? And, if so this is a major shift away from what I was led to believe Animal Farm was truly about. This wasn't just LOLRussia, but a scathing criticism of much of the leadership present near the close of the second World War. If this idea is pretty obvious and commonplace, I had never heard it before and don't remember it being discussed in class.

\- Other questions I encountered while reading: Is this book banned in Russia today (and if not, I wonder what the general attitude is towards it?)? Also, it got me wondering if there exists books that satirize other nations or time periods so ""on the nose"" as Animal Farm does the Russian Revolution? I would definitely be interested in reading those as well.

\- Still fuzzy on some of the other symbolisms of the book. If others would like to chime in, that would be excellent. 

\- Also, pick up the Ralph Steadman illustrated edition of this book. His work is freakin' glorious.

puoi93,The Handmaid's Tale and Gender Lenses,"\- Today, I finished The Handmaid's Tale, and man... I didn't know books by women were written so well! Just kidding. I say this in jest over the recent revelations and debates here at r/books over how men read women authors. But, my jest has a point! It sort of aligns with my struggles with this book. I am a man, foremost, and reading this book was quite uncomfortable for me. It was a great book, let's get that out in the open. But, it was an uncomfortable read. And, I think the real reason for this discomfort was the feeling that when confronted with many paths of emotion to embrace-many moral stances to lay a firm hold on- I couldn't figure which was the right one to choose. This is the crux of where some of us are at using the cultural lenses of gender studies, and why I think Margaret Atwood's book is a masterpiece. Now, for my convoluted rant/review on the story:

\- You read The Handmaid's Tale, and you find yourself getting upset. Our protagonist, a young woman who has been through a range of tug-of-war-like events, lives a life not uniquely her own, dominated by masculine-dictated rules in a recently-formed overtly patriarchal society in the old United States of America. She exists during this transition from the former democratic, free USA to this stern, strict, oppressive religious-state, where women are given a place in society as wives, housekeepers (Marthas), child-bearers (Handmaids), teacher/disciplinarians (Aunts), or the unworthy positions of Unwomen or colony-dwellers. Our protagonist is a handmaid, a somewhat honorable position (I guess), where one is kept in great care as their womb is to house infants in a society where war, toxins, and a weird caste system prevents just anyone from giving birth. We never really learn her true name, but her given one, Offred (""Of Fred"") which I kept reading as ""off-red"" which I suppose would have been apt as well. All handmaids take the name ""Of-(to be filled in by whomever there Commander is)"". This is all a set up to just make you feel an underlying sense of dread over the lives these women, especially Offred, live. And, Atwood has done an incredible job setting this mood, especially for male readers, in my opinion.

\- So, throughout the novel, at various instances I am upset and uncomfortable. I think it is hard to write down why, but I will attempt to. As a man there exists a protective, heroic quality to many of us, where we'd like to jump into the pages and rescue Offred, and give her a new life. Yet, I don't think this is the path Atwood wants us to take here, and I think this is the attitude that has gotten us into this society in the first place. These men display an ownership of women that should strike a nerve, yet as a man which nerve is it striking? It's a tough swallow. And, I tried to think realistically if I lived in this society, where would I fit in? As a guardian? As a rebel living on the treacherous outskirts? How would I react? This book forces you into some tough corners. Maybe the point is to get us to see and feel as women do? Maybe it all acts as symbolism as to how we are ignorant of the woman's perspective in our day-to-day lives? I admit I can be guilty of that. I would love to hear some other perspectives from those who have read the book. 

\- I feel like we live in a society that tries to box us all into a definable container concerning our beliefs and ideologies. I think that is why we have so much conflict between us, and maybe between our genders. Many of us are still seeking out our truths, and it is tough to choose the right paths in these instances. I listen to something like a Bill Burr comedy routine about ""male feminists"", and in the moment you think you can relate to the absurdity of that. Yet, is it so absurd to try and relate to the opposite gender on some level? I don't think so. We have carved out terms like ""white knighting"" and ""virtue signalling"" to call out those who, I suppose get too holier-than-thou concerning being woke about the plight of women. I was accused of that in my review of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and I kind felt insulted about it- and, yet I guess, in the end I don't even really know what those terms are getting at so- why get spun up? This book has forced me to confront a lot of my own views on women, and much of my own ignorance, and reflect on the many paths one can go down concerning gender observations. And, maybe there is more than one right viewpoint we can approach with this.

\- In the end, I guess I am just getting thoughts off my mind. I do recommend this book, though it isn't a necessarily enjoyable read (although some of its descriptions about ""the little things in life"" are nice). At times, I felt I just wanted to rush through the book to get it over with and get to the end, as Offred wanted to just get through her Ceremonies. But, this book will challenge your ideologies and cause reflection towards relationships you thought you understood. I am married to an Asian woman (OfKeaton126), who is just an absolute peach, and this book has made me consider more not only her perspectives as a woman, but as one from a different set of cultural norms and values as well. Not to say I was ignorant of those things before. I have always observed what gives her enjoyment, happiness and peace, but maybe need to spend more time considering why. None of us are, nor should be so easy to place in a definable box. So in that sense, I think this book has taught me something I hadn't reflected upon before.

11w0c22,Finished Descartes Discourse On The Method,"\- Hello all. I have just finished up  René Descartes's *Discourse On The Method* (1637) and decided to do a very general commentary on it; general in that this was my first foray into Descartes, and I didn't want to make the mistake he often criticizes, of believing one knows everything upon their mere introduction into a subject. Instead I will try to be more careful and precise about what I believe I do know in honor of his work.

\- In doing some background investigations into Descartes, I found his life to be massively intriguing even outside of his writings. Born in France, he was raised primarily by his Roman Catholic grand-parents, and attended the Jesuit college of La Flèche. The Church plays a big part in his life, and obviously throughout Europe during this time period. It is interesting that he is raised Catholic, but proceeds to join the Protestant Dutch army as a mercenary in the Thirty Years War. How badass is that? Mercenary would never have been an occupation I would have associated with Descartes. Anyway, scientific writings and discoveries begin emanating from titans like Galileo and Kepler, and Descartes is drawn to some of these new lines of thinking. But the terrible Inquisition hovers around at large, accusing minds like Galileo of heresy, and it is a fear of Descartes that seems to pervade his conclusions within *Discourse.* It is why he spent much of his years writing in the relative safety of protestant Netherlands. In his later years, he accepts a career as a tutor for the fucking Queen of Sweden (Christina)! He dies there after contracting pneumonia, though there are some who argue he might have actually been poisoned by a secretive Catholic missionary. But really now. What a life! I had no idea of the interesting historical background he lived in while he was writing.

*""Finally, since I thought that we could have all the same thoughts, while asleep, as we have while we are awake, although none of them is true at that time, I decided to pretend that nothing that ever entered my mind was any more true than the illusions of my dreams. But I noticed, immediately afterwards, that while I thus wished to think that everything was false, it was necessarily the case that I, who was thinking this, was something. When I noticed that this truth* ***‘I think, therefore I am’*** *was so firm and certain that all the most extravagant assumptions of the sceptics were unable to shake it, I judged that I could accept it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy for which I was searching.""*

*-*I think therefore I am is the philosophical principle and mantra that Descartes is most famed for. And, that's totally cool and deserving. However, I really was more in awe of *how* he came to that conclusion. It is simple but brilliant. And I am of a meager intellect, so if it seems amazing to me but just meh to those more intelligent, so be it. One of the methods Descartes provides in this book, as I am to understand it, is to doubt everything initially except that which is clear and beyond uncertainty. Which seems to be really nothing when he begins this process. And he uses this reasoning for everything. I mean everything. But, when he gets to the idea of SELF, he tries to attack it from every possible angle, and literally stumps himself. He can't escape it, but the clear cut, beyond doubt truth he finds is that, even the fact he is able to perform the very action of doubting existence proves that he is a substance which exists. The act of thinking, regardless of the conclusion a thought produces, at the very least proves that you are something. There is no thinking in the void, thinking doesn't emanate from nothing. The whole chapter in context is quite wonderful and just enhances 'I think therefore I am' to another level, at least for me. 

\-I would be remiss if I did not talk about the actual method, and for my own understanding I will try to summarize it in my own words. The first rule, as I stated above, is to accept nothing as true except that which is clear and beyond uncertainty. Second, in the case of whatever item or thought is being examined you divide it into as many subdivisions or categories as you think necessary. Third, begin observing or examining each thought or item from the most simple subdivision, then gradually working your way up to the most complex. And, finally, if I am to understand the process correctly, to repeat the process from as many other alternative perspectives and/or angles, so that nothing is omitted in arriving at your final conclusions. And this may not be groundbreaking stuff to readers of today (though again I still find it fascinating), but I imagine the stir it caused to the minds of the 1600's.  I imagine popes and cardinals just gnashing their teeth and pooping their pants (robes?).

*""For according to the arguments I have just constructed, all I had to do in order to know the nature of God– in so far as my nature was capable of doing so– was to ask, about all the things of which I found some idea in myself, whether or not it is a perfection to possess them. I was convinced that none of them which involved some imperfection was in God, but that all the others were. Thus I saw that doubt, fickleness, sadness and similar things could not have been in him, since even I myself would have been very glad to be free from them.*""

\-I want to talk a bit about the man that was Descartes, at least from my perspective in reading *Discourse.* While a man of science and discovery, he seems very much to authentically be a man of God. Many passages are devoted to God, and his reasoning for understanding both perfection and falsity are derived from being a reflection of God. Yet he is a man of God thinking outside the confines of a staunch religion that the Church attempted to place everyone in Europe under. Which was dangerous in itself, but I imagine also thrilling what with all of the new truths and discoveries there were to be made. That is pretty courageous in my view, not only in the threat the Inquisition of the Church posed at the time in their propensity for stake burnings, but also for a believer to wonder if he were under the auspices of something divine or heretical. We take that for granted, or are indifferent, to that notion in this modern age, but this was a deep fear in Descartes's time. And it took a fair amount of boldness to publish these thoughts.

*""Thus, if later people begin at the point that their predecessors had reached and thereby join together the lives and labours of many, we would make much more progress together than each person could ever make on their own.""*

*""The other reason is to lose no opportunity to benefit the public if I am able to do so; and if my writings have any value, those who have them after my death may use them as they think fit.""*

Descartes seems quite aware that his writings are about to blow up, and though he is modest about his intellect and his mind throughout, he is still concerned with how he is seen in posterity. Here is a man who is so conscious of the dangers of the era- the Church, the Inquisition, the casual burnings at the stake (Stake burning Friday, you in?)- that he moves to another country to fight and to write without the Church pummeling down his door. Here is a man so accutely interested in the writings of the ancient pagan philosophers (he seems to make references to Seneca on a few occasions), the new sciences cropping up, and the potential falsities of a classical liberal arts education that he conjures up a new way of thinking and deciphering truth; yet, is still quite fearful of a perfect God who might strike him down from the Book of Life should Descartes try and deny His existence, even if he has proven his own. Here is a man who sees the flow of light, heat, motion, color as a reflection of God's perfection of Creation from the cosmos, as he seems to imply with his thorough example of the circulation of blood from heart to lungs and extremities. And here is a man who deeply believes that his writings are of such importance to be published despite dangers to himself and his reputation, and that his methods should only prove beneficial to his readers long after his death.

qewde3,A review of the Dublin Murder series by Tana French,"Today, I finished reading the Dublin Murder series by Tana French back to back. As you can probably guess from the title, I liked them so much that I decided to do the series some justice and write my own review, focusing both on the strengths (and some potential weaknesses, depending on your mileage) of the series as a whole, and sharing a few thoughts about the individual installments as well. I will try not to spoil anything besides what you would learn from reading the blurb, but I won't be able to avoid subtle hints about whether or not I liked a certain ending or character. If you want to read the books with absolutely zero clue about the premises or characters, proceed at your own caution.   


Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad is a series of six crime thrillers, so named because they all chronicle cases from the eponymous fictional squad (Dublin does not actually have a dedicated murder squad, as French points out in her afterwords). The six installments do not have an overarching, connected plot arc, but French ingeniously avoids both tedium from the lack of character development through the series (e.g. Jo Nesbo) and having to explain changing protagonists midway by promoting a supporting character from the (or in a single case, 'a') previous installment to protagonist. The stories are not told chronologically, and in fact, sometimes one can only piece together the overall timeline of the stories by a few words hinted in conversations, or the makeup of the squad in any given story. This achieves two things: On the one hand, it allows French to weave a new story, based on an entirely new premise each time, while still firmly rooting the books in the same, shared universe. Every time I started reading a new installment past the second one, I immediately knew what I was in for. I understood tiny references to characters not even featured in the book, in-jokes and innuendos as if I had been a part of the squad myself, filling me with a homely, cozy warmth akin to returning home after a long abscence. I opened the book, and a few pages in, I already was sure that it would be good.   


The first thing anyone getting acquainted with the series will probably notice is the language. It is no surprise that French's niche of detective fiction is often referred to as ""literary crime fiction"". Even though I firmly believe that the term ""literary"" is meaningless, it isn't hard to see why. The language is not the jaded, factual, colloquial English found in lesser crime novels. Her language is flowery, eloquent, and at times painfully accurate with its symbolism when describing human emotions. So much so, in fact, that when I first started reading In the Woods, I wanted to put it down for good around 20 pages in. The language seemed too dense, too ""artsy"" and too pretentious for a detective novel. However, once I understood what she was getting at, and how the pieces fit, I was immediately hooked. Conversations sound natural, and French has an amazing talent for writing Irish characters. I am a linguist by profession, and seeing the pecularities of Irish-English grammar, and the slang was pure, utter joy.   


Conversation brings us to the actual characters. All protagonists and supporting characters in the series are well-developed, believable human beings. They are characterized by actual hopes, fears, flaws and dreams. This is especially refreshing, as the vast majority of detective fiction I have read prior tended towards one dimensional characters, whose every action is defined by a single, dominant primary trait (""alcoholic"", ""badass"", ""good cop"", etc.). In isolation, this would already be a notable achievement, but it really starts shifting into higher gear when these characters interact with each other, and their personalities start either clashing or clicking. It really makes for some spectacular scenes, and if someone told me these characters actually exist somewhere, I would believe them without batting an eyelash. If I had to name a single problem I had with characterization is that even though the stories are told from a first person focalized perspective, French's characters tend to withhold crucial information pertaining to their past or to the reasons for their choices until the finale, where the reveal has a greater emotional impact. This makes perfect sense from a writing perspective, but feels somewhat weird, when we have full access to the protagonists's thought processes throughout the book. French's protagonists tend to be borderline unreliable, so that alleviates this somewhat, and it does not detract from the enjoyment substantially.   


The actual plots range from decently good to the ingenious. French made the contentious choice not to reveal the end result of the investigations in any of the books (so you will not see what happens to the perpetrator once they have confessed, and won't even be told what punishment they receive at court) which might put off those who derive satisfaction from knowing justice has been served, and the perpetrator will stay behind bars for life. However, given the heavy focus of the series on character interaction, investigations gone off the rails, and the psychological state of the protagonists, I think it was overall a good choice not to let formalities and the process of law to take center stage at the end. That being said, we have to briefly enter into spoiler territory here. The first four books are straightforward detective stories, told from a single perspective, about a detective or pair of detectives working a case. At this point, French must have felt that she needed to stir up the formula a bit, to avoid repeating herself, so the fifth installment, Secret Place is told from two perspectives: detectives in the present, reopening a cold case, and a group of students in the past, in the weeks leading up to the murder, with a slight supernatural twist. Bisecting the narrative is an interesting choice, but the supernatural angle does not really work (even though some earlier novels, especially In the Woods and The Likeness also have implicit supernatural overtones here and there). It is not a bad book by any means, but it is easy to see French decided to ditch the split narrative concept and return to the original setup for the final installment, The Tresspasser, which finished the series with an absolute bang.   


It also has to be noted that these books are slow burners. It usually takes anywhere between 50 and 100 pages for the action to get going, and even than, don't expect blazing guns and chase scenes at each turn. Actually, there is a single ""onscreen"" gunshot going off in the entire series, which speaks for itself. Obviously, books that slow will always be polarizing. If you are looking for quick thrills, action and the good guys saving the day, you won't be enjoying these. But if you don't mind slow, methodical, immersive thrillers, give these a go, you just might find a new favorite.   


And without further ado, some thoughts about individual installments:  


(1) In the Woods: The first book probably has the best character dynamics in the series, hands down. Some people have criticized the narrator as too gloomy and whiny, but I think as the description of a fundamentally broken character, it is spot-on. The mystery itself is also interesting, but it takes a back burner to the development of the protagonist's relationship with his partner halfway through.The ending has left a sour taste in some people's mouths, because it is not your garden variety ending, but I like it a lot for stepping outside the box. Be prepared to potentially be left wondering and disappointed though, if you expect something usual.   


(2) The Likeness: Again, good characterization, which is not surprising, given that the supporting character from In the Woods takes the role of the protagonist. The whodunit atmosphere  is absolutely on point, but the premise takes a leap of faith and some conscious suspension of disbelief to accept. Once that's a given though, it provides one of the best actual mysteries in the series, and I kept wondering until the very end.   


 (3) Faithful Place: The mystery is a bit too banal for my taste, but it is nice to get to know one of the more interesting supporting characters from The Likeness a bit better. French is at her best when writing believable human relationships, and the fact that the protagonist does not have a stable partner in this one kind of  steers her away from her own strengths. It still has some amazing  moments with the whole dysfunctional family of the protagonist, and a marvelous description of working class Dublin.   


 (4) Broken Harbor: Next to The Likeness, this one has the mystery I enjoyed the most in the entire series. It kept me guessing until the end, and we once more get to see a pair of detectives (one of them a jaded veteran, and one a rookie) trying to crack a case together, which paired with a great plot with some really painful social commentary on the economic crash and social expectations facing middle class youth makes for one of the highlights of the series.   


 (5) Secret Place: I think (as I said above) French made a mistake trying to tell the story  from two separate viewpoints. It does not leave enough space to really  delve into the protagonist's psyche, leaving him a bit underdeveloped compared to  previous leads. It is not a huge problem, since he returns in The Tresspasser, but it sticks out. The teenage slang the girls use is also annoying sometimes and the supernatural angle is a bit tacked-on, but it is still a compelling  book in it's own right, but it's definitely the weakest of the series. Don't skip it though, because The Tresspasser continues with the same pair of detectives, but the role of protagonist shifts.   


 (6) Some have said that it was at this point that French started copping on the fact that in real life, cops are not always the good guys (the writing of the book coincided with an increased awareness of many social justice issues worldwide) and according to these voices, it is the reason she stopped telling her books from the police perspective (her latest two books are stand alone). I tend to agree, as the main topics of the book are bullying, power struggles, and hushing up problems within the murder squad. The story won't be to everyone's liking, because it contains numerous red herrings, but has the single best and most powerful ending in the entire series. It is morally ambiguous, touching and relatable at the same time.

igg15c,"A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce","I'm making a habit of discussing the books I've read on here with you guys, it's always fun.

I just finished *A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man* by James Joyce, and enjoyed it quite a bit! I think as a 20 y/o who is alienated from their own nationality and trying to figure out my shit for the rest of life this read was really quite comforting to read. Watching Stephen mature and decide for himself to subvert the church or any kind of national obligation (like learning Irish) was a breath of fresh air.

This is the first Joyce novel I've read, and his narrative style was something I haven't quite encountered yet. This interesting blend of stream-of-consciousness and real conversations. Also, following characters as they move through an environment, enountering new characters along the way to join in on conversations which would then morph into memories or internal monologues were quite tricky to navigate  but it was really smoothly executed.

The opening chapters where Stephen is still a boy were soaked with a kind of awe for the world around him, and Joyce's ability to capture that sense of wonder, by zooming in on small details of the physical world made the environment really vivid and beautiful, it reminded me of myself as a child always asking questions to my parents, and silently watching people interacting in my mom's office and so on... 

The section in the middle where Stephen's growing personality collides with the external world of religion was maybe the most challenging for me to get through; this endless sermon of hell was really quite excruciating haha. I think it was difficult for me to relate to this but still the passion with which the dialogue is written is really great, and once it swapped back to Stephen's perspective on the matters at hand I found it really brilliant.

I think by far my favourite section was the final third of the book, in which Stephen is having long conversations on his philosophies of aesthetics and what he now firmly believes; it was kind of cathartic in the sense that he had become the man he is, rather than sumbissing to the church and becoming a priest... 

This book was interesting, it isn't standard in its use of characters or plot or narration, I think I'm still trying to make sense of some of it. His dialogue with one of his friends at the end of chosing an isolated existence of devotion to art, and beauty was also curious, in a sense it seems akin to a priestly devotion, but to his own religion, something I hope to find one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/igg15c/a_portrait_of_the_artist_as_a_young_man_james/,2020-08-25 16:53:26,8,21,books
cqiai0,"The man who laughs, a moving and exciting novel","  

The man who Laughing is a novel of Victor Hugo published in 1869. The action of this novel takes place in England between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, and relates to several characters: Gwynplaine, Dea, Ursus and his wolf Homo, Josiane, Barkilphedro and David Dirry-Moir.

The first character of which the reader is acquainted is Ursus, a philosopher tramp who travels all over England to sell potions, and who holds firm to his freedom. His domestic wolf, Homo, accompanies him on his travels around the country. During one of them, they cross on their way Gwynplaine. Abandoned by the ""comprachicos"" (understand the ""buyers of children""), this young boy of about ten years fight alone against a snow storm during a cold night of January. As he searches for civilization back to Portland Island, Gwynplaine discovers a baby alone in the snow and warms him up against his cheek. Determined to save this baby, the boy resumed his journey to try to find refuge with the inhabitants. It is then that he meets Ursus who decides to shelter him in his trailer. It is only the next day that Ursus realizes that Gwynplaine's smile is not really a smile; what he thought until now was a simple grimace of the child is in fact a mutilation of his face made by the ""comprachicos"". As for the baby that Gwynplaine saved, he realizes that he is blind.

Fifteen years later, we find Ursus who managed to set up a theater troupe with the two children he took under his wing. Dea, the newborn baby found and collected by Gwynplaine, is now a 16-year-old girl. Together, this couple presents a play that meets with great success, especially thanks to the mutilated face of Gwynplaine that arouses the general hilarity of the audience. Dea is 16 and Gwynplaine is hopelessly, chastely, purely and idealistically in love with her. She, being blind, is not repulsed by the sight of his grotesque grin. This love is presented by Victor Hugo as a positive value, in contrast with the crass and immoral world that surrounds them.

The novel has one of the best plot twist in the literature. A very exciting and moving novel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cqiai0/the_man_who_laughs_a_moving_and_exciting_novel/,2019-08-15 00:13:51,4,8,books
38q280,Anyone else notice the similarities between Pale Fire and the movie Beetlejuice?,"I was reading Pale Fire and came across these stanzas in the third cantos:
(I.P.H: Institute for Preparation of the Hereafter)

>Instead
The Institute assumed it might be wise
Not to expect too much of paradise:
What if there's nobody to say hullo
To the newcomer, no reception, no
Indoctrination? What if you are tossed 
Into a boundless world, your bearings lost,
Your spirit stripped and utterly alone,
Your task unfinished, your despair unknown,
Your body just beginning to putresce,
A non-undressable in morning dress,
Your widow lying prone on a firm bed,
Herself a blur in your dissolving head!

>While snubbing gods, including the big G,
Iph borrowed some peripheral debris
From mystic visions; and it offered tips
(The amber spectacles for life's eclipse)--
How not to panic when you're made a ghost:
Sidle and slide, choose a smooth surd, and coast,
Meet solid bodies and glissade right through,
Or let a person circulate through you.
How to locate in blackness, with a gasp,
Terra the Fair, an orbicle of jasp.
How to keep sane in spiral types of space.
Precautions to be taken in the case
Of freak reincarnation: what to do
On suddenly discovering that you
Are now a young and vulnerable toad
Plump in the middle of a busy road,
Or a bear cub beneath a burning pine,
Or a book mite in a revived divine.

flh94d,What the h*ck is up with the ending of The Lathe of Heaven??,"Okay. Chapter 9. Orr has a different dream. He meets an alien who teaches him a magic word. He regains his stability of mind, ""He was back where he belonged"". He wakes up and tells Haber He cannot let him continue to use his dreams. He stands firm and confident for the first time in the novel. Haber gives him an ultimatum: be back here tomorrow or else. He replies, defiant: ""I'll come."" I got shivers from that line.

In my mind this was a clear setup for the final confrontation, Orr has learned to control his dreams, but not in the same sense that Haber controls them. A more holistic, Taoist sort of control, which is much more Ursula's style. Haber is destroyed by his own hubris, the world is restored to some acceptable level of normalcy, Orr and Lelache live happily ever after.

Chapter 10. 

Actually George has not gained confidence or control or anything of the sort. He wanders around feeling lost, disconnected from reality. He talks to another alien, this encounter adds nothing new to his understanding of his condition. Back home he falls asleep to a Beatles record and dreams Lelache back into existence. Ok. ""everyone needs a little help from their friends"" is a nice message. This is fine.

They go to Haber's office. This is it. As Haber puts him under, Orr mutters his magic word. And then.... Nothing. He wakes up, Haber's induction worked, he has done away with Orr's power, and now has the ability to reproduce it in himself. The magic word did nothing, sure, it summoned Lelache, but she is sitting there doing nothing! And then, Orr and Lelache JUST WALK OUT OF THE OFFICE. What? The fuck? Orr knows perfectly well what he's going to do with that power. And he just leaves. Before they're even out of the building, reality starts crumbling around them. We get that awesome sequence of Orr fighting the nightmare to get to the machine and shut it down.

And that's that. 

Haber is a mad scientist whose mad creation destroys him. Textbook poetic justice. But he takes everyone else down with him! We all get to live in Haber's mangled world! Ursula teases us with another scene of Orr going to sleep, but it's true, his power is really gone. We get the happily ever after with Lelache, but the world is broken and Orr learned nothing. Also Lelache doesn't have the memories from the other timelines, so Orr gets to live the rest of his life carrying that burden alone. Yay.

I really wish we'd gotten some kind of symbolic victory for Orr... Haber puts him under. he mutters the word. Haber is making speeches at Lelache as the world starts changing around them. He tries desperately to fiddle with his machines, but they disappear before his eyes...

OR, how about this, Haber succeeds, Orr does lose the power. That actually puts a neat little bow on the story. But! As he leaves the office, he uses the alien words to plant an induction in Haber's mind, as they exit the building reality is restored back to normal, *cool guys don't look at explosions* style.

OR, what if Lelache actually had some meaningful role to play in this climax? What if her heavy purse and bangles and stuff turned out to be a Chekhov's gun, and she bunks Haber in the head with them? I think we could have used some more physicality and humor in the ending.

I don't know! I just really got this weird feeling about the last two chapters. Like she had written the book up to Ch.9 and then came back years later and wrapped it up for the publishers. I was very bewildered.

zyl85v,"I read ""Notes from the Underground"" and ""The Catcher in the Rye"" back to back","I decided to cap off 2022 by reading these two books as I thought it would be interesting to see how they compare and contrast. I looked over both synopsis and I figured they'd be pretty similar seeing as how they are both first person narrated books where the main character is anti-social and a prostitute plays an important role in the narrative.

Upon actually reading both of the books however I found out that the two books are trying to do two different things.

So I'll start off with the first book I read ""Notes from the Underground"" by Dostoevsky. For the record I read the Oxford World Classics version translated by Jane Kentish, I don't know what or how different this translation is from the more common Constance Garnett translation but I felt it was important to at least point it out in case I talk about stuff that is different from Garnett's translation. 

First thing I'll say, yo this book is hard to read. Even though this book normally is around 140 pages (the OWC version I have is formatted to be around 120 pages) I'm pretty sure it still took me a longer time to read this book than it did for me to read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and that book is 60 more pages. For people who haven't read ""Notes from the Underground"" and don't know what I'm talking about, let me say that one time I was reading the first part of the book and I see that the text of a paragraph is continuing on the page I turn over, I then notice that the entire page is still this same paragraph, and then I look at the page next to it only to see that too is still the same paragraph that had begun 2 pages ago. Two entire whole pages of a wall of text, I was like ""yo Dostoevsky calm down"". 

""Notes from the Underground"" is a novella that is seperated into two parts. The first part of this book is complete insanity with it being a man writing a paradoxical and nonsensical philosophy for 50 pages straight. The OWC version that I'm reading comes with a nice explanatory notes index going into all the references that Dostoevsky was making. The point of this part of the book is that it's meant to be, at least how I interpreted it, to be a brutal satire of the intellectuals that Dostoevsky hung out with that eventually lead to him getting thrown in jail. It's also a self-deprecating satire of a more extreme version of Dostoevsky himself. It's a lot to take in. 

The second part of ""Notes"" is a couple of stories involving the narrator (who is commonly referred to as the underground man) when he was a younger man in his 20's. The point of these stories is to show the narrator's delusional line of thinking and narcissism, how he tends to make a big thing out of nothing, and generally how he's a massive loser. The big climax of the book is him ending up with a prostitute, essentially giving the prostitute a ted talk about the problems with her line of work, and her simply responding that he ""talks like a book"". It's brutal. ""Notes"" is meant to be brutal in it's take down of intellectuals in 1800's russia. 

So while ""Notes from the Underground"" is a satire of intellectuals in mid 1800s russia, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is more of a look at teenage depression, or if you really want to stretch out it's relevance, a look at how post WW2 America didn't really handle PTSD all that well. 

I never read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" in school. Wasn't assigned it, I was assigned ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" but never ""The Catcher in the Rye"". So this was my first time reading it as a 32 year old man. 

The style of the book was irritating. I didn't think it added anything to the overall experience. I'm saying I didn't like the style of the book. 

I know, I know, everyone has made similar jokes like that before but hey I just read the damn thing can you blame me? But one of the first things you notice about the book is how stylish it is and it just got on my nerves. I get what the book is trying to convey, I really do, but I just felt like Holden needed an editor in the damn asylum or something. 

I feel like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a book that's more interesting to talk about than it is to actually read. Like it's interesting to notice the cultural significance of it, how it effected the boomer generation, how it was probably the catalyst of the hippie movement of the 1960's when they misinterpreted one of Holden's delusions as an elegant lifestyle, but the book is just so ehhhh. Not reading it all these years I thought the book was going to be more philosophical and less whiny but maybe I just saw all the glowing praise for it, how so many influential boomers said it was their favorite book, that when I did finally read it I was set up for disappointment. It's not a terrible book, but it's a book about a time firmly in the past. 

It is funny, however, that it was banned all over the place, even though the book doesn't really have that many controversial ideas nowadays. Here's a good example:

""Notes from the Underground"" - Criticism of Chernyshevsky's idea of the Crystal Palace: I sleep

""The Catcher in the Rye"" - Say that Jesus wasn't the best at picking his disciples: REAL SHIT

This is truly the society we live in... Say one thing that would upset evangelicals in the 1950's and you go down in history as having one of the most ""controversial"" books of all time. 

I think that's also the main difference between them, Dostoevsky's ""Notes"" is a lot more indepth a lot more challenging, while Sallinger's ""Rye"" is a lot more approachable and relatable. People go through trauma and feel depressed, so it's easy to see why that story latched itself onto the public consciousness; for me though I just wish it was more interesting and had more to chew on. I guess I just prefer books that have 50 pages of paradoxical philosophy over a teenager calling everyone a phony.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zyl85v/i_read_notes_from_the_underground_and_the_catcher/,2022-12-30 00:13:01,5,4,books
ao7xod,Is there a problem with how YA Authors view the concept of self?,"I've been writing YA for a while now, and I want to present a core idea of the book I'm writing, just to see if people agree with me.

The main problem I see with YA Fantasy is the notion of 'self', which seemingly abandons the 'Be who you want to be' ideal and focuses on how the character is different.  Percy Jackson is the son of Poseidon, Harry Potter is the boy who lived, etc. etc.

Note here how, in the above two examples, this abnormality is entirely outside of the character's control.  They have no choice on whether or not to be different, rather, they are inherently different by merely being.  Continuing on, the revelation about their uniqueness usually comes with a revelation about the world, that there is a secret world where their uniqueness is considered a net positive.  They are told that their true self, who they should aspire to be, is based off this uniqueness that they knew nothing about, straight up told their meaning for existence by the end of Act 2 at the latest.

I find this quite disconcerting, for several reasons, primarily because of real world counterparts.  There are a lot of shit people can't change about themselves: sexual orientation, gender disposition, and even if you believe those are choices (which I firmly don't), people do not get to choose their skin color or whether or not they have a mental disorder.  These books, if taken literally, insinuate that these should be one's defining character traits, which doesn't apply in the real world.

So yeah, I want to tackle these two philosophies (the one before about how you can be whoever you want to be, and the one I just explained, that you are what makes you unique), through the lenses of people who have grown up in these circumstances, or just learned about that they were unique, and show their failings, and hopefully present some sort of hybrid as a solution.

So yeah, I'm just asking to see if anyone else thinks the same way I do, or if you don't, why not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ao7xod/is_there_a_problem_with_how_ya_authors_view_the/,2019-02-07 20:07:44,4,13,books
7qwk4g,"Michael Faber's ""The Book of Strange New Things""","Spoilers ahead. You have been warned.

Has anyone read this? I just finished it last night. Had picked up a galley copy at a local book cafe and thought it looked fascinating. It pulled me in, but I had several burning questions from early on that were not not only never answered, but never acknowledged. It made me feel like the author didn't have a firm grasp on human psychology, which is bizarre given how well-respected Faber is and how good his characters are.

My biggest problem was how unbelievably incurious Peter is. He vaguely asks for more information (about USIC, about Oasis, about the aliens) a few times, but never once pushes for it. Once he meets the Oasans, he takes their fanatic worship at face value, never questioning why they're so enraptured by Jesus or actually *anything at all* about their society. He makes a few half-hearted attempts to ask if they're male or female, totally ignoring the ridiculous assumption that aliens would have a typical human gender binary. He *never once* asks about their biology--if he had, the twist about Oasans not healing wouldn't have been a surprise, and he could have gotten valuable information for USIC. He only starts trying to learn their language 3/4 of the way through the book, for god's sake!  

A lot of this can be explained by the fact that he was chosen by USIC at all. (Which, come on, could you write a more boring twist than ""everyone here was hired because they're boring""?) But I feel there was a basic human element lacking in all the human characters, except Bea and Grainger. 

I'm kind of ranting I guess. Typing about this made me realize how frustrated I actually am at this book. I absolutely love the idea of a corporation quietly starting a colony because they believe Earth is collapsing, but I think it was poorly-executed. 

My final critique probably isn't valid, as it's kind of the point of the book. But Faber managed to write a story about exploration, discovery, destruction and faith that contains almost no emotion at  all, besides Bea's messages beamed from Earth and Grainger's refreshingly human outbursts. No catharsis, no answers, no tying together of threads. 

Honestly, before writing this I thought I'd liked this book. Now I'm not so sure.

84ivn5,"The Sot-Weed Factor- discussion, thoughts, a question","I just finished The Sot-Weed Factor yesterday, it took me about two-months, but I read the last 200 pages in three days and to be honest I am thinking in the parlance of a late-17th century Englishman/Marylander, not even kidding the style of the novel is firmly inside my head at the minute.  This novel just blew me away- first of all it is quite possibly the funniest book I've ever read (Smith/Burlingame journals is probably the single funniest thing I've ever read), the layers to the humor are unreal, I even loved the extremely clever chapter descriptions.  The book was also one of the dirtiest I've read, but all the dirt is hidden in flowery prose and classical/biblical allusions (eg. me looking up the sin of onan to find out he's making a joke about pulling out).  The jokes were not extraneous at all, however, rather they fed the extremely complex but air-tight plot.  I would love to see what a plot diagram would look like, I'm just in awe of how the author was able to tie everything into together, including the historical backdrop of the novel.  I love the idea of presenting American history, or any history really, from a, umm, grittier, perspective.  Honestly, yes the book is funny and over-the-top, but I'm starting to see the value in looking at history not only from textbooks, but also from an angle where the people were actually people, and, you know, got wasted, brawled, stepped on each other's necks for even the slightest personal gain, gave each other STD's, etc.  I really think the irreverent tone about the nation's settlement brings value to thinking about history and indeed current events, just how the world works.  I'm kind of just rambling, unlike the author of the book, I have no idea where to start or end, but I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts.

I did also have a question for others who have read (spoilers incoming)- did ebenezer and Anna have sex after they got captured by pirates at the end?  I didn't exactly follow what happened, and I think the text at least leaves it ambiguous.  If anybody could shed any light it would be much-appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/84ivn5/the_sotweed_factor_discussion_thoughts_a_question/,2018-03-15 01:42:44,7,7,books

We were once sitting in a bar when a group of tough Austrian lads came in. They had had a bit too much to drink and saw these two actors sitting there and started making loud comments about us and our sexuality - all in perfect English. We just sat there, ignoring them, nodding away and chatting. They ratcheted up the invective, but we hung in there and kept our cool, which seemed to rile them even more. Of course what they didn't know was that sitting all around us at the other tables was our entire stunt team, just waiting for us to give them the nod. After about ten minutes, the Austrians could take it no longer, pushed back their chairs and squared up to us. They wanted a fight. Omar and I stood up, too--they must have thought, blimey, these actors have got some guts--but then the stunt team stood up--and, well, I'm afraid there was a bit of a ruckus and some of those Austrians ended up being thrown out of windows that were firmly shut.

pjnjri,Joanna Kavenna's 'Zed' is the contemporary successor to Brave New World and 1984,"This week's regularly scheduled 1984 post reminded me of this great book I'd recently read, and I figured I'd talk about it a bit. 

Most people who read or have read dystopian fiction are familiar with 1984 and Brave New World. While neither of them match completely with the state of the world today, both books have several elements can be seen in our society, making them quite popular. I believe Joanna Kavenna's Zed is this generation's 'update', so to speak, of the dystopian hellscape that both these books have demonstrated in the past, and it is far more relatable than its predecessors.

Considering how 1984 and BNW were written far before the advent of modern technology and communications infrastructure, the narratives, while prescient to some extent, don't really translate well to our world of instant digital connection and gratification. Enter Zed, which portrays a world which takes all the various problematic elements of the modern digital sphere, and extrapolates them into their logical worst outcomes. 

The world is essentially run by a few megacorporations, with most of the focus on the western megacorp: an amalgam of Google's breadth of digital services, Apple's hardware/wearable tech and ecosystem, and Facebook's analytics and profiling algorithms: a delicious cake iced generously with artifically intelligent personal assistants a la Siri/Google Assistant/Alexa. There are elements of the Minority Report in here as well, as these predictive algorithms can be so accurate as to reliably report what a person will do over the next day. 

AR/VR digital spaces enable virtual-real interaction between people across the planet, and these interactions can be digitally filtered to present yourself in exactly the way you wish. Heavily armed humanoid drones enforce the peace, driven by behavioural algorithms that allow them to 'evaluate' interactions with humans, and respond as required. The world is harmonious and chugs along without issue, because the algorithm knows all, and the algorithm is never wrong.

Of course, the algorithm begins to fail catastrophically, evidenced by events that are drastic outliers to predicted outcomes: Zed events. Over the course of the story, more and more Zed events pop up across the world, and the megacorp is left scratching their heads. Is the algorithm flawed? Impossible, says the textbook narcissist who serves as their CEO. It is in fact, the people who are no longer acting rationally. It is imperative that they are advised of the error of their ways, and encouraged to behave as the algorithm believes they should. Our intrepid corporate leader takes it upon himself to demonstrate to people just how wrong they are for making the choices they do.

Zed is a lot more relevant to the lives we lead today, seeing as how it was published just two years ago, and it paints a picture of a terrifyingly plausible future where our reliance on tech for greater and greater conveniences leads us to contributing towards the creation of a society where our identities are easily molded, our opinions are decided for us, and any aberration is treated as a failure of the self and not the system. Kavenna writes with tongue planted firmly in cheek in a style reminiscent of Douglas Adams, because the dry sarcasm and abundant tautology are crucial to preventing the subject matter from becoming morbid. You'll have a sensible chuckle when you understand what she's saying, and then the smile melts off your face as you UNDERSTAND what she's saying. Her prose is layered and always purposeful, and a slower read will serve you better as you explore this narrative she has compiled.

Zed isn't a masterpiece, just as 1984 and BNW aren't really, but it is an excellent dark satire that surpasses them, in my opinion. An entertaining cautionary tale that assumes the worst of tech corporations and how their zeal for 'efficiency', 'brand new services' and 'customer interaction' almost always works against the individual in the long term. Several sympathetic characters guide you through this Black Mirror-esque nightmare and a story that engages your curiosity keeps you thinking for a while after, about the long term implications of our modern technological platform.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pjnjri/joanna_kavennas_zed_is_the_contemporary_successor/,2021-09-07 13:56:26,8,15,books

Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  
>  
>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

**Best Debut of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fxcbo7/best_debut_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi - nominated by /u/okiegirl22

>Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of *Homegoing* follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, *Homegoing* makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.

2nd place: *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/baddspellar

>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. By all rights their paths should never cross, but Achilles takes the shamed prince as his friend, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.  
>  
>Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.

**1st place:** *Circe* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/honeyiamsorry

>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  
>  
>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.  
>  
>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

2nd place: *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante - nominated by /u/SinoJesuitConspiracy

>My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.

3rd place: *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara - nominated by /u/Scurvy_Dogwood

>  
>Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love.

**Best Short Story Collection of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gag0qp/best_short_story_collection_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Tenth of December* by George Saunders - nominated by /u/rjbman

>In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of *Tenth of December* are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.

2nd place: *Exhalation: Stories* by Ted Chiang - nominated by /u/amyousness

>This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate,"" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ""Exhalation,"" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""  
>  
>In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

3rd place: *Homesick for Another World* by Ottessa Moshfegh - nominated by /u/ApollosCrow

>There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. *Homesick for Another World* is a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and *Homesick for Another World* is her *Everything That Rises Must Converge* or *A Good Man is Hard to Find*. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources, and the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp. The needle hits the vein before we even feel the prick.

**Best Horror of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ger39o/best_horror_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer - nominated by /u/Bennings463

>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In *Annihilation*, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's *Southern Reach Trilogy*, we join the twelfth expedition.  
>  
>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

2nd place: *The Fisherman* by John Langan - nominated by /u/ifthisisausername

>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman's Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.

3rd place: *My Best Friend's Exorcism* by Grady Hendrix - nominated by /u/leowr

>Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since fifth grade, when they bonded over a shared love of E.T., roller-skating parties, and scratch-and-sniff stickers. But when they arrive at high school, things change. Gretchen begins to act….different. And as the strange coincidences and bizarre behavior start to pile up, Abby realizes there’s only one possible explanation: Gretchen, her favorite person in the world, has a demon living inside her.

**Best Non-Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0jyb8/best_nonfiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman - nominated by /u/TriangleTingles

>In the highly anticipated *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.  
>  
>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will transform the way you think about thinking.

2nd place: *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI* by David Grann - nominated by /u/GanymedeBlu35

>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.  
>  
>Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.  
>  
>In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.  
>  
>A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.

3rd place: *Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup* by John Carreyrou - nominated by /u/Flashy-Band

>The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.  
>  
>In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ""unicorn"" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.  
>  
>For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at *The Wall Street Journal,* got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the *Journal* were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.

Happy reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hk3opr/the_rbooks_best_books_of_the_decade_results/,2020-07-02 19:33:27,196,810,books
5kg47a,I see the post about 93 books. I did something different. I have read *no books* in 2016.,"I've been looking at everything in my life to see what I need and what I need to not and one of the things I didn't do this year was read for pleasure.  I avoided all stories that weren't news and mostly read documentation, labels and instructions (in Pest Control you get lots of reading) but *no* fun stories.  This includes no new audio books either.  I *have* allowed myself to listen to audio books of a few things that I've already heavily read to keep it like ""watch that episode again"".  I've even mostly avoided new movies as well.  (Deadpool, had to)

What I've found is that I'm far more distracted by things and paying far more attention to details around me, much more like a nervous habit than being attentive.  My retention in conversations has dropped and I find myself having to rewind youtube videos more often because the words just blur out.   My conversational skills have become *far* sharper than what I would normally engage in and somehow my writing has become more careful and a little more ornate.  The same about my cooking.

My creativity has climbed drastically.  Spontaneous melodies coming from my mouth, almost any combination of sound might remind me of a song from the late 70's and through the 80's and I've found that I've started having trouble reading fine print that wasn't a hassle last year.  

One of the other things that went away was my tolerance for pop music and continuous music in general.   For the first time in my life since I was 6 and found an AM/FM 9v radio I've spent more time without music than with - even turning it off in games and barely ever listening while driving.

Reading was the *only* mental pursuit I removed.  I still do my daily pre-sleep guided imagination themes (space opera, survival, jogging on a wilderness trail) that I learned decades ago to keep my crazy subconscious from feeding me nightmares right off.

So all in all I've become better at being a person, but not a better person from denying myself books.  I've been a little more manipulative and a little more cold with people.  Like I aged 5 years since January.

And in one week I'll start into Discworld (I've watched the movies and know they're weaksauce) to see if I can manage it all in one year.

Its been a strangely disappointing experience and its led me to just sitting thinking about nothing at all for periods of time for the last few months, enough so that my wife has become worried.

This is the first I've told anyone that I've done it.

As discussion I'd ask for anybody to share a period of time of more than a month when they've been literature starved and what changes they noticed - if any - in their personality, daily life and focus of skills.

I believe this fits firmly into /r/books even if it is kind-of psychological.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5kg47a/i_see_the_post_about_93_books_i_did_something/,2016-12-26 22:16:53,14,0,books

22qgs3,Has anyone read the Delirium trilogy and want to discuss it? (Spoilers for all three books inside),"I just finished today and no one I know has read it. It needs to be discussed! (I think)

I really loved the ending, it was poetic, but I felt like I didn't get near enough closure, Lena's last moments with Julian were hectic and rushed, I mean, we didn't know that was the last moment's we'd see with them, but I wanted some kind of closure. I wanna know what happens to him, how does he take Lena choosing Alex? I hope he does it well and finds another love, he was one of my all time favorite characters in the book.

Raven dying was so anticlimactic and the only mention of the original Wilds group is when Lena glimpses Hunter and Bram on the other side of the wall, I wanted to see something more of Tack and the rest. (I liked her description of Coral and the way that whole thing played out however).

I loved that her and Alex are back together, and that they found Grace. But the scene where Grace was shouting ""I didn't mean to!"" as though she was the one who started the fire was confusing. I recognize she probably did it, but again, I just feel like it was so anticlimactic and had no explanation.

Hana is a complicated character too, I was half heartedly hoping for a more firm resolution for her too, where did she go? Did she ever tell anyone about how awful Fred is? And what about Cassie? Does she ever get out of the Crypts?

I felt like the ending was abrupt and left me wanting *way* more but I appreciate the poetic and metaphoric-ness of it. Tearing down the wall was a really good ending, it went well with the descriptions of the cured as being behind a glass wall, muffled and cut off.

xmbk2j,‘Where the crawdads sing’ by Delia Owens – Book vs. Movie,"  

Every quarter that the book has stayed in the NYT best seller list, I have tried to read this book at least once but couldn’t get past initial couple of chapters. But then I came across this advertisement for $3 per ticket for National Cinema Day on September 3rd and the only name that I knew among the listed movies in my local theatre was ‘Where the crawdads sing’. I had some time to spend and I thought it might be interesting to read the book before I watch the movie. And that’s what I did, I completed the book in two days and watched the movie on the day I completed the book. And I must say the experience was truly awesome!

Let me get one thing straight – it was an okey-ish book (6/10) and a mediocre (5/10) movie. And this post is neither about the book nor about the movie but the contrast that I was able to experience between both media.

As I read the book, I had firmed up my imagery about the lead characters’ appearance, their residences, living conditions, the marsh, the swamp, gas station, shops, roads, court, and all that. And as someone who has never been in the area and is not old enough to have seen similar shops or towns, I had no clue how any of this looked like in real life. So, all my imagery was just dreamt up based on the best of my imagination. And when I watched the movie, I was in for a surprise!

**Characters**

The book is clear about the social strata of all the characters and their wealth. It was also clear about how this was reflected in their appearances and dressing sense. Lead character and her family (except for her mom) was portrayed as ‘dirty’ in the book (or so I perceived). But the movie gave them costumes which reflected their wealth status but was still not ‘dirty’. When you wear old handed down cloths, they may look old but not necessarily dirty. 

Another aspect is that movie must assign characters to actors and thus leaving nothing for imagination when it comes to the appearance. This in a way is a good thing because when I read the book, I had a detailed imagination for their clothing, physique, hairstyle etc., but I did not have any faces assigned. First thing that the movie does is to assign faces. If you watch the movie without reading the book, then may be the faces do not come with any pre-assigned emotions. But if you have read the book, then you feel like you know them and you already love or hate them. Then when you meet the characters, you almost feel like saying, “Hi Kya, how are you?” or “Dude, good thing that you are gonna be dead soon”. Also it was interesting to observe how some faces were totally way out of my imagination. 

**Dialogues and conversations**

A considerable part of the book is about the lead character’s thoughts and other conversations. Book can literally be unlimited in its resources to express these, whereas Movie is limited in time and ways to ‘show’ the ‘thoughts’. So, book won in this regard with its ability to let the reader know about the thoughts. And in particular, I felt the movie left out a lot of significant conversations. May be that is where my take on the book is differing from that of the Director/Screenwriter.

**Scenery/Geography**

This is where the movie wins hands down! As I said in the beginning, I have no idea how these marsh or swamp or anything related looked like. I did not know how big a ‘shack’ can be or how it can have water around it and still can have car access. I was thinking of extremely constrained and dingy spaces where it was not possible to have the idea of ‘rooms’. I was way off in imagining how trees, grass, shrubs and water can all be one place. But the movie was an eye opener. The way it has portrayed the whole geography, it was a treat as someone who has never been to anywhere close to all that. I think we are wrong when we say imagination is unlimited (or may be it is just for me). What I could ‘imagine’ about how all the water, marsh, swamp, roads and the ocean was very restrictive without having any past experiences. But the movie just shows it in front of us. Another aspect is the roads/buildings in general infra structure. The moment I hear the years 50’s and 60’s, I imagine them just a cut above the towns portrayed in Clint Eastwood movies. Paved roads instead of dusty roads and motor vehicles instead of horses. But 50’s and 60’s are way closer to our period than to the period of ‘The good/bad/ugly’. (Mental note to self: That movie might have been made in the sixties but it didn’t show the sixties.). There were nicer buildings, running water, electricity and good roads. Of course, ‘visual’ is the strength of the Cinema as a medium and it truly lived up to that.

**Emotions**

This dimension is really interesting! Movie media won in showing the facial expressions, intensity and the physical reactions. It is kind of obvious but the non-verbal expressions are the forte of a visual medium. But the written text is capable of detailing the nuances about what goes ‘within’. If the visual can show *how* a person gets angry, the text wins over in explaining *why* the person is angry. 

In short, I was able to experience the strengths and weaknesses of both media – cinema and novel – by going through this. I don’t think I will recommend either this book or this movie as a standalone experience to anyone but I think if you have the time and inkling, undertaking a project to watch the movie immediately after reading the book is a good idea (Or vice versa. But in that case you already have the imagery and faces to have some prejudice). Godfather was the most notable movie adaptations that I have come across earlier but it is one heavy book and three pretty long movies. So when you pick, I suggest something of a quick read and one single movie.

**TL/DR:** Watched the movie adaptation on the same day I finished the book and it helped me contrasting the take of both media on the same underlying content.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xmbk2j/where_the_crawdads_sing_by_delia_owens_book_vs/,2022-09-23 22:39:47,5,6,books
o8cbpv,Just finished The Witcher series … thoughts?,"I just finished The Witcher book series and I’m curious as to whether people agree…?

I just finished The Witcher series (minus season of storms) after loving the Netflix show. 

Im usually a book first, movie/tvshow after type of girl but after watching the first season of The Witcher on Netflix, I had to get my hands on the books and dive deeper into The Witcher universe. I was somewhat disappointed… 

I started off with the 2 short story books, The Last Wish and Blood of Elves, which was essentially a recap of the 1st season. I didn’t mind them and actually quite enjoyed seeing the dynamic of Geralt + Ciri as they meet earlier on than the Tv show portrayed. I think this made their reunion at the end of blood of elves more meaningful, and excited me to begin the offical series. 

Like starting any new book series I was waiting for the moment to come where I felt as though I couldn’t put the book down; that up all night, page turning type of read.. but it never came. I think that was my main issue with the series is that I felt as though I could put it down whenever I wanted and I didn’t have the urge to pick the book up again. It was more of a get through this to find out what happens type of read. 

The start of the first book began with Geralt and Ciri in Kaer Morhen, with Ciri in Witcher-training mode. I thought this was epic. We had already read about Geralts adventures as a Witcher and the thought of him training his child of surprise as his protégée, a female Witcher made me believe the rest of the series would lead to some tag team monster slaying action packed adventures between Geralt and Ciri. But unfortunately that never came. I understand that Ciri used a lot of her Witcher training and abilities throughout her storyline but the only moment which made me feel thrilled about her training was in Lady of the Lake where she uses the pendulum technique Geralt taught her to defeat Bonhart. 

In fact, I was even disappointed in Ciri’s ability to use the magic that Yennifer taught her, in most of the series. Ciri was talked up as this powerful, promising being that everyone was after, and it turns out that they only wanted her for her future child… which never even happened (not that I wanted it to). It just felt to me like that Sapjowski had this witty, epic character, with Elven blood, magical abilities, and Witcher training, and decided to have her whole plot based around running away from people who were trying to capture her to use her for her womb. Ciri, as a character is great, she’s strong and went through so much, but I just feel as though there was a lack of direction in her plot. Which brings me to my next point… the plot. 

It just felt underwhelming. The whole plot was basically this massive road trip of Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer trying to find their way back to each other against the back drop of political power plays and an ongoing war.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, it sounds great, however, I just felt that instead of it being intense, and leaving the reader on the edge of their seat, it was dragged out with a lot  of tedious nothings in between. 

I guess after watching the first season of the show, my expectations were different/higher than what the book’s presented. I expected this quest of Ciri, a trained Witcher and sorceress, reclaiming her throne and avenging her grandmother. And whilst she did go on quite the adventure, and experienced getting revenge (on Bonhart), it was not how I was expecting it to go down. 

I was also quite confused at a lot of the characters/countries/language as I felt like when new characters were introduced, it seemed as though Stokowski expected us to know who this character was, without giving any context. Usually, I don’t mind, and ah e read other books where this happens, but in this instance, it seemed like he would name drop 10 characters in 1 paragraph, only to never mention them again. 

I read somewhere that people seemed to have an issue with the non-linearity of the storyline and the different worlds but I actually didn’t mind this so much. I like when authors do weird things that make you think, “where the fuck did that come from?” It seemed a bit strange, that a few books in we all of a sudden hear about these other worlds, fantasy worlds, our worlds, the future and the jumps between past and present, but as mentioned I actually didn’t mind it. 

The reunion: The Geralt/Ciri/Yennifer reunion was the best part of the series. It was the moment the readers were waiting for. Accompanied by the squad showdown with Milva, Cahir, Regis and Angeloume vs Bonhart and Vilgefortz was my favourite bit. And yet, even it felt as though it was somewhat rushed. All I kept thinking was that the TV show was going to absolute kill this scene (here’s hoping they get to it) and I couldn’t wait to see the shows portrayal. 

A few questions and comments had about the end. 

Loved the Emhyr/Duny twist. But was a little grossed out about the fact that he still wanted to marry Ciri (I know, I know it’s fantasy but still). And was a little confused at how he just left the real Ciri to be with the fake Ciri, and it was never explained? Like dude just started war and annhilated entire countries to get to Ciri, only to just leave her approx 5 mins after he got her. 

Geralt and Emhyr’s conversation about the Duny revelation and Geralt accepting his fate to die seemed a little un Geralt-like. I was expecting a bit more of a fight, and yet he and Yennifer just got into that tub ready to end it all?! 

And that ending! I don’t mind an open ending but I’m curious as to whether people believe that Yen and Geralt are alive or dead? Geralt remembers being in the boat and Yen was “unconscious” but I see that a lot of people think they died? Thoughts? 

All in all, I think that whilst Stokowski world building was fantastic, I felt as though the plot itself was quite minimal. He did a great job at the characters, and their interactions, but I never got attached, or fell in love with any of the characters (minus dandelion) as I usually do when reading a series, even though I still really liked Yen/Ciri/Geralt. 

As mentioned, I’m a firm believer in the book is always better but in this case I think that the book series serves as a leg for the show to stand on. As seen in the battle of Sodden hill and even the fall of Cintra, I think the show elevates the books and the characters, and really highlights what should have been more intense plots from the books. I’m excited to see how they portray the ratz, Ciri’s cat/mouse chase on the frozen lake, the reunion, the Vilgefortz showdown, and the Bonhart fight. 

Anyway, I’m curious as to what your thoughts are on the Witcher book series, and whether you agree/disagree with this review.

5rdypc,Keep the Aspidistra Flying was a fantastic book.,"This has been my favorite book by Orwell thus far. It was obvious after the first chapter. The line when he says ""Because how can you buy anything with a three penny bit? It isn't a coin, it's the answer to a riddle."" was the moment I fell in love. 

Gordon Comstock was such a phenomenal character. He took on so much in the world through fighting the system and gaining nothing from it because he was trying to achieve exactly nothing. He was trying to live his life outside the bounds of ""money-society"" scrounging for enough for cigarettes and food and being constantly enthused that he was living by his own powerful convictions. The commentary on capitalism and the ""money-god"" put forth by Orwell were so enthralling and still 100 percent relevant today, like so much of his work.

His illustration of differences in understanding between levels in the class system was so well written. Ravelston's lack of understanding that he could buy meals to send to Gordon in jail set next to the pub owner purchasing a meal to give to the others was amazing and ironic. When Gordon drags Ravelston along to pick up prostitutes was probably the best example of this. Every time that Ravelston and Gordon are seen together there is a sort of silent comfort. Ravelston never seems quite out of his element. Sometimes lacking a little understanding but never truly uncomfortable.

The end was bittersweet, though. He sacrificed his convictions though it was for a good reason. Rosemary got pregnant so he decided to reenter the money-world. Pretty cut and dry. Even though I am aware that it was a literary device I didn't appreciate the fact that he tossed ""London Pleasures"" down the sewer. It was absolutely symbolic of him trying to destroy his former self. He believed that he could only live firmly in one class or the other which he learned pretty quickly was wrong when Rosemary was adamantly against getting an Aspadistra. I guess it turned out that life wasn't as soul crushing as he thought it was going to be.

This is an amazing book. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a literary adventure about a normal guy.

BONUS: I made a post about Animal Farm a couple weeks ago. People got pretty wacky about me saying that Orwell was too intelligent to think Socialism could work anywhere but on paper. I am compiling a list of examples where he says exactly that in his books. I will make a wicked cool post once I have finished with his entire works.

10i5cyp,The Lantern Bearers (Roman trilogy) by Rosemary Sutcliff,"Here are some of my thoughts after finishing *The Lantern Bearers*, the third volume in Sutcliff's Roman Britain trilogy. (*The Eagle of the Ninth* has long been a favourite of mine, and I read *The Silver Branch* right before *The Lantern Bearers*.)

Wow, what a incredible, sweeping tale this was! Sutcliff's ability to seamlessly weave her own characters into the backdrop of established history/folklore is impressive. Re-visiting the well-known tales of Vortigern, Hengest, Rowena, Ambrosius, etc. through the eyes of Aquila was a very interesting experience. I actually found myself looking back at Henrietta Marshall's *Our Island Story*, where I first encountered these stories as a child (I think Marshall stuck with me more than later readings from Bede, Geoffrey of Monmouth, etc.!). Of course there are many versions of these tales, and I loved the intricate little details Sutcliff inserted, such as the section describing Rowena preparing the poisoned hawking glove to kill Vortimer. I also loved the idea of Aquila starting a legend by lighting Rutupiae beacon for the last time after the Eagles had sailed...the idea that so many others saw it and took it as a sign of hope was beautiful. And finally, the terrible fate that befell Aquila just a couple chapters into the book reminded me of Esca's fate before the events of *The Eagle of the Ninth* \-- the wheel of fate has indeed come round, and our Roman protagonist is now the one whose family is killed/captured by invaders and he himself is made a slave!

Things that surprised me / made me wish they were different:

* Flavia, Flavia, Flavia! I fully share Aquila's grief and sense of betrayal when Flavia refuses to run away with him and take her child along. Of course I wouldn't have wanted her to commit suicide after being taken by the Saxon giant, but I would have certainly wanted her to seize the opportunity to re-unite with her brother and escape with him. Her loyalty to her ~~husband~~ rapist (who was part of the band that killed her father and destroyed her home and abducted her brutally) was not something I could sympathise with, and this Stockholm syndrome was just too much for me.

&#x200B;

* Based on the previous two books, I expected Aquila would find a close companion who would become his ""partner in crime"", forming a duo just like Marcus and Esca, or Justin and Flavius. Marcus and Esca were soul ""brothers"" not related by blood, and Justin and Flavius were cousins, so I actually hoped that the third book would feature even an more closely connected pair: Aquila and Flavia who were actual siblings! I really hoped Aquila would rescue Flavia and they'd become a team for the rest of the novel in their quest for revenge. But alas, instead of giving us a strong female lead who would risk her life to rejoin her brother and contribute to the Romano-British resistance against the Saxons, Sutcliff gives us a woman who is so attached to her rapist and her comfortable new Saxon life that she chooses said rapist over her beloved brother who has risked everything to find her! But breaking the pattern of having a duo of main characters is perhaps what makes *The Lantern Bearers* so poignant...Aquila's loneliness and bitterness is highlighted all the more, making his journey to finding some peace at the end even more touching and redemptive.

&#x200B;

* I think Ness' situation is very different to Flavia's, and while there are certainly parallels in terms of being forced into an unwanted marriage, I disagree with the notion that their fates and ultimate choices to stay with their husband are essentially the same. Ness' arranged marriage was what happened to basically all girls in those days, and even happens now in some cultures where girls don't get to choose whom they marry, often having to leave behind broken-hearted secret lovers like Ness did. (Not saying this is right in my opinion, but it was ""standard"" practice back then.) Ness was honourably married, with her father's full consent, to the man who saved her father's life, and she knew that her husband too was marrying her under orders from his boss Ambrosius, for the sake of strengthening a political alliance. Flavia, on the other hand, was violently seized by a man whose family had just slaughtered her father and destroyed her home forever and taken her as his share of the spoils of looting and ravaging -- certainly not the same thing!

&#x200B;

* I really wish Minnow and Mull could have met each other at the end! It would have been an interesting meeting between two young men of similar age who look very much alike, yet are on opposing sides of the battle. An absurdly optimistic part of me hopes that Mull will ask his mother to tell him more about her past when he's back home, and Flavia will reluctantly tell him after he gives her Aquila's message. Mull's harsh nature will already have been somewhat softened by his realising how selflessly Aquila rescued and protected him. After learning the whole truth about how his mother was coerced into marrying his Saxon father (I hope that brute died in the battle already!) whose family murdered hers, Mull will have a change of heart and feel disgusted by his Saxon family, and want to seek out the uncle who saved his life. In a few years, he will have made it back to Aquila in some way (perhaps even dragging a widowed Flavia along), and will meet Minnow and instantly become best friends with him.

All in all, I have to say that *The Eagle of the Ninth* remains my firm favourite, surpassing *The Silver Branch* and *The Lantern Bearers* by miles. Some reasons I think this is the case:

* Narrower scope and focus on the main characters Marcus and Esca and their relationship. Their companionship is just so magical and special, given their conflicting backgrounds. Esca's devotion to Marcus, despite Marcus being Roman, as well as Marcus' treating Esca like a brother from day one really shows the power of love/friendship which goes beyond national identities and politics. The plot centres them and is fully driven by them, unlike *The Silver Branch* and *The Lantern Bearers* where Sutcliff's own characters are caught up in a much larger political drama, with lots of other people including well-known names like Carausius, Allectus, Ambrosius, Vortigern, etc. who existed outside Sutcliff's imagination. *The Eagle of the Ninth* truly feels like Marcus and Esca's personal story at every point in time, whereas the following books often feel like larger stories where Sutcliff's heroes are just playing a small part. So overall, *The Eagle of the Ninth* just feels more intimate and unique, and thus more impactful to me, although its scope is very narrow compared to the vast scope of the later books.

&#x200B;

* The ending of *The Eagle of the Ninth* indicates major life changes and and new hopes in a way very different from the following two books. I like the fact that Marcus is no longer a soldier, and is sympathetic to the native British peoples. (This is why I was really surprised that his descendants in later books would be so committed to joining the Roman army and propagating imperialism! How could kids growing up in a household with Esca and Cottia even dream of taking up Roman arms? I would have imagined more peaceful careers, such as healers, farmers, businessmen, teachers, etc., though they'd be very athletic kids and well-trained by Marcus and Esca in fighting for self-defence!) Anyway, the ending of *The Eagle of the Ninth* beckons towards a totally new life as Marcus starts his own farm with his chosen family, whereas in *The Silver Branch*, Justin and Flavius go back to serving in the army, just under a new ruler, and in *The Lantern Bearers* Aquila continues fighting under Ambrosius.

Whew! That was an enormous post! Happy to hear other's thoughts on these wonderful books, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Sutcliff's works!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10i5cyp/the_lantern_bearers_roman_trilogy_by_rosemary/,2023-01-21 23:48:33,2,4,books
7vq0tb,Has anybody read NO EXCUSES! The Power of Self-Discipline by Brian Tracy? Two-thirds through and confused.,"So at the dawn of 2018 I decided to start a resolution of **""a book a month""**, you know *enlightenment* and all that, I read a lot, but mostly articles and studies, the pocket app told me I read an equivalent of 12 books in 2017, so I thought why not give actual books a try.

See the trouble is, it's always been tricky with me and books, I've only ever read The Hunger Games Trilogy and I did it in 3 days(Suzan brought me in hook, line, and sinker.) 
I tried a lot of books, Harry Potter, The Fault in our stars, Robinson Crusoe, Wuthering Heights, Agatha Christie and much more, yet for all of them two chapters in, I'd put the book down and it would gather dust. On the other hand, I would read ridiculous amounts of articles and some massive articles that would border on books themselves, (in multiple fields too, medicine, psychiatry, tech, physics, or even self-help and blog posts)

Anyway, so I figured Discipline was my trouble and I just had to push through (It troubles me in my student life a lot) So I took a firm decision to fix my motivation machine and discipline myself to do what I want, not what my instant gratification monkey instructs me too. [This Book seemed just right](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8112865-no-excuses). Overwhelming positive reviews everywhere, so I get it and I push and push.

Two-thirds through I can't help but feel weirded out, this sounds like a cheerleader regurgitating common knowledge transforming me into a materialistic yesman/robot. My personal opinion on success aligns with [Ralph Waldo Emerson's]
(http://quotepixel.com/images/quotes/success/quote-about-success_13985-1.png). (I would **love** to read one of his works)

But this book just won't stop about *""Never stop working"" ""Be superior and richer"" ""Be the top 1%, not a loser""*

While the book has some great quotes and solid advice, some stuff I applied over the past 2 weeks and they have been working great, most of it seems like fluff and fallacious science with catchy ""laws"" and ""rules"". I really appreciate the take responsibility for everything in your life tone throughout the book, but it just sounds cringey.

So I took to read actual reviews, and some of the 1 stars actually resonated with my personal opinion, but the amount of 5 and 4 stars hailing this book as the 2nd coming of Christ was surprising.

So did anybody read it? Want to talk about it?

12ofw98,Mental Health and Suicide: A Journey Through The Midnight Library: An Essay,"  Mental Health and Suicide: A Journey Through *The Midnight Library*

*The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig is a compelling science fiction fantasy novel that tackles the sensitive topics of mental health and suicide. These issues have been explored extensively in literature and all forms of media, and they often prove difficult to present in an unproblematic way. Authors and other creators must be careful to avoid romanticizing mental health struggles or presenting suicide as an appealing strategy. Haig’s novel successfully offers a nuanced, sensitive look at the protagonist’s complex issues. The novel ultimately offers an inspirational, realistic message of redemption, hope, and acceptance.

Haig sets the tone for his novel by prefacing it with a quote from Sylvia Plath (1932 - 1963). She is a literary icon who posthumously became famous for her prolific, confessional writings about her lifelong battles with depression. Plath attempted to take her own life several times, ultimately succeeding at age thirty. In 1982, nineteen years after her death, Plath was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (Ferretter). From her journals, we are presented with a poignant excerpt which foreshadows Nora’s fantastical journey through alternate life paths.

”I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. (Plath)” This quote brilliantly illustrates that depression is not necessarily borne from a hatred of living; rather, despair can just as easily be the result of unfulfilled desires to live life more fully.

Nora Seed, the main character of *The Midnight Library*, echoes similar sentiments throughout the novel: “It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out” (Haig 244).

*The Midnight Library* opens with an intimate look at the fragile state of Nora Seed. From the very first sentence of the novel, the reader is acutely aware of Nora’s ultimate decision to attempt suicide: “Nineteen years before she decided to die, Nora Seed sat in the warmth of the small library at Hazeldene School in the town of Bedford” (Haig 11). 

This in-your-face approach is jarring, but it immediately prepares the reader for what is to come. While some authors might have chosen to ease their audience into the story, Haig instead pulls no punches, choosing to lay all the cards on the table. This one simple choice both helps illustrate the gravity of Nora’s despair and echoes some of the shock of learning someone wants to or has attempted to end their own life.

The novel spends some expository time exploring Nora’s life and inner state before portraying her tragic decision. However, the reader is never left with a nagging sense of “will she or won’t she?” The audience knows where this story is leading, but the ultimate ending remains elusive. Haig’s transparency from the outset of the novel ensures that Nora’s descent toward suicide is not one of romanticized mystery. Instead, he prepares the reader with the facts of the matter, leaving no question about Nora’s ultimate choice. The opening lines of the first eight chapters act as a dreadful countdown to that fateful day, transitioning from a distance of nineteen years from her suicide attempt to counting down the remaining hours.

When Nora tries to kill herself, instead of dying, she awakens in a mysterious place called The Midnight Library. This is a world between worlds, a space that allows her to explore alternate universes. The Midnight Library is reminiscent in some ways of the concept of purgatory, with a fascinating twist: Nora is granted the incredible, otherwise impossible opportunity to explore alternate life paths. The reader follows along on a magical ride throughout several possibilities of paths not taken. 

Another important detail about this mysterious place that sets it apart from a purgatory-type space is that Nora is not alone. She is gently guided through the different worlds by Mrs. Elm, who was her school librarian from her childhood. Mrs. Elm’s character acts as a stable source of strength and support, beautifully illustrating the power of human connection. Like any challenge in life, mental health struggles tend to become all the more difficult when one feels alone. Mrs. Elm’s character serves as the antithesis to isolation, offering a lifeline of hope. This serves as a recurring reminder to the reader that it is necessary and good to reach out for support when needed–and that help may come from the most unexpected of places.

Notably, the depiction of depression and suicide in *The Midnight Library* is not romanticized or glorified in any way. Haig shows in agonizing detail how Nora suffers from regret and despair, eliciting sympathy and understanding from the reader: “She had come to imagine mediocrity and disappointment were her destiny. Indeed, Nora had always had the sense that she came from a long line of regrets and crushed hopes that seemed to echo in every generation” (Haig 126).

For readers who have dealt with their own mental health problems–or those of their loved ones–-Haig’s honest, harrowing portrayal of Nora’s hopelessness may provide some solace. Taking in Nora’s experiences may help them to feel a sense of being seen and understood, and sometimes simply that is enough to begin unlocking the dark doors of despair.

On the other hand, some portrayals of recovery from mental health issues can veer too far in the positive direction, implying life will now be all sunshine and roses. Haig is careful to temper the inspirational moments of his novel with thoughtful reality checks. Toward the end of the novel, Nora muses:

“Will my life be miraculously free from pain, despair, grief, heartbreak, hardship, loneliness, depression? No.

But do I want to live?

Yes. Yes.

A thousand times, yes” (Haig 245).

This perspective is important to keep in mind for anyone working through difficult times. Although it is tempting to imagine some carefree future life which is devoid of woe, that is dangerously unrealistic and only leads to disappointment. Nora’s acknowledgment that life will continue to present challenges offers a necessary dose of wisdom and perspective. This adds a vital level of realism, helping to moderate the reader’s expectations for the journey of healing.

 Haig is also careful to avoid presenting Nora’s experience in the library and beyond as a panacea; she never finds that one elusive thing which will change her life for the better. Instead, each life Nora steps into has its own unique set of challenges and joys. Even in lives where Nora has accomplished lofty goals–such as being an Olympic swimmer or a scientist studying glaciers–she still faces a wide variety of obstacles. Haig portrays the complexity of life’s struggles with empathy, recognizing the multifaceted nature of mental health issues.

The climax of the novel imbues the reader with an infectious sense of strength and hope. Haig brilliantly portrays how dramatically Nora’s perspective has shifted:

“The one truth she had, a truth she was now proud of and pleased with, a truth she had not only come to terms with but welcomed openly, with every fiery molecule of her being. A truth that she scribbled hastily but firmly, pressing deep into the paper with the nib, in capital letters, in the first-person present tense.

A truth that was the beginning and seed of everything possible. A former curse and a present blessing. 

Three simple words containing the power and potential of a multiverse. 

**I AM ALIVE**” (Haig 240).

This simple statement of existence is incredibly empowering, and the reference to the “former curse” recalls how desperately she once longed to *not* exist.

In conclusion, Matt Haig’s *The Midnight Library* is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that explores the delicate subjects of mental health and suicide with respect and sensitivity. The author acknowledges the complexity and severity of these issues, while emphasizing the importance of seeking help and connection. Nora’s journey highlights the significance of perspective shifts and acceptance–both of life, and of oneself. Although mental health issues can be challenging to portray, Haig manages to do so in an empathetic and ultimately empowering way. The reader is taken on a remarkable journey from Nora’s darkest moments, through a dizzying array of alternate lives, to the fiery conclusion of her desire to truly *live*.

2730mt,I just finished read all 5 of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Mind. Blown. was yours? (x post with /r/dontpanic),"I have to make a 3 hour commute every week. Music has not been cutting it lately, and so i have been listening to audiobooks, with success. I honestly did not expect to get too far into The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. My attention span is not all that good. However, the moment i heard Stephen Fry's posh and witty voice, i was hooked on the book. the moment i heard the first hilarious guide entry, i was entrenched in the series.

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy made me wonder why it sold better than the Encyclopedia Galactica. While it does stress that you ""Don't Panic"" it was quite unlike the traditional fiction i read. Instead of a focus on traditional literary narrative, Douglas Adams seemed to focus on satirising every facet of humanity, science, space travel, politics, life, the universe and everything. While this focus was a little off putting at first, i got used to the enjoyable Guide tangents and the social commentary offered by the main characters. The ending was a tantilising shape of things to come.

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe gave a similar impression to that of HGGTG, but offer a brilliant twist at the end. With this twist was a hilarious take on modern humanity and why we are, who we are (Gogafrinchain and Zaphod discovering the real leader of the universe). The novel was a little more engaging that other, as Adams developed his descriptive language and really managed to pull you into that universe. As mentioned before, the ending was wildly jaw dropping, and, again, an excellent set up to the next novel. Also, Martin Freeman is an exceptional narrator.

*He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad.*

I loved that quote at the beginning of Life, the Universe and Everything. The prehistoric Earth and Lords cricket sequence are amongst my favourite ever book sequences. And how can you go past the crucial Agrajag chapter, which is equally as poignant and hilarious.  LTUAE was not my favourite of the novels; i thought, despite the meta-ness of the themes, that the adventure was TOO big. However, it was still an amazing read and hope to one day own a Bistromath.

So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish was my least favourite of the series. However, i thought it was still a great listen. Arthurs romance with Fenchurch was a little mushy for my tastes. *Also, if someone could tell me why the Earth re-existed, that would be great. For the life of me, i still dont understand that.* However, sending Arthur, Ford and Fenny back into space at the end was good enough for me.

Mostly Harmless was probably my favourite of the lot. The novel proved that Adams had a firm grasp on how traditional literature operates (despite my early perspective). Finishing the series where it began was so well handled and the inclusion of Stravomula Beta was subtle and ingenious. I so enjoyed seeing Arthur in his element as a sandwich maker, an extremely hilarious situation. Finally, the pay off for the major characters was exceptional (save for Zaphod).

This book opened my eyes to the vastness of the galaxy, how big life, the universe and everything really is. And how small and insignificant the things we do really are. All we can do is to find something that fulfills ourselves and try not to worry, or ***""Dont Panic""***

91r4hc,"Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda. Maybe the most gripping and beautiful book I've ever read","I’ve always liked the Fitzgeralds’ writing, having read The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender is the Night and Save Me The Waltz (although unusually none of their short stories), and I’m going through some ‘things’ at the moment so I thought I might try Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda: The Love Letters of F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (probably a bad idea emotionally but it did make it more meaningful). It's been on my shelf for a long while but I read a lot more fiction that non- and have never read a collection of letters.

I’ve never read anything biographical about them (apart from Tender is the Night and Save Me The Waltz which are heavily autobiographical) although there is a whole world of it out there, given that even in their own lifetime people were fascinated with their lives and that has only increased since.

The vast majority of the letters are from Zelda to Scott, apparently because he kept meticulous records of correspondence and she didn’t. Also, two letters, one from each, represent their 10 years together in New York, Paris and the Riviera (the ‘Jazz Age’ years) because they were together and so didn’t send each other letters. So the book in actual fact is mostly letters from Zelda to Scott, a short section while they were courting, and the majority written from the various asylums to which she was committed after several breakdowns. 

Considering that the bulk of it is by the less famous writer/individual, about the less famous period of their lives, one could be forgiven for thinking that it would be somewhat less interesting than a study of the Fitzgeralds could be. But they write so incredibly beautifully even in their private correspondence and are by turns, tender, passionate, honest and incredibly funny. 

It’s the first book I’ve been compelled to annotate/underline and the first book I’ve wanted to immediately reread. I’ve seen people describe on here a sadness that a book is over, a desire to slow down towards the end so it will last longer, and this is the first time this has happened to me. I got totally lost in their lives and I don’t know if it’s due to, or in spite of, the fact that the letters were only ever meant for each other (not publication), but it contains some of the most moving writing I’ve ever read.

The authors/compilers do a grand job of giving context without it being overbearing or dry. I’d recommend it to anybody interested in the Fitzgeralds, their work, letters or love. 

**An excerpt from near the start:**

“All the fire and sweetness – the emotional strength that we’re capable of is growing –  growing and just because sanity and wisdom are growing too and we’re building our love-castle on a firm foundation, nothing is lost – That first abandon couldn’t last, but the things that went to make it are tremendously alive – just like blowing bubbles – they burst, but more bubbles just as beautiful can be blown – and burst – til the soap and water is gone – and that’s the way we’ll be, I guess – so don’t mourn for a poor little forlorn, wonderful memory when we’ve got eachother – Because I know I love you – and you’ll come in January to tell me that you do – and we won’t worry any more about anything.

\-Zelda”

**About the middle:**

“- take care of yourself. I wish I could have done it better. You have never believed me when I said I was sorry – but I am.”

**Towards the end:**

""Dearest: I am always grateful for all the loyalties you gave me, and I am always loyal to the concepts that held us together so long: the belief that life is tragic, that a man's spiritual reward is the keeping of his faith: that we shouldn't hurt each other. And I love, always your fine writing talent, your tolerance and generosity; and all your happy endowments. Nothing could have survived our life.""

**And months before Scott died:**

“Thanks again for saving me. Someday I’ll save you too – 

Devotedly, Zelda.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/91r4hc/dear_scott_dearest_zelda_maybe_the_most_gripping/,2018-07-25 11:48:43,1,15,books
eurhjq,Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor,"**The Harry Potter books are perfect and holy in every way, but – can they be improved with another polish? And how?**

&#x200B;

Go Set A Watchman, published in 2015, was the most pre-ordered book since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The publicity claimed Go Set A Watchman as Harper Lee’s sequel to her iconic 1960 novel To Kill A Mockingbird. Bookshops threw midnight launch parties, echoing Harry Potter.

But Go Set A Watchman is not To Kill A Mockingbird’s sequel. It is the book’s first draft. In 1960 this first draft was transformed from “a series of anecdotes”\* into a “fully-conceived novel” — or in the author’s words, a “good idea” into “a gem”.

Editor Tay Hohoff helped Harper Lee refocus the story on six-year-old Scout, and encouraged her to drop chapters with the same character as a young woman. The novel they crafted, To Kill A Mockingbird, won the Pulitzer Prize.

&#x200B;

**Harry Potter and the Vanishing Editor**

The Harry Potter series became a thing apart with its fourth entry, published in July 2000: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. To prevent spoilers, release dates in the UK and USA were synced. The midnight release parties began. And that September, filming started on the first movie.

The first three books emerged as a fairly regular piece of publishing, but from Book Four onwards, Harry Potter is an industry. By the fifth book JKR was described as being richer than The Queen. Soon after, she became the first author billionaire.

*How can an editor tell the billionaire goose to revise her golden eggs?* This author is way too powerful.

&#x200B;

**For the Flintz**

Harry Potter exploded into internet chatrooms at the dawn of the new millennium. Committed early fans nominated themselves as editors and flagged up inconsistencies. Marcus Flint, who played Chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team, was in his sixth year in Book One. Yet he remains on the team in Book Three (Hogwarts students leave after seven years). Oops. Fans noticed the error and JK Rowling tagged such slip-ups as “Flints”. To correct, Marcus became a fifth year in reprints of The Philosopher's Stone. (Real editors play second fiddle to the readers.)

Meanwhile, the author incorporates ideas from fans. In Book Six, Ron refers to the makers of the Marauder’s Map as “The Marauders”. Why? To service fans who ~~didn’t understand apostrophes~~ had grouped Remus, Peter, Sirius and James as The Marauders since The Prisoner of Azkaban.

The need for plot secrecy also tied the editors’ hands. Eyes on each manuscript were heavily restricted. No chance to share a problem with a colleague without breaking contract! The atmosphere around the books becomes uptight. One editor’s difficult question may interrupt the productivity of the Harry Potter industry. And the first rule of business is: serve when hot.

&#x200B;

**Mea Culpa**

Jo Rowling has made excuses for three Harry Potter books:

\- Chamber of Secrets: she had writer’s block.

\- Goblet of Fire: she had a story crisis and spent a lot of time on rewrites. she struggled to hit the deadline agreed with her publishers. Pottermania was in full swing, and the movies underway.

\- Order of the Phoenix: writing OotP was a chore, she ran out of time and energy at the finish.

And marriage and babies and interviews and the charity and politics. Like her main character, JKR had too much going on ~~to be a prefect~~.

""There were a couple of the Potters and I definitely knew that they needed another year,"" she told the BBC in 2012. ""I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough. And I read them, and I think 'Oh God, maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut', I don't know.”

&#x200B;

**Stephen is Our King**

When the role of editor is diminished, the writer’s imperfections shine.

Horror writer Stephen King is the world’s second biggest author, worth about half JKR. He championed and mused upon\*\* the Harry Potter books:

“As a writer she is often careless,” he wrote in his review of Book Five\*\*. “Characters never just put on their clothes; they always ‘get dressed at top speed’.”

“The part of speech that indicates insecurity is the adverb,"" wrote King, ""and Ms. Rowling seems to have never met one she didn’t like, especially when it comes to dialogue attribution.” The best-known adverb in HP? “Dumbledore asked calmly.” But ""Dumbledore said simply"" is more prevalent.

King made notes: Sirius – “exasperatedly”, Mrs Weasley – “sharply”, Tonks – “earnestly”, Harry – “quietly”, “automatically”, “nervously”, “slowly” and “ANGRILY”.

King went on: “These minor flaws in diction … are the logical side effect of a natural storyteller who is obviously bursting with crazily vivid ideas and having the time of her life. Yet Ms. Rowling could do better, and for the money, probably should. In any case, there’s no need for all those adverbs (he said firmly), which pile up at the rate of 8 or 10 a page.”

&#x200B;

**The Perils of Structure**

The Harry Potter books contain a beautiful gay relationship that ends in tragedy. Remus Lupin spends 40 lines (across three books) simply looking at Sirius Black, before the latter dies in a fight with Bellatrix Lestrange at the Ministry of Magic. Then this story line evaporates.

JKR is a genius at forward planning and foreshadowing. But there is a flaw in the careful plan. Being fixated on the end goal she cannot allow her characters to speak to her. To fix the end goal of orphan Teddy Lupin, she smothers the flame of Sirius + Remus.

And Remus fights back! In The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, he resists his relationship with Nymphadora Tonks, resists marriage and resists fatherhood. He would much rather hang out with two 17-year-old boys (and, if he must, Hermione).

JKR felt Harry and Hermione pull together. This magnetism is palpable when Ron is absent in The Deathly Hallows. Harry even takes Hermione to visit his parents in Godric’s Hollow. They hold hands. There's a kissing gate. But a late-breaking romance between Harry and Hermione is not in the story plan, even if readers feel the frisson. Would a foolish coupling, one that can be blamed on the Slytherin Horcrux, have made the final book more epic? Screenwriter Steve Kloves made Harry and Hermione dance, to show the temptation and the characters’ decision to resist. JKR ignores the risk. She sacrifices these organic moments and succumbs to her pre-existing structure.

&#x200B;

**Insert Joke Here**

The final HP books wrap up the stories of Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Snape, but… are they finished works?

JKR’s story plan keeps the essential elements of the story safe. But having the path laid out allows the author to skim across details. Several times Fred and George do something funny and everyone laughs – but we are not supplied the joke, only a nod to some antics. Possibly JKR is bored of the characters. Possibly she was hot to write another passage and planned to double back.

Whatever, the basic rule of show-not-tell is ignored, which leaves vague holes. Harry’s schoolmate Dean Thomas\*\*\* drifts twice into the story in The Deathly Hallows – by coincidence! The story's romances feel forced. Ginny, who blossoms with interest through the stories, becomes a trophy in the final book, an object Harry repeatedly puts away for safekeeping.

An empowered editor would smooth away these curiosities and make good the minor beats as well as the major ones.

&#x200B;

**Good or Good Enough**

Jo Rowling finished Harry Potter in January 2007. All was well. The end.

Except there is no letup. Only last year: four new Hogwarts e-books, which unlock seven subjects from the Hogwarts syllabus. A third Fantastic Beasts movie, which promises more Albus Dumbledore, goes into production this spring. Plus, the Pottermore. Plus the Twitter.

If JKR can change the books to amend “Flints”, if she can consider her own “Director’s Cut”, and if she can continue to publish supplementary material to ensure the books are interpreted exactly as she intends, is Harry Potter an ongoing work-in-progress, like the movie Blade Runner (four versions, one sequel and counting)? And is the author the person who decides? Something wonderful about the Wizarding World: readers/fans fill the gaps with their own imaginations.

Thirteen years ago this month JKR defaced a bust of Hermes in her suite at Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel to mark a full stop on Harry Potter. I'm doubtful that her editor was in the room at the time. “It All Ends Here” claimed the publicity for The Deathly Hallows. But not really.

loa9pb,"Most overrated book ever: honest review of ""The Black Swan"" - Nassim Nicholas Taleb (★★☆☆☆)","**Before I start: contradict me please, explain me why this book is worth reading. Because the feeling of having wasted all these hours of life is unpleasant, I would rather be able to find it some merit.**  
**(TLDR -> Scroll down to the end)**

★★ ☆☆☆

I rarely struggled to finish a book like I had with The Black Swan. The content probably deserves three stars, but the author's unpleasantness makes the reading so annoying that's impossible to give him more than two.

Let's start with the substantial aspects. As a firm supporter, if not of absolute randomness, of the decisive impact that chaos has on our lives and on history in general, I can only agree with Taleb's thesis. The problem comes, however, when he tries to make rather standard ideas (not to say trivial) pass for the new philosophical revelation, a one full of high-sounding terms used a bit randomly, demonstrated by bizarre ""experiments"" that almost always go nowhere: we cannot predict the future; something unexpected could happen that would change our life, at any moment; it's useless to try to build, on the basis of the study of the past, rules that are valid a priori for every future scenario, because - what a discovery! - we can't be sure that the future will follow the patterns of the past; it's good to keep a flexible attitude, we can avoid to be caught off guard by admitting ourselves that the only thing we can know for sure is that we do not know what will happen - Socrates, is that you?; a limited number of significant events determine most of the outcomes in any given context - and here I would invoke Pareto, if only he wasn't relegated by Taleb to the desolate world of fools, as we shall see. The entire book could be limited to these claims, but in this way the author would have no way of expressing his ego: what appears to be the real purpose of this book.

And here we turn to the formal problems. Taleb is devoured by the anxiety of affirmation, you can see it from the first page. He is self-centered, arrogant, obviously piqued by a public recognition that he has lacked in the past, and against which he must take revenge. And so everyone becomes stupid and useless - except him, of course, the bearer of the new revelation: judges? Stupid. Historians? Idiots. Analysts? Fools. Stupid are the economists, the linguists, the statisticians, every Nobel prize winner, the jury of Nobel prizes (he has obvious unsolved problems with the Nobel prize, someone please help him), the traders, stupid is Plato, who is indeed the king of stupidity, philosophers aren't stupid, as long as they think like him, and stupid are in general all experts in any possible field - but non-experts are even more stupid, because they don't even know how to be experts. Especially stupid are the French, towards whom Taleb has a special hatred which, if can be funny in the first two jokes, from the tenth onwards becomes really annoying.

The book is also monotonous. In addition to stupidity, Taleb accuses any field of action, any branch of knowledge and any author of being boring. Yet rarely have I come across books more boring than this: being those expressed above the basic concepts, the writer had to justify hundreds of pages in excess. Too bad that to fill them he used an almost unique scheme for each chapter:

1. Bizarre and high-sounding title (e.g. ""The ludic fallacy, or the uncertainty of the nerd"") which takes up the first statements contained in the new chapter;
2. ""To understand this concept we will use a simple mental experiment"" (even if the concept was"" if you put your hand on the fire you'll get burn"", a mental experiment always seems to be needed);
3. Description of the mental experiment, more bizarre than the title (e.g. ""Suppose you take the entire rat population of your city as a sample, and expose them with radiation"");
4. Conclusions that confirm the opening thesis, which most of the time have no logical correlation with the experiment itself;
5. Inconclusive anecdotes of personal life (his own and the one of the poor Evgenija Nikolaevna Krasnova, the imaginary friend of the author that you'll very soon come to hate), I have never read an author talking so much about himself in a book that is not an autobiography!

In this perseverance in constantly rising himself to be better than anyone else, however, Taleb often contradicts himself. Just think of how (and we can agree with him on that) he accuses of incompetence and lack of originality the authors who, in absence of original content, stuff their books with learned citations... Except he then get lost in a profusion of ""as X once said..."", ""the affirmation of the well-known Y according to which..."" and so on, from quote to quote.  
Another extremely annoying aspect is the touchable anxiety Taleb has of seeing his neologisms (and in general abstruse definitions given to each aspect of everyday life) established and used: so in the course of the book the expressions ""black swan"", ""mediocristan"", ""extremistan"", and phrases like ""I define such hypothetical situations an engine of computational epistemology"" (applicable to any hypothetical situation, since the definition doesn't seem to fit the ""mental experiment"" it was coined for more than any other) are repeated beyond belief.

**TLDR**

Taleb, in conclusion, accuses everyone of being smug and full of himself, without giving any concrete contribution. His ego is bulky, it overshadows the real content of the book and at the same time undermines its foundations, because his statements seem meant to be accepted as an act of faith in the same way one cannot but accept his evident superiority (under penalty of be relegated to the stupid's universe, to the mediocristan, with no chance of appeal). Actually, it's not clear whether the author is stupid - which, unlike him, I tend to exclude until proven otherwise -, he takes his readers for stupid or is, more simply, surrounded by stupid people. This is the impression giben by most of his supposed experiments, which invariably start from flawed bases to reach the conclusions the author wanted to reach: there is no need for any mental experiment to prove that if a certain event has always had a certain outcome it doesn't mean that it will continue to repeat itself in the same way forever. What makes the experiment required is the premise, as said flawed: ""statisticians believe that if an event has always had a certain outcome it will continue to repeat itself in the same way forever""; or dry statements such as ""it is generally believed that if women have a longer life expectancy and women are the only ones who use tampons, tampons will make you live longer. We can prove this is not the case with a simple mental experiment"". No Taleb. There is no need. This is simply not the case, none of us come to absolute conclusions starting from such precarious premises.  
The reading key of the entire book is contained towards the middle of it, where, destroying the work of the so-called experts, the author states (not without the usual lengthy passages) that the only difference between an expert on a given subject and an ordinary person are self-confidence and the arrogance with which the expert proclaims himself as such. Nothing that any high school student does not already know, however: by showing ourselves convinced of our claims they will sound more reliable. Taleb exasperates the concept, however, and shows such adamantine confidence as to be frankly hateful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/loa9pb/most_overrated_book_ever_honest_review_of_the/,2021-02-20 16:10:45,11,14,books
2ei168,Pulp Friction...those were the days!,"In the Clive Cussler 237 page thriller MAYDAY, the hero Dirk Pitt shows how it should (still) be done......
Dirk is sleeping on a secluded Greek Isles beach when a startled Teri arrives for an early morning swim.....
....she was about thirty and wore a red bikini swim suit. The bikini was not the exaggerated brief kind.....her figure was a beguiling mix of grace and firmness; the stomach looked smooth and flat and the breasts were perfect, not too small and not too large and out of scale. Her legs were long, creamy coloured and slightly on the thin side. Pitt decided to overlook this faint imperfection.....
(Teri goes on to tell Dirk about her deceased husband who ..'skidded off the course and hit a tree with his MG.')
Pitt sat silent for a miute, staring at her sad face. 'How long ago?' he asked simply.
'It's been eight and a half years now,' she replied in a whisper.
Pitt felt dazed. Then anger set in. What a waste, hethought. What a rotten waste for a beautiful woman like her to grieve over a dead man for nearly nine years. The more he thought about it the angrier he became. He could see tears welling in her eyes as she lost herself in the remembrance, and the sight sickened him. He reached over and gave her a hard backhand slap across the face.
  Her eyes jerked wide, and her whole body tensed from the sharp blow. It was as if she was struck by a bullet. 'Why did you strike me?' she gasped.
   'Because you needed it, needed it badly,' he snapped.
(Pitt goes on to explain that her husband is dead and nine years is too long.)
  Her face was distraught in the morning sun, and her breath came in sobs. Pitt let her cry for a long time.......She looked up at him and he caught the gleam in her eyes....He lifted her in his arms and kissed her. Her lips were warm and moist.
  'When was the last time you had a man?, he whispered.
  'Not since....' Her voice trailed away.
  Pitt took her as the long shadows of the rocks crept upward over the beach, shielding their bodies from the sun............At last Pitt drew back and gazed down at Teri's serene and smiling face.
  'I don't know whether to ask for your thanks or your forgiveness,' he said softly.
   'Please accept them both with my blessing', she murmured.
  He kissed her lightly on the eyes. 'See what you've been missing all these years,' he said grinning.
    'I agree. You've certainly shown me a wonderful antidote for my depression.'
...Teri goes on to invite Dirk out to dinner......

qnd50k,[Review] Battling bad tropes in dark historical fiction: An (almost) complete review of the works of Karen Maitland,"I was recently in a discussion about bad tropes in historical fiction, and wanted to give a shout out to a favourite author who I think does a fantastic job of subverting them, especially the common pitfalls surrounding the accurate portrayal of women. 

Each of the following books is a standalone novel, and I present my reviews in order of my personal  rating. Maitland's usual setting is Dark Ages England, which is one of my favourites, and her novels definitely sit on the darker side of the genre.  

# #1

***A Gathering of Ghosts***

It  was honestly tough choosing the top spot here, but I think GoG takes  it.  Set on Dartmoor in 1316, the book explores the interplay between  Christianity and British paganism, witchcraft, saints and miracles.

For  me two things make this a stand-out novel. Firstly, virtually all the  characters are women. Considering how few voices we have of women from  this period, especially those from the lower classes, Maitland's women  are fantastic. She avoids the anachronism that so many authors fall  victim to, and manages to create deep, fascinating characters who stand  in their own right. Being women is part of who they are, but it's only a  small part of it.

Secondly, her  exploration of magic and religion is some of the best I've read. Many of  her books incorporate supernatural elements, but this is I think the  standout. The novel is not a fantasy novel, and the use of magic is kept  strictly within the cultural context of the book. She manages to bring  superstition and religion alive in a way that allows the reader to step  into the minds of the timeframe, which is no easy feat.

# #2

***A Company Of Liars***

This  came so close to the top spot. Set in 1348, it follows a ragtag group  of travellers thrown together in their bid to escape the black death as  it sweeps across the fens of East Anglia. The best description of the  plot I can give is that it feels like a novelisation of a particularly  phenomenal D&D campaign.

As with GoG above, *A Company Of Liars*   features a wonderfully realistic portrayal of local superstitions and  beliefs, with the added feeling of fear and the unknown that is a  must-have for any plague story. It also features some excellently  written women, and it's the characters and their relationships that make  CoL such an amazing read.

As the  novel progresses, the histories and flaws of each member of the company  are revealed, allowing Maitland to explore a wide range of different  topics and social situations. What I think is especially brilliant,  especially post-pandemic, is how she manages to explore the way that  life goes on. Even when the world around her characters is collapsing,  their own personal dramas and individual intrigues never take a back  seat. When we read about history, it's sometimes hard to imagine how the  events you study in school actually felt for the people that lived  them, and *A Company of Liars* does that with aplomb.

The  setup also means there's a tasty bunch of good old-fashioned plot  twists, and the secrets of each character give it a generous helping of  the gloriously self-indulgent joy of an old-school murder mystery.

***The Plague Charmer***

Okay,  so this one comes with a warning. Of all of Maitland's books, this one  is by far the darkest. Those with a squeamish disposition should perhaps  think twice, as the story plunges headlong into all the horrors of the  1348 black death epidemic, with some parts definitely crossing the  boundary into historical horror.

Set  in a small coastal fishing village, the book again features a hugely  female-dominated cast and a dose of the supernatural. Whereas *A Company of Liars* focuses on life going on around the plague, *The Plague Charmer*  meets it head on, and the story explores the desperation and fear of  the time. It's a story about the unknown and about death, but her  characters are not heroes. They are normal people, forced into  ruthlessly practical actions.

***The Vanishing Witch***

Set a little later than the above three novels, *The Vanishing Witch*  follows the arrival of a widow into Lincoln in 1380, set against the  backdrop of the Peasant's Revolt. The story is full of intrigues,  witchcraft and trickery, which gives it just a hint of the period drama.

The  main story here follows a more well-to-do cast than Maitland's usual  fare, but she balances this by following several other characters. This  allows her to play with the contrasts between the various classes, which  works extremely well in the context of the Peasant's Revolt.

For  me, the witchcraft elements of this novel don't quite meet the standard  of some of her other works. While they remain excellently portrayed,  the main female lead - the beautiful but sinister widow - is slightly  more cliche than some of her others, so didn't quite capture me as much  as she could have.

# #5

***The Raven's Head***

This  is probably Maitland's most 'magical' novel, straying more towards the  dark fantasy end of the historical fiction genre. She still keeps it  firmly grounded in the cultural context, but it's scope is more limited  than the books above. The tale follows an apprentice librarian and  would-be-blackmailer, who's possession of a beautiful figure of a  raven's head results in his becoming an unwitting participant in a range  of dark and superstitious events.

While  the women of this tale are brilliant, they don't quite take the centre  stage that they do in many of Maitland's other works. The characters and  interplay are well-written, and she draws upon the sinister and the  supernatural beautifully.

A very enjoyable read, *The Raven's Head*  doesn't make the cut for a top spot mainly for it's lack of scope; the  characters and plot are excellent, but the setting takes more of a back  seat, which is a real shame.

# #6

***The Gallows Curse***

Set in a village in 1210, *The Gallows Curse*  explores the chaos of the seizing of the church by King John, and the  consequences of ripping away the supporting role religious ritual played  in day to day life.

Before I get  into the review, I must confess that my dislike of this particular book  comes largely from David Thorpe. While he does a fine job on the  narration of *A Company of Liars*,  his insistance on the use of an appalling falsetto to portray the  eunach who acts as one of the main protagnists in this tale is at best  irratating, and at worse offensive. As such, my opinion of the book is  somewhat coloured.

Okay, onto the  actual story. Maitland's portrayal of the ruthlessness and injustice of  the life of an English peasant is excellent, and the interplay between  religion as an administrative body and religion as a moral authority is  an extremely interesting read.

My  main disappointment with the story itself here is the sex. Part of the  story is set in a brothel, and while Maitland does use it averagely  well, it feels cliche and unimaginative. Her exploration of the female  characters attitudes towards sex is nothing new, and I honestly just  felt like she really could have done better.

# Uncategorised

Maitland has two further books, *The Owl Killers* and *The Falcons of Fire and Ice*, neither of which I have read. *The Owl Killers* because after *The Gallows Curse* I didn't fancy subjecting myself to any more of Thorpe's narration, and *The Falcons of Fire and Ice*  because I haven't got round to it. It's set in Lisbon in 1564, so I'd  be interested to see how Maitland deals with such a different setting.

She has also just published a novel which appears to be the first in a series, under a slightly different name (K.J Maitland), *The Drowned City*, which is next on my reading list!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qnd50k/review_battling_bad_tropes_in_dark_historical/,2021-11-05 15:07:11,16,12,books
16172kq,Little Women - Why I love Amy and Laurie as a pairing from the perspective of someone currently playing Laurie in a Stage Production,"There are countless debates about Amy, Laurie, Jo, etc in Little Women. I wanted to give my reasoning as to why I absolutely love the final pairing that is Amy and Laurie as I'm currently playing Laurie in a staged production and been putting a lot of thought into it.

*1. Laurie and Amy both have deep and similar traumas that affected them throughout their lives.*

Laurie and Amy obviously fit together well as a classically elegant and charming couple, but they also have similar traumas that really set them up to relate to each other.

In the case of Laurie, it's very easy to trace how he has this history. As a half-Italian (In this time period in America this was not a beneficial thing) boy, his parents died and his grandfather chose to leave him in Europe for a few years in the boarding school system before he finally sent for him to come to Concord. He grew up in Europe and, ultimately knows those customs and norms better than any in America.

But on top of that, he was alone in this system where he likely faced the classic ""Oh, poor Laurie, we should be nice to him because his parents are dead,"" from many of them. It's the kind of thing that feels like the nice thing to do, but just highlights how different you are from other people and makes many children feel out of place. Then when he goes to Concord, he's not only visibly half-Italian, but the people he ends up befriending are both very poor and a complete family unit, two things that are his exact opposite. He spends his whole childhood never fitting in and desperately seeking a sense of belonging. This is partially why he ends up so attached to Jo because she doesn't focus intensely on treating him like a victim after finding out about his parents. She treats him like another kid in the neighbourhood who she can play with before anything else and doesn't pull her punches when ribbing him.

Now, let's look at Amy, the youngest daughter of the March family. It's much more complicated to see what's going on, but there is very clear text and subtext that shows she faced painful trauma growing up. Amy began to develop true cognizance right around the time their family went from being kind of well-off to desperately poor. Her youngest days fantasizing about princess dresses were dashed away before she got a chance to experience them. That's no fun, of course, but the real source of her trauma is the family dynamics that develop out of their poverty. In any family that struggles thru a difficult time, the members end up fulfilling certain roles as a part of their survival.

For the March's, I map it out like this:

**Marmee:** The Rock. She is always a shoulder to cry on for both her family and her community and bears an extremely large emotional burden keeping it together while, ultimately, neglecting the emotional needs of her children by the fact of not having enough time or energy.

**Meg:** The Second Parent/Enforcer. With Mr. March away, Meg ends up being parentified as the eldest daughter and her childhood and hopes and dreams are utterly cut off. Meg has to take on a role of responsibility and antagonism toward her sisters to help maintain order in the home and it is completely unfair to her and her relationship to her sisters.

**Jo:** The Rebel. Jo manifests a very rebellious nature, both in response to their family's change in station and as a means of coping with her own difficulties understanding her identity. She ends up holding onto and letting out every negative thing that builds up inside the March family, both taking on the burden of a publicly poor reputation from her outbursts and manner and being fairly abusive toward her family caught in the crossfire.

**Beth:** True North. Beth is the pure soul that keeps everyone on track as they struggle. It's very easy when faced with painful challenges like those the March's face to become cynical, selfish, and cruel. Beth takes on the burden of guiding every one back to what is right and proper to do to keep them from losing their kindness. She is pure and loved and kind and suffers from her having to care for her parents happiness when the others leave.

**Amy:** The Butt of the Joke. Amy was too young to be a true helper when the family fell on hard times. She was still at a point where she was being a kid around home when every thing fell apart. So when every one had to suddenly start pitching in, she didn't have the opportunity to grow up gently into the life of providing for the family. Instead, she is thrust immediately into working on things that she is not ready to do and gets compared to other, more experienced, people constantly. She can never live up to what the family needs from her and so she ends up being the person that everybody teases for being incompetent.

Amy being thrust from girlish fantasy to the ""real"" world at such a young age is enough as it is, but she quickly becomes the ""Omega"" of the group providing the others with laughter and levity at her expense. It may seem like casual familial teasing in many interpretations, but it's important to consider how the story can't tell you every detail of a person's life and that, in this case, it is told primarily from Jo's perspective. If ridiculing Amy and making her feel lesser was common enough that it is a key signifier of who Amy was in the home in this more summarized story, then it can be easily implied that there was much more going on that was not seen. Especially since abusive personalities like the one Jo develops, will always present a lighter version of events than what actually transpired when telling a story.

And imagine how utterly painful that must have been for Amy growing up and facing this severe poverty trauma. But instead of having a family who openly loved her and was steadfast with her struggles, they turned her into the butt of the joke every time for the sake of their own chance at a laugh. And then add on that Jo consistently berates Amy and treats her as absolutely worthless and childish. Jo ends up being a kind of ringleader of abuse, directing so much of this negative energy that she and her family are feeling directly onto Amy as a scapegoat.

But then, what does Amy do? She inevitably explodes and fights back against her abuser by burning Jo's manuscript. All that Amy wanted to do after/on the tail end of being sick and cooped up before then was go to the theatre and have a nice evening with her family and their friend Laurie who she was sweet on. But, as always with her household family, she was denied a chance at having that simple happiness and comfort by Jo belittling her as a worthless child. Marmee, thankfully, gives Jo the much needed advice to forgive her sister, but without Amy being present at that interaction and without the context of why it's important that Jo recognize she has been being abusive and caused retaliation, it ends up falling on deaf ears for both Jo and Amy.

And like all familial abuse victims, Amy ends up latching onto someone who shows her acceptance and kindness, her Aunt March. Aunt March, for all her stuffiness, sees Amy as a person that is worth supporting and mentoring and being there for to develop who she really wants to be. It's actually incredibly sad how the family reacts to Aunt March choosing to take Amy instead of Jo on her Europe trip. Rather than be happy for Amy, their instinctual reaction is ""Oh, poor Jo,"" before they correct themselves and are happy for Amy. And a lifetime of being forced to put others happiness before her own makes Amy want to feel bad for Jo in that moment as well.

It's thru this familial history that we see how Amy was othered and abused by the world she grew up in and has an intense trauma underneath her guiding her actions and experiences. While Laurie lines up with her true interests, he also shares the pain of othering with her.

*2. Laurie and Amy both get the necessary mental and emotional space from each other to develop true love and properly support each other.*

Something that happens with Jo and Laurie that leads to their ultimate falling out and lack of mutual romantic love is that both of them are deeply in love with each other as they grow up together but in different ways. While Jo finds a level of companionship in Laurie that she can't find in others, Laurie develops an obsessive love for Jo. Both of them hold so much mental energy for each other that they don't get the time to really think about who the other person is on a genuine level.

In contrast, both Laurie and Amy have distinct periods where they are just seeing each other and not any idea of the other. In the case of Laurie, it is as they are growing up. At the time, Amy falls in love with Laurie, but Laurie treats her very much like a younger sibling. He sees who she is and knows the real Amy before any fantasy of her comes into his head. For Amy, this comes when she encounters him in Europe. With suitors and engagement following her, she has the chance to really think about the world and the people in it, particularly the boy she fell in love with as a child. She sees him lazing about, blowing his fortune, and generally being kind of a dick and it gives her space from the idea of love to acknowledge Laurie fully as a human person.

Seeing each other as real people allows them to appreciate and respect each other for who they are all around. Amy is not a beautiful beacon of perfect ladylike behavior to Laurie. She's a woman who has an aggressive bent to get what she wants that sometimes comes off as rude or impertinent, or even childish in its idealism. At the same time, Laurie is not this suave and handsome man who is intensely charming to Amy. He's a man with a chronic pain of loneliness and fear of failure in the expectations thrust upon him who runs away from responsibility. They get to see each other as actual human beings, flaws and all. And thru that, they not only find true love for another person, but they also help each other grow beyond their flaws into great people.

Amy wants the life of a lady and she can only achieve that with an ""appropriate"" suitor, but she also wants a life with someone she truly loves and who genuinely supports her passions. Laurie wants to be free of the pain of responsibility having to do with his family and the pressures his grandfather places on him and he wants to love someone deeply enough to get away from it all just as his father did before him. So when Amy has these artistic passions and wants to be philanthropic and help people, it all comes together that Laurie can be that person to provide boundless support to someone he truly and deeply loves. In turn, Amy doesn't get written off for what she wants in life. She finally has someone who genuinely believes in her and what she believes is right and good for the world.

*3. This is more controversial, but Jo was queer in a way that meant she would never marry a man for romantic love, so the final arrangement is perfect for the three of them.*

I firmly believe that Jo is not someone who was straight enough to be in romantic love with a man. In the final book she ends up married to Bhaer, but Alcott herself noted that this was a requirement of her publisher and she never intended for Jo to get married. So, whether Jo was Asexual or just very gay and unable to describe who she was in that time period, it seems very clear, from my reading, that Jo was not meant to fall in romantic love with a man. But that doesn't mean that she didn't deeply love Laurie in her own way and that is the tragedy of their relationship. Jo desperately wants Laurie to stay a part of her life because of her love for him, but Laurie wanted to marry her and have a family and a real romantic relationship. They literally could never work without them both losing something they wanted. In Laurie's case, he would lose a loving spouse, and in Jo's case, her perceived loss of independence should she marry. With Amy and Laurie, you have the perfect solution to their problems where Laurie is a part of the loving March family with a wife he cherishes just as he always wanted to be when they were growing up, Amy has this beacon of support and kindness who cares for and loves her deeply in her passions, and Jo gets to have her best friend close by who is truly just a friend.

For all their differences, it provides comfort and resolution to Jo and Laurie's relationship and also helps Amy and Jo to really resolve their childhood of an abuser and victim dynamic, seeing each other in the right light outside of the traumas they experienced as children.

And the best part of it all is that none of them are really villains or antagonists in all of this. Nobody is ""the bad guy"" as they are all, ultimately, victims of their circumstances occurring at very difficult times in both their lives and history. Jo has no means to define who she is in the mid-late 1800s and lashes out. Amy has no means to come into her own when stricken by poverty and a family using her as a punching bag to process their pains brought on by the world. And Laurie has no right to complain about the trauma and loneliness he experiences growing up and is forced to bear it silently, because he is still a wealthy, mostly white, straight man. The world itself is the villain in their story and that's such a beautifully human narrative to give to a reader. Sometimes there are no bad guys. Sometimes it's just a generally awful part of the human experience in a world that other people designed to not allow for every person to feel accepted, comfortable, and cared for in it.

At the end of the day, things worked out exactly as they were meant to to allow for the most happiness and most good for these three. And that's what makes it so very sad that Amy and Laurie die so soon after they all resolve their problems in the real life story this is based on. It's like the perfect happy ending that exists in text because it never happened in real life. Of course, it couldn't last in the real world.

I hope this wasn't an annoying read for anyone who read the whole thing. Let me know what you think about these people and their struggles for happiness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16172kq/little_women_why_i_love_amy_and_laurie_as_a/,2023-08-25 18:26:10,28,121,books
2ll60f,[Spoilers All] Just finished reading The Wise Man's Fear,"So, as the title said, I just finished reading The Wise Man's Fear. After finishing The Name of the Wind, I was just desperate to get my hands on the second book in the installment, and I got it just a day or two after I finished TNotW. 

These will just be my general impression from the second book, but also from the series in it's entirety. Keep in mind that English isn't my first language, so that's why I sometimes seem unclear. 

First off, I really like the narrative perspective. I've never come across a book that is kind of first-person, but actually is the reader sitting by the table in the Waystone Inn. The chapters in between the story are like an intermission of sorts, making you get a fresh breath of air to inhale between the intensity (is that a word?) of the story of Kvothe. I love the pacing of the story. It makes Kvothe more real, to see him as a mere shade of his past greatness. That even Gods can fall.

Secondly, I firmly believe that the story of Kvothe isn't over. The story so far is a story of his past, but I think that Kvothe will, one way or another, catch up to where they are at the Waystone Inn. To clarify, I think/believe that he will recover his power, be it his name from the thrice-locked chest or in some other way, and complete what ever his life goal is. I don't think he will want this, making him lock his past in a chest, thus making him, ultimately; Kvothe the Unwilling. 

I can somewhat support this second idea of mine with the making of a fourth book. Book three (Day Three?) will catch him up to where we are at the Inn, and somehow end with Kvothe regaining his truer self, realizing what he has to do to restore peace/make things good/fulfill his destiny.

This is where book four starts. Kvothe will walk out the door of the inn as his former self, and never look back. He will leave Bast and the Chronicler to their destinies, so that he can do what he has to do. Thus, the narrative shifts and you get to know the continuation of the story from Kvothes perspective. You get to actually know his thoughts and emotions, casting perspective to the great hero that we've learnt so much of. I think the Adema has a strong point in this, saying he has a great shadow (don't remember the exact phrasing) over himself. Some inner darkness. 

Keep in mind that this is just the tinfoil theory of a new fan of the series, and thus nothing to be believed will happen. It's just what I'd like the series to continue, since three books are, seemingly, sparce for the entire story and some kind of closure. Since the story of Kvothe isn't a great story of love and success, it will probably just end with him becoming a Chandrian or something. 

Lastly, I would like to praise Patrick Rothfuss. You've given me a break from ASoIaF, and what a break it is. Even the huge side-tracks are entertaining and filled with a feeling of purpose, something many great fantasy reads lack. 

**TL;DR: Great book, great series, I got an idea of how the series will end. Don't take my tinfoil too seriously.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ll60f/spoilers_all_just_finished_reading_the_wise_mans/,2014-11-07 15:54:47,3,3,books
f7d1ip,The Autobiography of Malcolm X - As told to Alex Haley," I'm sure most, if not all, of what I'm about to say about this phenomenal book has been said by now. Most of it, again, has probably been said so much since 1965 that it may sound trite. In my little vacuum of the world I'm not sure if that is true, however, since I had very little knowledge about Malcolm prior to reading his book. Sure, I knew of Malcolm. Knew that he existed. Knew that he had a brand of fire (and violence) attached to his image. Knew that he was shot and killed.  


I'm not even sure where this prior knowledge came from. I don't remember sitting in my social studies or history classes and discussing Malcolm is or his words. It certainly wasn't from any media. Heck, today is the 55th Anniversary of his execution and there's minimal press. If not for the timely release of a six part Netflix series titled ""Who Killed Malcolm X"" I doubt his assassination would even be anywhere near the news media, but the Manhattan District Attorney's office has apparently re-opened the case and to review “new information.” Read through the right books, however, and you catch glimpses of Malcolm and the esteemed reverence his followers still pay the man. In Angie Thomas' **The Hate U Give** a picture of Malcolm X hangs on the kitchen wall right next to (black) Jesus. Read Alex Haley's wonderful transcription of Malcolm's life and you'll know Malcolm.  


Alex Haley does a masterful job of putting us firmly in the head of Malcolm X. The prose is measured, eloquent, and commanded masterfully by a writer who channels X's voice and instills each page with it. By the end you feel like you've been in the room with this giant of a man. A man who was always learning and applying new knowledge to old and new problems. His pursuit of knowledge and truth combined with his fascination with linguistics gave us a man who commanded attention and whipped the entrenched superiority with nothing more than words. Aggressive no doubt, but words nonetheless. He recognized life is full of changes and embraced it fully. Changes which took him as low as the slums of Harlem and prison to the highs of making his pilgrimage to Mecca. Changes that happened so quickly that he was addressing and meeting with Afro-political leaders from around the world during his last year on Earth. It is absolutely incredible how much Malcolm jam packed into nearly forty years of living and it is absolutely maddening feeling robbed of yet another great man whom was executed well before his prime.  


There are the life stories of several men in this book. The fact Malcolm X not only did as much as he did, but changed as much as he did in forty years of life is incredible. There is a fascination with each and every page as Malcolm goes through his life's history occasionally offering present day analysis and insight. Running throughout is the prophetic paranoia of his life ending violently. Partly due to his present day situation, but also because it is the reality of the world he was born into. The reality of black men dying violently every day. So much so it's common place and expected. By the end Malcolm admits he never expected to live as long as he did and with the death threats coming in he treats everything like borrowed time. Reading the book it isn't so much a change of thinking as a continued knowledge of finite time. Even as a young person he knew how limited time was. His watch kept him mindful of time and appointments. If he wasn't busy with someone he was reading or learning about something. He cherished intellect and relished in whipping somebody with nothing more than words.  


For all of the fire, aggression, and violence that has been and is assigned to Malcolm it's not an image crafted by the book. Passionate and aggressive. Certainly and in large quantities. Notwithstanding the extreme Nation of Islam stories (truly fascinating if not clinically insane) I never got the sense Malcolm was for hatred. For equal prejudice, yes. For responsibility and accountability, yes. The need to defend these values by any means necessary - most notably, yes. Yet, Malcolm was measured. He knew what and how he was saying things would garner him attention - he learned that early on in life. He preached from his own perspective with truth and an uncommonly astounding way to say that truth concisely and with maximum effect.  


Throughout the book I ran through many emotions while reading. Firstly, reading about how much and how often Malcolm changed himself was astounding. This was a man who had three different names throughout his life. It was completely mesmerizing reading his tales about the jazz greats and his relationship with Cassius Clay. Not to mention his completely offhanded name dropping of Maya Angelou. His pursuit of gaining knowledge, continuing to learn, and applying the new knowledge to his life is inspirational. His time management is certainly commendable and militant and made me quickly realize how much time I myself am wasting. Haley offers truly fascinating insight into Malcolm’s mind and it’s power. While dictating to Haley, Malcolm would write random thoughts and comments on any scrap paper around him (often planted there by Haley for this very purpose) and they often were completely different topics than what he was speaking on. By the end there was impending doom seated in my stomach as Malcolm’s words and thoughts ended and Alex Haley picked up for the last days and weeks of Malcolm’s life in the epilogue. Sadness and frustration certainly. We were all robbed of a great man and leader who hadn’t even begun to reach his prime or potential. It’s somewhat fitting that the one feeling that stands tallest at the end of this book is one of anger. Fire branded anger at everything Malcolm was fighting against. The very system that shaped him in the first place. Anger at the loss of life. Anger at the minuscule amount of progress since Malcolm’s execution. Anger at the very same old song and dance that Malcolm traced back 400 years.  


Thankfully, Malcolm used that anger as his fuel rather than fester in it. It urged him to seek and speak the truth. It guided him as he realigned his faith and guided him further when he started connecting with African leaders to facilitate a worldwide brotherhood. Perhaps most importantly the book truly gives you Malcolm’s perspective. For many of my peers it’s a perspective we are never familiar with although Malcolm’s perspective was far from uncommon. Still, the man was uncommon. Shaped by common experiences and molded into a truly remarkable mind. Whenever I think of him and this book nothing but pure admiration and fascination fills my mind. And then the anger starts to trickle in and I know that’s his legacy, too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/f7d1ip/the_autobiography_of_malcolm_x_as_told_to_alex/,2020-02-21 15:54:14,14,49,books
aijjlw,Why How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic and is still worth a read today in the 21st century,"*How to Win Friends and Influence People* sold countless copies and is probably the best known book in the self-help genre. Now over 80 years later, its status as an enduing classic has constantly been under debate. In my opinion, it definitely deserves to be considered a classic, it is still very well worth a read, here’s why: 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, socialization is harder than most people think. Of course, the people on r/foreveralone will agree, but a lot of people tend to disagree with the statement “social interaction is hard”. Social interaction is like driving, or swimming, perceived to be easy because most people have had so much practice with it. If you ask most drivers, they’ll say driving is easy and intuitive, but if you ask them about their first day on the road, it was probably nerve-racking and difficult and kind of scary. Driving became easier because you got good at it, and you got used to the complex actions required. 

&#x200B;

It’s the same thing with social interactions really. If you think about it, there’s a lot of skills involved that may seem intuitive but are incredibly difficult. People intuitively understand how to phrase things, when to say things, how to negotiate, how to convince, etc. Only because they have been doing it since they were kids. Now if you put someone in a situation where they’ve had little practice, say, a job interview, first date, or doing business abroad, people will often complain about how difficult it is. 

&#x200B;

Yes, it is true, much of Carnegie’s advice is arguably common sense. For instance, consider his six points on making people like you: become genuinely interested in other people, smile, remember a person’s name, be a good listener, talk in terms of the other person’s interest, and sincerely make the other person feel important. But why is it common sense it’s because people have been doing it for the longest time. I would actually argue that these six points are not immediately intuitive. Sure, charismatic people have a rough idea on effective socialization, but I doubt that they can really list out these 6 points and back up why they work. 

&#x200B;

I also believe that it is important to consider this book in its historical context. late 19th and early 20th century is if we were to be honest, filled with shoddy social science. The study of human behavior and societies was still in its infancy. Quite frankly, most of the influential social scientists from that time used shoddy methodology and reached questionable conclusions.

&#x200B;

A quick read of say, Das Kapital by Karl Marx or The Elementary Forms of Religious Life by Emile Durkheim would show that late 19th century and early 20th century social sciences aren’t exactly the most rigorous, and that authors from that era love grandiose over generalization. After all, by modern standards The Elementary Forms of Religious Life should have been more accurately titled Observations of Australian Totemic Religion, as one of the great social science books from the 20th century tried to generalize localized observations from specific niche religions onto the world of religion as a whole. Nowadays even guys in the reddit comments know that one cannot generalize trends based on one anecdote.

&#x200B;

Yet that’s where I feel How to Win Friends and Influence People shines. Sure, the advice is simple, you can even consider it primitive but the book never presents itself as an authoritative treatise or an all-encompassing reference on the practice of socialization. The tone and prose is conversational, like if an old friend is talking to you. As a firm believer in the Chautauqua movement, Dale Carnegie himself was never the aloof academic, he always believed in delivering practical easily understood advice to the masses, and it shows in his book. Because of this, I feel like the book is truly timeless and universal. Through anecdotes Carnegie delivers lessons on socialization and what he considers to be the human psyche. 

&#x200B;

Finally, there has always been an argument that *How to Win Friends and Influence People* is an immoral book, that it encourages psychological manipulation. In my opinion, that is a ridiculous statement, and one that could be easily dispelled with a simple reading of the book. Sure, one may argue that telling people to “become genuinely interested in other people” essentially encourages people to feign interest in others, but I feel like there is a much deeper reading that is often missed. 

&#x200B;

How to Win Friends and Influence People is no more a book on feigning interest in others than Animal Farm is a book on pigs. Sure, the book is filled with friend making strategies and anecdotes on how to make others like you, but it contains so much more than just that. It is really promoting a framework of thoughtfulness on how one should socialize. Carnegie explains that one should consider one’s actions, and how it impacts others and what they think of you.

Carnegie essentially explains that if you want to influence other people and their opinion of you, you must consider how your actions impact their perception of you. Therefore, you should present yourself in a way that is least likely to offend and create resentment in others. Some may consider this manipulation, but in reality, isn’t this what people do every single day? From not mentioning how you got fired from your last job at an interview, to saying “good job Bobby! You showed great spirit” at your nephews little league game when he can barely catch a ball, people manage their social interactions to influence how other people think of them every single day, Carnegie merely wrote down what billions of people are already doing everyday. 

&#x200B;

This is why I think How to Win Friends and Influence People deserves to be considered a classic. I consider it to be in a similar category to On the Origin of Species. After all, Darwin never invented anything, he compiled his observations into a book and a theoretical framework. Carnegie essentially did to human socialization what Darwin did to biology. 

&#x200B;

Finally, if you still aren’t convinced that How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic, consider this: The book sold a gazillion copies across tens of languages. For better or for worse, the ideas and strategies propagated by the book have been embedded deep in our culture and society. As probably the single most read book on social science, Carnegie left his mark on how people interact with each other. I think it is at least worth a read if just to understand how it seems to have influenced every politician, business leader and used car salesman under the sun.

d7bel,"Sexist, Racist, Neocon, Scribe: Best-selling thriller author Frederick Forsyth makes a rare appearance at the Edinburgh Fest.","The best-selling thriller writer from Kent has never ""done"" a book festival before; professing a loathing of talking about himself and his work, he warded off his publicists' pleas--until now.  I'd managed a last minute ticket to this sell-out event.  Oh, dear.

His latest book, *The Cobra*, is a cross between Clancy and 24.  As usual, it features a ridiculous super-agent who isn't afraid to make the ""hard"" decisions of murder and torture in defense of the soundly-sleeping masses.  This time the villain is the cocaine trade.  How do you defeat such a villain?  A bloody final solution for drug dealers and cartel leaders!  Why hadn't we thought of that?  He answers: because of the ""squeamishness of the public"".  Oh.

He ticks off his hotspots of the drug trade: northern Mexico, Colombia,  Venezuela.  ""I don't know whether it's ethnic, or regional, or the nature of the drug.""  ""These are all Hispanic countries,"" he notes.

""I couldn't help but notice that there were hardly any women in your book,"" begins the moderator.  ""I believe there were, hmm, one in this one?""  He begins to describe her.  ""She was sort of a pawn in the course of the various machinations...""  

Forsyth nods.  ""Well, I've been to these places, talked to the spooks involved,"" he says.  ""And they just aren't there.""  Aside from a few women with ""battle grsy hair and battle gray faces.""  Light laughter ripples through the crowd.  Asked if he writes books with ""the chaps"" in mind, he says, ""if you want romance, read Danielle Steele.  The thought of inserting a love-in out on the islands, three days spent under a duvet, well, you'd get back to the story and the reader would wonder, 'what was happening, now?  What was the point of that?'  And quite rightly.""  Oh, so *that's* how you write for women.  Noted.

""Could it be done, the elimination of the cocaine trade?"" asks one audience member.

""First, we have to stop treating the drug dealers with kid gloves.""  Ah, yes, the lessons California teaches!  ""And we have to treat them like the enemies they are. Despite what you might believe, *we don't slot people,*"", he says, referring to intelligence agency-run assassinations.  ""The French do.  The Saudis do.  We don't.""

""What if we legalized cocaine?"" asked an elderly woman, last of all.

""Ah.  There seems to be this perception that if we make something legal, then the previous violators would instantly reform into nice, well-behaving, good-mannered chaps.  Remember the abolition of licensing and 24 hour drinking?  We thought our youngsters would sit down with a glass of sherry (one) and talk intelligently about Sartre.  Well!""  He chortles.  ""That's not what happened.""

I should mention the extract he read.  Firmly prompted by the moderator, he reluctantly read the (very brief) moment when the White House Chief of Staff talks to an advisor.  ""Only one man can do the job...a former head of Special Ops at Langley.""  ""What's his name?""  ""I don't recall him, sir...but his operational name was....**THE COBRA.**""  Fucking seriously?  These books are cartoons for fascists.

That leaves him a cartoonist.  A moral caricaturist.  I don't think he doesn't aspire to much else; he said as much, explaining that his books mean what they say; there's nothing else to them.  ""I like the good guys to be good, the bad guys, bad.  Clean and nasty,"" he says.  ""There's not one day in my 72 years that this country hasn't been under threat,"" he says, perhaps unconsciously sliding into conservative demagoguery.  ""Socialism, communist dictatorships, and, in the last ten years, Islamic fundamentalism. And MI5 has stopped eighteen major conspiracies, eighteen!""

How sad that this man used to be a journalist and that he's now so happily satisfied with the narrative patina on top of all the real story that goes on in real life.  I guess that for him, these cartoons are in black in white.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d7bel/sexist_racist_neocon_scribe_bestselling_thriller/,2010-08-30 17:44:40,0,2,books
1m25e9,The Possessed by Fyodor Dostoevsky,"Hello, before you read this I want to give fair warning that it's pretty long. If you're interested in Dostoevsky as an author or in his works, this will give an overview of The Possessed that is hopefully compelling. If you aren't, this article probably isn't worth the time. That is something I take no offense to, I just want to be honest about it.

I think I finally realized today why The Possessed is my favorite novel, so I figured I'd share some thoughts on it with you. In many regards, particularly throughout the first half of the novel, it deals with traditional fundamental questions through the struggles of its characters like the true nature of art and intellectualism, the struggles of spirituality, and social upheaval. The novel is greater than a two dimensional analysis of these subjects though because it frames them in the very personal struggles of its characters to determine their true nature. It often feels as though these larger issues are the pretense of something more innate. For example, Kirillov, a spiritualistic nihilist with epilepsy, grapples with the belief that his will is ultimate, and thus to prove he is god he must kill himself (which he does). The irony being that the contempt he sees in his own mortality is proof he isn't God. While this is witty commentary on the inherent flaws in nihilism, readers can easily see his struggle is more so that of a depressed epileptic man attempting to overcome his condition (a condition with morbid similarities to Dostoevsky's own), and how this eventually leads him to kill himself. Kirillov has a yin to his yang, Shatov, a Christian undergoing a crisis of faith. As Kirillov embarks down the convoluted path of convincing himself to commit suicide, Shatov slowly emerges from his crisis, even becoming happy, but it isn't meant to be (This is Dostoevsky for Christ's sake) because he is tragically murdered, providing readers with a frustrating and defeatist counterpoint to Kirillov's nature. 

An interesting aspect of the novel when considering its characters in this light is the breadth of topics covered and labyrinth plot. The version I own is 416 pages and the first half often feels like an epic on Russian life mixed with philosophy. This is because Dostoevsky didn't have a firm idea of what the plot would be until the second half of the book. Strapped with gambling debts and desperate for money, he submitted sections of the books to meet strict deadlines before developing a concrete plot. As a consequence, the first half of the book is often written off. And while it can be a thick read at times, this aimless feel gives several important tools to the novel's second half that increase its potency. First, it helps establish an atmosphere that lets readers understand Russian culture during the time period. As anybody who has studied Russian history during the 19th and early 20th century or it's literature knows, Russian books from that period are a very distinctive beast. This is important because failing to view the novel's characters through the lens of this culture erects barriers that keep readers from relating to characters as people. It is easy to miss small cues with major ramifications. Secondly, the novel's first half sets up intricate back story that helps to develop characters. Naturally, most people don't want to read War and Peace or In Search of Lost Time, but the two hundred or so pages before the shit hits the fan make the characters in the novel, people. The fact the style is haphazard actually adds to this at times. It is easy to hear the existential questions Dostoevsky grapples with addressed to readers through his characters. While Russian literature often appears to have a great distance between the writer's words which can be verbose and convoluted in English translations and the readers, this style can easily come to feel far more personal no matter the translation because it has the slight ring of personal musings. All of this culminates to create a strong dichotomy between the almost whimsical and idyllic first half where readers see naught but the seeds of tragedy sown and the haunting second half. 
                                                        
As the story progresses, the novel's characters who are as incomplete as they perceive themselves to be in the face of new thoughts and their inherent flaws end up coming together in an oddly shaped web of interaction. It is hard to pull a protagonist from this forming web because dostoevsky gives such equal voices to all his characters and provides no moral compass, but it eventually forms around the mysterious Nikolai Stavrogin. Nikolai's only redeeming character is that he is on a quest to determine who he really is as a person, and is put in conflict with everything around him in doing so. At the novel's start, one could consider him an anti-hero, having carried out stupid pranks against traditional nobility that are actually kind of annoying due to the attention he receives as a mysterious rebel in consequence. This is just Nikolai's boredom though. As the plot progresses, his struggle isn't the struggle of an anti-hero against society, it is his struggle against himself. He repeatedly tears himself down and builds himself back up in an odd sadomasochistic cycle. He's mentally unstable, takes out a hit on a mentally ill woman who had his child, murders people in questionable duels, and one chapter describes him raping a little girl then convincing her to kill herself. It isn't over the top, Dostoevsky writes him in a way that makes it believable, and he is the novel's hero. Readers can't help but relate to Nikolai and project themselves on him because of his cool dissatisfaction for all the pretense he sees around him. As a result readers empathize and then feel disgust with themselves for doing so just as Nikolai does with himself. The web of characters in the novel eventually kill one of their own in a sick attempt to cement their bonds, but the group falls apart completely upon doing so. The death stands out as a glaring statement that you never understand your true nature. To put it another way, the group consciousness attempted to understand itself, but that consciousness couldn't withstand the complete dissolution or death of the individual. In stark contrast to this, the hero Nikolai, who has traveled inward to the point of madness, is offered reconciliation, but determines it is impossible for him and kills himself. Some readers want to chock this up to guilt, but such an analysis would be overly simplistic. Nikolai was likely somewhat guilty, but even more so he was bored, numb, and empty. One quote sums it up well, ""My desires are too weak; they are not enough to guide me."" Nikolai is the set path of destruction of the unleashed mind. One that can't check itself and pushes itself irreparably over some unmarked line. The only character who finds redemption is Stepan Verhovensky, the artistic intellectual who finds God on his death bed. This isn't a happy message for two reasons though. The first lies in father son dynamics. Pyotr, Stepan's son is depicted as the devil throughout the novel, and represents the perversion of intellectualism. This must also be coupled with the fact Nikolai is varvara's son, and that Stepan shared a lifetime platonic love with Varvara. These two pieces of information demonstrate Dostoevsky's lack of hope for the upcoming generation's ability to redeem themselves (one that was well founded). Secondly, Stepan finds his redemption disgraced and impoverished on his death bed. While there is a happy connotation to this, one cannot help but also note a level of sarcasm. After all, one of the major questions posed throughout the novel is: ""was searching for a supposed truth really worth all the trouble? Is it really an answer when there is no time to apply it?"" If there is one thing readers have learned about Stepan, it is that he'll talk himself into a universal truth one week and out of it the next. While there is no reason to believe Stepan doesn't mean what he says at that moment, readers are left to ask if it is his nature that has changed, just his circumstance (that he won't really have the time to change his mind), or if he is like Shatov. 

This is more potent in the context of Dostoevsky's life, the life of a man who was an intellectual revolutionary turned ""slavophile"" writer (a term attached to writers who wrote works espousing the virtues of more traditional Russian lifestyles and Russian orthodoxy) who struggled with the question of God's existence and meaning his entire life. The novel's overarching moral seems to be much like the connotation of Tolstoy's oft touted question: How much land does a man need? and proposed answer: six feet. Learning to find comfort in something that is inherently depressing. The Possessed doesn't seem to offer much comfort, but that is its greatest virtue. It acknowledges certain truths at their absolute worst and challenges you to find a way out.

bxdyhr,"Effective Communication of Position, Space, and the Movement Through It (And why it's important)","One of the qualities that I see in many of my favorite authors, and one that is lacking in many of the less memorable ones, is the ability to clearly and concisely communicate space, position, and movement to a reader. This is a quality that I would like to see more attention towards as I firmly believe that it is one of the distinguishing factors between a good author, and a great one.

**What do I mean?**

What I mean by clearly and concisely communicating space, position, and movement, is the ability of an author to deliver all of the relevant information to the reader about the space in which a scene is set, the position of everything in that space, and the movement of everything through that space. 

**In Practice**

This starts off simple, basic, X person walked through Y door and sat in Z chair. But this is where the *relevant* part comes into play, relevant information is *any* piece of information about something's space, position, or movement which is necessary for the reader to know in order to understand what happens in the space.
Let's start with just looking at position, (and a minimal amount of space because information about the space is necessary for even a basic understanding of the scene) in a very basic manner and use the example of a baseball bat. If you hit someone with a baseball bat, that bat can't come from thin air, either someone brought it into the space, or it was there already and they grabbed it, either way the reader needs to know that the baseball bat was present before it was used. So what we would need to know is 

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters within the space

* The position of the bat in the space

Essentially this is Chekhov's Gun in reverse, if a gun is fired in a story, it must be shown at some point beforehand. Now this is all still very basic stuff, but this is with just position and space, and in a very basic form. Let's go back to the baseball bat, this time fleshing it out. Let's assume that the baseball bat is present in the space already. Looking at position, the relevant information would be:

* The dimensions of the space

* The position of the characters, in relation to the space, each other, and the bat

* The position of the bat in relation to the space and the characters

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and the bat

* The position of anything in between the characters and the bat in relation to the space, the characters, the bat, and anything else in between the characters and the bat

* The dimensions of anything in between the characters and each other

* The position of anything in between the characters and each other in relation to the space, the characters, and anything else in between the characters and each other

As you can see it gets complex very quickly, however, all of this can be taken care of with a description that includes all of the information required to figure this out for yourself, In reality, something like this would work: 
Person A and Person B are sitting in a small, square room. There is window on the wall opposite the entrance, there is a bank of chairs along the left wall, there are two side tables, one on either side of the bank of chairs, each with a lamp on top, and a basket containing some magazines below, on the right wall there is a closed door which leads into an office, against the closer side table rests a baseball bat. Person A and Person B are sitting on opposite ends of the bank of chairs. 

It isn't particularly hard to cover your bases, you just need to plan accordingly, however this is still missing a key part of the picture.

**Movement**

Up to this point we've only been looking at position and space. But position and space aren't generally where I see most authors fail, chances are that if you're a half decent author, you have those figured out. Where most people falter, is movement. Without movement you have a picture of a single moment, frozen in time, adding it in necessitates that you not only consider a third layer of relevant information, but also that you communicate the way that information changes. It is important to communicate not only the movement, but how the positions of everything within the space change in response, and if necessary, how the space itself changes in response. If changing the space is a bit hard to grasp, think of the ""The Floor is Down"" moment in Ender's Game.

Many authors just don't manage to keep track of both the movement and the response, but even for those that do, there is another obstacle to conquer.

**The Tunnel**

Most good authors make it to this point, where *they* fail is a rather insidious pitfall which I am going to refer to as tunnel vision. Where Tunnel Vision always seems to rear it's ugly head is in battle scenes, Tunnel Vision is where the focus narrows to a small part of the scene, to the detriment of the whole. If we're talking battle scenes, what you tend to see is: X swings their sword, Y blocks with their shield, X scratches Y's arm, Y decapitates X. 

The problem here is that the focus of the scene narrows to the upper bodies of two people, to the exclusion of literally everything else. Not only is it boring, but it lacks any information about the two characters' movement through the space, their positions at any point in time, or the movement of anything besides whichever arm is the current focal point.  This leads not only to scenes which are confusing to follow because the reader has suddenly been disconnected from the space, and any sense of position within it, but also to a jarring break of their immersion when they have to try and figure out how someone fell off the balcony, when the last thing they remember, everyone was at the bottom of the stairs. 

**The Force Carrier**

Effective communication of position, space, and movement is different, not in that it lacks the same level of focus, but in what that focus is directed at, and in that it is less narrowed, if not by much. Instead of the focus being on the action, the movement, the focus is on the what I call the Force Carrier. The Force Carrier is whatever bridges one action to it's corresponding reaction, and then whatever bridges the reaction to the reaction, and so on, In a fight scene, for example, the action could be a punch, the carrier could be a block, and the reaction could be the person who blocked, stumbling back from the force of the block. In a more extended example you could have a fight where each blow is redirected to the advantage of the defender, whose redirection leads into an attack, which is the redirected back at them. The carrier is a vehicle for keeping the focus of the scene on whatever is the most important part of said scene, with each focus transitioning to a new one as the scene shifts. This allows the fight to be one uninterrupted sequence, as opposed to a disconnected stop and start, and with every important action leading to the next, it becomes much more difficult to miss important details and end up confused when they come into play.

The best example that comes to mind is from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn, It is Kelsier's fight against a group of foes, in a noble family's keep, involving a heavy metal paperweight, It is a fantastic example of how to create a flow of cause and effect in a fight, and is a fantastic example of effective communication of position, space, and movement working in tandem to immerse the reader and communicate effectively.

TL;DR:
* Give the reader the information necessary to visualize the space, and the positions and movement of anything within.
* Remember, Your characters have legs, use them!
* Each important action should lead to the next.

Hopefully I explained this in a clear enough manner, if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them

1. enjoy genre-defying magical realism

2. enjoy indulgent, decadent prose

3. enjoy post-colonial literature

4. enjoy dense, erudite, literary fiction

5. enjoy slow reads

6. enjoy fierce intertextuality

7. enjoy left-leaning political views

This review will be spoiler-free.

In the year 1981, Salman Rushdie's *Midnight's Children* was published. That novel won the Booker Prize and would be considered by many his greatest literary achievement. The year is now 2021; *Midnight's Children* enjoys its fortieth anniversary and Salman Rushdie, who still lives, enjoys a body of fiction that right now numbers at twelve novels. This pandemic era, while for many a tragic and irretrievable period, had its bright spots. 2021’s brightest spot for me was falling in love with literature all over again. Salman Rushdie saved me. That is hyperbole of course. Salman Rushdie never saved me. I have never met the man. Our acquaintance is limited to me reading his books. Alas, his work, when I discovered him, was a vivid flare that helped me fend off my own breed of personal darkness in these trying times. 

In the span of only a few months’ time, I read all twelve of his novels. This is both a review of each individual work and a comprehensive reading guide. I do not believe in arbitrary numerical scores when it comes to novels; you will not find them here. Instead I will just tell you what the novels were about, what I loved, what I did not love, and who I think each novel is for. Said novels will be categorized into three groups. The first group will be my personal favorites. This group represents the novels I am most infatuated with, advocate for, and would recommend to any literary friends in my personal life. While these novels are excellent, they may or may not be the optimal options for an entry point into Mr. Rushdie’s fiction. The second group is what I will dub the essentials. These are also novels I love but these also are, in my opinion, novels that must be read in order to capture his contribution to the world of literature. If any one person were to choose to read only a single novel from Rushdie, then they should choose one of the novels from this group. The last but not least group of books will be books, in my eyes, reserved only for the Rushdie enthusiast, for the Rushdie completionist. Make no mistake; these are in no way bad or worse novels than the ones aforementioned. These novels are good but if read by themselves, they could be very misleading and may make some readers form an incomplete picture of Rushdie as an author. You should be immediately skeptical of anyone recommending you start with any of the novels in this group. 

**1. First impressions…**

*Shalimar the Clown* (2005)

*Shalimar the Clown* gets its own section in this post and it will serve as an introduction. When this year began, I never heard of Rushdie. I picked up this novel on a recommendation. Despite *Midnight’s Children* being much beloved in many circles, I chose *Shalimar the Clown* because I usually prefer to choose my own entry point with new authors. Why this novel? I could not tell you why. I don’t remember in the slightest. I think now, without an inkling of a doubt, that I could not have chosen a better introduction to Rushdie. *Shalimar the Clown* splendidly performs two functions for me: its characterizes Rushdie as an author and establishes the motifs that permeate and construct his work. What is the novel about? The plot begins in California. A well-dressed, urbane man of no young age is murdered by his driver. We learn in time that the man murdered came to be a critical figure in the United State’s counter-terrorism apparatus. We learn in time that the murderer is a shameless terrorist, or was he more than that? We learn in time that the murderer was no more than an otherwise ordinary man, suffocating on the bitterness of a long, lost love. 

That’s the premise. You will see a version of that summary as a blurb most places you look. You heard the plot but what’s the story? Here, Rushdie displays his talent at simultaneously telling an intimate, individual, character-oriented plot and at the same time mobilizing large, complex ideas. This is one recurrent attribute in Rushdie’s novels: the fact that it is difficult to confine a description of them to a single sentence. *Shalimar the Clown* is a tragic love story, told against the backdrop of Kashmir and California. *Shalimar the Clown* is also a meditation on terrorism. Like nearly all of Rushdie’s novels, *Shalimar the Clown* is an examination of the nature of belief, religion, and religious fundamentalism. Like nearly all of Rushdie’s novels, *Shalimar the Clown* is also an excoriating look at Middle Eastern and Middle Asian geopolitics and history. I’d like to see you summarize all of that in one short sentence. The stories that Rushdie tell are never flat; they are faceted. They are dimensional. They are always more than what they first seem to be. Rushdie is unafraid to juggle multiple knives. He is unafraid to make us feel afraid, to feel foolish, to feel. Most of the time it works brilliantly and nothing is hurt; most of the time. These novels might be action packed sometimes but Rushdie does not produce pulpy page turners. These are slow, excruciating portraits of real people and real places. Speed demons, beware. These are dense, literary novels so rich with substance that they are being studied in classes today. I will be the first to confess that much of the nuance about what is said about this region of the world is perhaps being lost on me. I am woefully undereducated about countries such as Pakistan, Kashmir, and India; but Rushdie did successfully whet my interest in learning much more. 

Another important aspect of Rushdie’s novels is how they are unapologetically postmodern. It didn’t quite take one-thousand-and-one-nights to read all twelve of his books but that story is clearly one of his key inspirations. These novels are often non-linear, overlapping, parallel, layered Russian nesting dolls of narratives. They are filled with ever-changing perspectives, fluctuating pace, dream sequences, and often the all-colorful dream-logic magic realism that harkens to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. On the subject of magical realism, Rushdie was my first exposure to this movement. However, you will find little of it here. This twelve-novel escapade was a learning experience. I learned that magical realism exists on a spectrum. In novels such as here in *Shalimar the Clown*, and *The Golden House*, magical realism is merely a whisper, a suggestion. They are, for lack of a better word, more grounded. Then there are novels such as *Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty Eight Days* which almost disregards genre lines with devilish glee. 

Before this section ends, there are two specific things I would like to praise this novel for. The first being how Rushdie humanizes the people often called terrorists. I want to preface whatever I say next that I in no way condone the heinous atrocities committed by terrorists everyday in this modern world. I mean that Rushdie does not fall into the trap of reducing terrorists to faceless caricatures of hate and bigotry and fanaticism. Reducing any form of bigotry to a caricature solves nothing but widen the distance between people. I distinctly remember watching one documentary about a terrorist group in Afghanistan. A journalist was brave enough to enter their camp and interview them. They all stood around the journalist and cameraman, lounging with their rifles bared. There was one scene where the journalist was being shown one of the men’s home village, ravaged by American drone strikes. There they stood, in the rubble of their homes. I will ask you this: who is right? Is it the pilot who levels a village to kill one target? Is it the boy who grows up and takes revenge by driving a car bomb into a busy street? This question is not for me to answer. I don’t believe it can be. Terrorists, much like us, are people. They love, they long, they loathe, and they are capable of feeling and being wronged. 

Last, and a galactic distance from being least, is Rushdie’s prose. I will not be the first nor the last reader to ever draw comparisons between Vladimir Nabokov and Salman Rushdie. The extravagance of prose exists on a spectrum. Nabokov and Rushdie exist together at the very tips of opulence. They are both talented polyglots who render their imagination with intense beauty and erudition. There are many conversations about English language prose stylists. Any conversation that excludes Rushdie should quickly be enlightened. This is the universal truth about all of Rushdie novels: they are wrought with a decadent, maximalist, over-caffeinated prose. If you are tired of reading bland sentences, if you want to read an author who clearly loves the English language then you are doing yourself a massive disservice by not reading Rushdie. At some point in the plot, the novel takes a jarring change in perspective. We go from California to Kashmir. The sequences in Kashmir are some of the most wonderful, immersive pieces of fiction I have ever experienced. Kashmir, painted with such artistry, such delicacy, you would think was a magical place torn straight from the pages of *The Arabian Nights*. I would read the passages here and I would often close the book and close my eyes and picture myself there beneath sharp stars, absorbing like a sponge all the sights and smells of Kashmiri feasting and dancing. It was those passages alone that secured this novel a place in my Valhalla, as one of my personal favorites. Its also one that easily belongs in what are the essential Rushdie novels. This is *Shalimar the Clown*. It is gorgeous in some places. It is harrowing in others. You should read it. 

**2. My personal favorites…**

*The Moor’s Last Sigh* (1995)

Pepper. Salt. Cardamon. Cinnamon. Portraits that become moving pictures. A town where time does not pass. A mad artist with ice in his veins. A boy-man racing to his death. A criminal syndicate. Bombs, and some that are even nuclear. A family of spice merchants. This is *The Moor’s Last Sigh*. I have no idea whether Rushdie is a fan of the Russian classics. He probably is, given how well-studied he is. I imagine this is Rushdie's answer to *War and Peace*, and the lengthy, archetypal Russian epic. In a way, all of Rushdie’s novels are their own *War and Peace*. These are no short stories for the faint of heart or fleeting attention. These are magical realist stories as wide as they are deep, telling us the uncomfortable details of human lives from birth to death. *The Moor’s Last Sigh* is framed as the narrator, the last scion in a long line of Cochinese spice merchants, recounting to us the events including his family’s slow rise and meteoric decline. It is a story that spans across generations and across cities and across continents. Our Othello here is also a vehicle for exploring more of Indian history, Hindu Nationalism, the clash of beliefs in the subcontinent, and love. Love, love, love. The most potent spice of them all. Rushdie must be a romantic because love, like India, is a character in his books. Lovers in his books tend to have varying degrees of success as couples but love is unerringly portrayed as a potent and dangerous force. While reading this novel, I couldn’t help but notice the faint but irrepressible sensation of black pepper at the back of my throat. It must have been my imagination. After having years of life stolen from him by the fatwa, Rushdie returned to prove to the world that he was not at all creatively impoverished. 

Massive props to Rushdie for also conceiving the greatest sex scene in any novel ever. It might be the only competent sex scene ever written. You can’t convince me otherwise. Erotica authors and romance authors everywhere: read this book and take notes. Take notes. You’ll know it when you see it.

*The Ground Beneath Her Feet* (1999)

This is not quite a retelling of the Orpheus myths but more of a modern reframing of the Orpheus myths as a story of a fictional, legendary rock group from India. If *The Moor’s Last Sigh* was Rushdie’s homage to *War and Peace*, then this must be his homage to *Love in the Time of Cholera*. Another motif in Rushdie’s writing is the idea of duality, or rather an essential, Jungian “otherness.” Magical realism, as a device, is often deployed to make a statement about reality. In Rushdie’s own words, magical realism is best used to tell the truth in a new, creative way. I can say that he succeeded. Magical realism is used in Rushdie’s novels to highlight the faceted nature of human beings. There are no simple protagonists in these stories. Love, especially. Love returns as a character; this time, a more unrequited form of love. If you like Greek myths and tragedies, read this novel. If you like stories about sexy musicians, read this novel. If you like stories about unrequited love, this is definitely your novel too. 

Toni Morrison also loves this novel apparently, if that testimonial means anything. 

**3. The Rushdie essentials…**

*Midnight’s Children* (1981)

This was the novel I saved for last, on my reading list. I am hardly a scholar of literature. I doubt I could say anything approaching original about this timeless classic. I doubt I am saying anything original at all about any of these novels, as a matter of fact. Search the internet for any list-icle revolving around fiction rendered in the English language; you will find this novel on nearly all of them. I will never be on any awards committee. I will never truly understand the nuance required of awarding something as prestigious as the Booker Prize. This was not the first Booker I have read but after reading this, I started to see the very edge of understanding what actually is defined as a Booker Prize-worthy work. The best novels, written lovingly, are just portraits after all. What is *Midnight’s Children* a portrait of? Salman Rushdie is India and India is Salman Rushdie; this novel is a portrait of either or both. They are one and the same. *Midnight’s Children* is a portrait of a man and also a portrait of this many-limbed, ravenous, reasonless creature on Earth called a country. *Midnight’s Children* tells the story of the novel’s namesake, India’s midnight’s children, born at that hour when India gained its independence; each born with special powers. *Midnight’s Children* is also the perfect portrait of Rushdie as an author. It has, for good or ill, Rushdie’s signatures in their naked extremes: its genre-bending magical realism, its acrobatic prose, its self-satisfied narrator, its epic length,  its educational background, its personal pretense, its tragic lovers, its politics, its fairytale eroticism, and more. More and more and more. You do not need to devour the world to understand one person or one place; to come close, you would only need to read this novel. Then, and only then, might you come close to understanding because a world is encompassed in these less-than-one-thousand-and-one pages. You will either adore it or hate it. This novel is the gate. People are either turned away or encouraged to press on into the rest of Rushdie’s work. 

*Shame* (1983)

This is easy props to Salman Rushdie. He could have easily profited off himself and milked *Midnight’s Children* to death. Instead, he wrote a wholly original work that stands on its own. I loved *Shame* even more than I loved the aforementioned. In a way, they are each other’s companion piece. To tell a story about India, after all, is to also tell a story about Pakistan too eventually. Shame. By levelling an inquisitive gaze on the radicalized Not-Quite-Pakistan, Rushdie points an accusatory finger at the very soul of all hatred and bigotry: shame. The main character is an unlikeable, irreverent, skeptical physician born to three mothers; he is a gaping social and intellectual wound on the religious Pakistani society. *Shame* does nothing new or different than any other of Rushdie’s beloved novels but I must admit that out of all of them, this one has the most indulgent prose. 

**4. Novels for the Rushdie enthusiast only…**

*Grimus* (1975)

This is where it all started. This is Salman Rushdie’s debut novel. What is true of this novel is true to the rest of the novels in this group: one, that they are more difficult to rate, and two, that they include Rushdie’s more critically damned works. The sections on individual novels here will be shorter in this category for that reason.

*Grimus* reads like the novel I thought *The Satanic Verses* would be: its obtuse and somewhat inscrutable. Rushdie mentions in many of his interviews how he spent much of his youth infatuated with classic, pulpy science fiction literature. *Grimus* is Rushdie’s homage to those science fiction novels. This novel in particular is especially difficult because not only does it deploy esoteric ideas but its also draws heavily on, from what I could discern, Middle Eastern mythology and stories from obscure Sufi poetry. This combination of ideas, while interesting, is not always digestible. Hence why it is difficult to really conclude whether Rushdie is successful telling the story he wanted to tell. To me, I get the impression that this novel was Rushdie’s own personal experiment. This novel is just Rushdie proof to himself that he can be an author. Did I enjoy it and do I think its a good book? Yes, I did enjoy it. My time was not wasted but I found some parts of it unpalatable; I think it will be unpalatable to many other readers in general. 

*Grimus*: a long, prolix meditation on immortality. 

*The Satanic Verses* (1988)

Here it is: the infamous Satanic verses. The verdict? Its infamous for no good reason whatsoever but first, let me address the elephant in the room. This might be the most controversial part of my “review.” Yes, I am putting *The Satanic Verses* in the enthusiasts-only category. Why? Forget the notoriety for a moment. I personally do not think this novel does anything different than the novels nor better than the novels in my own favorites category or the essentials category. That’s not to say this is a bad novel. Its quite good and I loved it dearly. I just think that this is a horrible place to start if you want to try reading some of Rushdie’s work. 

So what is *The Satanic Verses* and what is so controversial about it? That is a loaded question but it gets easy if you think of the novel in parts. *The Satanic Verses* is one part novelization of the narrative of the Prophet Muhammed, told in dream or dream-like interludes. It is also one part magical realist parable about racism and  the immigration experience. It is one part, like all Rushdie’s novels ever written, also an exploration of religion and religious fundamentalism; although not quite the atheist parable it is often touted as often in lots of circles. That all sounds fine, right? So what was the “controversial” part? The “controversy” was generated from the first part I mentioned. In the “dream sequences” revolving around the prophet Muhammed, there are three essential things that upset the Muslim world. One: the suggestion that Muhammed, when receiving instructions from God or His archangels, was actually receiving instructions from the Devil. Two: the suggestion that Muhammed was told that Allah accepts several pagan deities of Mecca. Three: the suggestion that several Meccan prostitutes had taken the names of all of Muhammed’s harem. There is an unspoken fourth essential element that is perhaps the most damning: the suggestion that Muhammed was an ordinary man, flawed and fallible and possessing a capacity for as great ill as good; the suggestion that Muhammed could not hear gods nor archangels, and that he merely engineered his own instructions to use belief as a tool of control and manipulation. If I am being frank, the “present day” sections of the story were a little bit dry and definitely my least favorite stretches of the novel. They were by no means bad but I found myself far more enamored by the dream sequences. How much you enjoy *The Satanic Verses* depends on how much, or rather how little, you are already familiar with Islamic theology. I knew nothing. Which is why the sections taking place in the city of “Jahilia” were the most interesting to me. This point confounds me though. I don’t understand why this novel is so controversial among Muslims. From my rudimentary understanding of these complex subjects, *The Satanic Verses* does not make any original statements about the narrative of Muhammed. Perhaps someone more educated on this subject could enlighten me. 

So who is this novel for? I have no idea. It worked for me. The novel does make atheist suggestions but I wouldn’t call it the epitome of an atheist story. I wouldn’t exactly call this novel polemical either. I believe that this is one of Rushdie’s best books but at the same time, I do not think you will lose anything by skipping it. I often see this novel recommended as an entry point into the work of Rushdie. I said it before at the beginning of this review but I will say it again: I believe you should be immediately skeptical of anyone who first recommends any of the novels in this enthusiast category. That includes *The Satanic Verses*. To a serious devotee of English literature, I would only recommend this novel third. I am always going to recommend *Midnight’s Children* and *Shame* first. 

I will forever be exasperated by the fact the Rushdie had years of his life stolen from him over a novel so innocuous. 

Also, people are really overrating how hard this book is to read. Its really not that hard to read, people. Stop exaggerating that and trying to scare everyone. 

*Fury* (2001)

This is another novel that is hard to rate. This is, in my opinion, the closest thing Rushdie wrote to his weakest novel. At this point in my life, I have never read a single thing from Philip Roth. This novel reads like what I imagine a Philip Roth novel reads like. Rushdie says he is a massive fan of Philip Roth and that’s where I think this novel fails; *Fury* isn’t Rushdie writing at his best because here he is only writing in his best impression of another author. So what is *Fury* about? Like *The Satanic Verses*, *Fury* is a novel that can be described in parts. It is one part portrait of pre-9/11 United States. It is also one part satirization of the Philip Roth-esque, damaged artist-as-celebrity philanderer. I do not think this novel is as profound as it seems to be but at the same time, perhaps that is the point. Perhaps it is profound because its a story about shallowness. Perhaps that would be giving this novel to much credit. I would tell other people that they can skip this novel and not lose a wink of sleep. I don’t think my time was wasted reading this book but I don’t think I gained anything substantial either. 

*The Enchantress of Florence* (2008)

From what little discourse I have seen in online circles of Rushdie fanatics, there seems to be a prevailing sentiment that Rushdie’s weakest novels are the ones released after *Shalimar the Clown* but before *Quichotte*. I am going to have to take a stance here and wholly disagree. I absolutely adored all three of the novels published in this period of time. Do you like historical fiction? Do you admire the imagery and aesthetics of Renaissance Italy? You should definitely read this novel then. The reason why this is in the enthusiast category is because *The Enchantress of Florence* reads like a story told straight from the pages of *The Arabian Nights*. *The Arabian Nights*, much like the original and unsanitized fairytales compiled by the Brothers  Grimm and Andersen, are an acquired taste. Unless you have read and enjoyed *The Arabian Nights*, then you won’t enjoy this novel. *The Enchantress of Florence*, and the next novels Rushdie wrote, is the closest Rushdie will ever flirt with writing fantasy literature; fantasy in the vein of those old myths and folktales. This is the Rushdie sleeper-hit. 

*Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights* (2015)

This is another Rushdie sleeper-hit, where he flirts with fantasy. If you made it this far into the review, you will have seen that I do not think of *The Satanic Verses* as the premiere atheist novel. That title goes to this novel.

Earlier this year, I had the absolute pleasure of reading Ursula K. Le Guin’s *Earthsea Cycle* for the first time. I would describe that series as a feminist-flavored Taoist parable that criticizes the power structures often ideated by traditional fantasy literature. *Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights* (which I will now abbreviate as *TYEMTN*) is the *Earthsea Cycle*'s irreverent inverse. This novel I would describe as a magical realist, atheist parable that criticizes the power structures often ideated by religion.

Let’s get philosophical for a moment. Download this novel as a document you can edit. Search for and highlight every instance of the word Jinn or Jinni, then replace the word with either God or Allah. The effect? Nothing. Nothing would change. The story told is the same. If people are not responsible for their own actions, then who is? That is a central question posed constantly throughout the story. This central question and its exploration is the single most damning argument for atheism I have ever read. Forget Rushdie’s good friend Christopher Hitchens. Forget Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris or whatever flavor of famous atheist you choose to name. This novel is the premiere atheist novel, hiding shyly beneath the veneer of sheer fantasy. *TYEMTN* tells us the world we live in is fictional. In the real world, Jinn and Jinnis and their possession of us is the cause of human lust and greed and envy and hate and violence. Do you see the problem already? People on this planet already say that God compelled them to commit great or terrible deeds. A wealthy person gives half his fortune to charity; clearly it was a supernatural act. He must have been possessed by a good Jinn, or a Jinni in a good mood, so why should we bother recognizing his charity? A terrorist hijacks an aircraft and kills everyone aboard in a horrific suicide bombing; clearly he was possessed by an evil Jinni, or a Jinn in a bad mood. His actions clearly were not his own, so why should we punish him? The Jinn or Jinni told him to. This is the problem presented by the novel. This is the fissure, the gaping wound in all belief. To believe in God or Fate or astrology or what have you is to divorce human beings from blame, from agency. If you like your magical realism to suffocate you, read this novel. If you want to question all your beliefs, then read this novel; it is far more profound than it lets on. Don’t be fooled by all the magic bottles and sexy, wish-granting fairies. 

**5. A special section…**

*The Golden House* (2017) and *Quichotte* (2019)

These two novels deserve their own special section because they are both good and separate themselves from Rushdie’s *Fury*. I would firmly place *Quichotte* as one of the Rushdie essentials with the caveat that if you read *Quichotte*, I think you should also read *The Golden House* (which, individually, I would put *The Golden House* in the enthusiast column). The reason being is that these two novels represent an important period of Rushdie as an author. Rushdie, much like our king, Vladimir Nabokov, was eventually Americanized and his work was affected. These two novels, both in story and message, are uniquely American. Both novels are excoriating portraits of pre-Trump, Trump, and post-Trump America. All of America is naked; its ugliness, its bigotry, its anti-intellectualism, its pseudo-intellectualism, its hate, its violence, its detachment. Rushdie tells American stories with a distinct Hindu flavor and its brilliant. *The Golden House* being a satire about Trump-era America, vulnerable and full of humor. *Quichotte* is a hostile reprimand of America’s “trash culture:” its anti-vaxxers and flat-Earthers and reality TV stars and eccentric trillionaires and celebrated criminals. If you are American, definitely read these two novels. 

**6. Conclusions, Rushdie tropes, and Women…**

Earlier, in my discussion about *The Moor’s Last Sigh*, I praised Rushdie for conceiving the greatest sex scene ever seen in literature. I can happily praise Salman Rushdie for writing some of my favorite female characters too. *Shalimar the Clown* has the aptly named Californian named India and *The Moor’s Last Sigh* has the tiger-eating matriarch Isabelle de Gama. I love the female protagonists that Rushdie implemented. Despite all the sex and eroticism, you won’t ever find Rushdie on r/menwritingwomen; if you do, then I don’t think he belongs there. 

I am not saying Rushdie is faultless either. Rushdie’s body of work, like all authors, has its own idiosyncratic tropes: the young femme fatales, the nested storytelling, stories-as-homage, the cucks and cuckolds, the philanderers and playboys, the rich-have-problems-too, the seductresses, the lonely old men, et cetera, et cetera. However, in his defense, you probably won’t ever notice those tropes unless you read a lot of his novels like I did. 

I am not here to claim he is perfect. I am not here to be an apologist either. I only state that I think he writes female protagonists well and that his tropes, while not always amusing, are mostly forgivable. I included this section because I felt I must say this. There is a lot of discourse on this subject, especially in these online circles. 

Who is Rushdie for then? I think the novels of Salman Rushdie are there for all lovers of English literature. Those who have not been exposed to his work are missing an essential experience as a reader. If you love magical realism, if you crave prose style from a wordsmithing god, if you want post-colonial themes, if you want literature that will fuel your mind, then you should read Salman Rushdie. 

That concludes my review. Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, or want to let me know what you think, leave a comment. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p8xo73/i_read_all_twelve_of_salman_rushdies_novels/,2021-08-21 19:29:16,66,225,books
3m47b3,"Shakespere - the big fake (quite long, I have to make my case)","Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (12 April 1550 – 24 June 1604), was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and playwright. Since the 1920s he has been the most popular alternative candidate proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare's works

The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship proposes that de Vere wrote the plays and poems traditionally attributed to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon. Popular interest in the Oxfordian theory persists and his candidacy was featured in the 2011 Hollywood film Anonymous (directed by Roland Emmerich), in which he was played by Rhys Ifans. The case against William Shakespeare’s authorship is strong enough to have attracted many famous individuals.  A partial list of the Shakespeare doubters include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Thomas Hardy, Oliver Wendel Holmes, Walt Whitman, Otto von Bismarck, Benjamin Disraeli, James Joyce, James Barrie, Orson Welles, John Gielgud, John Galsworthy, Leslie Howard, Daphne Dumaurier, Malcolm X, Helen Keller, Derek Jacobi and US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.

Not to be discounted is the propaganda potential from government. The Shakespearean history plays are a superb and effective set of propaganda pieces that legitimize and glorify the Tudor dynasty. They are based on a revised version of Holinshed’s chronicles, commissioned by Secretary of State William Cecil, principal minister to the Queen.

Mark Twain, one of the most famous doubters, author of the essay “Is Shakespeare Dead?” wrote: “So far as anybody actually knows and can prove, Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.” Mark Twain, in his hilarious 1909 debunking of the Shakespeare myth titled “Is Shakespeare Dead?” points out that no one in England took any notice of the death of the actor William Shaxper (Shakespeare). “His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford. Does this mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of any kind? His death made no more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theatre-actor would have made. Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting poems, no eulogies, and no national tears. Contrast this with what happened when Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, Spenser, Raleigh and the other distinguished folk of Shakespeare’s time passed from life! 

Other doubters include:

Novelist Henry James - “I am ‘sort of’ haunted by the conviction that the divine William is the biggest and most successful fraud ever practiced on a patient world.”

Sigmund Freud - “It is undeniably painful to all of us that even now we do not know who was the author of the Comedies, Tragedies and Sonnets of Shakespeare.”

Charlie Chaplin - “I can hardly think it was the Stratford boy. “Whoever wrote them had an aristocratic attitude.”

Such famous doubters have been  joined by everyone from Orson Welles to Helen Keller. There is a large selection of individuals who might have had a hand in the writing of 
Shakespeare’s works. At last count there were more than 5,000 books on the Shakespeare 
authorship question with more than 50 possible candidates. The three most popular are 
Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and, currently the strongest alternative candidate, Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford. All 50 candidates have one thing in common: each is more likely to have written the works of Shakespeare than William Shaxper himself. 

Even Malcolm X became “intrigued over the Shakespearean dilemma” “If Shakespeare existed, he was then the top poet around.” “If he existed, why didn’t King James use him?”

Other candidates of Shakespeare authorship are Christopher Marlowe, Henry Neville, Mary Sidney, William Stanley, Amelia Bassano Lanyer, Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, 
Roger Manners and Sir Walter Ralegh amongst others. The lack of documentary evidence, a distrust of disputed texts, the improbable success of an unlikely individual and the notion that the “official” story can only be perpetuated by general ignorance and conspiracy by the establishment. How could an untraveled, poorly-schooled commoner have written so widely on topics about which he would have had no first-hand knowledge – court intrigue, the legal process, life in other countries, even stories and information that had never been translated into English?

There was a group theory as well.

Group Theory
It would seem impossible for any one person to have known as this much information in the era of Shakespeare and create this enormous body of work. They would have to have mastered many foreign languages, have apparent insider knowledge of the inner workings of the royal court, know legal phrases and concepts, have naval expertise and be familiar with European travel and sports of the nobility together with comic and acidic allusions to powerful people on the national stage. All anti-Stratfordians base their argument on the impossibility of ""the man from Stratford"" writing the plays due to his lack of education, his anonymity and his supposed limited knowledge of the law, the battlefield and the court. How could a mere commoner (feel the condescension dripping in the air?) ever write such works, or know about politics, or French and Italian vocabulary, or allude to Greek and Latin sources? Many point to educated Renaissance men like Sir Francis Bacon, or Edward de Vere (the Earl of Oxford) as more likely authors. De Vere did have a degree from Oxford University and a solid grounding in the law that would explain the number of Tudor legal phrases in Shakespeare's plays. He also lived in Italy for a few months--the setting of many Shakespearean plays such as Othello and Romeo and Juliet. He served as a soldier, and he was the nephew of a literary pioneer who helped popularize the sonnet in English. Another of de Vere's uncles translated Ovid's Metamorphoses, the source of many allusions in the Shakespearean plays.

Mary Sidney Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke, ran a literary academy at her estate in Wiltshire where most of the principal authors of the day spent significant periods of time, competing and collaborating. This academy was akin to a spider web with Mary Sidney and Fulke Greville at the center and strong links to all of the other candidates, all the theaters and acting troupes, the courts of England and Europe, the noble families, the politicians, the spy services and, especially, Stratford-upon-Avon and the First Folio of 1623.

One thing all these competing claims have in common – Shakespeare has been erroneously claiming authorship of documents for centuries. He did NOT write the material attributed to him.

Christopher Marlowe
Calvin Hoffman, in The Murder of the Man who was ""Shakespeare,"" argues that Christopher Marlowe did not die in a knife fight in 1593 (as listed in historical records). The whole affair was a hoax created by Marlowe's alleged homosexual lover, Thomas Walsingham (who is somehow equivalent to the ""Mr. W. H."" to whom the sonnets are dedicated), who thought that Marlowe was likely to be executed for atheism. Once believed dead, Marlowe could assume the nom de plume of ""Shakespeare"" and keep writing while he was hidden away on Walsingham's estate in a secret love-shack (exile to 
Spain is much more likely

The Case for Kit Marlowe writing Shakespeare’s material

The most plausible contender (IMO) is Christopher Marlowe (1564 - 1593?). He was born in Canterbury, the son of a cobbler. He obtained a scholarship to the King’s School, Canterbury, where boys were encouraged to write poetry in Latin and perform plays. He got a scholarship to Corpus Christi college, Cambridge. Six years of study & MA raised him to the status of gentleman.

He was connected to the Sidney-Pembroke circle through a dedication to the Countess of Pembroke and also connected to the nobility – he was very well known to both the Earl of Northumberland (Percy) and future Earl of Derby (Stanley). He was connected to Sir Walter Raleigh and astronomer Thomas Harriot and a member of the London literary scene - friend of Thomas Nashe, Thomas Watson and Matthew Roydon. He wrote with Thomas Kyd (who was tortured to death).

Marlowe's sham ‘assassination’ and inquest document is widely regarded by scholars as a cover-up. The three named witnesses to his death were all professional liars. Two worked, like Marlowe, as intelligence agents. Two worked as conmen. (One was both spy and conman.) All three were connected to Marlowe's friend and patron, Thomas Walsingham (head of the Elizabethan Secret Service?). Marlowe’s apparent death on 30 May 1593 occurred when he was effectively on bail. Marlowe was facing accusations of atheism, heresy and blasphemy – charges considered treasonous and likely to lead to his execution. The man said to have stabbed Marlowe, a lifelong servant of Marlowe’s friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (ahem), was pardoned with unusual swiftness and before he could be brought to trial. Since the killing was deemed to have occurred within 'the Verge' (12 miles of the monarch’s person), the inquest was conducted by the Queen’s Coroner, William Danby. The county coroner should also have been present, but Danby conducted the inquest alone, making the inquest legally void. Danby was a long-time friend of Lord Treasurer Burghley (William Cecil), Marlowe’s employer. Burghley had a history of protecting Marlowe from accusations of treason – including a potentially capital charge sixteen months earlier. Scholars have argued this is because the accusations in 1587 and 1592 arose from Marlowe’s working in the Queen’s service. (Much wriggling of eyebrows).

The Baines Note – a list of Marlowe’s crimes produced by a suspected Catholic double agent– was edited by a hand identified as that of Privy Councillor Lord Keeper Puckering. In the copy sent to the Queen, he altered 'died a sudden and violent death' to the more equivocal 'came to a sudden and fearful end of his life'. This 'end' occurred at the home of Mrs Eleanor Bull, cousin to the Queen’s favourite nanny, Blanche Parry, who was in turn a cousin of Lord Burghley. Charles Nicholl identified it as a government safe house, a stopping-off point for agents travelling to and from the continent.
Robert Poley, the key witness and one of the government's best agents, was carrying letters for the Queen, only 16 miles away, but took a week to deliver them. The brawl and assassination theories cannot explain this delay. The record for his payment for the period 8 May – 8 June 1593 states he was 'in her Majesty’s service all the aforesaid time'.

The only available substitute body was that of John Penry, executed suddenly the previous day, only three miles away. The body, unaccounted for, would have been the legal property of Danby. The faked death scenario has been proposed as a compromise meeting the needs of the two main factions of the Privy Council: the Cecil faction arguing to keep a valuable agent alive, and the faction headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, who would want to make an example of a notorious atheist. Marlowe's death was publicised as divine retribution. William Shakespeare was 'born' as an author shortly after Marlowe’s death. Venus and Adonis was registered anonymously on 18 April 1593, and the first recorded purchase on 12 June 1593, less than a fortnight after Marlowe’s apparent death, marked the first appearance of the name 'William Shakespeare' in any literary or theatrical context. Marlowe is the only candidate with a proven record of writing 'like Shakespeare'. Marlowe’s later works are indistinguishable from early Shakespeare. First Folio works such as Henry VI, Shrew, and Titus Andronicus were attributed to Marlowe until the 1920s. Key Shakespeare plays are re-workings of earlier Marlowe plays. Shakespeare quotes (and refers to) Marlowe throughout the canon. Marlowe has consistently matched Shakespeare in stylometric tests.

Faked death fits with several references in the sonnets that orthodox scholars have struggled to interpret including 'Though I (once gone) to all the world must die' (91), 'I to none alive' (112), and 'You are so strongly in my purpose bred/That all the world besides me thinkes y’are dead.' Sonnet 74 can be interpreted as referring explicitly to the events of May 1593, referring to the author's 'body being dead,/The coward conquest of a wretch's knife' and death as 'that fell arrest without all bail'. Slander followed by exile offers a firm basis for the 'outcast state' for the 'shame' and 'disgrace' mentioned throughout the sonnets (e.g. Sonnet 29). The author reports in the sonnets that his name has received 'a brand', and that it should 'be buried where my body is Sonnet 66 – 'Tired of all these, for restful death I cry' - tallies with the Marlowe theory in its description of 'right perfection wrongfully disgraced', 'art made tongue-tied by authority' and 'folly, doctor-like, controlling skill'.

And more...

Marlowe had the social breadth required to be the author:

From cobbler to Queen’s agent. Despite mixing with noblemen and duties that took him to foreign courts, he remained familiar with the yeoman class sensibilities strongly depicted in the Shakespeare canon. The Marlowe story fits Shakespeare’s obsessive themes. Shakespeare is obsessed with resurrection: 33 characters in 18 Shakespeare plays are wrongly thought to be dead. The author repeatedly returns to slander, false accusation, and loss of name and reputation. 19 plays explore exile.

The Rival Poet can easily be identified under this theory. In 'rival poet' sonnets 85-87, Shakespeare refers bitterly to 'both your poets'. Marlowe’s patron Thomas Walsingham became George Chapman's patron after Marlowe's apparent demise. Chapman, who claimed the ghost of Homer helped him write his translation of the Iliad, was first suggested as the rival poet who was 'by spirits taught to write' in 1874 (yeah, right). In 1598, Chapman published his continuation of Marlowe’s Hero and Leander, tripling the length and changing the structure: more than enough provocation to account for the tone and content of these sonnets. William Covell (who was at Cambridge with Marlowe) apparently confuses Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare in Polimanteia (1595): he suggests 'eloquent Gaveston' (a character in Marlowe’s Edward II) is one of Shakespeare's creations. He also calls Shakespeare 'Watson’s heir' (Thomas Watson was a document friend of Marlowe's). Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare are apparently confused in the Stationers' Register on 3 Jan 1600, when 'WS' is given as the poet who translated Ovid's Amores alongside the epigrams of 'JD' (John Davies). The author of The Newe Metamorphosis (JM, gent), writes about Marlowe in the present tense some time between 1600 and 1615: 'Kynde Kit Marlowe, if death not prevent him, shall write [Hero’s] story'. In The Merry Wives of Windsor, Shakespeare has Sir Hugh Evans confuse Marlowe's 'Come live with me and be my love' with Psalm 137, arguably the most famous song of exile in existence. In a widely recognised reference to Marlowe’s death in As You Like It, a line from Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta is altered to include a phrase from the inquest document – ‘the reckoning’ – a phrase 

There is a school of thought that says after Marlowe’s putative ‘assassination’ he lived in exile in Spain (out of sight) and used Shakespeare as a proxy author for his writing. I subscribe to this.

The case against Shakespeare

There is no evidence to show that William Shaxper (Shakespeare) was a writer. There are no original manuscripts of the plays or the poems, no letters and only six shaky signatures, all in dispute. Both his parents, John and Mary, were illiterate. His wife Anne Hathaway was illiterate. His children were illiterate, which would make Shaxper the only prominent writer in history whose children are known to have been illiterate. The actor from Stratford never went to college and as far as can be determined never had any 
schooling. There has been an attempt by Stratfordians to surmise that William Shaxper attended a grammar school in Stratford. No records of this exist and Shaxper made no mention of this school in his will.
 
The lack of any letters written by William Shaxper is particularly significant. As a great writer, it is likely he would have written a large number. Voltaire’s collected correspondence totals roughly 20,000 pieces. Shaxper’s, or Shakespeare’s collected correspondence totals exactly zero

William Shaxper’s will is four pages long and handwritten by an attorney. In these four 
pages there is no indication that he was a writer. The will mentions not a single book, play, poem, or unfinished literary work, or scrap of manuscript of any kind.  The absence of books in the will is telling, since to write his works the mythical William Shakespeare would have had to have access to hundreds of books. The plays are full of expertise 
on a wide variety of subjects including contemporary and classical literature, multiple foreign languages, a detailed knowledge of Italy. Italian language and culture, the law, medicine, military matters, sea navigation, painting, mathematics, astrology, horticulture, music and a variety of aristocratic sports like bowls and falconry. What happened to the hundreds of valuable books he would have assumedly collected during 
his lifetime? An exhaustive search of every bookcase within fifty miles of Stratford done in the 18th century failed to find a single book formerly belonging to the “world’s greatest author.” 

There is strong evidence to suggest that ‘Shakespeare’ was derived from the pen name “Shake-spear.” For an unschooled person, he also miraculously, possessed one of the greatest vocabularies of any individual who ever lived. The writer of Shakespeare’s plays had command of not only English, but Latin, Greek, French, Italian, German, Spanish and other languages. His French in particular is not of the classroom but reflects the vulgar speech of ordinary people. There are themes and passages from classical works untranslated in Shakespeare’s day. Among many examples, The Comedy of Errors was based on a Latin play by Plautus of which there was no translation. The thousands of new words Shakespeare added to the English language were created from his multilingual expertise. There is no way of reconciling the immense scholarship evinced in Shakespeare’s works with William Shaxper, who from birth was surrounded by illiterate people, had little or no education, and is believed never to have traveled outside England. 

William Shakespeare was a genius. This answer is generally supplied to all questions 
relating to Shaxper’s apparent lack of qualifications for the title of “world’s greatest 
author.” Genius however has its limitations. According to historian Thomas Macaulay, “Genius will not furnish a poet with a vocabulary; it will not teach what word exactly corresponds with his idea and will most surely convey it to others. Information and experience are necessary for strengthening the imagination. Genius may explain the literary skills in Shakespeare’s works, but it does not supply knowledge of places never visited or languages never learned. 

Elizabethan England was a land of brutal censorship. There was no freedom of speech. The Master of the Revels and the dreaded Star Chamber had the power to imprison and torture any writer. The playwright Thomas Kyd was essentially tortured to death. Christopher Marlowe was facing torture when he was murdered or, as some believe, staged his own murder and escaped (right-on). Playwrights Ben Jonson, Thomas Nashe, George Chapman, John Marston were all temporarily imprisoned for their writings. 
William Shaxper, supposedly one of the most prolific and successful of the Elizabethan 
playwrights, was never arrested. This fact is particularly astonishing given that the Earl of Essex sponsored a performance of his Richard II to encourage a rebellion against the Queen Elizabeth I. The Earl of Essex was arrested and executed, but Shaxper was never so much as questioned. 

Stratford-upon-Avon is one of the most successful tourist sites in England, though only 
about 10% of its visitors ever attend a play. People come not to see theatre but as pilgrims 
to worship a cult hero in his birthplace. As with virtually everything associated with the “historical” Shakespeare, the tourist sites in Stratford are pure speculation. “It is fairly certain” that the house on Henley Street is where Shakespeare was born and brought up, complete with (as the birthplace website proudly states) “recreated replicas.” The grammar school in Stratford has lost all records from the period, but “is almost definitely” where Shakespeare received his education. This institution even claims to have his original desk, which is “third from the front on the left-hand side.” On and on the fantasy is created with an avalanche of qualifiers like, “most biographers agree,” and “we are permitted to think,” and “we are warranted in believing,” etc. In 1969 the people selling tours of Shakespeare home were sued under England’s Trade Descriptions Act, which forbids false statements and claims in advertising. The court ruled that the Act did not apply since the historical site was a “Trust” and not a business. 

No one knows for sure who wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare. What can be said with some certainty is that William Shakespeare didn’t. 

Who wrote the plays?
An argument is that a nobleman wrote the plays, but for a different reason from shame at dabbling in common art. According to this argument, the plays were meant to be read as political commentary, with each character corresponding on a one-to-one basis with real political figures. The nobleman-playwright (be it Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, or Queen Elizabeth, or Walter Raleigh, or whoever) had to hide his identity so that the writer could denounce the current regime or certain political enemies without direct backlash. Thus, Hamlet's dying order to Horatio, ""tell my story,"" takes on incredible significance if you know that Horatio is the false Shakespeare and Hamlet is the true one--be he Bacon, the Earl of Oxford, Queen Elizabeth, Marlowe, or whoever. Thomas Looney's main argument in 1920 for Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, is that Oxford was the closest approximation to a royal prince at the time; he is therefore Hamlet, and thus Shakespeare as well. Similarly, Henry Pemberton argues that Shakespeare is really Walter Raleigh, as Hamlet's line describing Claudius as ""Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!"" could only be spoken by someone who hated the current king as much as Raleigh did.

Others have argued from incidentals about de Vere (who was a Lord). Edward de Vere's crest has a lion holding out a paw and shaking a spear (thus a pun on ""Shakespeare""). His copy of the Geneva Bible has passages underlined in it that also appear in the Sonnets, The Merry Wives of Windsor, and a Falstaffian speech. If nobles produced their works under their own names, they would face a certain social stigma from their peers. It's unseemly for a gentleman to dabble in entertainment for the rabble. At least that's how the argument goes. The theory was that some aristocrat who wrote the plays must have done a cover-up, hiring this nobody from Stratford to pretend to be the author.

Some arguments are based on anagrams or hidden messages in the plays. Cryptography and anagrams are especially popular with the Baconian school. Dr. Isaac Platt, by extracting certain letters from a famous line from Hamlet, ""The funerall baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables,"" comes up with an anagram of ""FR. BACONI NATI,"" which according to his unusual Latin means that Francis Bacon wrote the plays.
Another anagrammatical argument was proposed by Ignatius Donnelly, one of the most famous of the Baconians. He used a complicated cipher to drag ""More ... low ... or ... Shak'st ... spur ... never ... writ ... a ... word ... of ... them"" and other similar messages out of the text of the First Folio. Most modern scholars try to distance themselves from Ignatius Donnelly--given that he relied upon techniques of uncertain scholarship to gather evidence, including mediums at seances and liberal use

More recently, Joseph Sobran in his 1997 book, Alias Shakespeare, argued that de Vere wrote all the sonnets as part of a homosexual wooing of the Earl of Southampton, all hidden within the guise of courting her daughter. Shakespearean scholars in orthodox institutions became narrow-minded and protective of their territory. This coverup has been dubbed ""bardgate"" by Peter Dickson, a CIA official turned amateur revisionist Elizabethan scholar.

43d5oa,The books I read in 2015,"2015 Reading List

In this last year, 2015, I ended up with a grand total of over 34 books read.
The year before that, 2014, I read a total count of 44 books, and the year before that, 97 books, with 100 books the year before that, in 2012.   As I did last year, I have a rating system for the books I finished, my ""robot rating"", or R/R, and I have them in ranking from my favorites to my least favorite below.  I’m curious to know what type of reading you like or your recommendations.

1.   Abundance, by Peter H. Diamandis

Notes: This was my favorite book of the entire year, and I couldn’t stop thinking of all the implications of the bold concepts explored in this book. This made me learn very little about Diamandis, but lots about all the ways that we can now truly save the world and make lives better, in very creative ways.
RR: 5/5

2.       Rework, by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

Notes: A great read, with every turn finding more and more suggestions that are against the conventional wisdom. Written by the entrepreneurs that started the tech company 37 Signals, this book is really the anti-business book – iit’s a reminder that the corporate speak, meetings, and suggestions, productivity techniques, are all there to support work that means something or does something. Building the business, and your schedule, or your employee’s schedules, around that concept, and then refining the work, is simple, but powerful. Whether that works in other industries where the workload is already at capacity (that is, companies other than technology/silicon valley companies), remains, to me, to be seen, but there is no doubt that this is a well written book with powerful concepts all around one theme.

RR: 5/5

3.   Yes, Please, by Amy Poehler

Notes: This book, written (with help) by comedian and actress Amy Poehler, is an interesting and funny read. It's a very short read, to be certain.  I found her story about finding what you love to do fascinating, and touching, and her stories about improv training and becoming successful at what she loved to do anyway were well done.

RR: 5/5

4.       The Purple Cow, by Seth Godin

Notes: One of the current best sellers about marketing in the age of the internet, Seth Godin takes a simple concept – being so unique and different that you are automatically distinguishable from your competition – and goes into great detail on why that concept works. A simple idea, and a powerful, if short book.

RR: 5/5

5.       Speaking of Freedom, by George H.W. Bush

Notes:  I enjoyed this book much more than I expected I would. Bush was president at a crucial time in U.S. and world history. As the Soviet Union crumbled, the Berlin Wall fell, and the world seemed to scramble into new enemies and alliances, this is a fascinating exploration of exciting times for the planet. The real gem here is the commentary by Bush 21 years or so after his presidency. Yes, you can see the speeches on YouTube or CSpan. But I learned most from the commentary of the aged elder Bush, in his own words. He reveals in this book that he was not certain at all that he would win the presidency, or even the nomination, as all polls put him in third place. He would often read the speeches before speaking, and would sometimes cry, since they were often emotional (and reveals that the Navy Hymn always makes him cry). He had a deep fear that he wasn't as good a speaker as Reagan, his predecessor. He was hurt that many in the Republican Party criticized his Clean Air Act, as he considered himself an outdoorsman, thought the national parks was one of the best things the USA ever did, and wanted his party to be the one that protected the environment. And he had always thought that the Romanians were the eastern block country most opposed to the Soviet Union, and when Lech Walesa in Poland started a movement, U.S. Attention immediately changed to support polish interests, which surprised many in the State Dept and Council on Foreign Relations. All in all, very enjoyable. I learned a lot about this time in history.

RR: 5/5


6.       Wild Swans : Three Daughters of China, by Yung Chan.

Notes: I only learned at the end of this book, in the epilogue, that this book is still, to this day, banned in China. As an account of three generations of specific women in a specific region of China, it is a fascinating account of a culture that changed dramatically in 100 years. The book begins in the year 1911 with the grandmother of the author, who dictated her life’s history, including having her feet painfully bound for life, and being given to a Warlord General as a concubine when the family could not care for her, through World War II, Mao’s revolution and the country’s mass starvations and killings under Communism, and through the modernization of China from 1976 forward under Deng Xiaoping and up to 1992. An emotional, fully detailed look at three lives, what they suffered, what Chinese culture expected from them, and three women through amazing times in history. I learned much from this book.

RR: 5/5


7.     This Explains Everything, by John Brockman

Notes: John Brockman is a book agent, and highly intelligent individual, who focuses on science and society writers, and thus surrounds himself with other highly intelligent individuals. This book asks each of his clients one question, as he does every year. And it’s a big question: “What one thing explains everything?” The variety of answers, from a variety of people who are top in their field, including musicians, artists, tech company visionaries, psychologists, physicists, and scientists from all disciplines, is really a fun read, and even though all essays are short by design, many will make you think long after reading them.

RR: 5/5


8.     Brahms: His Life and Music, by Robert Greenberg

Notes: This look at the sad childhood of the composer, Brahms, and his eventual success and obsession with writing and rewriting music (none of which he ever thought was good enough, was amazingly well done. Much of the information contained here was well researched, gives a background that makes you feel as though you were there, or lived during those times, and has many anecdotes and examples of what made the music of Brahms great. Enjoyable and definitely worth the purchase.

RR: 5/5

9.     As a Man Thinketh, by James Allen

Notes: This book is a classic, originally published in 1902 (although not nearly by a couple of thousand years as old at the Marcus Aurelius book on this list). A collection of essays, each are short and well written, and goes into why most respond unconsciously to things, why your long term thinking affects your goals and your moment to moment thoughts either move you towards what you truly want, or away (or help define what you want). Short, but powerful, and recommended.

RR: 5/5


10.     Sum of Our Days, by Isabel Allende

Notes: This is more non-fiction than fiction, but not by much. Playing off the fantasy that the author’s deceased daughter would like a summary of family events since she passed away, this book follows the activities of a charming family, with the writing (translated from Spanish) following interesting conversations and all the events families go through, including birth, love, death, friendship, and enjoyment of life. Although Allende is a fiction author (I have not read her other books), and is a very good writer, this has the “realness” of describing real events, real successes and failures, to a real family, and is very very touching in many ways, including her travels around the world. A great read.

RR: 5/5


11.  The Politics of Diplomacy, by James Baker III

Notes: This book only covers the time period from 1988 to 1992, while Baker was secretary of State for the US Government. The saying, maybe apocryphal, that in Chinese the wish for good luck is “may you live in interesting times”, could not be more appropriate here. During that four year period, the US witnessed the fall of communist states all over the world, and then scrambled to assess whether the new states, some of which ended up in chaos, in war, or in the case of Russia, immediately having a coup and taking Gorbachev hostage, were amenable to diplomatic relations, joining existing treaties, and securing nuclear weapons. After that, the long buildup of diplomatic agreements, sanctions, and eventually a coalition war followed the years after Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied the country of Kuwait. While I was hoping for a more honest and frank assessment of his mistakes and what might have been done better, Baker is a good writer and examiner of this portion in history that he flew all over the world dealing with as it happened.

RR: 5/5


12.    Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

Notes: This famous book of meditations, written by a Roman Emperor to himself to remember the lessons of his life, is timeless. The edition I purchased had each essay edited by a different translator, which made for a strange and not cohesive whole, but the information in this short read is worth going over for everyone.

RR: 5/5

13.       Zero to One, by Peter Thiel

Notes: This book, by PayPal founder Peter Thiel, about founding companies, and bringing new concepts to change the world, through simple steps and actions, was well written. While recommended in the same vein as “Abundance”, above, the other book is very well written and is applicable to every human on the planet. The further away you are from the world of capital investing and silicon valley tech, the less you may find this book useful or interesting.

RR: 4.5/5


14.  Out of Your Mind, by Alan Watts

Notes: This book, which is really a transcript of the talks on meditation from the famous Alan Watts, was recommended to me, as I have always had an interest in meditation.  Watts philosophies on life and the mind are simple, and are discussed here. The overall message is to try to see the world as it really is, as difficult as that might be, and as much as your mind wants to impose constructs of what you want to have happen instead of the reality of just “what is”. With humor and discussions on the environment, technology, and information, this was an interesting book.

RR: 4.5/5


15.  Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the world of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation and Time Travel, by Michio Kaku

Notes: This is, as the title suggests, a book written for geeks. Less impossible, and more “can Star Trek and Back to the Future ever become real?”, this book is a little more simplified than some of his other books in an attempt to reach a more popular audience. The writing, as always, is excellent, and Kaku is great at fantastic speculation, which makes the book fun.  I wish there was exploration of other areas not covered by the book, but this is a book you may want to read twice if it is of interest of all.

RR: 4.5/5


16.  The Fabric of The Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality, by Brian Greene

Notes: One of the most famous books in science literature is The Elegant Universe, Greene’s discussion of his work (and collaborative work on) string theory. This builds on string theory, and discusses quantum mechanics, especially the Heisenberg Principle, and how that might affect the universe as a whole, but also speculates on how the universe might be different without either space or time, which the universe might not even need to exist. Written for the lay reader, which is great, for this high level physics discussion, Greene is always an easy writer to follow and has some fantastic mindblowing discussions of implications of string theory.

RR: 4.5/5


17.  Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics, by Henry Hazlitt

Notes: This famous best selling economics book is famous in certain political circles, but is also an easy read and are told in story form. Brilliant writing, in that the book explains the “one lesson” in chapter one, and then uses all other chapters to examine how that one lesson applies to a variety of situations, and how short sighted policies, or policies intended to address narrower and narrower situations, usually backfire and fail. This book originally came out in 1946, but is an interesting look at the economy as a whole, and what actions affect it.

RR: 4.5/5

18.  In the Ruins of Empire: The Japanese Surrender and the Battle for Postwar Asia, by Ronald H. Spector

Notes: This book takes a close look at the events starting in July, 1945 and onward, and documents how, for one, the Japanese surrender did not stop fighting – much of the military and the population believed that they should keep fighting despite the surrender. It also shows how much turmoil continued for decades in Manchuria, Korea, Indonesia, and China, leaving that state open to Mao’s deadly policies, that killed more than anyone else in history. The United States had not thought of any policies or playing any significant role in any country other than Japan, which led to Communism, war lords, and chaos to take place all over Asia. A very interesting look at the part of post WWII history that not many write about or discuss.

RR: 4/5


19.   In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson

Notes: This book has famous writer and humorist visiting, writing, and traveling all over Australia, to find out what makes it tick. You might feel you know Australia much better after reading this book, as I certainly did. While his look at Australia was very interesting, it seems to cover ground that has been well traveled by other observers. Plus, I don’t find Bill Bryson that witty or funny.

RR: 4/5


20.  Write It When I'm Gone, by Thomas De Frank.

Notes: This book is a unique look at president Gerald Ford, written by a journalist who traveled with him at the end of his presidency, and afterwards, and was told not to publish any of their conversations until Ford had died (hence the title). An interesting look at a reluctant president, and writing that makes him more interesting than he probably was in real life interactions.

RR: 4/5


21.     The 4% Universe, by Richard Panek

Notes: One of the most amazing things about our universe is that, with dark matter, and dark energy, which constitute 96% of what we know, can observe, and test. We know both are there, but don’t know exactly all the qualities of the majority of the universe. This book clarifies what that means and comes up with a comprehensive survey of what we do know about both, and what the leading theories on what it might mean are.

RR: 4/5


22.  The Eye Never Sleeps: Striking to the Heart of Zen, by Dennis Genpo Merzel

Notes: This book is a commentary and deep exploration of the meaning and lessons of a famous Zen poem by Sosan Zenji's. It is based upon lectures and as such, is a transcription of discussions of the opem. Exploring what it means to be conscious, to be self aware, and to be on a path of improvement, it was a fascinating look at a narrow text from one past writer, as analyzed by a modern writer and Buddhist. A very short read, and in some cases profound, in others illogical in its conclusions.

RR: 3.5/5


23.  Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life, by Henry Cloud and John Townsend.

Notes: As the title makes explicit, this book is a guide to determining what you can be responsible for, and what is beyond your resources, or your time, in an effort to make a balanced lifestyle the goal. Written very much from a biblical/Christian perspective, there is heavy bible quoting here, which is off-putting to most. This book could be streamlined to be an examination of the relationships with friends, family, and other commitments, and an instruction manual to take a close look at the time commitments and importance of each. For those that have no experience in time management, this may be a good start, but is not well written and is sidetracked in several notable instances.

RR: 3.5/5


24.  Black Holes and Baby Universes, by Stephen Hawking

Notes: This book is really a collection of essays, most over 25 years old. I am almost certain that the publisher wanted to get these in print to capitalize on Hawking’s position as the most famous scientist in the world. Because Hawking’s work as an astrophysicist that studies the physics of black holes is so narrow, however, and because this is a collection of essays, and not a unified whole, this book suffers from many redundancies, speaking to the same concepts again and again. There are essays exploring his personal life, which are worth much more than the other material, and which were fascinating and of interest to those who wish to know about his childhood and younger life, and his development of ALS, which is slowly killing him.

RR: 3.5/5


25.  How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Personal Success, by John Gray

Notes: As you would expect from the author of “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”, this book is very much simplified. But some of the concepts, including that material things and external trappings don’t bring much happiness, that gratitude is one way to train yourself to be gradually more satisfied with your life, and that each of us have a “love tank” (corny name) that needs to be filled with things or people in our life, are good concepts. Unfortunately, a much longer book filled with fluff and filler are built around those simple concepts, many of which were treated better in other books on this subject.

RR: 3.5/5

26.  Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe, by Freeman Dyson

Notes: This book is amazingly well researched, and in brief, looks at the accomplishment in building the world’s first digital computer, in England, to solve the problem of the German Enigma Code machines, and what theories and practice of that event have brought since then. It was having the machine have both the data and the instructions in the same processing machine that made for a revolution. Unfortunately, the great amount of well documented research makes for a somewhat dry book. And, unlike what you might expect from the title, the life of Alan Turing, and his personal accomplishments and private life, are almost nonexistent in this book, although he is discussed along with other people and institutions of his time.

RR: 3.5/5


27.   The King of Taksim Square, by Emrah Serbes

Notes: This fiction novel is one of those “you feel like you are there” novels that have many scenes that are excellent and skillful in drawing you in as a reader. Taking place in Turkey, involving the events during the Arab Spring, there are discussions of Michael Jackson, childhood, living with the constant threat of bombs, and how family changes in times of war or stress. However, the strong opening of this book quickly fades, and goes on for many pages just trailing off and away, without a strong message, conclusion, or much of it is boring, and almost calculated to not be interesting.

RR: 3/5

28.      Debt: The First 5000 Years, by David Graeber

Notes: Being a history of debt throughout history, the concepts of debt, and how they arose in different societies and civilizations, and what they mean today. This should have been a more interesting read, as it is just as important and interesting as the rise of theories and practices of capital, but unfortunately, the book goes on for much too long, and is too dry to recommend, with a heavier writing style than is appropriate given the long historical perspective here.

RR: 3/5


29.  The Fault In Our Stars, by John Green

Notes: This book, by YouTube star John Green, became famous for being a major motion picture. I knew John Green for his charity work and science videos on his channel, and was eager to see his take on fiction (although this is based upon a true life girl). Unfortunately, the writing is fairly amateurish, and the story too predictable to recommend this quick read.

RR: 3/5


30.  Storming Heaven - LSD and the American Dream, by Jay Stevens

Notes: This is the first book I’ve read start to finish via Amazon Kindle (in this case through an iPad). And I find it hard to analyze why I took all year to read this book. Was it the reading on a screen experience? Part of it could have been because the book takes a deep look into an interesting time – the, at the time, unregulated drug culture and other counter culture of the 1960s, and the history of LSD, from it’s accidental discovery through it’s use by the United States CIA and military, and its use in psychology circles for therapy, and beyond. But, while the real life characters presented here are fascinating, the writing is dry and brings dullness to what should have been a more vivid subject. I picked up this book because the writer of the book that became the Bradley Cooper film “Limitless” cited this book as the inspiration to that story. However, Glynn definitely seems like he handled the basic material with much more skill than this book did.

RR: 3/5


31.  Tattoos on the Heart, by Father Greg Boyle

Notes: This book, written by the founder of “Home Boy Industries” in Los Angeles, which goes out of its way to employ gang members and give people in poverty and in gangs a way out of their cycle of life. With great humor (some of which is certainly honed through using the stories in the book in sermons), it can be interesting. It’s not all good stories – the story of the company burning down for employing someone from a rival gang, and their scandal in funneling money to the Mexican Mafia is explored and touched on lightly.

RR: 3/5


32. 2666: A Novel, by Roberto Bolano

Notes: This book had won many awards and was much talked about before I picked it up. Part of that, certainly, is because of the author’s death. At 898 pages, it’s not a short read, and is definitely not an easy read. It jumps around a fictional future planet Earth, with discussions and long tangents on a variety of things, and has characters that are out of novels from 50 years or longer ago. Definitely epic, but frustrating. It’s part fairy tale, and part a series of short stories, in a way, with much dialog and quotable sections. But overall more a book for other writers interested in epic novels, and for academics interested in fiction structure, than a recommended read. I almost was more confused after reading this book than when I started, and was glad when it was over.

RR: 3/5



33.    13 Things that Don't Make Sense: The Most Baffling Scientific Mysteries of Our Time, by Michael Brooks

Notes: I attended a lecture on dark energy and dark matter, and so purchased this book, and was curious to read all about both, along with other “mysteries”. Unfortunately, other than the discussion of dark energy and dark matter, there is a discussion of much pseudoscience that has been firmly debunked elsewhere, from one time alien signals, homeopathy (really?), free will, and cold fusion.  Not much mysterious in most of what the author tries to make otherwise.

RR: 3/5


34.  The Time Of Your Life, by Anthony Robbins

Notes: This several day program focuses on particular goals, and portions of your life, improving each one at a time. Unfortunately, as is the case in Robbin’s later works, the book rambles into side issues, bragging, personal stories, that may or may not be relevant, name dropping of people he has met, and would benefit greatly from an editor. It seems to be the policy of the Robbins company that “more is better”, and focusing the words or subject matter doesn’t seem to ever happen, as it did in his earlier books edited by a publishing house.
