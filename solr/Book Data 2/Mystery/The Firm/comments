wv45bg,"I read The Firm as a hardcover new release back in 1991.  I don’t get the hate.  It was a good story and topped the bestseller list for ages.  It’s mass market fiction, not fine literature.  I was entertained.  That’s why I read bestsellers.  I watched the movie some years later on a tube TV with chunks of it edited out and lots of commercials.  The second half of the movie doesn’t follow the book at all.   Again, mass market popcorn movie.   I was entertained.  

I haven’t read a Grisham book in ages.  I think the last one was A Painted House and that was 2001.   I should probably circle back and re-read a few of the early ones.",ZaphodG,2022-08-23 10:22:41
wv45bg,"I had to read **The Firm** in my 7th grade English class when it was chosen as a selection for the advanced reading group. I remember uncomfortably trying to choose a euphemism for ""sex"" when writing a plot summary. I'm still not sure who decided this book was appropriate for 7th graders, or how there were no complaints from parents.",Harriets-Human,2022-08-23 12:17:26
wv45bg,"Not really.  Grisham was a totally unknown author when he wrote that book.  It was his second book and it took him 4 years to find someone to publish the first one.  The Firm was mostly written before his first book had it’s initial tiny 5,000 copy printing.   Hollywood had no clue Grisham existed.",ZaphodG,2022-08-23 10:30:13
wv45bg,"The part that shocked me was when >!the main character cheats on his wife by having sex on a beach with a woman he just met. It turns out it was a setup by the firm, and they photograph it, then use the photos to blackmail the main character.!< If I read it today, it would probably seem really tame, but that was the first time I'd been exposed to something like that. Plus since it was for school I had to talk about it with my classmates and teacher, which made me even more uncomfortable.",Harriets-Human,2022-08-23 17:32:46
wv45bg,"Totally agree, that’s the vibe I got. The plot is compelling, but very generic and essentially none of the characters are fleshed out or seem real at all, they’re basically just tools to move the plot along. I’m just getting into reading as consistent hobby and read the Firm after finishing Michael Connelly’s The Lincoln Lawyer and the difference is night and day, LL seems very grounded and realistic, the characters very layered and imperfect, the day to day life of a defense attorney(which I find very interesting) woven seamlessly into the main plot, etc. the firm on the other hand essentially felt like reading a screenplay which made it easy to follow and get through but didn’t leave me feeling much of anything when I was done",Conscious-Eye5903,2024-03-25 15:31:23
12g6zzb,I had to read **The Firm** for 7th grade English class 19 years ago. I have no idea why this book was considered appropriate for middle schoolers. I remember being uncomfortable about the sexual content.,Harriets-Human,2023-04-10 00:32:39
12g6zzb,"I forgot to add that they changed the ending in the movie significantly and it’s the only movie I’ve ever liked more than the book. Highly recommend! I am about to watch it again for the first time since I read the book when I was 10 yrs old. 

I’m really contemplating reading the book first though because I’ll probably understand it a lot more now than back then. I began reading novels like VC Andrews & Grisham in 5th grade because I was a strong reader. We didn’t have TV and I grew up on a very small island so I was easily bored and was the kind of reader that would walk into poles trying to walk and read. Still, I wasn’t exposed to a lot at that age so I’m really wondering how I was able to understand the book so well. 

When I was 9, I got this thing that looked like a calculator but it was a dictionary. It was probably the best gift I can remember ever getting in my childhood. It fit in my pocket and I was able to pull it out & look up words. Within 6 months, I was able to begin reading adult novels. I think that dictionary is how I was able to understand them. 

The Firm was my first. To this day, I still want to go visit the Cayman Islands and drink a Red Stripe. It’s really strange, too, because it can’t be much different from the island I grew up on. Back then, I imagined all of these cool mobsters running around, though. I thought I’d be able to tell just by looking at someone if they were in the mafia. LOL!",whteverusayShmegma,2023-12-18 07:56:04
12g6zzb,"I’ve seen a LOT of corruption as a legal investigator and I can tell you personally that John Grisham managed to do something that few others have. He worked as a criminal lawyer and then spent 7 years in politics. It’s almost impossible to be successful in either field without being equally as corrupt.

Grisham used writing to not only get out of it but to then be able to successfully work in activism. Not just that but he did so by writing about the corruption. Not only that but he was able to be a type of whistleblower by showing the world what goes on. Most lawyers, police officers, etc. think they’re going to make a difference, change the world. They don’t realize that’s not how it works until they’re balls deep in with student loan debt and their prime years gone. So they become part of the problem.

I understand the sexism and racism is probably hard to swallow, especially as a Mexican woman. The firm was only his second book, both written around the same time. So you’re reading the work of almost 20 years of someone who was successful in two of the most racist and sexist institutions in our country. 

I’m sure his later work might be much better but it’s never going to be as raw as his earlier stuff- if that makes sense? To me, this is a way of learning how to navigate the sharks in the waters of my field by becoming familiar with their tactics in a way that’s more entertaining and a lot easier to stomach than reading into the many similar case files as my own.  Plus they have a happier ending and give me some hope!",whteverusayShmegma,2023-12-18 07:36:08
e71l75,"The Firm was one of my favorite books in the nineties and I have read it at two or three times and found it riveting. But it might not have aged well, the genre of thrillers has changed much since then, as have our own life experiences. Maybe if you are not into it after 140 pages don't waste your time.",Samantha_M,2019-12-07 13:18:29
e71l75,"I feel a lot of them have been influenced by the fast-paced plots of movies and video-games. I like the slow-moving, tense ones that have somewhat of an intellecutual bend. But also, the plot seems a little bit fallen out of our time. The Firm is very clearly a 90ies thriller, it belongs to its time just as recognizable as the spy thrillers of the cold war era did. Today a thriller that revolves around attourneys billing too many hours and is resolved by an indictment for mail fraud would gather much of an audience?",Samantha_M,2020-05-09 09:50:07
1bzhwg4,"I went back and re-read *The Firm* before reading *The Exchange.* *The Firm* is excellent.  *The Exchange* was indeed horrible.  The plot was poorly developed and the ending was very unsatisfying.  It felt rushed.  I was particularly irked by how suddenly the Mob was not interested in pursuing someone who took down a whole family from the inside and stole millions in Mob money.  At the end of *The Firm* we were left believing Mitch was gonna be on the run for the rest of his life, but with barely a paragraph it was explained that nobody cared anymore and he can just resume his law career. I felt cheated by the whole thing.  Instead of Mitch developing as a character, he seems to have lost depth and became much less interesting or compelling.",DrBarry_McCockiner,2024-04-09 13:18:05
1bzhwg4,"The Firm, Runaway Jury, The Client, and A Time to Kill are all very enjoyable reads. I read Grisham like I read Lee Child and John Irving, palate cleansers between heavier stuff.",StephenKingRulez,2024-04-09 04:23:30
1bzhwg4,"Loved the Firm. The Exchange could have been about anyone, wasted Mitch McDeere.

I’ll take The Last Juror any day.",Novel_Patience9735,2024-04-09 04:42:58
1bzhwg4,"I thought the book was okay, even if the final act just fizzled out.

The problem really was this wasn't a sequel to The Firm.  This felt like a book Grisham wrote, then thought afterwards ""Oh I could make this about the McDeeres"" and just replaced some names and added a couple of bits for lore.  Not a sequel in any means, and disappointing it was billed that way.",ReacherSaidSomething,2024-04-09 10:52:24
1bzhwg4,"I've read a couple of John Grisham's books, including _The Firm_. Some better than others, all very entertaining. Mainly ones from the '90s.

Then earlier this year I got _The Exchange_, hoping it would recapture some of the fun of _The Firm_, and it was a letdown.

It feels like Mitch was contractually added and the stuff relating to the events of _The Firm_ was tacked on to a different story. It never used the cunning Mitch showed in the earlier book.",TheJFGB93,2024-04-09 12:28:19
1bzhwg4,"I was also disappointed.  The Firm was the first Grisham book I read, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I snapped up The Pelican Brief, The Client, and The Rainmaker.  These books all had compelling plots.  The Exchange, not so much.  Much of the book is about scraping together a $100 million ransom for a legal associate - despite legal bans of not negotiating with terrorists.  Now this could have been a compelling legal and moral discussion point, but was reduced to 'well others ignored it and paid the ransom anyway', and 'sure the terrorists will be able to use the money to spread death and destruction, but our associate's life was in jeopardy'.  Ugh!  I expected better.",TennisGuy6161,2024-04-09 14:11:35
1bzhwg4,"Seems like the consensus is that this book is not representative of the quality of earlier books and especially disappointing as a “sequel” to The Firm. Will give A Time To KillThe Firm, or The Pelican Brief a try at some point. Thanks everyone.",wanderluster,2024-04-09 14:40:18
1bzhwg4,"I've read at least 40 John Grisham books.  Some are better than others.  Give the guy a break, they can't all be as good as The Firm.",Silly-Resist8306,2024-04-09 03:30:53
1bzhwg4,I didn’t feel like it was the same characters from the Firm at all. They just didn’t seem like the same people. Just didn’t like it.,BORGQUEEN177,2024-04-09 04:08:51
1bzhwg4,"I am currently suffering through The Rainmaker, and if I bother to finish it, it will be my last Grisham book.  

I was curious about him because he is so popular - which in and of itself doesn't really mean shit, but I wondered if I was missing something.  I started with The Firm, which I'd seen when it came out, and which was pretty good.   Then I read something, can't recall the title, but it was about an ex-priest who was involved in something like the Innocence Project, helped innocent people on death row get new trials.  I guess I would say, generously, it was more subplot than plot.  And the Rainmaker is that times about three; it's almost as if Grisham can't carry a single plot and thinks he has to throw in a ton of other shit to swell the page count and make it look interesting.

Well, it's not.  I have a library run scheduled for Friday afternoon and regardless of whether I'm done or not, its going back in the Free Little Library from which it came.",calcaneus,2024-04-09 17:39:17
1bzhwg4,Totally agree with you. The Exchange was an unworthy sequel to The Firm.,Historical_Pop7853,2024-04-10 01:54:42

1bzhwg4,"Agreed.

The Firm, Rainmaker and Pelican Brief were all good reads.  The movies were good.  Pelican Brief the movie was fairly different than the book.",fm2606,2024-04-09 16:39:02
1bzhwg4,I re-read The Firm last year after reading it as a new release a jillion years ago.  I liked it and liked that was different from the movie.   I’ll probably circle back and re-read some of the old Grisham.  They’re entertaining.   I haven’t read a Grisham since A Painted House.,ZaphodG,2024-04-09 15:29:45
1bzhwg4,Thanks for replying. I’d definitely like to give him a break! Would you say The Firm is one of his best books? Is the writing and plot of a different style and substance to The Exchange you’d say? This is my first Grisham experience.,wanderluster,2024-04-09 03:34:36

It was insanely popular in the early 90s, meaning you can get a used copy for dirt cheap. ",kevstev,2012-12-06 18:44:35
14e8co,"The sequels to The Lincoln Lawyer. I've only read the first two in the series but I intend to go back to the others soon. The Lincoln Lawyer was the first legal thriller I read and it sort of stunned me with how exciting such a boring sounding genre could be.

* [The Brass Verdict (2008)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brass_Verdict)
* [The Reversal (2010)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reversal)

With this next in the series:

* The Gods of Guilt (2013)

I'm currently reading [The Rainmaker by John Grisham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rainmaker_(John_Grisham), about a quarter of the way through and really enjoying the premise — a law student struggling to find work — which seems more down to earth than  Mickey Haller's high flying courtroom drama.
