ui1igd,Opinions on 'The Alienist' and 'The Angel of Darkness' by Caleb Carr,"Let me start of by saying that my reading taste is spread over many genres. I try to get a taste of the 'best' of each genre so I can understand why the genre is popular. The only things that I almost never read are romance and action-packed thrillers (aka airport novels).

Now, the detective genre is also one that I tend to stay away from, because most of the books are set in the present and tend to get repetitive really quickly. However, Caleb Carr has something special going on in my opinion with the 'Dr. Kreizler' series. It's still a detective/mystery novel in its essence, but the fact that it's set in the 19th century and has a cast of interesting characters that all support the story in their own way just make this something special in my opinion.

Any opinions from you guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ui1igd/opinions_on_the_alienist_and_the_angel_of/,2022-05-04 07:58:41,32,8,books
n1vapq,The death instinct vs The Alienist,"I’m a third of the way through The death instinct by Jed Rubenfeld and it reminds me very much of The Alienist by Caleb Carr. In both, the team to crack the mystery is made up of 2 men and a woman. In both, one of the men is a doctor and the other is a policeman/detective. 
I’m also bothered by the stereotypical portrayal of the characters. The bad guys are fat, or have whiskers, or are ugly or foreign, or speak with an accent. The good guys are elegant, smart, academic types.

88rc2a,The Alienist novel vs The Alienist show adaptation. Differences between both?,"I just finished the TNT adaptation, and while I loved the overall cinematography and world building throughout the season, I was very let down by the finale. I wasn’t expecting the show to wrap up like some run-of-the-mill CSI episode, but I really felt like the finale was rushed and anticlimactic. For those that have read the book and watched the series, are there enough differences in the book that it’s worth reading now? For those that have only read the book, (without discussing spoilers), did you feel that the book ended without answering some of the core questions? Or does the overall journey of the book make reading it worthwhile? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/88rc2a/the_alienist_novel_vs_the_alienist_show/,2018-04-01 14:56:10,4,4,books

I've never been a fan of historical mysteries, but this is a leauge above the rest. I have never been to NYC in my life, and Caleb Carr described it so well, it felt almost intimate. 

I'm putting all my previously schelduled reading on hold so that I can start the sequel!

1avoazl,"Has anyone read ""An Instance of the Fingerpost""? I binged it in a week and it finally got me over both my The Alienist historical crime fiction hangover and also all that I couldn't get over in 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle","I'd love to talk about this book if anyone else has read it.

Basically, I read *The Alienist* by Caleb Carr and failed to get into a historical mystery/crime novel since. The last time I felt that way was maybe like 7+ years ago when I first read *The Historian* and *Perfume*. What I really liked about The Alienist was the naturalistic way that Caleb Carr brought the world of turn of the century New York slums to life with gritty detail but without loss of pacing in the plot.

Then during COVID, I also read the *7 1/2 Lives of Evelyn Hardcastle*, which I also loved - every bit of the atmospheric historic mystery from different points of view, up to the very end when it takes a weird turn. I did not like the last 10 pages but this post isn't really about that. Since those two books, I've been looking for another deeply engrossing historical mystery/crime novel that is heavy on the mood and period details without losing the plot and bonus points if there is also multiple POVs and unreliable witnesses (yes, I have read all the main Christies).

I tried *Name of the Rose* by Umberto Eco which was a good mystery but somehow failed to grip me in atmospheric tension (ok, maybe I just don't care that much about monks). I also tried by *The Wolf and the Watchman* by Niklas Natt Och Dag, which takes place in end of 18th century Scandinavia (similar to time to *Perfume*) and was horribly grim (more than either *Perfume* or *The Alienist*) but without as rich character portrayals or intricate plot of those books. I also read *Fingersmith*, *The Miniaturist* and *The Glass Woman* which were historic domestic thrillers, more *Rebecca* than crime fiction.

I finally stumbled across this book. Which despite being a New York Times Bestseller in the 90s, I have never heard of until now and didn't really know anything about. It's fantastic. Quite huge, which was a surprise when I received it in all its 700+ page glory but very intricately plotted. The mystery unfurls backwards in a steady pace from the POV of 4 different characters. And those characters were very realistic for the time and place (17th century ye old Oxford), with their prejudices and thought processes and odd quirks. I love the sense that you can't totally trust any of them as they recount what they witnessed through their own lenses - especially the first time the POV switches and you realize that they are giving very different accounts of the event. 

The marvel and reward after all those pages is how collectively by the end of the book, the POVs intricately come together with the fourth POV and reveal the mystery. I think despite the length, this book was more engrossing for me than *Name of the Rose* because of the diversity of well drawn characters in various professions, various social classes - some are honestly repulsive, some are quite charming. There is a slight but distinct fantasy element, but like the ""man in the plague doctor mask"" in *7 1/2 Lives of Evelyn Hardcastle* for most of that book, it didn't really detract from the historical accuracies and feel of the book, and unlike *Evelyn*, it didn't take the extreme twist in the end.  I was very impressed with this book.

c5utd0,The Alienist by Caleb Carr,"I just wanted to come here and rave about this book. I know I’m a little late to the party on this one. 

I’m about halfway through and it has completely engrossed me. I find Carr’s writing to be thrilling. From the first chapter I knew this was going to be a wild ride. Unfortunately life has gotten in the way so it will probably take me a few more days to finish, but I wanted to know everyone else’s thoughts on the book!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c5utd0/the_alienist_by_caleb_carr/,2019-06-26 19:51:48,8,11,books
a1clrs,"r/Books, should I continue reading The Alienist?","I'm 126/495 pages into the book, I think it's written well and the author definitely knows his NYC history, but for some reason it's not really pulling me in. I can't explain why not, I don't dislike it but I'm not sure if I want to commit that much more reading time to it if I'm not super digging it this far in. Does it pick up more if I keep reading? The other thing is, I was thinking of watching the show, but did some reddit searching about it and seems that most prefer the book to the TV series. Ahh, I hate not finishing books that I started but there's soooo many others I want to read! What do you guys think? 

EDIT, one month later: FINISHED IT. It was alright in my opinion, not a huge fan but I liked the author's knowledge of old New York City and the minds of murderers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a1clrs/rbooks_should_i_continue_reading_the_alienist/,2018-11-29 01:21:58,11,1,books

8rzczb,How close is Netflix’s “The Alienist” adaptation to the source material?,"I’m almost done with season 1 of the Netflix show, and would love to resume the story. In these cases (like with GoT) I usually reread all the books, but I’m 4 books deep into Malazan so I don’t really have the real estate to read books if I don’t need to. And so I‘m here to ask you guys, is it similar enough that I could simply start from book 2? Or is there enough of a difference to warrant reading the first book seeing as I _really_ hate missing out?

cjvmph,The Angel of Darkness is a tedious trial (no pun intended).,"To preface, I’m a huge fan of Carr’s The Alienist, the predecessor to the Angel of Darkness. It’s a great mystery done well. Most importantly, there’s no *fluff*, which is my main gripe with the sequel. In the Angel of Darkness, Carr spends too much time narrating (from Stevie’s pov) the movements and actions of the group which are completely extraneous to the plot. As an example, Carr likes to narrate not just *where* the group goes in NYC, but *how* they arrive there. Hansom (the 19th century cab) is probably the most recurrent word in the book.

And this kind of writing weighs down the scenes and images in the book that actually stand out on their own. They become muddled with details that add nothing to the story. In my opinion, I don’t think Carr was as confident in this book as he was in the first, which would explain its length. A lot of writers think volume makes up for whatever a novel lacks in intrigue. But Carr could have shaved the novel down by a couple hundred pages by editing out all the extraneous narration I’ve briefly described here, and I think it would have improved the story immensely. Because he didn’t, I found the book too tedious to enjoy.

For those of you who have read it, what do you think of it? Did it lose you at any points?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cjvmph/the_angel_of_darkness_is_a_tedious_trial_no_pun/,2019-07-30 18:09:39,3,1,books
