ui1igd,"I enjoyed The Alienist, but I would consider it a mash-up of Silence of the Lambs and Sherlock Holmes with  enough action to place it in the airport book category.  Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the characters and especially the descriptions of 19th century New York, but I wouldn’t consider it a best in class.",ABoyScorned,2022-05-04 10:25:57
ui1igd,Your reading taste sounds really similar to mine. I’ve not yet read The Alienist but I’ll certainly give it a go. I also find the modern detective story generally a bit samey. There is a book I’ve read you might like that sounds similar called The Interpretation of Murder by Jed Rubenfeld. It’s set in 1909 and follows Sigmund Freud and a young apprentice as they try to solve a murder. Let me know what you think if you read it.,BookCat91,2022-05-04 08:10:35
ui1igd,I remember reading and really enjoying *The Alienist* when it came out back in the 90s.  But 25 years has dulled my memory from being able to talk about it in depth any more.,Ineffable7980x,2022-05-04 19:34:37
ui1igd,The Alienist is the one book I NEVER get back when I lend it out. It and Angel of Darkness are great books and I wish he’s write more with those characters,aretmis_Smoke2144,2022-05-05 00:37:43
ui1igd,"Action packed thrillers are not inherently Airport novels, they can be but it's a guarantee. In fact I'd say the Alienist is a perfect example of an airport book, something quick, fun, and easy you can read while sitting at an airport.

It's not going to be an in depth character study of morality and consciousness, it's not going to leave you with an existential crisis, and that's fine. They're not meant to be that. They're fun thriller books about solving crimes, with an easy writing style that isn't exactly pushing boundaries. Again that's totally fine for what they are, but they're not world class literature or the best in their class.

I'd argue in terms of being best in their class detective works, something like The Long Goodbye, L.A Confidential, The Snowman are leagues above the Alienist. Though I won't pretend to be an expert in the genre, I haven't read as many books in it as I have others and I'm sure there's someone who can give more and better recommendations than I can. To me though the Alienist is a fun romp through the period but it's not exactly striving for anything more than that.",TheJester0330,2022-05-05 05:25:40
ui1igd,"Loved *The Alienist*, didn't know it was the first of a series. Thanks for a couple new books to read!",chileheadd,2022-05-04 15:54:08
ui1igd,"Added to TBR! It sounds really similar to the Alienist, because Dr Keizler also tries to get into the head of his antagonist from a psychoanalytical point of view (what they called alienist back then, hence the name).",Ritchiiee77,2022-05-04 08:14:08
ui1igd,"I'd like to argue against the fact that The Alienist is an airport novel, as it doesn't fall into the categories you describe. It is indeed a study of morality and psyche of the victims, but it's woven into this detective story so it's not considered as a dense book (like some of the Russian classics).

I will definitely check out the recommendations though!",Ritchiiee77,2022-05-05 07:07:40
ui1igd,"I'm about 55% in, it's great up until now, although it seems the case and crimes in the Alienist are a little more gruesome than in this one.",Ritchiiee77,2022-05-04 19:44:50
n1vapq,"I only read *The Alienist* of the two and I enjoyed it a lot! I don't remember the characters being particularly stereotypical. The heroes' team was made up of a young woman, a socialite, a Hungarian alienist and two Jewish detectives - pretty diverse crew for a story set in the late 19th century. They were indeed smart and academic types most of them, but I didn't find that offputting (after all, they get in plenty of trouble), I think the author did a really good job creating a fun and engaging dynamic with them and the villains (who were less memorable, but I think the main antagonist there was supposed to be the dark side of the human mind, which is where most of the attention went). 

Perhaps reading one is fine, but reading two works that seem too similar starts to be a drag? Imo, try to see if there are enough differences and if *The death instinct* has something peculiar that makes it enjoyable on its own. If there is nothing, don't force yourself to finish it if it bothers you too much.",Last_Lorien,2021-04-30 17:24:37
n1vapq,"Sorry, I wasn’t clear. The Book that bothers me is The Death Instinct. In it, the characters are, imho, stereotypical. And, as it is written years after the Alienist, the setup looks suspiciously similar. I keep on reading just because the plot is interesting and makes me curious to know how it is solved.",catonroof,2021-05-01 05:21:42
8t857t,"Great book, and the sequel, *The Angel of Darkness* is good, too. 

Carr is also working on two books within *The Alienist* universe: a pseudo-prequel to *The Alienist* focusing on Dr. Kreizler soon after graduating from Harvard, and a sequel to *The Angel of Darkness*, focusing on violence/terrorism during WWI.",MicahCastle,2018-06-23 11:49:52
8t857t,"I always think you guys are talking about Machado de Assis's The Alienist and I want to say: oh shit, that's one of my favorite stories! But then it never is ",,2018-06-23 07:11:09
8t857t,"I love *The Alienist*, and the sequel *Angel of Darkness* is great also. It's narrated by the Steve Pipe, which takes a little getting used to, but IMO enhances the period feel. The TV series was OK, but I wasn't crazy about Luke Evans as John Moore.

I haven't really liked anything else Carr has written.",FTLast,2018-06-23 10:25:00
8t857t,For split second I always mix up The Alienist and The Alchemist and then I feel foolish. ,GillianOMalley,2018-06-23 14:02:28
1avoazl,"I love Pears! My favorite of his is The Dream of Scipio, but I really enjoyed An Instance of the Fingerpost as well.

Also a big fan of Perfume and The Alienist. But I do adore Eco - I think you might like Foucault's Pendulum better than The Name of the Rose.",Hypatia76,2024-02-21 04:55:20
10qbk1,"Great book. If you're looking for more in the same early-days-of-forensics/criminal-profiling vein you could check out *In the Shadow of Gotham* by Stefanie Pintoff. (also obviously the Alienist's sequel, *The Angel of Darkness*)",OldManSimms,2012-10-01 00:39:08

8rzczb,"Don't know about The Alienist but the Hannibal show doesn't become a straight retelling of the books until it hits its (to date) final story arc, and even that has some big changes. Prior to that its a total scrambling of events and characters from the books mixed with new material.",DustyFeedbag,2018-06-18 17:02:41
8rzczb,"The Alienist sticks close'ish to the plot. However, it's hard to not imagine someone , anyone, more nuanced but passionate in the role of Sara . Dakota Fanning seemed to be like, "" oooo stoic! I can totally be more still than a wooden plank. I'll just , every once in a while, take a sassy tone when I want to challenge the male characters. Golden Globe win..... here I come !!!""  Lol, she is not bad as Ms. Howard she's just... uh..could do more. Evan Rachel Wood would have made a perfect Sara. Bruhl is the man though. He's such a good actor, without him I think the series woulda got canned XD! He's the glue that holds everything together and Luke Evans as his side kick is good too. 

As for Hannibal Season 2 and most certainly Season 3  will make you frustrated. I love Bedalia du'Maurier  LOVE HER!!! However, for some reason.... in season 3 …… just..... why?  I know why..... but like... why? My why's refer to them very clearly using her as a Clarice substitute with events in the Hannibal book. Season 2 was just full on ILLOGICAL. There is no way in the modern world Hannibal would have got away with the level of bullshit he did. It's hard to not use spoilers, but multiple people KNOW he's the Chesapeake Ripper and decide to play cat and mouse games with him. Just....no...…. no...….  It was clear they were taking a lot from Hannibal Rising and Hannibal with many Clarice substitutes. It felt jumbled in a way. I will say this murder and death never looked to BEAUTIFUL! The cinematography and scenes are down right beautiful xD.  You can take stills of some scenes are use them for uppity cookbook covers or Vanity Fair/Vogue magazines. Just.. beauty :D!

t2mrm,"Yes, the sequel was ""Angel of Darkness."" Wasn't quite as tight as Alienist, probably because it read less like a Sherlock Holmes straight detective thriller and more like an episode of Law & Order. A good chunk of the second half was spent in a courtroom.

But OP should *definitely* read The Alienist. I'm honestly surprised they haven't made it into a movie yet.",mkraft,2012-05-02 12:09:34
32pm0t,"To be honest, I couldn't make my way through The Alienist. It's not even that it was bad, it was just written to be a screenplay, not a novel. It'll probably be a very successful TV series.",,2015-04-15 18:21:38
3ficgi,"I tried reading The Alienist earlier this year and I just couldn't make it through it. I don't know how to explain, but it felt like the author meant it to be a screenplay, not a book. I'll probably like it quite a bit better as a TV show than as a book.",,2015-08-03 02:15:48
