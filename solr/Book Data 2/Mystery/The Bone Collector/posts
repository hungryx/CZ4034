31htpb,The Bone Collector - The first Lincoln Rhyme novel -Frustrating to read.,"I had heard so much about this series and Lincoln Rhyme seemed like a character that I'd really enjoy reading about. But 150 pages into the book all he's doing is ordering test after test on pieces of evidence. Literally every paragraph he is in is just him saying to analyze this piece of wood with this density gradient scanner or check for fingerprints on this bone or analyze this blood. It's unbearable to read. There has been very minimal moments of amazing deduction...just test after goddamn test. Not only is it difficult to read but I feel no 'thrill' in reading it. It doesn't have the page-turner quality. In fact I'm afraid to turn the page lest I be bombarded with more paragraphs of sophisticated tests and analysis.

I may be sounding harsh but it's only because I had such high expectations of this book. Please tell me it gets better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/31htpb/the_bone_collector_the_first_lincoln_rhyme_novel/,2015-04-05 05:20:14,3,4,books
65bipz,"Weekly Recommendation Thread for the week of April 14, 2017","Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 ____

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 ____

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

srut0h,What audiobooks do you want redone or the unabridged version?,"The more I am into audiobooks, the more I am upset about the quality. The narrators are either extremely fast, speak in a bedtime soft style, or are robotic. I don’t expect a Jim Dale skill. I do get disappointed when a book is made into an audiobook and found abridged while some time ago there was a version unabridged. It is no longer sold. The next book in the series might be with a different narrator based on the first book reviews. I would love a redo of that first book. 

White Oleander is a long book that when I finished it, I was shook and in love with the story. I wanted to listen to the audiobook years later. Thankfully it was from the library. I don’t like Oprah personally. I absolutely love her reading of the abridged book. I am disappointed there is no unabridged version. If I ever wanted to have the book read to me, I would have to do it myself. And my voice is not as wonderful as Oprah’s in her version.

In The Bone Collector the first book has horrible reviews. The next book and after are with a different narrator. They never have gone back to redo the first. What was done was done. I would enjoy that first book to listen to. 

Beantown Girls. I loved the book. I never noticed the number of she said or the word said until the audiobook version. It seems stomped on the ground when it comes up. SAID. Sadly I don’t believe it could be fixed. That is what needs to be read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/srut0h/what_audiobooks_do_you_want_redone_or_the/,2022-02-13 22:26:08,7,2,books

For instance, (SPOILER ALERT if you haven't read The Bone Collector)
[Spoiler](/s ""The part when the two people are driving in the car and they realize the door locks were removed and they were in trouble etc etc ... was pretty cool and intense.  Also the part with the steam ... "")

There were other parts as well and many awesome and intense moments in other books but I just wanted to hear some of your favorite from the thriller genre.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ty5z7/what_are_the_best_or_most_intense_parts_or/,2018-06-26 07:42:40,6,2,books
cqq5w8,Discussion Thread for Ch. 3 - 5 of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs by Steve Brusatte - August Book Club,"Welcome to the second discussion thread of this month's selection, specifically for Chapter 3 through Chapter 5 of *The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs* by Steve Brusatte. Hopefully you are all enjoying the book so far

To help kick off the discussion:

>Millions of people look at this cliff every week. Hundreds of thousands of people live on it. Few realize that it is a remnant of those ancient volcanic eruptions that tore apart Pangea and ushered in the Age of Dinosaurs.

* Why do you think we sometimes overlook the history close to home?
* Did it surprise you that two paleontologists got into a Bone War with each other? Do you think it benefited paleontology or did the sloppy collection work negate some of the benefits?

>Siber is a commercial paleontologist: he digs up dinosaurs and sells them. It's a thorny issue for many academic paleontologists like me, who see fossils as irreplaceable natural heritage that should be protected in museums, where they can be studied by researchers and enjoyed by the public, not sold off to the highest bidder. But there is a whole spectrum of commercial paleontologists, ranging from gun-toting criminals who illegally export fossils to diligent, conscientious, well-trained collectors whose knowledge and experience rival that of academics. Siber is in this latter category. In fact, he's the archetype of this kind of collector. He is wel respected by researchers and even founded his own dinosaur museum east of Zurich, called the Saurier Museum, which has some of the most remarkable dinosaur exhibits in Europe.

* What is your opinion on commercial paleontologists?
* What is the most interesting thing you learned from the book in this week's part?

Feel free to answer any or all of the questions or tell us what you think of the book so far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cqq5w8/discussion_thread_for_ch_3_5_of_the_rise_and_fall/,2019-08-15 13:56:27,26,20,books

83pao2,The Top 100 Crime Novels,"The list was created in 1990 by the Crime Writers’ Association. I love such lists, but sometimes it's better to trust redditors than some guys from CWA. Do you agree with this list? Which of those books are really worth reading? Which of them have aged well (most of them are pretty old). Nevertheless, whatever you suggest me, I know I will read 'The Third Man' and 'Day of the Jackal' by the end of this year. 'The Collector' seems to be also interesting, so maybe it will be next. I know this post seems to look like a /r/suggestmeabook post, but because I've mentioned huge amount of books, I guess it would be nice to have big discussion here.
