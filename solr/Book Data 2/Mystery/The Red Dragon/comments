1bpu3sq,"There are two sides to it:

Harris strongly suggests that Graham is effectively the same as the serial killers. Lecter has this insight into Graham - no other character appears to understand it - and uses it to provoke Graham and allow the reader to understand Graham thinks the same way as the serial killers, is able to understand their motivations and *appreciate* what they get from killing. When Lecter points to this, Graham tries to hide from it. There's a certain degree to which I expect Graham already knows what Lecter will tell him, but goes to Lecter to avoid having to acknowledge he thinks the same ways as the serial killers.

Having Graham previously capture Lecter also shows the reader that Graham is talented, skilled at his job, a force to be reckoned with and a suitable go-to for Crawford.

Just note that the *Red Dragon* movie (the second version with Hopkins) adds extra scenes with Lecter; that's why half the audience is there. These scenes are not in the book, at least not from memory.",TheChocolateMelted,2024-03-28 12:54:16
1bpu3sq,"I think your issue really stems from the fact you have too much history with what followed Red Dragon. You’re not looking at the story from the perspective that it’s not about Hannibal Lecter. He’s a minor side character but you’re coming from 40+ years of Harris and other writers building off that small beginning. 

He was popular and got expanded upon in the sequel (in which he’s still just a side character) and then eventually he took over the series and it pivoted focus to be all about him. But in Red Dragon he’s just there to support Graham’s investigation and leave the story and everything else is just world building to flesh out why Will would contact a serial killer to aid in the investigation.",Tyrant_Virus_,2024-03-28 15:29:08

Incidentally, I was cheesed off that both films chickened out on the ending of the book. The finale of Red Dragon shocked the hell out of me and I was really looking forward to see how it would transpire in the film(s). Disappointed.",PippyHooligan,2024-03-30 07:28:50
1bpu3sq,"Argh. That's the problem. I just said on another post where someone said to read Red Dragon for Hannibal Lecter to not do that. To read Red Dragon for Francis Dolarhyde and Will Graham.

Hannibal Lecter is a minor character in Red Dragon whose only point is his history and ongoing (one-way) antagonism with Will Graham. He's there to explain why Will Graham quit. And to show Will Graham's psyche. And, in the end, to try to destroy Will Graham's life. The only importance of Hannibal Lecter is through Will Graham because it's Will Graham who is important.",Dana07620,2024-03-31 04:23:29
1bpu3sq,"If you really liked the movies, I recommend you see Manhunter, which is an earlier version of the Red Dragon movie.

1bpu3sq,"I love the way that he sees the cut tree branch and asks for an analysis to know what was used to cut it. It seems so impossible in many ways (especially for a reader in the mid 1980s when police procedurals were far less common), but the confidence Graham shows in asking for it immediately makes it seem like an everyday police procedure.   

When he first introduces Lecter in *Red Dragon*, Harris was a little surprised himself to find himself writing that Lecter smelt Graham before actually seeing him. I suspect Harris was afraid of Lecter the character. Sound weird? I think he wanted to write about him, but was scared of where it would take him (as happened with Graham) and brought this fear into the first two books and the distance he holds from Lecter. In the third book, creating a back story and giving insights into Lecter's thoughts inevitably makes Lecter feel less evil. I suspect Harris needed this to some degree. I suspect Barney in that book is in many ways present as a way for Harris - and the reader - to feel safe in their dealings with Lecter. But that's just me.",TheChocolateMelted,2024-03-28 13:42:08
1bpu3sq,"Whether you realize it or admit it to yourself your familiarity with the character is clearly influencing you while reading. The fact that a relatively minor character casts such a large shadow over the story is good writing. He doesn’t exist purely to further the plot you can instantly feel that there’s more to him, he has his own stories, complex history with Will, and none of it really impacts the Dollarhyde plot but it grounds him in the world and fleshes him out. It makes him real not just a cardboard cutout that exists to move Will to the next scene. 

This obviously worked as readers were fascinated with him and wanted more and he got more and more focus as time went on. You read his brief parts and want more because he has depth. If Red Dragon never got sequels and prequels Lecter would still work just fine as a one off and a testament of how much Harris would do with very little.",Tyrant_Virus_,2024-03-28 16:52:41
1bpu3sq,"I'm not sure what your point is. Is it that you think Lecter's character was given too much background in Red Dragon? That's a matter of opinion. I do not. He was Graham's last capture. His most important capture to him personally. We were given enough information to understand Graham's process and how he figured out that this former ER resident turned psychiatrist was the cannibalistic serial killer everyone was looking for...and no one would suspect.

And then when Dolarhyde knew that Graham had been to see Lecter, it seems natural that Dolarhyde would contact him.

I don't see that Lecter's character was given more detail and importance that Freddy Lounds' character. We learned his history. His motivation. Got to know him professionally and personally including his romantic history.

Yet you're not wondering why we found out all that about Freddy Lounds.

Nor are Lecter and Freddy the only ones. How much did we learn about that one wife / mother that Dolarhyde killed? Did we *need* to know about her cancer scare for the story? No. Did it make the character and story richer? Yes.",Dana07620,2024-03-31 15:41:59
11eg0lh,"Hannibal rising was written after red dragon. So this is  just a continuity error.

Animal cruelty is a common occurance in individuals with sociopathy, and serial killers, so it's not surprising for that to originally be a trait of Lecter.",madchad90,2023-02-28 18:38:40
11eg0lh,"In addition to what the other posters have already said about Harris being cornered into writing the book, I think it's a case of the character outgrowing the material.

Harris published *Red Dragon* in '81 and while it received favorable reviews, it wasn't a massive hit. It was, however, optioned and adapted into the 1986 movie *Manhunter* directed by Michael Mann. Brian Cox played a Lecter (spelled ""Lektor"" in the film) that was very different to the portrayals we're accustomed to, and much more in line with what people understood a ""sociopathic"" serial killer to be at the time. The movie was not well-received.

Fast forward to 1988 when Harris published *The Silence of the Lambs*. This novel was much more popular than its predecessor and was adapted into a highly acclaimed and commercially successful movie. Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Lecter became iconic in popular culture despite his comparatively low screen time.

The character of Lecter grew both in further adaptations/sequels and in the public consciousness. He evolved into a larger-than-life figure that bordered on the supernatural. He's one of the most intelligent characters ever portrayed in fiction (barring science fiction or fantasy), right up there with Sherlock Holmes. His intellect, his refined taste and his tragic backstory are set at odds with his true nature, which is that of an inhuman monster.

In going back and crafting his origin tale, I think Harris was super-aware of the character's evolution, as well as his beloved status among fans. *Hannibal Rising* was written to fit the pieces together in a way that explained his darkness without making any apologies. All things considered, I think it turned out better than what I expected, though I wasn't very fond of the movie. *Hannibal*, on the other hand, I will always defend, despite the ridiculous Ray Liotta brain scene and the strange ending choice. Hopkins chews the scenery and commands every room, and Mason Verger is an antagonist *par excellence*.",PDV87,2023-03-01 06:28:52
11eg0lh,"The fact that Hannibal Rising came after the fact makes this lack of consistency more unforgivable, not less.

11eg0lh,"It makes the character interesting if we don't know much about him I'll give you that. Also it was way easier to just see just the monster, because even before you met him in the Red dragon you already knew what kind of ""man"" he is, like when they were talking about him attacting the nurse. That might be a bit harder to do after the Rising.

As much as I hate to admit that, the Hannibal rasing made me kinda like him and feel sorry for him. I mean that his whole nazi hunt was fulled by wanting to avenge Misa for what they did to her so I (again as awfull as it sounds)  was on Hannibal's side when he was going after these guys. 

With the butcher it was more like ""Ok, I get it, that guy offended lady murasaki and you want to defend her honor, BUT this might be a bit too extrem reaction"" Like I saw why he did it, but this time the reason was not enough for him doing what he did. 

He was doing awfull things there but also I felt like it was not just ""out of nowhere"" like that he had a reason for it. Not that it would make the things he did ok! Just that he was not just some lunetic killer, if it make sence.",Majiska394,2023-03-01 15:48:35
uath7l,"Red Dragon is my absolute favorite of the Thomas Harris books. I love the in-depth look inside the antagonist's life. I love how Harris makes you feel pity for him while not minimizing at all the horrors that he's done.

No, it's not about his most famous characters: Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. But the protagonist and, especially, the antagonist are so well depicted.

EDIT: I saw the movie Silence of the Lambs in the evening, went to the bookstore and picked up all three of Harris' novels at that time. And I read Silence of the Lambs before I went to sleep that night. (By the way, first time watching the movie and immediately reading the book is not something I'd recommend. That night my dreams were so blood soaked that I woke up the next morning feeling like I needed a bath.)

But once I read Red Dragon, Silence fell flat to me. The only character who's well developed is Clarice. The antagonists are bogeymen, not real people.

The way the violence was hinted at instead of graphically depicted, as when Graham was walking through the house where the latest killing had taken place reading aloud from a dry, clinical crime scene description. (This is also how *Manhunter* handled it).

kbo2ge,"You don't mention this (and it's not in the comments), but the man Dolarhyde kills to use as a substitute dead body isn't random, it was his co-worker, who was trying to get Reba to dump Dolarhyde and go out with him. This is a crucial point, because Reba actually does change Dolarhyde, as even Graham realises when he says, ""He's trying to stop."" 

But the voice of the Red Dragon is very strong in Dolarhyde's head, and it's the moment of weakness when Dolarhyde sees his co-worker kiss Reba goodnight (innocently, and Reba does not reciprocate, although Dolarhyde observes this from too far away to notice) that kills his love for her and allows the Dragon to take over; so he kills the co-worker. As he knows that the FBI have already identified him, Dolarhyde uses the body to fake his death and escape, and allowing Reba to survive fits in with the both the Dragon's and Dolarhyde's wishes – Dolarhyde doesn't want to kill her, and the Dragon wants her as a witness to his faked death.

Once he has done this, Dolarhyde (who is now mostly the Great Red Dragon) only wishes to fulfil himself in Lecter's eyes and carry out his earlier wish to locate Graham's family and kill them all.",HugoNebula,2020-12-13 13:59:18

Saw it when it came out. Such an incredibly well made movie. Mann""erisms"" and all style-wise of course I understand why some people think it's too 80's looking.

Even jam packed with some of the best actors living couldn't help that fucking turd of a movie.

i6p2hp,"In my opinion, *Red Dragon* is Harris's second best after *Silence of the Lambs* (which is just a gripping read the whole way through). They're both excellent books, but I think the pacing of *Silence* is superior. When it comes to the antagonists, I find Dolarhyde and Gumb equally believable and frightening. I also have to admit that, especially on recent re-reads, the film version of *Silence of the Lambs* affects how I read certain characters as well as the atmosphere of certain scenes, and it actually improves the experience. It's one of those rare cases where both the book and the movie are almost perfect thrillers on their own, and serve to complement each other rather than invite critical comparisons.

I think *Hannibal* is worth a read; there's a lot of good stuff in there, and though the movie version mishandles some of it, it has many redeeming aspects (Barney, Mason Verger, Rinaldo Pazzi and the Florence scenes are all fantastic). Julianne Moore did a great job, but there was no way she could really trump Foster's performance in *Silence*, so *Hannibal* as a movie, like *Red Dragon*, is inferior to the book overall.

I still think the book is worth reading, it's better and goes into a lot more detail than the movie.",gloryday23,2019-04-03 20:16:46
b8y0wh,"There is no comparison, the novel is a hundred times better than both films but Manhunter is way better than the Red Dragon film. Red Dragon is one of the scariest books I have ever read, I was a teenager when I read it, and Red Dragon scared the hell out of me! ",Jorge777,2019-04-04 09:04:34

6fasd2,"Definitely read Red Dragon and The Silence Of The Lambs. They are fantastically scary and tense and two of the best fictional crime stories you could read. Both movies are worth watching, but Silence is an all time classic. Everything after you should ignore. I have no idea what Thomas Harris was thinking when he wrote Hannibal, but it is god awful and ruins a relationship that was sacred. That book harms the mythology more than it could possibly help. The movie is just as bad if not worse",Batspank,2017-06-05 02:20:54
6fasd2,"It's a personal choice. If you're inclined towards option b, then go for it. That's what I'd do. Also, there are two Red Dragon movie adaptations. The other, lesser known version is called ""Manhunter"", from 1986.",perspektivo,2017-06-05 01:23:11
6fasd2,I read Silence of the Lambs before watching the movie. I'm glad I did. Red Dragon is also great. Hannibal is just okay. I always felt like maybe we was pressured to write more Lector books. Hollywood does love trilogies. The fourth book I skipped.,dreddpirateroberts42,2017-06-05 08:08:02
1fznpp,"I recommend reading them in order (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, Hannibal Rising) mainly because it works out a lot better that way. Silence of the Lambs actually does talk about the fate of Will Graham in the beginning (in conversations between Starling and Crawford) and so it might ruin Red Dragon a bit if you read it first. It is also possible, I think, to read Hannibal Rising first, since it is a prequel, but I found it to be far more enlightening to read it last, the way Harris wrote them. I actually read the books before I saw the movies. If possible (I know it's unlikely), I highly recommend doing that. If you watch the new show Hannibal, too, don't expect it to hold tight to Red Dragon either. Just saying.",TheMetallian451,2013-06-10 03:50:30
1fznpp,"I think you could read either first and still enjoy them both. I personally liked reading Red Dragon first just to follow chronologically better with the characters. If you're looking for another series after you finish Red Dragon/Silence/Hannibal, I've enjoyed the Gretchen/Archie series by Chelsea Cain. It starts with a novel called Heartsick and currently has four novels. ",eliphaz,2013-06-09 18:25:07
1fznpp,"Thank you for your insight! I got Red Dragon and I'm going to start with that one and read the books in the order that they were written. As far as the movies go, I don't know them well enough to spoil the books in any way, and that's a big reason why I want to read them! Books are always better, but with the Silence of the Lambs being such an iconic movie I cannot wait to get to that book! I am sure that Red Dragon and the other books are great too.",smartwentcrazy13,2013-06-10 06:09:01
1fznpp,"Thank you for your suggestion! I think I want to start with Red Dragon because it would be chronological, as you said. What do you like about this other series that you suggested?",smartwentcrazy13,2013-06-09 18:36:31
1fznpp,"They are all really great. Hannibal gets a little tiresome at certain points (I think it's the longest book), but it's still really good. The movie adaptation of that book was HORRIFIC to say the least though. My god it was awful. You have no idea how much was taken out of the movie until you read the book though. Like half the book and a lot of major characters are missing from that movie. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs are pretty spot on though, but they both leave a little out. Silence of the Lambs is still a really good adaptation. Probably the best of all the movies, though I prefer Will Graham (Ed Norton, Red Dragon) to Starling (Jodie Foster, Silence of the Lambs). But that's just my opinion. ",TheMetallian451,2013-06-10 06:57:29
3rk7xz,"They are all great, so I would start with the first (Red Dragon).",bmtri,2015-11-05 00:04:02
3rk7xz,"Silence of the Lambs covers the first meeting of Clarice and Hannibal, and the evolution of their very strange relationship. While I'm sure you'd be able to understand what was happening in Hannibal, you'd miss a lot of the significance and depth if you started there. 

You can probably skip Red Dragon, while it'll introduce you to Hannibal and cover some of the backstory, it's a different story. 

That said, they're all fantastic books, and I wouldn't miss any of them. 

The television show is great, but departs radically from the storyline of the books. It isn't going to help you much. 

If you're going to skip anything, skip Hannibal Rising, the last book. It's definitely the weakest. I'm pretty sure it was written purely to facilitate another movie.

duv2n,Someone has already recommended Ann Rule-I'd also add Stranger Beside Me to that list. She gives a complete profile of Ted Bundy that shows his blatant sense of narcissism which reminds me of the psychopath in Red Dragon. Might be interesting to compare the two.,chaoskitty,2010-10-24 12:52:24
