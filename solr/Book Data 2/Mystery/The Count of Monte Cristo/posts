wzcofb,The Count of Monte Cristo is a masterpiece…,"When I finished reading the last page, I closed the book and just sat there for some time. Any book that just leaves you thinking, or reminiscing on the story you just read are my favorites, and I think this one may be at the top of the list. 

In my opinion, this book is a masterpiece. A saga that takes us from Marseille, to Château d’If, to Rome, and to Paris. A saga that contains love, greed, death, despair, adventure, wit, revenge, change… need I go on? A saga that introduces us to complex characters… Mercédès, Caderousse, Fernand, Villefort, Noirtier, Danglars, Abbé Faria, Luigi Vampa, Haydèe, Franz, Albert, Morrell… their own stories that were entertaining in themselves. As for Edmond himself, I was in awe of the intricacies of his schemes for revenge that played out over hundreds of pages that I could not even begin to guess where they would go next. I found myself rushing towards the end and when I got there I wanted more. 

Dumas has become one of my favorite authors in the process and I plan on reading more of his work.

150cz3r,I just finished The Count of Monte Cristo,"By far the longest book I've ever actually finished, it is also the same book that has made me improve my own writing by a considerable amount.

A friend got me into thr book by first showing me the musical, then we started talking about the story but with our own characters, started writing for that, and then I finally purchased the book to read it myself.

The book gave me so much to think about when it came to writing a story with so many moving parts, parts that one won't even think about till much later. Dumas crafted a story that left me wanting more, more, and more, to the point I was bringing the book to work to read in-between customers. Edmond's fall from a man who saw the best in everyone to then only seeing the worst, before making his way to the middle of it after meeting a few other characters is something I will never stop thinking about.

I was never really one to read historical fiction (I was in all regular English classes so while we read some older books, and some Shakespeare, they were still a lot more current than Dumas) and so this was my first entrance into the genre. It's beautiful, heartbreaking, characters struggling with and against the social norms that I haven't really seen in the books I've read prior.

ibvwyn,Just finished the Count of Monte Cristo - stunned (no spoilers),"I finished the book around two minutes ago and I am stunned and just needed to quickly write down my feelings. It’s 2:30 am but I don’t care. I’ll try not to spoil as I want this post to encourage anyone who hasn’t read the book to pick it up. 

Never have I ever been so deeply enthralled in a book. Despite its length (I read the unabridged 1471 page edition, which I highly recommend) The Count of Monte Cristo was impossible to put down. I was engulfed by the world that Dumas creates in this masterpiece. The satisfaction of the events of the plot, the countless messages and themes and morals, and the gorgeous writing itself that Dumas used - I can talk about these probably for ever. God the language - Dumas is probably the most beautiful and talented writer I’ve ever read. His sentences and words not only kept me engaged, but enriched my mind and tugged at my heart. Never have I been so moved, so touched, so engaged in a story, as if I were Dantès or Mercédès or Maximilien themselves or any other character mentioned. As I read, I experienced what they experienced, I rejoiced at their victories, and felt pain at their sorrows. 

I will always remember this novel and keep it with me as I live my life. This book taught me to forgive, to keep myself grounded and humble, and to always “wait” and “hope.” God I love this book

EDIT: I’m so glad this post resonated with so many people! I’m posting the link edition/translation I read, which was the Robin Buss translation, unabridged. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did :)

15cvkpl,I finished The Count of Monte Cristo!,"It was quite the journey. I recently got back into reading this year, and being here on this sub was a big part of that decision, as was the desire to read The Count of Monte Cristo. I saw it hyped on so many posts and comment sections, so I wanted to give it a try. It was the biggest book I've read so far.  


Overall I did really enjoy the story. Throughout my reading, there were moments that seemed unnecessary and I wondered why it was integral to the plot. There were so many tangents. I had no issue following along, but I admit once or twice I got a little off-put. I called those lulls. But the thing about that is, and this is my favorite thing about the book: everything, and I mean everything, matters. It's all tied together. Everytime I wondered why x moment was important, then it was later used. It got me everytime, until I let my brain finally just go with it because I allowed myself to eventually trust Dumas. I'm glad I did. I've never read such an intricate, and plot heavy story with tangents be so well woven. No stone was left unturned.   


I have to say my only gripe about the book is >!that throughout the book Dumas wrote Monte Cristo or any other character going in depth to explain every minute detail of what they do/did and/or why. But in the last chapter, Dumas writes that Valentine tells Morrel how she was saved, but we don't actually get to know how. I felt like that didn't make much sense in relation to the rest of the book. I would have liked to know what Dantes did to save Valentine.!<  


Anyway. Great book.

11fkja7,"Finally finished ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas, and I'm dying to talk about it"," I recently finished The Count of Monte Cristo and my goodness do I have some thoughts on it. It took me about five months to finish it but every second kept me engrossed. It started when I read a post here probably close to a year ago singing its praises, and immediately put it on my ever-growing 'to read' list. After getting it for my birthday last year, I finally sat down and started reading it in early September of 2022.

Coming from reading basically only non-fiction works, I was surprised by how this book *immediately* got me hooked. I fell in love with Edmond Dantes character, and his betrayal, loss and heartbreak genuinely affected me. I found myself so frustrated at his turmoil, and wanted nothing more than his revenge to be brutal and all encompassing. Seeing the fall from grace of this young, idealistic and just genuinely good hearted kid, into a cynical, mean-spirited and extravagant man was just something that made me feel emotions from words on a page I had never experienced previously.

Really the entire cast of characters Dumas created I found to be extremely compelling and interesting to read about. Off the top of my head there's Noirteir, the entire Danglars family, Andrea Cavalcanti, and Haydèe to name a few. And of course the titular Count was the star of the show every time he appeared on page. I found myself as in awe of him as were the people around him. His long drawn out plan of revenge was as fun to behold as it was impossible to predict. I do wish we could've heard about the aftermath of all the characters. I was particularly interested in what happened afterwards to more minor characters such as Andrea and Franz specifically. I felt as though their characters had quite a lot of build-up but were essentially forgotten about once they'd fulfilled their purpose to the Count. 

Other than that, the bit of a slog in the middle, and a few minor gripes (Didn't get the translation by Buss so apparently there were quite a few changes and removals made in my translation) I think this is quite possible my favorite book I've read. Certainly my longest read!

I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts!

Edit: Also for all those wondering, I read the Barnes and Nobles bound leatherback edition. The translator is uncredited, but it is the unabridged version.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11fkja7/finally_finished_the_count_of_monte_cristo_by/,2023-03-01 22:38:23,433,3030,books
10ysbam,"I read the Count of Monte Cristo and bloody hell, it is awesome.","This book was quite a long one, but at no point was I feeling that I should quite reading, unlike most other long books.

My favorite two characters were Abbe Faria and Edmond(or rather the count to monte cristo after the the time skip). Which is because of my tendency to like and respect polymaths. Also the suave demeanour of the Count and the wisdom and kindness of the Abbe are quite something. 

But by far the best parts were the revenge... Oh the revenge. That was quite something.

1. Fernand Mondego, or the Comte de Morcef. Fantastic, I loved the whole thing that happened to this dude, good for Haidee, good for Edmond. Little sad for Mercedes.

2. Baron Danglars, oh how I hated that guy. He got what he deserved, fantastic. FANTASTIC.

3. Monsieur de Villfort. Now this guys thing was quite tragic, I felt bad for him. And even more for Valentine and Monsieur Noirtier. In my opinion, this dude was the least guilty of the three although still guilty but got delt the worst hand out of the three, even if it wasn't by Monte Cristo but by Providence as the author always like to say.

This was such a fantastic read and my first french classic.

I want more, what other good french classics can I read and what are some other good french authors. 

I plan to read Les Miserables next and then maybe pick up 3 musketeers another one of Dumas' works",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10ysbam/i_read_the_count_of_monte_cristo_and_bloody_hell/,2023-02-10 13:42:44,243,1628,books
p4a8rw,I thought everyone was lying to me about The Count of Monte Cristo but somehow it really is THAT good.,"I would like to formally apologize to Alexandre Dumas for underestimating him. I looked at the date and length and thought it would be boring, and I even made sure to download a few other books before I started reading it on the assumption that I would need a break during the tedious parts.

There?? Were?? No?? Tedious parts???? I stayed up until 4 in the morning to read the first half and only fell asleep when my eyes could not process any more words. I don't know how Dumas manages to write 1200 pages of nonstop action and intrigure & I am in awe! Les Mis is around the same length, and as much as I loved it, there were definitely parts where Hugo went off on long tangents and my eyes sort of glazed over.

Obviously there were some parts of the book that have aged poorly, but on the whole it was an incredible journey and I'm so glad I finally picked it up.

**ETA: Woah, I was not expecting this to get so much attention. I've seen a lot of commenters saying this convinced them to pick up the book, so yay! I hope you have fun reading! And naturally some people disagree with me and didn't like it, and that's cool too :)**

**As for all the people asking about the title, it was just a bit of hyperbole on my part! I didn't think anyone was straight-up lying, but I assumed they were exaggerating considering the other books I've read that were over 1000 pages all had quite a lot of filler. I was happy to find that wasn't the case!**

121qyim,The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas.,"Well, I have just now finished this book that I began reading on March 2nd and which (minus a couple of days I didn't get to read any) has taken me about 3 weeks to finish.

Longest book I've read so far, standing at 1243 pages and the beginning feels so very far away from the end. However, the world which is built up and all the stories within which connect it, honestly makes for a fantastic experience.

I highly recommend this book but I would advise patience. Not because it is boring or a slow starter (it's not), but because you need to appreciate how the story is written and the journey on which the author is taking you. You also need to prepare yourself that when you first begin, hashing out 50 or 100 pages doesn't make a dent in the bulk of remaining story.

It was a very wild and exciting ride. Each chapter leaves you wanting to discover what comes next and the ending is something that will sit with you for a while.

1bpuz30,I just DNFed the Count of Monte Cristo.,"I am going through the hardest time of my life. I wanted a good distraction, and what's better than a 1276-page book about revenge? 

It just added to my misery.  
  
The first 100 pages were solid. I liked how the events were fast-paced, I liked Abbe Faria, the despair, the hope, the depth of human feelings in prison.  
  
Things fell apart the moment Dantes escaped. From around page 100 to 600, I tried to give the book a chance, but all I got were endless descriptions for the slightest detail and endless dialogues that seemed pointless. The dialogues that had meaning could be summed up in 10 pages.  
  
I am so disappointed. The pages from 100 to 600 could have been reduced to 30. I didn't pick the abridged version because I wanted to savor the whole beauty of a classic, but what was that?  
  
This will give me a very long reading slump, which is the last thing I need now. Maybe the book is not for me, although I have no specific liking in fiction. I read everything, but this one was the biggest letdown since I started reading.

PS. I read the translation by Robin Buss, the Penguin Classics edition. I wanted to read s summary when I reached page 300, but at this point, I guess I will never know what will happen, since I am ready to throw myself out of the window from the boredom.

18kdek8,The Count of Monte Cristo,"This book is my safe place. I have read it once a year since I bought it 16 years ago. The cover is creased, the pages are yellowing but I love it. It has  travelled the world with me. 

To me, the story never falters, the way that Dumas describes human nature through the Count's observations is just amazing, in particular La Mazzolata.
The way that each character has a fleshed out enough introduction and back story to make them feel like a main character really pulls me in to the point that I never really miss the Count in the chapters that he isn't in. Everyone carries the story wonderfully.
Every time I read different parts of the story hit in different ways depending on how I am feeling at the time. 

The Counts actions change how I feel about him every read through, I find myself looking at them from different angles and points. It really feels like I'm reading a different book each time.

I know the story inside out but still find new things to get me thinking each time I read it.

So far I’ve enjoyed the book, even if it is a little hard for me to read (1844 French translated to English is not as smooth as Project Hail Mary lol). However I’m about 3 or 4 chapters into Franz’s story and I’m getting really discouraged. It’s so boring now. Obviously there has to be a reason why we are investing so much time into this character, but he’s so uninteresting and there is zero connection with him. Yes I can see that Edmond keeps popping up and that’s supposed to make it more interesting, but it’s just not holding my attention. And the whole drug-induced dream sequence, what was that about? I’m really hoping we get back to Edmond’s POV soon.

yc2xcl,Just finished The Count of Monte Cristo,"I can confidently say that this might be my new all-time favorite book. I don't know that I can do justice to the whirlwind of emotions I had while reading this book, but let's just say that the story was emotionally riveting all throughout. I found myself really latching onto the characters (especially Edmond Dantes/the Count of Monte Cristo), and other characters both major and minor. For me, it was never boring or meandering. Every chapter served a purpose, and the way Dumas, through his prose, builds up the Count as a powerful, mysterious figure seemingly controlling fate itself is masterfully done. I watched the 2002 movie immediately afterward. Good movie with a very good cast, but on a scale of 0-100%, it's about 5% the book, the rest creative liberties (it's impossible to tell the story as is, or close, in 2 hours).

There is so much I could cover, but I'll just say that the way Edmond Dantes immediately wins the readers heart at the beginning with his kind, easygoing, likable nature, only for that to be pulled out of the crime when he's accused of a crime he did not commit, is effective. The way his transformation into the Count of Monte Cristo his handled is wonderfully written. I love how there is such an air of mystery to the Count, and how this mystery is relayed by the characters reacting to the Count. We see, not through Dumas literally telling us, but through the Count's own reaction to certain events, just how cold and bitter he has become, with disturbing reactions to capital punishment and other morbid events. We're desperate to see his revenge plot against his enemies play out to the T.  And he mostly achieves this revenge...only to, in the midst of an unintended tragic consequence involving a child's death, causes him to reapproach how he will exact his final revenge. I also love how he defeats each of his enemies in the order from ""least important"" to ""most important"" in terms of how they helped ruin his life. But the takeaway amidst all of the darkness, both of emotion and of events, is that there is always hope.  The battle for Edmond's soul becomes more important than his revenge, as evidence by his sparing of Albert de Morcerf and later of Danglars.

It's late, but I just wanted to put out some thoughts that captured my awe upon finishing this beautiful story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yc2xcl/just_finished_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2022-10-24 05:21:10,136,499,books

I suppose, at the time, that was kind of the point. 

One thing I wanted to talk about was the character of Franz d'Epinay. I love this dude! I love his outlook on most things, and the way he pieces everything together.

17r3ngs,Why did Dumas write the end of The Count of Monte Cristo that way?,".Why didn't Dumas make an Edmond and Mercedes ending together?

Alexandre Dumas read Homer (Dumas A., Mes Mémoires, Paris, Bouquins, 2003, p. 590)) and The Odyssey influenced the book The Count of Monte Cristo. In Book IV of The Odyssey, Telemachus visits Menelaus who won Helen back after his elopement with Paris. Helen was sorry for what she did, but still Menelaus needed to use drugs to forget his painful memories like Helen's union with Paris. This influenced Alexandre Dumas. Edmond would never be happy with Mercedes and would never forget her marriage to Fernand. This would always make him have painful memories. Their marriage would be deeply unhappy.

Haydee does not bring the count the painful memories that Mercedes does. More realistic for him to be happy with Haydée.

The adaptations of 1934 with Robert Donat, 1998 with Gerard Depardieu and 2002 with Jim Caviezel make the mistake of transforming the Edmond and Mercedes union into a happy union. Their union should be unhappy and Edmond would always need Hashish to try to erase the memories that Mercedes was married for 20 years to the man who ruined his life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17r3ngs/why_did_dumas_write_the_end_of_the_count_of_monte/,2023-11-09 03:14:32,96,332,books

I don’t care if it’s overrated or overhyped to all of you, but after reading the last sentence I can for sure say that this is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I have suffered greatly in my life. No more or less than any other person but suffered in my own way. I struggled with grief and depression and still suffer greatly as all humans do. The ending of this book has put suffering and grief into a new meaningful perspective for me. It has given me a reason to live when I have contemplated about ending it all. It has given me hope for a happier future. I am happy right now :) . I really needed this book now more than ever and I really thank Alexander Dumas with all my heart wherever he is in the universe. “There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness.” 


I just wanted to share because I don’t really have anyone to share this with. Happy reading everybody!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tjfwpi/i_just_finished_reading_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2022-03-21 16:35:12,167,481,books
168b16u,The Count of Monte Cristo discussion because oh my goodness,"I finished The Count of Monte Cristo last week and I'm still thinking about it. Alexandre Dumas must have been a genius because how do you write such a masterpiece, such a COMPLEX plot with so many well written characters??? Not to mention the revenge plan...I was truly amazed and shocked towards the end of the book. I started connecting the dots and everything was falling into place in such a satisfying way, oh my goodness. To think that literally every single character had its role that affected the story so much and that was probably thought of way early in the story is insane, really. 

 It's my favorite book at the moment. I'm curious to hear what y'all think about it. I can't seem to let go of this book and the good part is: I don't even have to. I felt bad for Mercedes at the end but does anyone think they could have been together after everything that happened? Edmond changed so much, I don't know whether things would've worked between them. I also felt kinda bad for Villefort and the moment when realization hit Edmond left me in awe, I didn't think he would feel bad for what would happen to these people that betrayed him.

What was your favorite scene/chapter? I gotta say that I enjoyed that chapter in which Caderousse killed his wife and that man, the way Dumas describes the blood dripping under the stairs and on that guy who felt it dripping down on him, I got chills, it was so good.

Also, which movie adaption do you find to be the best?

Also eager to finish it so I can get on with my penguin little black classics backlog. White Nights, The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Akutagawa.

The character development, story telling and overall crafting of the plot blew me away, with the books final message leaving me in tears and deep in contemplation over what exactly should be valued in our lives. 

The book definitely has its flaws (overly detailed and lengthy) and isn't entirely an easy read (I struggled to get through the middle third of the book), however the satisfaction derived from the back third of the book has left me feeling content in a way that no other book has.

jcsfci,The Count of Monte Cristo,"I started listening to audiobooks at the beginning of lockdown and soon fell back in love with novels. I began with classics I already knew: Robinson Crusoe, Moby Dick and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

After these three, I wanted a new adventure book to satisfy my cravings and kept being recommended The Count of Monte Cristo. I was at first put off by this book's enormous length, but after finally finishing it I feel I've been on a soul-searching journey.

Wow. I am completely awestruck by this amazing story. I don't know what to say other than I encourage everyone to read this book at some point in their lives.

3w0d6w,Just finished the unabridged count of monte cristo. I am at a loss for words at what I missed as a young adult when I read the abridged version,"So when I was young, my mom bought me a bunch of the ""illustrated classics"" series of books. I can't believe how much deeper the plot went. I'm still reeling and trying to remember everything that happened. It took me nearly 4 months of periodic reading to finished it. Some times it was difficult to read, due to the emotional state I was in with personal things happening in my life. The idea of revenge being all-consuming, and still being the only motivation to get about of bed in the morning is a hard thing to reconcile. The almost mythical nature of Edmond in this story made it all the more enticing at times. 

I feel like I'm rambling here. On my main point, holy crap, the abridged version I had as a kid skipped over so much. It doesn't even make a note of Andrea cavalcanti. 

Seriously, this book has made a reader out of me all over again. 

Edit: I should have been working, but I have read each and every one of your comments. To know that this book had touched so many people, and also that I have moved people to pick the book up and experience it really makes me happy inside.

This is the most satisfying revenge story I've ever read! Plus, Dumas pays everything off in the end.

( By the way I really enjoyed the story, it was a really fun read but it took me some time to get through cause I dont really read classics that often, that's why I was kinda proud of myself for 'finishing' that one)

Idk what to do know, is it still worth it to pick up the unabridged version? I probably should do that but right now I don't have the energy to relive the book again... kinda disappointed though cause I despise 'abridged versions', now I feel like I read an incomplete book :(

At first, I found the dialogue between characters somewhat cumbersome to read, and most probably have misunderstood much from many paragraphs. But now on chapter 84 I find myself talking as if Albert, and the Count do!! It’s kind of cool if I’m to be perfectly honest with myself - I like it. 

But, can someone explain: is this how people talked in the 1800’s? Even in bitter arguments, they would call each other sir, or madame, or use the other’s respective title. I find most enjoyable while the Count is in Paris, and the way everyone talks to each other. Especially Maxamillion and Valentines.

12bzays,The Count of Monte Cristo. A question (spoilers),"Amazing book! New top-5 for me 😊 

TLDR: How did Monte Cristo contribute to the death of Villefort's young son Edouard? Why does this make Cristo feel guilty?

So Villefort's second wife, Heloise, poisons Valentine's maternal grandparents (the Saint-Merans) or at least Madame Saint-Meran. Heloise also poisons one of the servants accidentally when trying to poison Valentine's remaining paternal grandparent, Noirtier (Villefort's father). Then Heloise poisons Valentine herself. All this is so that Valentine's inheritances get redirected to Edouard, Heloise's son. 

Villefort finds out and says to Heloise ""poison yourself love or I'll hang ya"". He later regrets it and comes back to find that she has poisoned herself as well as their son Edouard. Villefort is driven mad by this. 

Monte Cristo shows up, reveals his true identity to Villefort and is shocked to find that Edouard has also died. Monte Cristo is like ""Oh dayum, I may have pushed this vengeance stuff a bit far"". 

BUT, how is the death of Edouard Cristo's fault? How did Cristo's plans lead in any way to Edouard's death? Wouldn't Heloise have been doing all the poisoning anyway, and so have been confronted by Villefort anyway? Did Cristo give Heloise the poison? Is it something to do with Cristo helping to end Valentine's betrothal to Franz d'Epinay so that she can marry her true love Maximilian Morrell? Or did Cristo's machinations somehow influence Heloise to start poisoning peeps? Or did Cristo help Villefort to discover Heloise as the poisoner? Or is it just that Cristo thinks Villefort has been over-punished, what with (1) the Benedetto affair that Cristo did subject Villefort to and (2) making Villefort think Valentine was also dead. 

Although the book was complicated, it was so engrossing that I understood it all. It's just this one thing bugging me. How is Edouard's death in any way Cristo's fault? Why does Cristo feel guilty about this?

17rpdoa,The Count of Monte Cristo and its many adaptations,"There is a belief that the only adaptations of the classic The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas are the 1934 films with Robert Donat, 1975 with Richard Chanberlain, 2002 with Jim Caviezel, the 1998 French miniseries with Gerard Depardieu and the anime Gankutsuou .

  
The book is not just about these 5 adaptations. All of the book's plots have already been adapted for either a film or a miniseries, including the ending with Haydée. The first major adaptation made by Hollywood was Monte Cristo (1922) with John Gilbert as the Count, France in 1929 made a super production based on the book also called Monte Cristo with actor Jean Angelo being the protagonist. During the Second World War, French director Robert Vernay adapted the book in 1943 with actor Pierre-Richard Willm as Edmond. The same Robert Vernay in 1954 made a new adaptation of the book with Jean Marais. French director Claude Autant-Lara adapted the book into a film in 1961, actor Louis Jordan played Edmond Dantes, who 14 years later played Villefort in the adaptation with Richard Chanberlain.  
In 1964. With the BBC television miniseries and with Alan Badel as Edmond, the first adaptation of the book for a television miniseries. This is the only adaptation that shows Eugenie running away with her teacher and friend. There is the 1966 Italian miniseries with Andrea Giordana that is also very close to the book. The 1979 French miniseries with Jacques Weber is perhaps the most complete adaptation of the book. And we have the 1988 Soviet adaptation, The Prisoner of Château d'If with Viktor Avilov.

  
These adaptations are perhaps little known due to the language barrier and the adaptation with Alan Badel, due to its low budget, does not arouse as much interest. Not everyone is willing to watch films and series with subtitles and that's why they end up not being that famous.

  
But it is not true to say that the book never had a faithful adaptation, including the death of Edoaurd (it is present in the Italian miniseries of 1966 and French of 1979) and the count leaving for the East with Haydée were already present in adaptations of the story .

  
In addition to the French film adaptation with Pierre Niney, there will be an Italian-French, English-language miniseries with Sam Claflin in 2024. This version in miniseries format will allow the book to be adapted more completely. This adaptation promises to be faithful to the original story and will present the book in a much more complete and faithful way for the new generation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17rpdoa/the_count_of_monte_cristo_and_its_many_adaptations/,2023-11-09 22:49:23,16,10,books

18rqy5q,The count of Monte Cristo - a critique of revenge,"Is suffering an injustice caused by the system itself a sign of carte blanche for us to do it by our own means? With this background, Alexandre Dumas exposes the hypocrisy of French society in the 19th century.The book, contrary to what EVERYONE says, is not about Revenge, maybe a little, but it has very beautiful messages about Forgiveness, Generosity, That There Is Goodness in the World, Believing in God's Plans, Repentance, Love, Hope and Happiness . The story, despite focusing on several characters, demonstrates Monte Cristo's journey very well, a journey with a negative arc that, thanks to love and friendship, meant that it did not end in disgrace, but rather with a positive ending. Villefort, Morcef and Danglars may have destroyed innocent lives, especially those of Monte Cristo, but the book does not attempt to demonstrate that the Count is correct in punishing the three in a monstrous way, the Count has several questionable behaviors and in the end he regrets it. It's funny because I didn't imagine the book would have so many Christian messages, mainly because it's a ""revenge"" story, but towards the end it shows a lot about that.

The ending was not like The Odyssey. Edmond simply punishes his enemies the same way Ulysses executed Penelope's suitors, the couple simply reunites.  Unlike Penelope, Mercedes was horrified by Edmond's actions and said that the man she loved no longer existed and broke contact with him.

Edmond stayed with Haydee because she was just like him and wanted revenge just like him. Because she experienced suffering like him, Hayee understood the reasons for the man he became, because she experienced the suffering he experienced. Edmond was imprisoned for years in the Château d'If and Haydee was a slave for years.  
Mercedes was the perfect woman for Edmond Dantes, but Haydee was perfect for the count of Monte Cristo.

I hope the miniseries being filmed with Sam Clalfin as The Count and Jeremy Irons as Abbé Faria does the book justice. In the film adaptation with Pierre Niney, from the images I think they want to make Edmond a kind of masked vigilante.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18rqy5q/the_count_of_monte_cristo_a_critique_of_revenge/,2023-12-27 03:47:08,8,20,books

But the last couple of chapters left me not liking the count. 

First of all he gets together with Haydee, whom he’s known since she was a child and bought as a slave.  He treated her like the princess she was and didn’t ever perv on her but how can you couple up with someone you’ve seen as your child? 

Secondly, the endings of Fernand and Villefort. For Villefort I feel most of the damage was done from within the family rather than the count except for revealing his illegitimate son. During the beginning of the book I felt that they really deserved every bad thing that could happen to them. But when it actually happens it doesn’t feel good.

1932qgy,Would The Count of Monte-Cristo be such a remarkable book if the outcome were different?,"  
If Alexandre Dumas decides to make an ending like Homer's odyssey. Ulysses, upon returning to Ithaca disguised as a beggar, murders his wife Penelope's suitors and after the massacre, the couple reunites.  
After Edmond Dantes assumed the identity of The Count of Monte-Cristo to take revenge on those responsible for having spent 13 years in prison, he and Mercedes resume their romance and now return rich to Marseille.

  
Instead of the message about remorse for taking revenge, the revenge was considered just like Ulysses' and he got the girl back like Ulysses and lived happily with her.

192tggt,Mathias Sandorf - the count of Monte Cristo by Jules Verne,"Jules Verne began developing the plan and working on the novel in the autumn of 1883. In a letter to the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, the author wrote that the new novel ""will resemble the Count of Monte Cristo, but without exaggerated love passions."" Most of the novel was completed in the summer of 1884, and at the same time the author and his family undertook a trip to the places described in the novel - from Tangier to Malta - on his yacht ""Saint-Michel"". Based on its results, clarifications and additions were made to the work.

On July 18, 1884, the first volume of the novel was delivered to the publisher, and at the end of the year he also received the second and third volumes. Etzel asked the author to change the protagonist's motivation a little, making him more of a fighter for justice than an avenger, which he did. On March 2, 1885, the novel was ready. Jules Verne dedicated it to Dumas, the father, and Dumas, the son, the first dedication in the works of Jules Verne.

In Trieste, two petty criminals, Sarcany and Zirone, accidentally possess a cipher that proves the existence of a conspiracy to make Hungary independent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Includes Count Mathias Sandorf and his two friends Ethienne Bathory and Ladislav Zathmar. They then decide to hand over the evidence to banker Silas Toronthal, who, after helping them decipher the note, reports the conspiracy to the Austrian authorities who arrest and try the three conspirators. The first is a widower and leaves behind a baby daughter; the second is married and has a son, Pierre; the third has a servant who is entirely dedicated to him. Sandorf and his two friends are trapped in the Pazin fortress, where, upon listening to a conversation, they discover the names of the two informants who made their plan fail.

The convicts tried to escape using a lightning rod, but Ladislau Zathmar was unable to follow them. Sandorf and Bathory find refuge with the Corsican Ferrato, but are denounced by the Spaniard Carpena, who wants the reward and wants to marry the Corsican's daughter. This time, only Sandorf managed to escape. He will survive, changing his identity, thanks to his talent as a doctor and hypnotist.

The narrative then jumps to fifteen years after the events we have just narrated, passing from Trieste to Ragusa, in whose port the rich Dr. Antekirtt disembarks, a mysterious doctor who became rich in the orient. As soon as he arrives he meets and enlists two French Pointe Pescade acrobats, agile and cunning, and Cap Matifou, endowed with incredible strength.

15egvqv,My thoughts on The Count of Monte Cristo,"Did I like this book? Absolutely, it is an incredible novel. Did I love it? No.

Maybe I started reading this with very high expectations because every single review that I read heralded this book as the best ever written and I was expecting something extraordinary, but I got something that was just good. There’s nothing wrong with that but I just don’t  feel that highly about this book.

I don’t like abridged editions. And I’m going say that a book like this doesn’t deserve to be abridged. But a good revision would have been a good idea. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and I think it wouldn’t have hurt the story in any way. I’m not saying Dumas should have gotten rid of any of the scenes, it’s just that some dialogue and some descriptions and some events could have been shorter. There is a lot of repetition going on and sometimes it is just annoying and it ads nothing to the story. I really, really liked the first and the last 200 pages of this. The middle 800… well, those could have been better.

Edmond Dantes was a great character. Really liked him and I was constantly rooting for him and wishing that he would get out of jail and get  back the life that he deserved. But then he turned into The Count. I have never disliked a protagonist more than this guy. A literal Mary Sue, this guy has no weaknesses ( and no Mercedes doesn’t count). He knows nearly everything, is a master fighter, very rich, very beautiful, can make stuff happen with just a snap of his fingers, is an agent of Providence, has The AlMiGhTy GoD behind him and is also the most pretentious character I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. This guy nearly single handedly made this book a chore to read. Only near the end when he starts showing some degree of emotion does he become kinda interesting. And also what was that with Haydee! One moment he thought of her as his daughter and then the next he was lusting after her. Guess Mercedes Benz had  had one too many rides for our dear old Count.

Concerning the villains, only Villefort was the one worth reading about. I personally would have loved a book about him and his family life. He had a life, passions, downfall and feelings; in short he is the only 3d villain in the story. Danglars and Fernand, while they have their reasons, considering Dumas didn’t spent as much time with them, appear to be a bit more cartoonish.

Albert for me is the best character in this novel and the only reason why I kept reading. Because, like Villefort, this guy also is more developed and feels more like a real person. I liked his hotheadedness, his strength and humility and his ability to apologise. He and his mother deserved better.

Anyway, these are my general thoughts about this book. Despite the fact that I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I would have liked, I’m quite excited about reading more Dumas, starting with The Three Musketeers.

28ywwd,I can't believe it took me 23 years to read The Count of Monte Cristo!,"I'm a big fan of classics, so when I found out my wife's favorite book ever was The Count of Monte Cristo, I was intrigued as to why. Of course I had heard of it before back in literature class in high school, but I never had been motivated to pick it up and read it. I guess I thought I'd be missing out on several books by reading this one instead since, unabridged, it clocks in at over 1200 pages. Let me just say, I am so glad I finally worked up the courage to start, because, once I did, I couldn't put it down. I was dead to the rest of the world. The story is absolutely beautiful, and I really feel like Edmond Dantes exemplified a great literary hero we can all appreciate. Also, I have really enjoyed getting to know my wife better by reading and loving her favorite book. I don't mean to ramble, but after finishing The Count, I felt impelled to post to encourage anyone out there to pick it up and read it. It might seem like you aren't getting anywhere at first, and even in the middle, but the plot will unfold beautifully and you will be left extremely satisfied, and probably sad the story is only 1200 pages. You will not be disappointed!

WAIT AND HOPE!

rc1klf,[Question] The Count of Monte Cristo,"Hi everyone! I have no idea if this is the right sub for this question. I’ve tried the specific Monte Cristo sub but my question got deleted.

First off I’d like to say, please no spoilers. I’m currently reading The Count of Monte Cristo for the first time and so far I absolutely love it. I’m currently on chapter 33, titled Roman Bandits. These past few chapters have me a little confused.

I’m not really understanding the role of some of the more recent characters. This is the first time I’ve felt bored in this book. More specifically, I’m talking about the role of Franz, Pastrini, Albert, and the characters around this part of the timeline.

I’ll be honest, I’ve kinda been zoning in and out during these chapters so maybe I missed something important to this part of the story. Is there any way you could give me some context into the purpose of these characters without any major spoilers? I’m just not seeing how they fit into Edmunds story.

Or if you think it’s detrimentally important to the story let me know and I will go back, reread, and try to understand for myself. 

Thanks so much! :)


I will also say I’m not a huge reader so my reading level definitely isn’t the best. There’s been some parts that have been really daunting, maybe it’s just with the translation. I’ve kinda just powered through those parts. Is that pretty normal with this book? If this is one of those parts let me know and I shall power through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rc1klf/question_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2021-12-08 21:33:54,40,17,books
12mn5q7,Favourite translation of The Count of Monte Cristo?,"Pevear and Volokhonsky did a remarkable job translating The Three Musketeers, but unfortunately have not translated The Count of Monte Cristo.

I have examined what I could find of excerpts that are available online and settled on the ""Standard Abridged Version,""  the one available in the Banes and Noble Leatherbound Classic Edition.  I actually own the Penguin Classics version by Robin Buss and prefer the former.  Buss modernizes the language too much to appeal to readers that used to reading more contemporary books.  The B & N version uses language that seems to be more true to the period.  

&#x200B;

HERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF B & N version: 

""Oh"", said Morrel, carried away by his friendship.  ""You do not know him and I do.  He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in all the world, and I will venture to say that there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service.  Oh, Monsieur. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him.""

Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied ""You are aware Monsier that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in his private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal.  Is it not true?""

&#x200B;

HERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE PENGUIN CLASSICS VERSION ""BUSS""

""My good sir,"" carried away by his friendship for the young man.  ""You do not know the person who is being accused; but I know him.  He is the mildest, most honest man you could imagine, I might almost say the man who knows his job best of any in the merchant marine.  Monsieur de Villlefort, I commend him to you most sincerely and with all my heart.""

Villlefort look contemptuously at Morrel and answered coldly: ""You know Monsieur, that one can be mild in one's private life, honest in one's business dealings, and skilled in one's work, yet at the same time, politically speaking, be guilty of great crimes. You do know that, I suppose Monsieur? 

&#x200B;

Now these are obviously very small samples, and I'm sure there are much better examples that illustrate the point I am trying to put forth. But yes, I much prefer the language of the anonymous standard abridged version.  Granted it may leave out small amounts of text, but I can live with that.  I was hoping that others who have read or looked at more than one version can weigh in as well. Maybe I'm weird, but when I read a translated novel, I will often have several translations by my side and then look at different ones if I find a part that is important or that I just like.  Sometimes a certain translation will leave something out.  Lol, I'm weird.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12mn5q7/favourite_translation_of_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2023-04-15 02:43:08,11,19,books
g7jemr,I just finished the longest book I've ever read: The Count Of Monte Cristo,"What a ride! This translated French classic novel was nothing short of grand and satisfying. At its core, it is a revenge tale but offers many layers of commentary and charectisation. 

Initially, I was intimidated by taking the task of reading this book due to its enormous size  (you can imagine my shock when I saw that it exceeded a thousand pages!) Also I typically do not lean towards picking up classics as they do not suit my reading tastes, not to mention my complete lack of connectivity with characters and the overall story. But Mr. Quarantine freed up my schedule and i found myself on the edge of a ledge, ready to take reading risks and take a leap of faith. And boy was I pleasantly surprised with the outcome.

Something about the author of this novel conveying much of the story through dialogue rather than endless narration hooked me. It was like watching a dramatization at some points. 

Given the sheer size of the book, i did not feel boredom or ennui (a word i learned from the book which means boredom or sadness caused by boredom). The plot was exciting, I rooted for the main character and was always amazed by the intelligance in which he constructed his plan for revenge. 
It had a satisfying ending too. 

In conclusion, I loved this book and i recommend it!

17ews3n,Count of Monte Cristo questions on the story (about Bertuccio),"Hello, I have some questions about the story of The Count of Monte Cristo (I finished the book).  

When Bertuccio the smuggler hides from the 
police at his intermediary who turns out to be Caderousse, he surprises the tale of Monte Cristo disguised as Abe Busoni discovering the conspiracies with Caderousse, and giving him a diamond in the name of Edmond Dantès to reward him in  as a friend.  After the greedy Caderousse and his wife kill the buyer of the diamond, the police blame Bertuccio who was there at the time.  I know that Father Busoni saves Bertuccio from the police by exonerating him.  He then recommends him as a servant for Monte Cristo (who is actually himself). 

 I have many qustions. 

 At the time Monte Cristo saves Bertuccio, did he know the link that united him with Villefort's son or is it a happy coincidence that Bertuccio is saved and will constitute the key element in Villefort's fall?  
Then, does Bertuccio accompany Cristo on his travels for 9 years or only join him later when he returns to Europe?  
Above all, how does the tale of Monte Cristo come to know the history of the Maison d'Auteuil when he buys it?  
How could he have predicted that Bertuccio, an ordinary smuggler, would be the key to his revenge against Villefort?  
And since he knew about the house at Auteuil, why make Bertuccio confess in the house, what more did he need to know?

k6ynyy,The Count of Monte Cristo (Unabridged),"Ok ok ok. I’ll admit this is almost a recursive post in that I’m only reading this book right now because it has manifested recommendations in this sub so frequently.

I suppose I’m just writing this to say that I now *completely and unequivocally* understand why so many people rave about this story here in r/books.

This book is just pure, raw badassery and genius woven into a superb set of storylines, relatable characters and first-hand history. I was a bit disappointed that I’d already read the Great Illustrated Classics version as a child and watched the film as an adult, but my concerns were without merit as this may as well be a completely different story. 

Oddly enough, the last book I read was Shogun. Did not expect to be blown away by another sailor turned to despair who recovers through a triumph of will in the 16/17th centuries when I picked up The Count of Monte Cristo. I suppose that shows how little I actually know.

uyierk,What is your opinion on the ending of The Count of Monte Cristo?,"The ending of The Count of Monte Cristo is great in a literary sense, but contextually, it feels very forced. This may be an unpopular opinion.

Monte Cristo ceaselessly and mercilessly exacted revenge for decades. Essentially, he ""waited and hoped"" that his enemies would suffer in agony, just like he did. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

**This beautiful quote:** *""There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope.""* **f

qqg0ak,The Count of Monte Cristo,"I just finished reading this. It was a real slog. I knew the story beforehand but overall I found it so hard to follow and it was generally really confusing. Multiple names and high society titles made it really hard to know what was going on a lot of the time. 

However, my main issue is the whole concept of Edmond's ""revenge"". So much of what happens is just by luck and circumstance. He finds something out so looks into something else which leads to another thing that results in the person having a bad time. Not some clever plan, just luck. Further, so much of the results of his actions rely on the social rules of high society. As none of the main characters come from that society I just felt they would be more canny and more clever. I just didn't believe any of it. 

The narrative jumps in time and location confusingly, things happen between paragraphs in a chapter. Locations change and names ar different. Overall  found it very difficult to follow or really care about. 

I don't know if I missed the point, or didn't ""get it"". I read a lot of books and was really surprised that a classic like this was....well, like this. Has anyone else had this experience?

1as1ylx,The count of Monte Cristo - a great adventure written by Dumas with a touch of Balzac that shows the corruption of French society,"In literature, there are two types of revenge. Firstly, revenge is where the good overcome the bad guys, much to the reader's satisfaction. Then there is the other type of revenge, cruel, savage, the one that rushes blindly before you like a furious bull, leaving the reader perplexed.  
He remained for thirteen years in a cell at the Château D'If, during which young Edmond's frankness and generosity will slowly erode to give way to a fierce hatred against the infamous people who condemned him to the slow agony of prison. He will happily find in the person of his cell neighbor, Abbé Faria, a friend and teacher who will teach him science, philosophy, history, but above all the secret location of a fabulous treasure hidden on the rocky island of Monte Cristo. When Edmond finally manages to escape, he is no longer the same man. He is more educated, successful, and considerably richer, but anger and bitterness have consumed his heart, driving out almost all warm feelings.  
The Count of Monte Cristo is a fabulous character, a charmer who seems to have come out of the Arabian Nights tales, a sorcerer from the Middle Ages. Behind this character hides a man who only has one idea in mind; revenge.  
  
Three men, each of them representing justice, money and the army, three powerful men therefore, established their fortune and their notoriety on a false and diabolical denunciation. They represent selfishness, greed and hatred. Alexandre Dumas shows the hypocrisy, pettiness and cruelty of an opportunistic society obsessed with maintaining its social position and the respectability or powers that it gives it, including the different gears - army, justice, finance - are subject to pettiness and the selfishness of those who direct them.  
The Count of Monte Cristo is a small romantic gem, a passionate story of a long-prepared revenge story with an elaborate plot, but beyond the intrinsic interest of the story, it is above all a formidable book about psychology characters, conflicts between social relations classes, the danger of expressing political opinions or romantic rivalries. With many details and precision, the author tells a story of intense suspense where the tension insidiously increases, until the final outcome. This novel also follows the spirit of Balzac's stories, where beings become vile, revealing all the darkness of the human soul, taking advantage of an opportunity situation and atmosphere, offering the reader a paranoid panorama of a society of unscrupulous careerists, ready to do their worst to climb the social ladder, for money, out of jealousy or to protect themselves from a scandal. If Dumas is not Balzac, in this book he lends him a certain style, but without ever combining it, however, we will maintain many other influences that are very much in vogue, such as an oriental exoticism in the sets and costumes, or an atmosphere of flirtation with dark romanticism sometimes. But this novel remains above all a story that raises real questions, in particular about the notion of justice, evoking denunciation, iniquity, personal revenge and the private justice that replaces that of men, precisely because the latter failed in its impartial application by the rule of law.  
\- the setting of the first part, which takes place during the Restoration and the Hundred Days – a period so superficially studied in secondary studies, but which I am beginning to know better thanks to the novels –, a period marked by strong governmental instability that will lose Edmond Dantès trapped in the game of loyalty to the emperor or king;  
\- Dumas' pen, at once beautiful (despite some redundancies) and full of humor and jokes, draws vivid portraits in just a few lines;  
\- the fascinating figure of the count, inscrutable most of the time, moving when an emotion arises, a prisoner of his revenge that induces an almost absolute loneliness, whose hand moves his human pawns as other hands once disposed of him. From the sympathy we have for Edmond Dantès and beyond the joyful aspect of his Machiavellian plans, we begin to question ourselves about the megalomania of the count who presents himself as the hand of God to punish the wicked.  
The ending of the book was very appropriate. Edmond had transformed from the gentle sailor to the cruel Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of Château D’If. Edmond Haia remained there, the one who escaped was the Count of Monte Cristo. Mercedes does not love that bitter and vengeful man who is very different from her loving Edmond with whom she fell in love. And he cannot love the woman who was married to his enemy. The power of love has its limits, it can help her financially, it can spare the life of her son, but it cannot marry the one who for years was together with one of those responsible for his incarceration in Château D’if. No confession of love would make him forget that. Haydée is suitable for the Count, because she is his mirror, her father was betrayed and killed by Fernand Mondego, she was sold into slavery, until she was rescued by the Count. The same man who was responsible for Haydee losing her family and being sold into slavery, was one of those responsible for Edmond's incarceration, one of those responsible for his father's death and kidnapping his bride. The two had a similar fate and each understands well what the other went through and both have the same motivation, seeking revenge against those responsible for their suffering. Haydée is the Count's mirror, it is much easier for one to understand what the other is facing and to offer the support and love that the other needs.

p8ahyn,The Count Of Monte Cristo discussion,"SPOILERS!


So I've recently finished The Count Of Monte Cristo once again and I just have 2 things on my mind after the ending.

First of all, this book is a god damn masterpiece which I cannot recommend enough, the language and the old timey ideas might not be the easiest for everyone to get past but trust me it's all worth it.

Secondly, I wanted to open to discussion what did you think about Danglars' punishment?

out of all of Edmond's wrong doers he was definitely the worst one. He was the one who initiated the frame and came up with the idea to destroy Edmond's life out of pure hatered towards Edmond and absolute revulsion of his happiness.

Now, while it is true that the Count destroyed Danglars family, reputation, business and capital in Paris, at the end it feels almost off that he just let's him go upon hearing his forced fake apology. mind you, Danglars was being held hostage and starved to death to the point where he would say and do anything for just a crumb of bread, hence I see his apology as nothing more than meaningless words to save his own skin - not to mention that he ""repented"" for his sins while not even knowing who is he speaking to, only after he ""repents"" does the Count reveals himself.

Compare it to Caderousse, De Villefort and Fernand's punishments, to me, it just feels much much more lenient.
Danglars is released and is free to live his life as he sees fit and is even left with a quite a bit of money (50k francs) which means he isn't even destined to a ""hard"" life.

I've seen a few people on this sub chucking it up to ""growth"" or some kind of ""character development"" for the Count but honestly? I disagree. In the chapters before Danglars last punishment we see the Count dealing with the morality problems that his revenge caused, he goes to his old town and later on to his old cell room and remembers all of the old emotions and despair he experienced back then, a thing which only reminds him why he even took the vengeance vow to begin with.

In my eyes it would fit much better if everything played out the same way for Danglars (being captured by Vampa and drained of his money and sanity slowly) but instead of letting him go, the Count would reveal himself as Edmond and make Danglars repent his sins only to then leave him as a slave for Vampa's crew (thus taking away his life and freedom without anything he could do about it, just like he did to Edmond at the beginning of the book).

This would ultimately close the circle for all his punishments. Since he never wanted to kill them because it would be much too merciful and quick,  but instead give them an agonizing and slow punishment that will amount to the same suffering they caused him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p8ahyn/the_count_of_monte_cristo_discussion/,2021-08-20 18:02:08,21,21,books
2fjo79,"Just finished reading ""The Count of Monte Cristo.""","Wow, I'm just blown away by how good this book was. Let me preface this by saying that after high school English, I stopped reading books. I actually downloaded this book because it was free to download when I got my iPad. It took me a while to read it, but once I got to the second half, I wasn't able to put it down, it was unlike anything I've ever read before. 

The character relationships and the way Dumas writes created such vivid images in my head. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot twists, even though many times I could see some of them coming.

I can honestly say, this book has made me want to read so much more. There are so many messages that this book sends, which will stay with me for a long time.

129oiz1,Question about this familial relationship in The Count of Monte Cristo,"I wanted to know your thoughts on what I thought was going to be an important plot point from The Count of Monte Cristo. Obviously Benedetto is a crucial character to the story, being the secret illegitimate son of M Villefort and Mme Danglars. One of my first realizations after finding this out was that makes him the half sibling of Eugénie Danglars. Once Monte Cristo started pushing for the engagement between Benedetto and Eugénie, I thought for sure his long term goal was going to be revealing at the last possible second that two were actually half siblings, resulting in the humiliation of the Danglars and Villefort families.

But then Benedetto murders Caderousse, and his parentage is revealed at his trial at the end of the book. Villefort is then humiliated because he, the crown prosecutor, is the father of a murderer, and an illegitimate one at that. That makes sense, but the fact that Benedetto and Eugénie are half siblings is never brought up. Ever. It really felt like a loose end that never got tied up. Why else would Monte Cristo recommend that Benedetto and Eugénie be married? Benedetto hadn’t murdered Caderousee yet, so the sibling relationship is the only angle that makes sense.

rw8rub,The Count of Monte-Cristo,"  

The work begins in 1815. Louis XVIII rules France, Napoleon is exiled to Elba. Edmond Dantes, a sailor from Marseilles, after the captain's death, commands the crew of the three-masted brig ""Pharaoh"". The owner of the Morrel ship promises 19-year-old Edmond the post of captain. The beloved Mercedes is waiting at the port of Dantes. The wedding is soon.

Dantes has two implacable enemies: Danglars, who dreams of becoming a captain, and Fernand Mondego, Mercedes' cousin, in love with a girl.

They decide to use against Edmond the fact that, at the captain's request, he delivered the package on the island of Elba, and from Napoleon he received a message for Monsieur Noirtier in Paris. Dantes, he knows nothing about the content of the cards and is far from political games. But Danglars' denunciation, which Fernand utters, lands the hero in prison on the very day of the wedding.

Noirtier's son, Villefort's prosecutor, doesn't want to risk his career for the Bonapartist's father, so he sends Dantes to the most terrible prison for political criminals in the port of Marseille - the Château d'If.

In Napoleon's 100 Days, Morrel tries to rescue Dantes, but in vain. The most brilliant pages of the novel are the hero's 14 years in prison. Edmond loses faith in deliverance, feels the pain of unjust accusation.

The meeting with Abbot Faria, an Italian priest, opens up the world of knowledge and the long-awaited path to freedom. Before his death, Abbot Fario made Dantes the heir to a 16th-century treasure hidden on an uninhabited island in the Tuscan archipelago.

How close are Dumas and Bulgakov's heroes in The Master and Margarita: Dantes and Ivan Bezdomny are disciples who find in captivity (prison, hospital) their mentors - Abbot Faria and Master. Furthermore, the teacher comes to the student in a desperate hour, giving the impression of an outcast, and then the teacher dies, giving the student a new path.

Edmond finds treasures and swears revenge on everyone who imprisoned him in the Château d'If. Their revenge is romantically sophisticated: the villains will perish from their vices - greed, betrayal and vanity. To translate his plans, he needs a mask and time

The Count cannot stop in revenge and cruelty, but does not punish Mercedes, saves Valentine, daughter of Villefort from death.

The author leads us through the labyrinths of treachery, greed, resourcefulness and cunning, strips the masks from the villains, shows that big problems begin with petty betrayal. Yes, revenge is cruel, but retribution for sins is inevitable.

The Count took revenge, but found no happiness, he remains an eternal wanderer, rebellious, restless soul.

**As for the end of Edmond and Mercedes not being together:**

**I don't see a hollywood-style happy ending as mandatory.**

**Great books like Anna Karenina don't have a Hollywood happy ending and that doesn't diminish their grandeur.**

And if Edmond had looked for Mercedes to run away together, couldn't he have generated a guilty conscience in her, for abandoning her son as she had with Anna Karenina with Seryozha? Would Albert accept the relationship between Edmond and Mercedes? Wouldn't that generate guilt in Mercedes for having to choose between Edmond or her son?

gyd6dk,Just finished The Count of Monte Cristo for the first time,"And I loved it! 

Despite it’s length, it was such an entertaining and well-written book all the way through. The plot twists were brilliant (Villefort being a Benedetto’s father was a really big reveal for me) and seeing The Count play everyone was so fun when you know his intentions, especially the conversation surrounding Villefort’s buried child at Auteil. Slowly realising his methods of revenge was very satisfying, though I do believe Villefort’s end was unusually cruel especially compared to Danglers. 

Glad Éugenie, Albert, Valentine and Morrel got their happy endings. The Count was such an interesting character to follow and the letter at the end contained my favourite quote in the book (He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness.

pebsqw,The Count of Monte Cristo - Conflicted about the Ending (SPOILERS),"I'm feeling very conflicted about the ending to this book. While I thoroughly enjoyed, I can't help feeling the Count is somewhat evil or ambivalent rather than good. I also felt what happened with Mercedes was really tragic, and that she suffered needlessly and I felt unfairly. After all both her and the Count had feelings for each other, wouldn't it make more sense for them to end up together, since she never really loved Fernand anyway? 

How did Mercedes fate at the end make sense? Was it fair? Was it unfair? Did how the Count treated her and his feelings towards her match up? Did the way she felt towards him and her actions towards him match up? 

I recently finished listening to an audiobook of the Count of Monte Cristo, originally going into it after watching the movie with the mind that the retribution and revenge that Edmond would exact on his former friends would be fully justified, and that The Count would end up somewhat good at the end.

Couldn't have been further from the truth. If anything I'd go so far as to say that the book differs greatly from the movie on one point particularly. That the Count of Monte Cristo, is far more of a cold cruel and calculating character not often moved by things of the heart, except perhaps when it comes to Mercedes and sparing Albert, but considering the fact that the majority of the book he spends with her son as his best friend I think perhaps shows he did not entirely intend to fight or kill Albert.

I feel that in the book the Count has a fair amount of machismo, making his character equal in braveura to characters like the Godfather, whereas in the movie he's seen more as an avenging angel Christian character which perhaps is what he thought of himself, though in all actuality he was more like a gangster, or tyrant.

I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't help wondering whether or not his revenge on Villefort was entirely moral by the end, and what happened with Mercedes truly left me heartbroken. Most especially when she was looking off at the ocean after her son, still calling the name of the man who never returned to her, except as a phantom bringing death and despair.

Somehow I feel it would've been better, far better if the two of them had ended up together by the end.  I can't fault Mercedes 100% on what happened to her. I think after losing Edmond she must have felt her life was worthless and what would be the point to turning away Fernands advances when now the man she loved was dead, what purpose was there in continuing on when the life she had wanted had been stolen from, and perhaps she was correct in saying that she had been somewhat cowardly, but I know very few women who after losing the man they truly love in such a tragic and violent way would be capable of withstanding such grief and still keep their heads.

I think her choice to marry Fernand was more out of desperation and surrendering to the cruelty of the world than out of any sort of affection for him.

So my question is, wouldn't it have made more sense for them to be together. After all I think it's very obvious to the Count that she still loves him, at that moment in the garden when the two of them were walking together. And if her husband killed himself it can't be entirely blamed on the Count. I can't help but feel that if the Count chose to take Mercedes for himself he could have done so easily, and that she would have willingly run away with him.

I felt that her fate at the end was undeserved, and I think in the process of him visiting revenge on Fernand that Mercedes was collateral damage.

Personally, it would have made just as much sense to me if the two of them had ended up together, and I can't see a reason why they wouldn't except so that Haydee could have someone to be with by the end.

I've tried to explain it logically, in the sense that perhaps there was some amount of guilt in her heart of what happened to her husband and that made it impossible for her to forgive the Count... but really I feel its a little bit of an excuse, or that perhaps they could've ended up together some other way.

The way the book ends on that note is just so tragic and I can seem to reconcile it with myself. Also what happens to Villefort, though much of it is done by the hand of his murderous wife.

I don't know, the whole thing just leaves me unsettled, and part of me can't see why it could've ended well and been just as realistic while still having a good ending. I thought that the tie in with him and Haydee was a bit weak and the result of bad writing, or trying to tie up the plot in a way that gave her character a good ending.

I can't help feeling that the original intention of Dumas was to have these two end up together.

I suppose it was just too much for me really that seen of her watching the ship sail away really broke my heart.

Any thoughts or contributions to this would be appreciated. If anyone could explain a logical reason for the book to end the way it does, please do. Or at least make the ending Mercedes suffer seem fair to me, right now I can't help feeling broken about it and feeling that Mercedes deserved none of the tortures she suffered, and perhaps she suffered as much as the Counts enemies without him realizing it, which I don't think was his intention.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pebsqw/the_count_of_monte_cristo_conflicted_about_the/,2021-08-30 05:31:14,27,24,books
qjfu8u,The Count Of Monte-Cristo,"“How many times do we go through our happiness, without realizing it, without looking at it; but even if we look, we won't recognize it. ""

In the center of the plot, we see a young sailor from Marseilles Edmond Dantes, who returns from a long journey for his fiancée, a poor Mercedes fisherman. But your envious people are sailing the ship with Dantes and, as a result of a conspiracy, our hero is trapped in Château d'If.

It's important to note beforehand that in addition to several friends, our hero has three envious enemies:

\- Fernand Mondego. Lost in love by Edmond's bride, a young man. Despite the constant presence around you, the ""friendship zone"" is solid and indestructible.

\- Danglars. An accountant who had a big fight with Dantes for an unknown reason (not surprisingly, on the other hand).

\- Caderousse. Neighbor of Dantes. Instead, he's just jealous of the danger.

Edmond returns with an unusual death request from the previous captain - to receive a letter on the Isle of Elba to a certain Noirtier.

Well then, the letter has been received, it still has to be delivered, but Dantes is in a hurry to find his beloved. The head of the company decides to make the captain ""deputy"" from yesterday, a wedding is being prepared.

Meanwhile, three enemies are chatting in the tavern about the current state of affairs. And they come up with an insidious plan - to write an anonymous letter with your left hand and cast Edmond as a Bonapartist agent. Note that Cadrusse was against slander. Therefore, Danglars crumpled the letter, but did not burn it, but threw it in a corner, giving Fernand a tip.

As a result, Edmond is soon arrested at the wedding. During interrogation, prosecutor Villefort realizes that Edmond is innocent. But the recipient, Noirtier, is his father, although he is the exact opposite of his son. The letter was burned and Edmond, the last witness, was imprisoned in the castle of If.

All attempts to get Dantes out of the dungeon, made by Morrell, the head of the company, and his fiancee, Mercedes, failed. Edmond then received a ""life sentence"" in one of the most impregnable dungeons.

Next, we learn how Edmont Dantes spent many years in prison, and this is perhaps the first thing that captured mine.

The author masterfully conveys the state of Edmond Dantes to the reader. At first, the hero still believes that everything that happens to him is a mistake, that now everything will be clear, he will be released and returned to his bride Mercedes. But day gives way to night, one day follows and he is still in the dark, dank cellars of the Château d'If. Edmond begins to understand that he is doomed to stay in this prison for the rest of his days, that no one will help him anymore.

After going through all the stages of despair, Dantes finds a friend - Abbé Faria.

Once, a neighbor entered Edmond's solitary confinement. It turns out that, by mistake: the old scholar planned to run away, but made a mistake in his calculations, because he did not have precise instruments at hand

Together they reconstructed the picture of events, discovered who the author of the anonymous letter was. And also two other malefactors. Before, he swore revenge against his enemies.

The abbé taught Edmond everything he himself knew: exact sciences and languages. And he also talked about the treasures of the Spada clan, whose members are dead and the location known to an abbot.

After Faria's death, Edmond had the chance to leave the Château d'If in a canvas bag instead of a corpse. Fortunately, a knife made from shards of clay turned out to be a very useful heirloom.

“In this world there is neither happiness nor unhappiness, both are understood only in comparison. Only one who was infinitely unhappy is able to experience infinite happiness. ""

After Edmond Dantes' fantastic escape from IW Castle, my favorite part about revenge begins, and from that moment on, the kind and open young Edmond Dantes is replaced by the stern and calculating Count of Monte Cristo.

""Only the Count of Monte Cristo can demand anything from the Count of Monte Cristo.""

It's HER MAJESTY REVENGE and reasoning about it that plays a dominant role throughout the novel, revenge is thought through and described in detail here, everything I love. Revenge has become the sole purpose of the Count of Monte Cristo's life, but it fills his heart. Sometimes revenge clouds the protagonist's mind and leads to dire consequences.

""Hate is blind, anger is reckless, and anyone who delights in revenge runs the risk of drinking from a bitter cup.""

Morrell the Younger inherits from the Count of Treasures and his underground palace on the island of Monte Cristo.

And the earl himself, now with his beloved Haydee, is sailing a high-speed ship on a voyage.

Is it revenge or retribution? Oath-keeping, personal ambition or exposure of vices and restoration of justice?

**Adaptations I watch**

\- **The Count of Monte-Cristo** (Le conte de Monte-Cristo ) 1954 with Jean Marais.

Edmond Dantes spent 17 years at the Chateau d'If, while Dumas was only 14. Considering the rapid development of events in France during this period, he found himself free in a completely different country, he fled in 1833 after the fall of Charles X There are no Danglars in the film, their roles have been taken over by Fernand and Caderousse, who in the film becomes the Pharaoh's captain's mate, while Dumas has him as a tailor and neighbor to Dantes.

Furthermore, almost the entire plot of the Crown Prosecutor of Villefort has fallen out of the movie version, except for his illegitimate son, whom Monte Cristo brought in under the name Viscount de Cavalcanti. And his name is Bruno in the film, while in the novel-Benedetto (from the Italian ""vendetta""-""revenge"", blood feud). In the novel, the Corsican Bertuccio not only meets Benedetto, but also educates him, while in the film he is a simple thief, a stranger to the Corsicans of the time. And that's why smuggler Jacopo plays his role in the film. Mercedes is jealous of him for Haydee.

**- The Count of Monte-Cristo (1975) with Richard Chanberlain**

In 1975, the British presented their version of the Count of Monte Cristo. Strange, but they tried to fit a huge 1200-page novel into a movie of just over an hour and a half. Most of the film's time is occupied by the story of Edmond Dantes until his escape from the Château d'If. Also, in the remaining half hour, the director tries to fit the entire second part of the novel, which is about revenge. Here, heroes just seem to be identified, like pieces on a chessboard that weren't even allowed to make their move. Character characters are not disclosed.

The film also has many discrepancies with the original source, some of the characters being completely absent. For example, Valentina de Villefort is a very eccentric girl, the opposite of the image described by Dumas, moreover she is in love with Albert de Morserf, as Maximilian Morrel is simply not in the film. The ending has been rewritten.

**- The Prisoner of Château d'If (Узник замка Иф) 1988 with Viktor Avilov**

The plot of the three episodes of the film is more consistent with the original source, although there are discrepancies.

A few things were changed in the Soviet adaptation. For example, Caderousse dies long before his term, and at the hands of Carconte, not Benedetto, when trying to rob the Monte Cristo mansion on the Champs Elysees. Villefort's plot was simplified, Valentina de Villefort and Maximilian Morrel only appear almost as extras. Benedetto only seems to commit Bertuccio's murder and expose the truth about Villefort at the trial. The ending is Count and Haydee.

**- The Count of Monte-Cristo (Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) 1998 with Gerard Depardieu**

The Count of Monte-Cristo (Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) 1998 with Gerard Depardieu

The beginning of the novel is almost completely discarded, just the moment of the arrest of Edmond Dantes, and some memories of the Count - was all we saw. The second part, dedicated to Dantes' revenge, is told in some detail. So detailed that for the first time there appears a character that does not exist in the novel - a certain Camille de la Richardais, lover of Monte Cristo. Haydee is pushed into the backyard, however, not to be abandoned, she marries Franz d'Epinay - a typically female ending. Benedetto in the series is called Toussaint and is not published under the name Viscount Andrea de Cavalcanti. Many other things were also misinterpreted. The woman decided to make the end of the film optimistic: the Count of Monte Cristo, having annexed Haydee Franz, leaves his treasures to the monks, and he himself returns to the Mercedes. In the novel, Monte Cristo leaves his cave on the island of Monte Cristo, a house on the Champs Elysees, a villa in Italy and many other properties to Maximilian Morrell and Valentina de Villefort.

Gerard Depardieu presents us not a cold avenger who served in a terrible prison for 14 years and then lived for several years in the Orient, refined and aristocratic, but a prosperous, life-loving bourgeois who loves to eat and drink, loves women and all kinds of entertainment. A kind of glutton, with a thick belly and neck, not much like the handsome Dantes in Dumas's novel. He loves theater, always changes masks and loves makeup. And it seems that the performance itself occupies much more than the goal itself - revenge.

**- - The Count Of Monte-Cristo (2002) with James Caviezel**.

The film was expensive, spectacular and, most importantly, it has nothing to do with the original source. Here it was just a parody of the novel. The beginning is tragic and on a grand scale, until a shootout was put into the plot. Instead of ""Monsieur"" - they called him ""Sir"". In short, it's bad, albeit expensive. Just having the names from the book.

The entire plot is based on the confrontation between Dantes and Fernand. The rest of the heroes are extras. There are several absurdities. Dantes' father hanged himself and didn't starve to death, Mercedes ended up giving birth to Edmond's son (when did she get that?), and Albert de Morcert defends his adoptive father, the Count of Morserf. Then, after Fernand's death, Albert mourns his adoptive father, but still accepts Edmond. In the end, Dantes buys Chateau d'If and comes to live with his family.

There are other adaptations, but I still don't watch.

A lot of the books I was forced to read for English or APES bored me, especially the Scarlet Letter, or I just wasn't interested in it. But something about The Count of Monte Cristo made me fall in love with it.

n4yx7j,Red The count of monte cristo.,"It's a masterpiece,no doubt everyone says that. The encounter with danglers,villefort and Fernand was something gives you chills. I wept when Faria died and in the episode of the past where Dante recollected his memories of imprisonment. Overall the book made me happy at end. Tough only regret is that dumas should have put more development on the relationship of haydee and the count. But I loved edmond and when he finally realized his salvation through haydee as he once loved Mercedes.

po2hzc,Shakespeare and The Count of Monte Cristo,"After escaping from prison and learning that his fiancée has married one of the perpetrators of his imprisonment, the protagonist says to himself the famous phrase of Hamlet: ""Frailty, thy name is woman!"". Subsequently, talking about the same Mercedes, Monte Cristo quotes that ""a woman is like a wave."" Bertuccio points to Villefort ""in almost the same gesture as Macbeth points to Banquo,"" but this comparison is reversed - it points not to the victim, but to the murderer (who, however, did not commit the murder, but almost did it). Finally, Monte Cristo tells Madame de Villefort that Lady Macbeth wanted to ""put her son on the throne, not her husband."" However, this is necessary in order to influence Villefort's wife. Of course, there is no need to think about any new interpretation of the behavior of Shakespeare's heroine.

>!Much more important than these and some other links are hidden parallels. However, the parallel with “Romeo and Juliet” can hardly be called hidden - it is simply exposed. Just like Lorenzo's brother Juliet, Monte Cristo gives Valentina de Villefort a drink, after which she is considered dead and buried in the family crypt. Further, the complete resemblance to Shakespeare begins to change a little: Maximilian Morrel, who loves Valentina, unlike Romeo, does not enter the crypt, but, like Romeo, decides to commit suicide. Finally, there is a complete departure from Shakespeare: the Count of Monte Cristo manages to prevent his friend from committing suicide.!<

>!Then the parallel with Romeo and Juliet begins to smoothly turn into parallel with ""The Winter's Tale"". Monte Cristo promises Morrell that he will organize an easy death for him, but only in a month, if he does not calm down. Maximilian agrees and takes an oath.!<

>!Hermione, presumed dead, had tested Leontes' love for sixteen years. Maximilian, unlike Leonte, is not guilty of anything, and his love is tested for one month (among other things, the development of the plot did not allow for a long time). Love passes this test. A month later, Maximilian still wants death, the persuasions of Monte Cristo do not work on him. He thinks that he is dying, but in fact he is sleeping, in a dream he sees Valentina, and when he wakes up, he realizes that he sees her in real life life is surrounded by sleep ”, because Valentine was certainly dead for him).!<

>!There was a parallel with the transformation of the statue into a living woman (or rather, into living women) a little earlier, when in the same room Franz d'Epinay, who had smoked hash from Monte Cristo, was seduced by former statues, and vaguely he saw a bashful statue wrapped in a veil. Subsequently, d'Epinay almost married Valentina, but her grandfather interfered with the wedding, saving his beloved granddaughter from an unnecessary marriage, and this repeated the narcotic episode with an inaccessible statue. The tandem ""Valentine - Statue"" appears. Thus, a parallel is drawn between the ""resurrection"" of Hermione and the ""resurrection"" of Valentine.!<

>!The main ones are the parallels with ""The Tempest"". In a sense, The Tempest can be considered the source of the Count of Monte Cristo as well as the chapter The Diamond of Vengeance in the book Notes. From the archives of the Parisian police. ""!<

>!All the action of ""The Tempest"" takes place on the island. The image of the island is also very important in the ""Count of Monte Cristo"". Prospero on the island from a duke, carried away by science and art, turns into a magician, a wizard; Monte Cristo, having found a treasure on his island, begins to manipulate people, seeking (like Prospero) to punish the guilty and reward the good.!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/po2hzc/shakespeare_and_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2021-09-14 13:12:10,9,38,books
lh2yq9,The Count of Monte Cristo (Semi-spoilers),"I'm reading an unabridged version of CMC and holy Toledo, I've never been so emotionally impacted by the actions of fictional characters. M. Villefort is truly a deplorable individual, and I hadn't really come to that conclusion on my first read through during high school. I loved it then but even more so now. The novel is at turns heart-wrenching, exhilarating, and frustrating to know human nature has not changed an ounce. Dumas was utterly brilliant in it's crafting, and I'm very excited to continue this journey.

Update Edit: WTF GUYS. In chapter 15 ""#34 and #27"" Dumas describes Dantes going through the 5 stages of grief using basically all the proper diagnostic verbiage.

Well, whether we like it or not, the Disney/Touchstone/Buena Vista 2002 movie is the ONLY Monte Cristo that a lot of people had experienced. The overall ratings are higher than I expected on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and even on some less-Monte-Cristo-specialized subreddits. Some people genuinely LOVE the movie. Now personally, I think it's a fun adventure film, but it just ain't the real thing. I take issue with the HUGE SLEW of rewrites, missing characters, missing sublots, characters altered beyond recognition AND added violence like whippings and unnecessary swordfights.

To take advantage of the influx of Monte Cristo noobs, I'd noticed that there are a bunch of dodgy e-books floating around. In this day and age, anyone with a computer can create and sell an e-book. They mooch a photo or two from the movie, grab a text version of the book in public domain and sell it. It's like printing money. HOWEVER, at least 4 of these dodgy e-books shamelessly pilfer their cover art from the movie, with no credit or permission from Disney/Touchstone/Buena Vista. I thought that Disney was big on defending their IP?

There is ONE ""authorized"" movie tie-in book, from Penguin Books, but the text contents are not from the movie's screenplay or script. Instead, it's just yet another reprint of the ""Standard Abridged edition"" (circa 1928) that has a decent resemblance to the original, with more modern language but missing chapters and subplots. So people buying it, hoping to read the movie-version of the story will be sorely disappointed. Revenge? Why is it taking so long? Who's Maximilian and Valentine and Haydee?

Just seems to me that, if Disney/Touchstone/Buena Vista were marketing an authorized movie tie-in book, they should have gone the route of *Bram Stoker's Dracula*. Dracula's movie-book marketing seems confusing, but it goes like this: 2 different versions exist, both using graphics from the movie. One is the real Bram Stoker novel, but the other is a novelized version of the movie screenplay. People who LOVED the movie and wanted to read about Prince Vlad and his romance with Mina can enjoy the novelized screenplay. People who want the real thing can get the real thing, with movie graphics on the cover.

hc8x5e,Unpopular opinion: The Count of Monte Cristo is not a must read,"This book just isn’t that good. There's a semblance of a great story beneath the bloated text, but you really have to dig. The prison scenes and escape were great but after that it just completely dies down. I think I have to give up on reading it (currently on page 392 of 875). The rhetoric is dated and very difficult to read.

Here’s a passage to demonstrate what I mean by bloated. To preface, this passage is between two characters planning a meeting together in the future:

'Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?'  
'Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!'  
'Nay,' said the count; ""I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.'  
'And in three months time,' said Albert, 'you will be at my house?'  
'Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?' enquired the count; 'only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.'  
'Day for day, hour for hour,' said Albert.; 'that will suit me to a dot.' - 'So be it, then;' replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, 'today is the 21st of February;' and drawing out his watch, added, 'it is exactly half-past ten o'clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.'  
'Capital exclaimed Albert; 'your breakfast shall be waiting.'  
'Where do you live?' - 'No. 27, Rue de Helder.'  
'Have you bachelor's apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience.' - 'I reside in my father's house; but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard, entire separated from the main building.'  
'Quite sufficient,' replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he wrote down 'No. 27 Rue de Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the morning'.  

Do we really need to know the exact time and address of the future meeting? And do we really need the count to confirm the appointment word for word?

Prophecy came true and my next two books failed me miserably. In one way or another, they could not measure up to the brilliance of Monte Cristo. I guess this post-book depression happens with many. We are longing for words in a new book to move us like they did the time you read a great book.

Until, Stoner happened

This novel is so full of sentiments, even in its sombre tone. The elegance with which it tells the extraordinary story of an ordinary man. In a way, I think both Monte Cristo and Stoner are about ""letting go"" : vengeance in the former and thinking of one's life as failure in the latter.

czwr0h,I finished reading The Count Of Monte Cristo an hour ago...,"This is a true soap opera. *I*t's true in the sense that it is never once **cheap.** It goes on and on and if you're invested early on, it takes you on this unpredictable journey peopled with wonderful characters and places, the entirety of 19th century France and leaves you on the other side a pulp, mangled and rosy-eyed, knowing you'll never find anything quite like it again. When you read this, you feel French, like you're in 19th century France. After a while I read everything in french and caught myself speaking with the accent. France must really have been a beautiful place in Dumas' eyes. Marseille is a truly wonderful place.

I loved the pacing, it was fast and rarely was stuck in a lull---the shortness of the chapter lengths worked with the prose as tightly as a gear turning another. To a fault at parts. Some chapters, I think, could have done with being just a tiny bit longer. But these thrilling chapters that carry on a certain plot driver in one of the subplots in the novel really skim the daunting feeling that 1,2k pages gives you.

The main character is captivating, commanding and sympathetic. Even in the height of The Count's powers he was human, a little fragile, because after all we knew where he was his softest. His pain in the Chateaux D'If is brutal, every reader wants him out of there as soon as possible but then the power of Dumas' writing shines through when he manages to(IMO) turn this grim setting into the scene for probably the most moving, most thrilling, most powerful section of the novel and easily the best thing I've read in years culminating into a chapter: The Graveyard Of The Chateaux D'If, which is a chapter so perfectly written, I can scarcely think of anything I've read better in my whole life. After This point in the novel, then, does **The Count Of Monte Cristo** begin, and it feels like you've earned it in the best of ways.

Now, some characters were insufferable, not only because they were intended as they were our main villains(Danglars, Villefort). Some characters were so insufferable because they were quite frankly, flat. So flat they stole the life out of a chapter as soon as I'd see their name. Characters like Valentine. Valentine, who is the object of the fiery love of a pure man, whose purity can lend him a static flatness but Valentine: who has only one tone of speaking, who has one expression or two, who is melancholic(though it is not a sin) but so utterly melancholic and flat that she, personally, undersells the passionate love she's committed to. Downright hideous, boring and insufferable characters like Eugenie, the masculine young woman who could be lesbian with such delusions of grandeur you just want to get in the book and slap her!

&#x200B;

Some points of view switches were drawn out. Again, because of my annoyance at this point, I can easily recall: the point at which Valentine and Morrel are making a promise with old Noirtier; the whole thing amounts to 50 or 60 pages and is again, people with these flat characters that drain the support that I, the reader should feel for them. These are all very essential in the grand scheme, but they could have been cut down significantly. Did I mention how long it took me to read this? 3 weeks. I'm no fast reader, I cannot read past something I don't think I grasp but when I got to this section, 850 pages in, a week into reading this, I got stuck. This part took the wind out of my sails. I wonder how others felt about this, knowing that others felt the same about the Rome section.

I think mankind lost teleportation technology at some point, and The Count had it. How quickly did our man get from Italy to France, in a day? So quickly was he in A that in B he'd get there in an inexplicable flash and leave you wondering whether or not you read over a few pages.

&#x200B;

But this is a book that lingers on today because of the powerful humanity it nurses in the heart of the story: revenge, losing that which you held dear, changing, acquiring fortune, power, elegance, love, forgiveness and friendship and the dark side of mankind.

The first part of the book, until Dantes escapes from prison, was probably the best part of any book I had ever read, it was incredibly engaging and I just couldn't put the book down for a moment, the dialogues with Faria and all of their moments in prison were just amazing to read.

kltyjc,Just finished The count of monte Cristo. Spoilers,"Just finished the book a while ago and wow. Frist things first, I am stunned by how the revenge story was played out and did not expect it. In any other revenge story the main character would put them in situations which they are framed or it seems untactful and not very interesting. I love how the Count did not really take them down, but instead uncovered their crimes and faults and let the wrong doers do it to themselves. For example when Danglers was going to marry his daughter to Prince Andres and the Count saying ""Oh idk if that's a good idea my man, I do not know the fellow and neither do you"" yet Danglers greed made him full speed ahead. 

My favorite part of the story is how I rooted for the fall of the families, and very violently too. Just imagine me rubbing my hands together saying yessssssss destroy them count. until it actually happened and I felt bad for each man. Just like the book said when  

Fernand fell, we all feel happy to hear of the folly's until you see the hurt and actually feel pity for them. From then on, even I questioned if the Count should continue, but by then the plans were in place and unstoppable. Not only did these men ruin themselves but I questioned, just like Dante, if he should have sought out the revenge. 

However Villefort downfall was the harshest and yet the most deserving. How he continued to think of himself as the hand of justice that strikes down the evil in the world with no mercy, but allows his own crimes to go unaccounted for. To the point he forces his wife to kill herself, and does not realize the irony in it until the very end and his crimes are brought to the light of day. Only when forced to publicly face his crimes does he acknowledge them as such. However his son dying was a bit too far, but not the counts fault. All he did was provide the means and both the husband and wife did it on their own accord. 

On one hand I do feel that Mercedes should not have been punished so harshly, but also part of me says she should. I know the modern attitude for love is more along of ""girl your man gone forever. Forget about him and move on."" But if the love of my life have been wrongfully taken, how could you live genuinely and still love another. In a more 1800 century context, it seems more unforgivable, especially compared to what Morrel was willing to do once his love was gone. 

Finally I see a lot of hate on the over the ending and really don't understand. I know tons of people who put modern day standards on situations without acknowledging that this was totally normal in the day. 40 year old men married 18 year old's all the time, especially rich men. King Henry Viii married an 16-17 year old when he was 49 and no one thought anything of it. ""But oh he is her father!!"" Not really. It was clearly shown through out the novel that the Count felt for very few people and did not even look at his relationship with her other than a means to revenge, until opps he feel in love.

p129kq,The origins of the Count of Monte Cristo,"I'm sure most fans of the Dumas's epic, *The Count of Monte Cristo*, have heard about its connection to Dumas's father, but less well known is its actual origin. This is not to say that his father's life did not inspire the story in any way but once you look into this real life Count of Monte Cristo story—the life of Pierre Picaud—no doubt will remain as to the inception of the long loved tale. If you have already read the book I highly suggest reading the police-files-turned-narrative of Pierre Picaud [here](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.220671/page/n19/mode/2up).

If, like me, you thought that *The Count of Monte Cristo,* while making for a brilliant story, pushed the boundaries of possibility, then the uncanny events found in the archives of the Police de Paris will make the narrative all the more believable and spectacular. From the humble young man betrothed to his love, framed by jealous conspirators, to the starving prisoner who forms a friendship with an Italian abbe in the next cell who bestows upon him immeasurable wealth, to the illustrious and vengeful ""count"", the events you read in this will be hard to grasp as factual events that occurred in the past.

jp21fb,The Count of Monte Cristo is slowly (VERY slowly) killing me,"Hey folks!

So I thought I needed to branch out with my reading, in general I read fantasy, sci-fi, pretty much anything by Stephen King, the usual stuff. I figured I need to get some vegetables in my diet, so what better way to increase my literary knowledge than to read a 200 year old, 1400 page unabridged French adventure novel? 

Turns out, my head is apparently broken.

**SPOILERS ABOUND FROM HERE ON OUT!!**

So the first several hundred pages were actually really good. The start moved very briskly, and in a few short chapters the story really got going, Edmond got arrested and thrown into French Alcatraz, met an old dying monk, and executed a daring prison break which was some riveting stuff. Once that's done, he gets a hold of some treasure (apparently an unlimited amount of cash) and then... skip forward.

That's when the trouble starts.

For some reason Dumas decided to skip forward like 10 years ahead. We don't actually get to see Dantes become the titular count, he just goes from poor bearded ex-con to Donald J. Trump in the space of 2 pages. Then the story starts spending huge swaths with different characters in different geographic locations. The count itself, when he deigns to appear, acts like a smug know it all, who apparently knows literally everything ever, speaks many languages, and in general is just really unlikeable to me. 

My reading really slows as things became much less exciting, but once the story hit Paris and a bunch of familial and court drama I just couldn't read more than a chapter at a time, and to be honest I have very little desire to see where things are headed. The story devolved into what feels like endless melodramatic multipage monologues, with the whole revenge  plot seeming to be forgotten for dozens if not hundreds of pages at a time. 

It feels like this book has beaten me. Should I keep pushing forward? Will the payoff be worth it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jp21fb/the_count_of_monte_cristo_is_slowly_very_slowly/,2020-11-06 09:15:58,21,24,books

What if Haydée were married and left her husband and child for Edmond? They say Edmond left Mercedes to marry a virgin.

It happened in Russia with the beautiful and young Anna Timiryova who started an affair with the admirable Alexander Kolchak who was older than she, later left her husband and son for Admirla who was also married.

This was shown in the movie Admiral (2008).

orexln,"""The Sultan of Monte Cristo"" (by Holy Ghost Writer) 2013. Alleged sequel to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" [SPOILERS]","This is the funniest Monte Cristo-related thing ever! When viewed as a parody/satire, it works! The author ""Holy Ghost Writer"" has created a sequel, and it's pretty loopy and a fun read...at least the first half is. The Count and his new wife, Haydee are headed to Albania, when they somehow get sidetracked in capturing a notorious pirate, Medusalocks (""Captain Dread"" already taken by the ""Monkey Island"" video game?) and Haydee admits to being a secret Muslim all along (What? As if he never noticed, especially during Ramadan?) The Count immediately converts to Islam, as he had a convenient shipboard imam with them (? For Ali, right?).

In the meantime, Mercedes discovers a long-lost letter from Dantes' father, revealing his secret origins. In true DaVinci-Code fashion, >!the letter says that Edmond Dantes is a descendant of Mary Magdelene and the Merovingian dynasty(!)!<. Mercedes, her love for Edmond reawoken, stops her all-day praying and weeping and gets her mojo back. She grows hemp, and sees a huge business opportunity in hemp-based lotions, soap, milk and cheese. (That's funny- where did all this entrepreneurial spirit come from? She had NONE in the original book!) She visits the Morrels (in Paris) to start a business partnership with them. And to relay a message to the Count (Please see me! Important letter from your Dad!).

The Count, after reconciling the Bible and the Koran, decides to return to Paris to forgive Villefort. Villefort is staying at the new ""Monte Cristo Insane Asylum at Auteuil"". The Count (in a new disguise) gives Villefort medication to heal his mind, and recommends the excellent biography, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"" (lol) that will explain everything. Oh, and Madame Danglars will be around soon to help. He also informs Villefort that Valentine is alive, and he will arrange a meeting with her.

Countess G throws a huge ball, and the Count and Mercedes attend. Now that he's a Muslim, the Count can have more than one wife, so he asks Mercedes to marry him, with Haydee's pre-approval. She agrees, on the condition that she gets an exclusive monopoly on hemp in Albania because, after all, she needs financial security, right?

The book switches gears and heads off to somewhere in Arabia, where a spunky Bedouin girl named Raymee informs her father Abram that she refuses a marriage to the Caliph of Mecca... a marriage contract assisted by an ugly merchant named... Danglars.

When Danglars and the Caliph's advisor Dr. Omar arrive at the family's oasis, Raymee's outspokenness and surprisingly modern views embarrass the men. Abram accepts gifts from Danglars, including, you guessed it... a copy of the famous book, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"". She scampers off, hides and listens in while the men discuss the terms of marriage contract- she's being engaged against her will! Abram agrees to a reverse-dowry... somehow the Caliph is supposed to *pay him*!!!

A servant announces that Sultan Sinbad of Albania (the Count) is spotted heading for Mecca, and they be passing by. Sultan Sinbad stops at the oasis and enjoys Abram's hospitality. He's also quite taken with Raymee. The next morning, Abram, Raymee, her cousin Mumad accompany Sultan Sinbad and his caravan to Mecca, with a stop at Shechem (as the Count's inner voice told him to do).

The caravan is attacked by bandits, and with a combination of bluffing and a poison dart, the bandit leader is killed and the bandits run off. >!Abram throws a big celebration feast and Raymee seduces Sultan Sinbad later at night. Her true intent is revealed... she wants to conceive a son who'll become the ruler of Arabia, being that the Caliph has only daughters!!<

>!The rest of the trip to Mecca goes without a hitch. Raymee tricks Mumad into agreeing to make an unknown sacrifice for her. The entourage (with Raymee) performs ""Hamlet"" for the Caliph. The Caliph is totally captivated, and Raymee negotiates her own bride price on her own terms, which he agrees to. With the deal concluded, she announces that Mumad will become her personal eunuch... the operation to be performed right there- onstage(!!!) Dr. Omar whispers to the Caliph, doubting her virginity, and for that, Dr. Omar is condemned to the same fate- Raymee's second personal eunuch.!<

>!Sultan Sinbad is shocked by the proceedings. During the marriage feast, he asks her about it and she explains that she had learned lessons from reading his biography... she would not let Mumad become her ""Fernand"". She's become cold and calculating and wants power through fear to control the people under her. !<Sultan Sinbad warns her of the lesson that he had personally learned- that revenge will backfire on her someday.

The End.

Now obviously, a lot of things are unresolved. what about Haydee and Mercedes? What about the hemp partnership with the Morrels? What about Villefort? Does he regain his senses and embrace Valentine again? Will any of them help save Benedetto? How's the hemp biz in Albania doing? This is not the last of the Monte Cristo books by ""Holy Ghost Writer""... there's more for sale at you-know-where's Kindle store... ""One must make a living"", as Bertuccio says.

I enjoyed the first half WAY more than the second. I was doubled-over laughing during Part 1. The tone completely changed in Part 2. ""Where is this leading... how does the Count come into this?"" I wondered. He does come in and he is played for a dupe. >!But, I guess the son that he had conceived with Raymee will go on the become a powerful ruler- a scion of 2 major houses- the house of the Magdelene/Merovingians and the House of Ishmael.!<

I'll give this a generous 3 stars for the first half, the laughs and the sheer entertainment value. The second half gets an eye-roll.

And, BTW, who is that ugly old man on the cover? Surely it's not the Count, who should be in his early 40s? Is it a statue of a Saint in Paris? Is that Abram, the father of Raymee? Or is it a random piece of clip-art to fill the need to have cover art of any kind?

80f47e,"I just finished the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo, and by god, it's one of the greatest novels I have ever read","**MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD**

1 month and 1300 pages later, and I'm finally through with this behemoth of a book. What a ride it was, I feel a gaping void in my heart right now lol. It's such an epic, transcendent story, even while keeping the stakes grounded and personal. 

The level of detail is astonishing - I felt like I experienced each and every year and month that Edmond/The Count spent in prison and then outside plotting his revenge. There were some parts of the book that felt slow and dragging, but ultimately, it felt by design as it really helped add colour to the setting, characters and the slow burn to the inevitable fall of Dantes' enemies. 

The character development is top notch, and Dumas does a fantastic job of portraying their motivations and purpose. The villains are complex and the heroes are flawed. Even people like Villefort and Danglars, who had seemed like mustache-twiling, one-dimensional villains in the beginning, are given layers to their personality and an understanding of why they did what they did. And Edmond, who seemed like a righteous saint, is slowly shown to be consumed by vengeance to the point of near-insanity. The narrative was a truly masterful exploration of the nature of revenge, and its purpose and validity. I also loved the veiled critique of 19th century upper-class Parisian society.

The best part was that by the end, it doesn't really feel like a badass one-man-army tale of justice and vengeance that it started off as, but rather a melancholy exploration of one broken man going after other broken men. None of the main characters really have much of a happy ending - Dantes got his revenge but is still alone and without Mercedes, Mercedes waited 2 decades for a man she ended up not reuniting with and losing her husband, Albert's family name is dishonored, Valentine loses everyone in her family, and even the villains' fates were more sad than satisfying. 

I'm sure there's a lot more to be analysed about the book, but I'll just leave it at that and recommend this to anyone interested in tackling a classic. It's a commitment, but well worth it, and I'd actually recommend taking time to read through this one. It seems like it was made to slowly savor over a period of weeks and months. Do so, and I guarantee it'll be one of the greatest reading experiences you'll ever have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/80f47e/i_just_finished_the_unabridged_version_of_the/,2018-02-26 18:13:26,47,253,books
h0u8cb,I hate the Count of Monte Cristo,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a terrible book. Granted, it was written in the 1800s, so it deserves some slack, but it still doesn't translate well into the modern day (I am excusing the racist/sexist/pro-slavery/other-junk that's in the book because it was written in the 1800s).

1. Grammar/Sentence-Structure  
Oh boy, do we have a lot to unpack here. The book was written in 1800s French, and translated into 1800s English, so there are grammatical errors galore. There are sentences that are as long as paragraphs; reading a single sentence is exhausting, and that's the best example. Some pages you have to re-read several times to understand what happened. 0/5
2. Plot  
It's a good plot, man gets betrayed, man gets revenge. It's simple, easy, & memorable. 5/5
3. Plot Structure  
Now we come to the worst part of the story in my opinion, the awful, awful, plot structure. The plot is like a roller-coaster, jerking from one place to another, going on tangents, sub-tangents, & sub-sub-tangents. Some of these chapters are excruciating to read, I found the Rome section to be pure torture.
4. General Oddness  
Now, I know this was made in the 1800s, so I am waiving *a lot* of stuff because it was the 1800s, but some stuff is still odd. >!So anyway, one chapter, some rich kid is sailing on a boat with some ... unscrupulous sailors. This kid just happens to be the friend of the son of Mercedes & Ferdinand. Then, Franz (The Rich Kid) decides to kill sheep on this random island in the middle of the Mediterranean. He then finds these pirates (or something, the entire scene is forgettable), finds The Count of Monte Cristo, who invites him for dinner in a cave. Somehow, the Count has a 6 Star Restaurant in his treasure trove (6 Star is on purpose, he somehow has the best type of ... everything). Afterwards, they get high on Hashish (Marijuana), and that's that.!< *The fact that that scene is told in total seriousness shows how weird this book is.*
5. How the Count's Wealth is treatedThis is a minor one, but as someone who's an investor, I almost had an aneurysm during several scenes in the book. *Even someone who doesn't know much about money should know how irresponsible this guy is with his money.* Anyone who has read the book should know what I'm talking about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0u8cb/i_hate_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2020-06-11 07:10:11,13,0,books
cjteyo,The Count of Monte Cristo Vs. The Three Musketeers,"I'm currently reading The Three Musketeers. I'm about 150 pages in, and while I like it, it's not quite what I expected. The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books I've ever read. It's definitely top 10, if not in the top 3 of favorite books. It's also probably been almost 10 years since I read it, so maybe I am just remembering with rose colored glasses. 

I feel like the Count of Monte Cristo is just a fun story about a dude who wants to ruin the lives of three other guys because they framed him and he spent like 15 years in prison being tortured. Not that you don't need any historical context to appreciate the novel, but almost all of the relevant details are in the novel. 

The Three Musketeers has been good, but I almost feel like I am reading two books: The Three Musketeers, and Wikipedia's History of France. And then I feel like all the names are just blending together. Where Edmond Dantes was immediately likable and I was routing for him the entire time, d'Artagnan seems kinda like a dick. Dantes was justified in seeking revenge, and d'Artagnan was basically like, ""you looked at my horse funny. I guess I need to murder you.""

o62lvh,So I finished the Count of Monte Cristo,"Obvious spoilers for the book

So I really liked it, I had a few things I didn't like, I initially thought it was kinda sad that Dantes couldn't reconcile his relationship with Mercedes but I came to understand that he felt like she betrayed him just as much as the others so I get it, I also got into a debate with my co-worker who recommended me the book because I was saying that even if Danglars, Fernand and Villefort couldn't recognize him I still feel like they could've put the pieces together if they thought about why a mystery man has taken interest in all three of them and things start to go to shit when he shows up but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief on that. The one thing that does kinda bug me is that out of all the people Dantes chooses to let off easy, he chooses Danglars. Like bruh, Danglars is the guy chief offender lol, he's the one who originally concocts the plan to get him arrested, he's the one who writes the memo that ultimately got him arrested, he's the one who convinced Fernand to turn in the anonymous tip, when Canderousse realizes what they had done and feels remorseful enough to turn Danglars in Danglars reminds him that he was there too and he can expect himself to be arrested just as well. Now don't get me wrong Fernand and Villefort are still scumbags, but they aren't as shitty as Danglars. Fernand is a little bitch who couldn't handle being friendzoned so he got a man arrested and then pulled some shady shit in the military but you can still tell that he cared for his family. Hell, Albert was ready to die for his father's honor. And Villefort's a shady politician who played both sides so he always came out on top (lol) but even he cared for his family, was distraught when they were dying, refused to do anything when he thought Valentine was the culprit, regretted burying his illegitimate son and made efforts to find him, and finally broke when he realized his youngest child was dead. Danglars was shitty through and through, dude let his wife sleep around because it benefited him financially, was ready to marry off his daughter to undesirables for profit, and when everything went south he just ditches his family, wtf lol. My point is, they all shoulda got their just desserts, but if anyone was given the chance of redemption, Danglars is the one who deserved it the least smh.

He repeated stated that his love for her was like that of a father but unlike a good father he did not allow her to live as though she were free, she was legally and contractual obligated to his every whim and although she had anything and everything she needed or wanted and occasioned the plays and concerts were a means of getting out it is explicitly stated that the count was the only man she ever had any interaction with outside of his other servants. To me it was the equivalent of having the most extravagant jail cell life had to offer at the time the book was written in but at the end of the day she was very much doomed to her cell like Edmond was.

This isolation and seclusion I think was the main catalyst of what made her feelings for the count as strong as they were because she had to have been extremely lonely and socially isolated to the point that to have her emotional needs met then her feelings for him as her sole social outlet, provider, and protector had to transform into something more than what it would have otherwise been, i.e instead of loving him as a father like how he loved her as a daughter she had strong romantic feelings as she grew into a woman. The basis of her love for him was of isolation and him being her only form of sustenance and so it would seem impossible for her to have any form of romantic interaction outside of him.

If my interpretation is off please let me know but it seems that everybody around the count was as much a prisoner of his revenge as he was and instead of letting her live free with a golden parachute and disappearing like I believe he should have he took her as his own knowing full well she had never even had an opportunity to court other men outside of trying to set her up with Maximilian but even that was facilitated by the count himself and not of her own free will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oqvpyn/the_count_of_monte_cristo_final_chapter_trying/,2021-07-24 18:43:41,19,12,books
10dr7ce,"What are the books that pretty much everyone has positive reviews of, that never seem to disappoint?","It seems like some books get effusive praise, and nothing else. The opposite of people's reactions to Ready Player One/The Catcher in the Rye/The Alchemist/The Da Vinci Code/JK Rowling/Ayn Rand.  

The only ones I can think of right now are The Count of Monte Cristo, 1984, East of Eden, and most Virginia Woolf books.  

Have you read any that seemed like that when you were looking it up? What books appear to be immune to criticism sometimes? The creme de la creme. Contemporary books are also encouraged, I think one of the big Andy Weir books might qualify.

afose0,The Count of Monte Cristo: Knowledge vs Happiness?,"So I've been rereading The Count of Monte Cristo, which is one of my all time favorite books, and it's led me to something of a philosophical quandary. Yesterday I started thinking about the character of Haidee. For those of you who aren't familiar with the book/character I'll explain briefly. Haidee was the daughter of a powerful local lord in Greece under the Ottoman Empire. She was nearly a princess with how much power, wealth and respect her father had. When she was very young her father was betrayed and killed, and she and her mother were sold into slavery by his betrayer. Her mother died, and she was bought by the Count of Monte Cristo as part of his elaborate revenge plot.  


That's the background. Now for the part I've been thinking on. He may have bought her as a slave, but he treats her like a princess and loves her like a daughter. When they arrive in France he tells her that French law doesn't allow slaves, and that she's free to do whatever she wants (not that he seemed to keep her from anything before as far as i can tell). He tells her she's the master of this house, she can do what she wants, go where she wants, and if she wants to leave him forever, there will always be a carriage waiting at her command, servants to accompany her, and she'll have enough money to never want for anything. Her response is, why would she want to go anywhere? Why would she want to leave? She loves her life as his slave.   


Then he tells her, that now that they're in France she probably can't remain cloistered away like was expected or at least accepted of a young woman in different parts of the East that they've been to. They'll probably have to visit and be visited, and maybe she'll meet someone she takes a fancy to, etc. etc. She responds that she doesn't want to see anyone else. She has him, she loves him, and that's enough for her. He replies that that's just because she's never really spoken to a man besides him and her father. So when she meets a few more she might change her mind.   


It goes on a bit, but the point is, he is telling her how much bigger the world could be for her if she extended her horizons beyond the small world she knows under his protection, and she argues that since she loves that world so much, why would she want to explore anything else?  


And let's admit it, she may have a point. Knowing more, experiencing more, expanding your horizons opens up way more possibilities, but they're both good and bad possibilities. Staying in an almost-child-like state of innocence and happiness certainly has its up side.  


So the question becomes, which one is more important? Haidee is happy, she is in love (or at least she makes a solid case for being in love, making it clear that if he dies or leaves, then she feels she has no reason to continue living, which admittedly also seems pretty naive). Is it ok for him to let her remain that way if it's what she wants? Or is the obligation to provide, knowledge, guidance an experience to a young person more important than their happiness? I mean, you can't let your kids stay home forever, right? 

&#x200B;

This has bothered me a little about the end of the book. The Count and Haidee go off together at the end deciding to love each other and be happy together. Is it wrong of him to allow that to happen? Is he somehow taking advantage of this young, innocent girl by letting her have exactly what she wants?  


And, I guess, as an extension of that, the book and her character kind of lead to a personal question. If you could choose now, which would you rather have? Would you trade your worldly experiences, the good and the bad for the same number of years being ignorant of all of that but blissfully happy? The question may seem like a no-brainer at first glance, but it seems to me like we spend most of our lives trying to find happiness of one kind or another. You might say it's not as meaningful without the struggle to achieve it, but if you never knew that difference, would it matter?

fqmxci,Why do people hate the end of “The Count Of Monte Cristo”?,"I’ve read the book about 4 times in the course of a year. Every time I read it, I learn something new that I didn’t realize before. As it pertains to the ending, I understood it to mean that Edmond finally got over Mercedes, and was willing to start a new, happy life with Haidee. 

What is wrong with that? I’ve seen several people complain and whine about how “it’s too unrealistic”. Oh really? I didn’t know we read fiction for its hyper-realism. Plus, this is a romantic novel, and these types of novels sometimes have good endings. I’ve also seen people who read the book and wished Edmond Dante’s kills himself or something, or ends up alone. Throughout my entire time reading it, the author makes it a point for the reader to empathize with Edmond and want him to succeed... and these people think the main character should kill himself? For what?  Or they say “but Mercedes didn’t get a happy ending!”; and to that I say, so? This story isn’t about her, and it’s not as though she is free from all blame either, she’s lucky worse things didn’t happen, like Edmond killing her son. 

I think a lot of people believe this books message is about how revenge is never worth it, and to some extent it is. But from the amount of times I read it, this book seems to be more about justice, and how some individuals escape the punishment that they deserve while others are unjustly punished in their stead. When you look at the book this way, there is no reason for the protagonist to end up alone or dead. He got what he wanted, and he succeeded. At the end, his mission is complete and he can start his new life.

i0h2ra,The Count of Monte Cristo - Haydee and Edmond,"I just want to say that I love this book, and is my absolute favorite so far!

What are your thoughts regarding Edmond and Haydee's ending?

Personally, I think their fate is intertwined, Edmond died the moment Abbe Faria accidentally placed vengeance on Edmond's heart, one would say that it is Abbe Faria who gave birth to the spirit of vengeance; the Count of Monte Cristo. It was at this moment, I think that Edmond was no longer driven by hope, but by vengeance.  The hopeful Edmond would have used the treasure for the purpose of love, Edmond had every chance to start a new life and the means to, but alas, its a different man who came out of prison, the Avenger.

Similarly, though we never really get much development with Haydee, their fates are heavily mirrored, wronged by the same man, Fernand, Haydee is stripped of everything she had and is put in chains, but as fate did with Edmond, it lent his hands to Haydee, this time in the form of the Count, instead of a Mad Priest. Haydee, too, was given a choice to start a new life, a choice that was freely given to her, but chose vengeance instead.

I dont think Faria ever intended to educate Edmond so that he could have his revenge, nor do I think that the Count also intended to educate and save Haydee to get hers,  Both characters were at their absolute desolation, just a layer short of death, and were given another chance at life, but both choose to become instruments of fate, in a way, replacing Edmond's dark cell and Haydee's chain for another; justice or vengeance.

I like to think that when Edmond and Haydee sailed off into the horizon is when edmond is finally free of his cell and Haydee of her chains, and finally start to really live life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/i0h2ra/the_count_of_monte_cristo_haydee_and_edmond/,2020-07-30 06:26:39,6,25,books

hxcjun,About the end of the count of monte cristo,"  

Believing that Haydée has for him only “the love and tenderness of a daughter”, Monte Cristo understands for the first time that she might love him for real when he sees her concern for him the night before the duel and carries her in his arms to her apartment (“the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father”, ch.90). He regretfully concludes that he might have had a chance to be loved and therefore to be happy (“‘Alas’, murmured he, with intense suffering,‘I might, then, have been happy yet’”, ch.90). His happiness to see her, when he returns from the duel, is not less intense than hers, although not as evident. Kissing her forehead makes both their hearts beat strongly (“a kiss which made two hearts throbat once, the one violently, the other\[silently\]”, ch.92) and he dares to believe that he can love again. This belief is confirmed after his journey into the past of his imprisonment. Already having overcome the doubts risen in him with Edouard’s death, he overcomes another doubt concerning the woman he loves: while passing by the village of the Catalans, he looks away and murmurs Haydée’s name “in a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love” (ch.113).

I n the last chapter (ch.117), although he knows that he loves her, the Count is still not sure if she loves him back (in his own words, “when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in \[happiness\]”, ch.3). Therefore, with his mission accomplished, Monte Cristo is determined to punish himself for the pain he caused to the innocents and leave her side, not wanting to allow his destiny to overshadow hers. He sets her free, restoring her position, fortune and name, and asks her to “forget even my name, and be happy”. When she clearly confesses that she loves him, he accepts her redeeming love (“Let it be, then, as you wish\[...\] Love me then, Haidee!“).

  

Alexandre Dumas had many lovers with big age differences.

Anna Bauër, Antoine Bauër's wife, was born in 1823 and was 21 years younger than Dumas. 

Aimée Léocadie Doze was born in 1822 and was 20 years younger than Alexandre Dumas. 

Béatrix Person was born in 1828 and was 26 years younger than Dumas. 

Marie Guinde, known as Isabelle Constant was born in 1835 and was 33 years younger than Dumas. 

Fanny Gordosa was born in 1831 and was 29 years younger than Dumas 

Emilie (or Emélie) Cordier was born in 1840 and was 38 years younger than Dumas 

In 1860 Micaëlla-Clélie-Josepha-Élisabeth Cordier was born, daughter of Emélie Cordier at the age of 20 years old and Alexandre Dumas at the age of 58 years old.

Victor Perceval, pseudonym Marie-Laure Chaufour, also known as Aussi Marie de Fernand was born in 1835 and was 33 years younger than Dumas 

Emma Manoury-Lacour, Emma Adélaïde Gallard, Mme Anatole Mannoury-Lacour was born in 1823 and was 21 years younger than Dumas. 

Adah Isaacs Menken was born in 1832 and was 30 years older than Dumas. 

Olympe Audouard was born in 1830 and was 28 years younger than Dumas 

Nina de Callias (Anne-Marie Gaillard, known as Nina de Villard, comtesse Hector de Callias) was born in 1843 and was 41 years younger than Dumas

30nqkq,Just finished 'The Count of Monte Cristo.' Wow.,"It's been six months but I did it.

I read the first fourth (up to The 5th of September) in a week and then resigned to less than a chapter a day. The book got a bit tedious between the Rome parts and M.C.'s introduction back into normal life. I read the last 500 pages in a week, that's how good it got.

However, I'd say it all paid off. This has easily become one of my favorite books and I'll tell you why. Everyone always calls it ""justice-porn"" and a ""revenge story."" I don't think they're correct.

The parts that shined in this story to me were Edmond's transformation, the bits with him and Mercedes and the end where he realizes what he's done.

I love how he goes from doubting God in the prison, to practically thinking he is a walking God and then realizing he isn't. In the final letter he actually calls himself the devil! He almost becomes too cocky and controlling for his own good until Eduard's death reels him back in.

I loved when he would try to stifle emotion. It was the little scenes where Edmond would creep back that just sealed the deal. 

One of my favorite scenes was when Mercedes is begging him not to kill Albert and she calls him Edmond. They both fight back and forth and he's like, ""Mercedes is dead.""

This book is crazy good and the themes of forgiveness like the one shown above really shine. Wow. This is the first book I've managed to finish in awhile. 

If you haven't read it, go pick up the Robin Buss version, and do it!

12z8ifh,"SPOILERS FROM ALL BEFORE CHAPTER 48 - The Count of Monte Cristo: A little confused by a seemingly major discrepancy between Chapters ""The Vendetta"" and ""Ideology""","**Please no spoilers beyond the chapter ""Ideology""**, where ""The Count"" sits down with  Villfort ro debate his rather interesting philosophy about justice and punishment.

One thing that's really confused me is that in the  earlier chapter ""The Vendetta"", Bertuccio recounts how he took revenge on Villfort by stabbing him in the back and (presumably) killing him. 

So how is Villfort alive and well in chapter 48?

If this is something that is explained later in the book, then I obviously understand. It's not illogical to reason that it will be explained that he survived his injuries. I want to make sure I've not missed something that was mentioned along the way between these to chapters.

eney3r,"Translations of ""The Count of Monte Cristo""","I did a bit of searching to see what the best translation of *The Count of Monte Cristo* is, and everyone seemed to be saying that Robin Buss's recent translation was the best / most readable / etc, and similarly many didn't have kind words for the 1846 translation used be Project Gutenberg...

However, in the end it's much easier to obtain the PG version, so I started reading that, not without some trepidation...

.... only to find that it's absolutely delightful—lively and playful, elegant, highly readable, and not in the least antiquated (indeed the language seems quite modern).

dluzi0,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy appreciation (does contain some spoilers),"OK I know I know I am beyond late to the party on this one but I have to say something to someone. Unfortunately I don't really have any friends who read so Reddit is my only outlet. I was an avid reader when I was growing up but when I hit my early 20's life started getting busier and I just didn't have the time to read much. This past year I have taken up reading again with a passion. I've blown through Kitchen Confidential, Medium Raw, Count of Monte Cristo, Ender's Game, Ready Player One, all 7 Harry Potter's (which to be fair I had read before), all of Sherlock Holmes, most of Hercule Poirot, all 5 Robert Langdon books, On the Road, Perks of being a Wallflower and I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple more. But I just finished The Hitchhikers Guide the Galaxy and I have never laughed so hard when reading a book in my entire life. The dialogue and banter in the 9th chapter when Arthur and Ford are saved from certain death by the Heart of Gold using the infinite improbability drive might just be the funniest thing I have ever read. I was literally howling with laughter. I don't know why it took me so long to read this book as it has consistently been one of the most recommended books but dear god am I happy I finally did.

8qg6mx,Halfway Through The Count of Monte Cristo,"[NO SPOILERS PLEASE - STILL READING!]

...and I love it.

After blowing through a few to-read novels in the earlier part of the year, I decided I wanted to spend (at least half) my summer reading a classic. And this particular one has always been highly praised on this sub.

So, for the past month now, I've been chipping away at Count of Monte Cristo.

It is, likely as a result of translation, a bit dense, and I find myself at times asking, ""What did I just read and what part will this have in the future?: The entire chapter rambling on about Vampa, and some chapters in which it's just dialogue between the count and the baroness just seem to be a bit much. However, I'm loving the story, and can sense it is all building up to a great finale. 

Somehow, despite being on this planet for as long as I have been, I've managed to completely avoid how this one ends. And that includes having watched the movie(s) back in the day. So I'm pretty stoked to have the opportunity to more or less unravel this classic without having even the slightest inkling as to how it ends.

Here's to finishing by 4th of July!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8qg6mx/halfway_through_the_count_of_monte_cristo/,2018-06-12 04:43:10,10,6,books

n6vczg,"The man who laughs, The count of monte Cristo, The Brothers karamazov","I was reading these three classics during the pandemic

&#x200B;

**The man who laughs by Victor Hugo**

Not an easy read, but very rewarding...especially in politically charged times. I have no doubt Hugo would be accused of socialism if he spoke up in modern times. But really he is anti-nobility and royalty, and uses his characters to speak up for the common man, as well as subtle digs at the rich and sheltered lords of 18th century England.

It's the story of man who goes from one extreme to the other, and not by his choosing. He's an amazingly complex character, as are many of the supporting characters. And quite unusual as well...""Ursus"" the old man and his pet wolf whom he named ""Homo"". Homo is a most excellent and well done character.

In late 17th-century England, a homeless boy named Gwynplaine rescues an infant girl during a snowstorm, her mother having frozen to death whilst feeding her. They meet an itinerant carnival vendor who calls himself Ursus, and his pet wolf, Homo.

Gwynplaine's mouth has been mutilated into a perpetual grin; Ursus is initially horrified, then moved to pity, and he takes them in. Fifteen years later, Gwynplaine has grown into a strong young man, attractive except for his distorted visage.

The girl, now named Dea, is blind, and has grown into a beautiful and innocent young woman. By touching his face, Dea concludes that Gwynplaine is perpetually happy. They fall in love. Ursus and his surrogate children earn a meagre living in the fairs of southern England.

Gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed. In each town, Gwynplaine gives a stage performance in which the crowds are provoked to laughter when Gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face.

&#x200B;

**The count of Monte-Cristo by Alexandre Dumas**

It's amazing how a low and personality-destructive human vice such as revenge can at the same time perfectly cohabit in the same person with excellent courtesy, intelligence in an intelligent intellectual with excellent manners, morality, charm and many other good traits.

Dumas created an excellent piece. It is a pity that not all people still understand it correctly. Very often, instead of drawing the right conclusions in order to avoid and extinguish the thirst for revenge, on the contrary, they exalt and justify it.

The Count of Monte Cristo ”is set in France in the first decades of the 19th century, and tells the story of Edmond Dantes, a humble young man, but happy with what little he had.

Edmond Dantes is a sailor who, after months of traveling aboard the Pharaoh, returns to meet his father and bride, Mercedes Herrera.

After the death of the ship's captain, he is assigned to be the next captain of the Pharaoh. Edmond was the envy of both the promising future as a sailor and the love of the beautiful Mercedes.

Owner of naivety, Edmond was an easy prey for the envy of Fernand Mondego, Danglars and Villefort.

Fernand Mondego was a cousin of Mercedes and was in love with her, making Edmond Dantes her rival, while Danglars envied him for being appointed captain of the ship, a position that Danglars wanted.

Together, the two plot against Edmond by writing a letter denouncing him. In the letter they will invent that Edmond was a spy for Napoleon Bonaparte, at the time, a serious crime since France was under the power of the realists.

The complaint might not have been taken seriously if it had not fallen into the hands of prosecutor Gerard de Villefort. The prosecutor had nothing against Edmond, yet he had to show a strong pulse against the Bonapartists as cover and protection for his father, who was smuggling information in favor of Bonaparte.

Protecting himself and his own father, Villefort did not care about Edmond Dantes' innocence and condemns him in the prison of the ""Château d'If"", where they said that no one ever managed to escape.

In prison, Edmond Dantes meets Father Abade Faria who, in an attempt to escape, digs a tunnel, but ends up in his cell.

The two become friends and together they plot the escape from prison. Meanwhile, the priest teaches many things like literature, science and even other languages.

In prison, the guards called Abbot Faria crazy, as he said that there was a hidden treasure in Monte-Cristo. However, before putting the escape into practice, Abade Faria dies of a stroke.

Meanwhile, Edmond Dantes' evildoers lived well, especially Fernand Mondego who convinces Mercedes Herrera that Edmond was dead and convinces her to marry him, and as a result Albert de Morcerf is born.

In prison, the priest's body is picked up and thrown into the sea. However, in the place of the priest, was Edmond Dantes who managed to escape from the “Château d'If” and found the hidden treasure on the island Monte-Cristo. Now as Count of Monte Cristo, he after years of recognizing those who betrayed him and creating friendships with the highest bourgeoisie and authorities, he begins his revenge.

&#x200B;

**The Brothesr Karamazov by Dostoevsky**

It is a masterpiece, a book difficult to summarize, due to the large number of characters, due to the depth of the subjects, the vast themes covered.

A phenomenal book, in which all the maturity of Dostoevsky, a genius of world literature, is investigated.

&#x200B;

Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazovis a man without qualities, mocking, debauchery, selfish, poor in spirit. He married 2 times, had 3 children Dimítri ,, Aliocha and Ivan, and perhaps a fourth son Smerdiakov. He never cared how his children lived, and if they had not been welcomed by people with a good heart, they would not have survived in childhood.

The children, with the exception of Alyocha, do not agree with their father, and Smerdiakov practically lives as a servant of Old Fiódor. To make matters worse Dimitri and Fiodor fall in love with the same woman. In such a troubled family, good things cannot happen. One day old Fyodor is found dead with his head blown off, the charge falls on Dimitri, as both were fighting a fight for the same woman, Gruchenhka and were also in trouble over an inheritance.

Ivan is intellectual, but revolted against divine laws, his famous phrase is ""If God does not exist, everything is allowed""

Aliócha is the most sensible, educated, generous and kind young man, spends time in the monastery but returns to the real world advised by his spiritual guide.

Most of the book is about the Dimitri trial, the investigations, the testimony of the witnesses, where various subjects are dealt with in a very great depth.

&#x200B;

**Adaptations**

**The man who laughs (1928)**

A great classic directed by Paul leni and with Corand Veidt and Mary Philbin in this film. The book despite its simplification in the script, remains faithful to the main stpory and coupled with Leni's great work, made this adaptation a classic.

**The count of Monte-Criato (1988)** directed by Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich. This adaptation simplifies, but remains true to the main story and maintains its ending. Great Adaptation.

**The count of Monte-Cristo (2002)** directed by Kevin Reynolds is a mediocre and poorly written film.

**The count of monte-Cristo (1964)** directed by Peter Hammond and Allan Badel as edmond Dantes. An apartment with limited budget, but with a script and spectacular performances.

**The count of Monte-Cristo (1975)** directed by Richard Green and Richard Chamberlain as Edmond Dantes. Average adaptation, reasonable, but higher than the horrible version of 2002.

**The Murderer Dimitri Karamazov is a 1931** German drama film directed by Erich Engels and Fedor Ozep, starring Fritz Kortner and Anna Sten. It tells the story of a lieutenant who is suspected of having murdered his father. The film is based on motifs from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov.

The British film critic Raymond Durgnat wrote in a 1993 article about Ozep for Film Dope: ""The Karamazov film is a tour de force of stylistic eclecticism: expressionist acting (Kortner), dynamic angles, Russian editing, marathon tracking shots. It's a real showpiece of formalism geared to psycho-lyrical ends, exactly as Eisenstein intended, except that Dostoievskian soul-torments replace Leninist collectivism to which the 'official' montage-masters tuned their lyres.""

nv5nql,What's the longest book that you've ever read that was totally worth the length?,"I was thinking about this question while reading ""Anna Karenina"", a book that I just started the other day. Supposing that I finish it (knock on wood), it will be the longest book I've ever read at a whopping 870 pages.

It fascinates me how some of the longest books out there (Brothers Karamazov, War & Peace, Don Quixote) are considered to be some of the greatest. And although those two aspects aren't mutually exclusive, I've thought about the correlation between the two. A longer page count is a larger canvas, perhaps providing more space for an author to masterfully execute character development, overarching themes, and the overall plot.

Have you read anything that reaffirms this claim? What are some other elements that have jumped out to you about larger volumes? What are some of the best you've read and why were they so wonderful?

lxg0az,"[Spoilers] Count of Monte Cristo - The ending feels weak to me, trying to understand why","Hi all,

**TL;DR: The Danglars' arcs do not come to an end, they just hang. That is not an issue with the direction the story decided to take, it is a narrative issue. Do you agree?**

I just read The Count of Monte Cristo and it was a good read, but I am very much disappointed with the book ending.

I have read a lot of people talking about this, and I do agree with the standard dissatisfacted opinion, that the Count's happy ending is unearned, but that does not put the whole of my dissatisfaction into words. I mainly think it's the whole Danglars arc that did not come to fruition. Let us see:

**Mondego / Morcerf**:

* Mercédès is in Marseille, in her old home. Her story is closed, she will never see the Count again and decides to live a contemplative life, basically waiting to die.
* Albert is on the Navy, he now started a new thing, but, as far as the Count's story goes, his arc has ended, he is now going to work to regain his name legitimately.
* Fernando is dead.

**Villefort**:

* Noirtier is an old man waiting to die, his only wish of granddaughter happiness is granted by the Count.
* Valentine is rejoined with Morrel by the Count.
* Several people are dead
* M. de Villefort went mad, and is maniacally searching for a body in his garden (it is a harsh ending, but the irony of it is so genius).

**And now, Danglars**:

* M. Danglars is still in a cave, as far as story cares, he never leaves and never has to deal with his new small bank account.
* Mme. Danglars is fainted on a courthouse.
* Eugénie appeared as a coincidence in another chapter. She was left mid-travel with her friend/lover, she is the ultimate ""gun in a wall that was not fired"". A useless coincidence for the book, unless you think her whole arc was ""go to bed with ~~Emily~~ Louise in a random hostel"".

Contrast the familial story arcs and I think it's quite obvious that the Danglars family have a few paragraphs missing. ""Oh, there were Christian mores at the time which impeded Dumas of writing ~~Emily~~ Louise and Eugénie together"" is not a proper argument, he already put them together in a bed, the people who want to see lesbianism have already seen lesbianism (as evidenced by half of all replies to a post critical of Count of Monte Cristo). There are several ways to bring ~~Emily~~ Louise and Eugénie together without shocking any mores whatsoever, show them singing in Brussels or something.

So that is basically it. I feel that we have three narrative cannons in the story. Mondego's and Villefort's one explode with a lot of fanfare and Danglars's one has its gunpowder disappear by magic mid-explosion and the cannonball just stays in the middle of the cannon instead of drooping out by gravity. The problem is not that it does not explode, that's up to the author, the problem is that the cannonball got unnaturally stuck in the middle of it.

Does anyone agree?

aufea9,Le Comte de Monte-Cristo (1979) is the best adaptation of the count of monte cristo," I like that Edmond finds only one casket of treasure like he did in the book.  In some adaptations, he finds dozens of trunks.  In the book, he gets about 15 million francs from the treasure and, through years of investments, ends up with about 100 million francs even after all his purchases.  It's a little detail that doesn't interfere with any telling, but it seems more realistic that Spada had one trunk of treasure than twenty.

 The fates of the three conspirators are good.  Danglars' is quite appropriate and matches the novel.  Villefort's is nearly the same, except he is not shown to lose his sanity.  This is acceptable to me, as the rest of his punishment is certainly fitting enough.  Fernand's is, thankfully, the same--he kills himself for the right reason this time.  I liked that the series preserved the way that Caderousse cannot tell that Busoni is Edmond even after he has taken the disguise off.  Time has worked on the two so much that Caderousse can't recognise his old acquaintance.  Edmond couldn't even recognise himself after spending fourteen years in prison--how could a friend recognise him twenty-four years after last seeing him?  The makers didn't speed up the recognition time--they let Caderousse take his time in discovering who Busoni really is.  It also lets us see the horrid truth: the four men who consigned Edmond to a miserable prison for life out of pride, lust, greed, and drink can't even remember what he looks like.  They've given him pure misery and can't even be bothered to honor his memory.  The mostly intact fates of the betrayers and the ways they arrive at them are line with the book.  Each is brought down slowly and with great patience by past mistakes and has the things that they truly care about taken from them.  Patience is what Monte Cristo has plenty of, as well as the desire to have them do themselves in, so he doesn't do the quick ""kill the enemies"" gig.  This is a very important element that some adaptations leave out.  They simplify the revenge scheme, which undermines the entire point of what Monte Cristo wanted to accomplish.  He crafts slow punishments that fit each one of them so that they can endure the slow torment that he suffered.  For Danglars, his greed.  Fernand, his wife and son.  Villefort, his family and position (and, in the book, his sanity). 

 The two lovers are so different, too changed from their experiences.  The Edmond they knew is gone, so little does he resemble the suave and bitter Count.  They want each other as they were twenty-some years ago, which cannot happen.  If they were to get together, they would not be happy.  They would have too many painful memories, memories of a time when they would have been happy, and broken fantasies of what could have been a happy life together.  They would be trying to live out a dream that they had many years ago, and the results would be a travesty, a farce of love, two lovers trying to bring back what they had, though their characters have changed.  They've turned into people they hardly recognise and no longer resemble the ones they loved.  The adaptations of Hollwyood forget these essential dynamics and have the two reunite to give the story a more happy ending.  As well, it's more realistic than a happy ending with edmond and mercedes.

&#x200B;

  The Count also sees that innocent children suffer from his plans--he's visibly saddened by Edward's death and makes amends by rescuing Valentine.

u2ruf,The Count of Monte Cristo plot hole,"Hello, this has always bothered me quite a bit, and no one I know has read the book, so I'll discuss it here.

In addition, I apologize if it had been brought up before.

After Dantes escapes and finds his fortune, he sets out to rescue his old boss: Morrel. He communicates with Julie under his alias of Sinbad the Sailor. That's all that the family knows about the person who saves them.

Dantes meets Franz d'Épinay on his island and introduces himself as Sinbad the Sailor. Franz proceeds to tell Albert that he knows that Sinbad is the Count.

Albert discusses the Count during the breakfast scene in which the readers are introduced to Lucien Debray, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud, who brings along Maximilian Morrel. They gossip around and associates the Count with Sinbad the sailor several times.

Maximilian really didn't pick up on that?


I'm in my phone, when I get home I'll include the texts as supporting evidence.

Edit: 

Chapter 29, Julie sees the stranger on the stairway of her house.

> ""Mademoiselle,"" said the stranger, ""one day you will receive a letter signed '**Sinbad the Sailor**.' Do exactly what the letter bids you, however strange it may appear.""

> ""Yes, sir,"" returned Julie. 


Chapter 30, Julie receives the letter and shows to Emmanuel.
> The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly and read:—

>""Go this moment to the Allees de Meillan, enter the house No. 15, ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive it before eleven o'clock. You promised to obey me implicitly. Remember your oath.

>""**Sinbad the Sailor**.""

* At this point, we have established that the Morrel family is aware that a man named Sinbad the sailor saved their house.

Chapter 31, Franz meets the mysterious man (The Count).
> ""...I tell you that I am generally called '**Sinbad the Sailor**.'""

> ""And I,"" replied Franz, ""will tell you, as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good genius."" 


Chapter 40, The Breakfast in Paris where the young gentlemen discuss the Count before his introduction.
> ""Have you read the 'Arabian Nights'?""

> ""What a question!""

> ""Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the Indies.""

> ""Which means?""

> ""Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself **Sinbad the Sailor**, and has a cave filled with gold.""

> ""And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?"" asked Beauchamp. 

Later on in the meal, after both Maximilian and the Count have been introduced.

> ""As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,"" replied Maximilian. ""She married the man she loved, who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunes—Emmanuel Herbaut."" Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly. ""I live there during my leave of absence,"" continued Maximilian; ""and I shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.""

> ""One minute,"" cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to reply. ""Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, **Sinbad the Sailor**, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch of him.""

At this point it has been clearly established that the entire party is aware that the Count is indeed known as Sinbad the Sailor.

Chapter 50, The Count visits the young Morrel family in Paris for the first time. Julie essentially, in today's terms, grills the Count on the identity of Sinbad the sailor. I'll include the entire conversation here.

""Monsieur,"" returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and respectfully kissing the silken purse, ""this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from shame and disgrace,—a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear every one envying our happy lot. This letter"" (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count)—""this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution, and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry."" Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our readers know) to Julie, and signed ""**Sinbad the Sailor**."" ""Unknown you say, is the man who rendered you this service—unknown to you?""

""Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,"" continued Maximilian. ""We have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand,—a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter.""

""Oh,"" cried Julie, ""I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago, Penelon was at Trieste—Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener—Penelon, when he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but he did not venture to address him.""

""An Englishman,"" said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at him. ""An Englishman you say?""

""Yes,"" replied Maximilian, ""an Englishman, who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It was this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf's, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That happened, as I told you, in 1829. For God's sake, tell me, did you know this Englishman?""

""But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have constantly denied having rendered you this service?""

""Yes.""

""Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be some one who, grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?""

""Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.""

""What was his name?"" asked Monte Cristo.

""He gave no other name,"" answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count, ""than that at the end of his letter—'**Sinbad the Sailor**.'""

""Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.""

Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice,—

""Tell me,"" continued he, ""was he not about my height, perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?""

""Oh, do you then know him?"" cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.

""No,"" returned Monte Cristo ""I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who was constantly doing actions of this kind.""

""Without revealing himself?""

""He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of gratitude.""

""Oh, heaven,"" exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, ""in what did he believe, then?""

""He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,"" said Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie's voice; ""but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.""

""And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?"" inquired Emmanuel.

""Oh, if you do know him,"" cried Julie, ""can you tell us where he is—where we can find him? Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!"" Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the room.

""In the name of heaven,"" said Maximilian, ""if you know anything of him, tell us what it is.""

""Alas,"" cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, ""if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he will never return.""

""Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,"" said Julie, much affected; and the young lady's eyes swam with tears.

""Madame,"" replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie's cheeks, ""had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;"" and he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count. ""But,"" continued she, ""Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known some one, can we not—""

""Oh, it is useless to inquire,"" returned the count; ""perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no secrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.""

m6ybh,Could we discuss The Count Of Monte Cristo?,"Having seen and enjoyed the 2002 film of the book I thought I'd really enjoy reading it. In both I liked and cheered for Edmond Dantes and in the film I continued to like and cheer for The Count as the bringer of justice. However, in the book once Dantes becomes the Count he becomes a despicable, manipulative monster who sacrifices the lives and happiness of several perfectly innocent characters. 

He gives poison to a woman he know will use it, leading directly to the death of four innocent people including a child in addition to the woman herself. His slave girl Haydée he kept around all those years just to unleash as a weapon against Mondego. He ends three marriages and prevents two more. He would have killed Mondego's son if not for the begging of Mercedes.

g73djz,The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas : Religiously Vengeful,"(Spoilers)

Who read this story in school and forgot all about it? Haven’t read a book in a while much like this one. The straight to the point prose and intricate plot lines in each chapter explained to me once again, why this story is such a classic. What's your favorite part of the story/ what you most remember?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.)

*“I’m not proud, but I’m happy, and I think happiness makes a man even blinder than pride.”* p16

A simple truth to start out - Dantès reflects Caderousse’s accusation of pride. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2.)

*“Joy sometimes has a strange effect: it can oppress us almost as much as sorrow.”* p18

A vague truth to think on - Dantès continues to explain his joy before the plot kicks off. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.)

*“Happiness is like those places in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons: we must fight in order to conquer it.”* p18

Another simple truth by Dantès foreshadowing his impending downfall. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4.)

*“A numbness, which was not without a certain feeling of well-being, took possession of him. The pangs in his stomach ceased. When he closed his eyes he saw bright flashes of light.”* p43

A harrowing description of Dantès’ starvation in the prison, his lowest point. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5.)

*“For every evil there are two remedies: time and silence.” p198*

The count drops one of his newfound axioms to Bertuccio, possibly the most profound quote in the novel. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6.)

*“She looked up and saw him without surprise; there are no intermediate emotions in a heart swollen by the supreme despair.” p294*

Dumas brilliantly describes the utter indifference one experiences to outward stimuli while inwardly grieving — Valentine on the entrance of Maximilien while praying at the bedside of Madam de Saint-Méran. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7.)

*“No matter how hardened to danger a man may be, he always realizes, from the pounding of his heart and the shivering of his flesh, the enormous difference there is between a dream and reality, between a plan and its execution.” p332*

A truth all can relate to describing the Count’s mental state while being preparing to be robbed by Caderousse. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8.)

*“Each of us has blood in his veins which the other is eager to shed. That’s our mutual guarantee.” p373*

A powerfully threatening line from the Count upon being ambushed at his opera booth. (Leading up to his duel with Albert).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

9.)

*“No,” answered Mercédès, “but I’ve seen the man I loved ready to become the murder of my son.” She spoke these words with such passionate grief, with such infinite despair that a sob burst from the count’s throat. p378*

The first instance in the novel of the breakage of the Count’s iron will. Mercédès convinces Count to sacrifice himself in the duel with her son. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10.)

*“The poor boy has a mother.” “That’s true,” said Monte Cristo. “And I have none.” He spoke these words in a tone that made Maximilien shudder. p381*

Count’s cold-hearted snap at Maximilien demonstrates his mindset before his death to be. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

11.)

*“I therefore say to you, count, that you were right to avenge yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you for not having done more than you did!” p384*

Possibly the most plot striking (blue-balling) sentence in the entire novel, Albert reveals Mercédès told him the Count’s reasoning behind attacking his father - thus cancelling their duel. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

12.)

*“The general clung to the curtain, struggling to hold back the most horrible sob that ever burst from the bosom of a man abandoned by his wife and his son at the same time.” p394*

A satisfying description of Fernand’s final downfall.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

14.)

*“But I love her!” cried Maximilien in agony. “I love her!” “What!” exclaimed Monte Cristo, leaping to his feet. “I love her deeply, madly! I love her so much I’d give all my blood to save her from shedding a single tear! I love Valentine de Villefort, who’s being murdered at this very moment, do you hear me? And I’m asking you and God to tell me how I can save her!” p402*

The passionate eruption of Maximilien's frustration due to Count’s indifference to the poisoning of Valentine. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

15.)

*“Andrea, overwhelmed with compliments and admiration from his friends, was at last beginning to believe that this dream was a reality and he was becoming bewildered.” p408*

A relieving description of Andrea’s marriage to balance the vengeful last sections of the story. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

16.)

*“He was crushed by the weight, but he was not yet clearly aware of the consequences; he felt them, but he had not measured them. p480*

Dumas once again surprises the reader with a very relatable and specific emotion while also giving the reader an almost sadistic pleasure from watching Villefort’s downfall. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

17.)

*“I have two friends who are always with me in my heart: one is the man who gave me life, the other is the man who gave me intelligence.” p491*

The count mustn’t forget to give credit to his two fatherly figures. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

18.)

*“ A weakened mind always sees everything through a black veil.” p491*

The third usage of this analogy in the story, an accurate depiction of Maximilien’s despair during the end scenes. Weakened by loss/grief. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

19.)

*“No, Mercédès,” said Monte Crist, “you judge yourself much too severely. You’re a noble and honorable woman and you disarmed me for a moment with your sorrow, but behind me, invisible, unknown and wrathful, there was God, of whom I was only the agent and who did not choose to prevent my blows from reaching their mark. Examine the past and the present, try to guess the future and then decide whether or not I’m the instrument of God. The most horrible disasters, the cruelest suffering, the abandonment of those who loved me, the persecution of those who didn’t even know me - that was the first part of my life; then, after my captivity, solitude and misery, came freedom and a fortune so extraordinarily immense that I would have had to be blind not to see that God had sent it to me as part of some great design. From then on I considered that fortune as a sacred trust; from then on I gave no thought to ordinary life and its pleasures; from then on I knew not one hour of peace: I felt myself driven like a cloud of fire descending from heaven to destroy an accursed city. Like an adventurous captain setting out on a perilous expedition, I laid in my provisions, loaded my weapons, and prepared every means of attack and defense; I accustomed my body to the most vigorous exercises and my soul to the most violent shocks; I taught my arm to kill, my arms to watch suffering and my lips to smile at the most terrible sights; from the kind, trusting and forgiving man I had once been, I made myself vindictive, crafty and cruel, or, rather, impassive like deaf and blind Fate itself. Then I set out on the path that lay before me and I reached my goal; woe to those whom I met on my way!” p494-495*

An all encompassing monologue from the Count to Mercédès elegantly summing up the motivation and motion behind the story’s plot. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

20.) 

*“there is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world: there is only the comparison of one state with another. Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.” p531*

The wisdom concluding the novel in the letter from the Count to Maximilien, feels like a solution to the earlier quotes on happiness.

o3rjyz,"""Exact Revenge"" by Tim Green, a modern-day rewrite of ""The Count of Monte Cristo""","Reading Tim Green's ""Exact Revenge"", due to the local heatwave that's keeping me mostly indoors. I discovered the existence of this book from an introduction penned by Tim Green in one of the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" editions. He admitted to pretty much copying ""Count"" for his own novel, set in the modern day.

So, how successful is it? Mixed feelings here. ""Count"" worked because of the time period, and the limits on technology/communication available, the limited due process of law, very limited female autonomy, and an unstable political situation. Green's rendition tries to transplant the story into our times, but I feel that a lot of it requires suspension of disbelief, as well as the need to accept his protagonist's (Raymond White) questionable deeds.

Most of the characters are named in a way so readers can make an immediate association between them and their Dumas counterparts. 

\[finishes reading\]

Final thoughts: The book started off pretty well... a mix between ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" with a little of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" added in. The problem is that the main protagonist, Raymond, spends the majority of his prison stint in solitary *by choice*. So he really doesn't spend much time with (Faria-substitute) Lester, nor does he spend his time learning or improving himself or becoming more than he used to be.

Once he gets out, the thrill of ""exact revenge"" for us readers is there, but turns out to be fleeting. Raymond becomes increasingly despicable and hard to root for. His concept of ""exact revenge"" is more like 10x retribution. His actions cause collateral damage >!in the deaths of Dani Rangle, Villay's second wife, and possibly countless heroin overdose deaths because he released millions of dollars of heroin into the community, via Russo and Andre's selling it.!< Unlike The Count, Raymond has no epiphany or sudden realization that his self-righteous revenge had gone too far. Raymond does not commit acts of accidental altruism to make other people's lives better. Because it's all about Raymond, the selfish ""protagonist"".

Even less satisfactory is Helena, the Haydee analogue. Helena is basically a waif that Raymond re-made into a pop star diva, >!and he enabled her to get some petty vigilante revenge on Frank (Fernand)!<. She wasn't a VIP in her own right, she was just a girl who needed a Svengali. The book ends with him happily getting as much sex as possible (voluntary, but still...)  No redemption or repentance, or last-minute acts of mercy here, because it's all about Money, Power and Sex.

Premise was good, but in trying to ""modernize"" what was a perfect novel, all the rewrite did was make things uglier, with more violence, foul language, loads of sex and TONS of unbelievable plot contrivances and logic flaws. Characters fail to utilize resources available in the modern world (that were unavailable back in 1815-1838). 

If you're going to read it, read it for the lulz and list how many ridiculous and unbelievable plot contrivances you can find.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o3rjyz/exact_revenge_by_tim_green_a_modernday_rewrite_of/,2021-06-19 22:35:18,0,15,books
9sdhta,Question about the Count of Monte Cristo (spoilers),"Just finished the book for the first time last night and one thing struck me as I thought about it a bit. The Count left two people alive-Danglars and Villefort-who know who he is. He got his revenge of course since they're disgraced (and one crazy), even though still alive, but is it wise to leave people alive who know you're an escaped prisoner and that have their own motivation now for revenge? 

The reasoning I can see:

1. They're both now broken men with no credibility so no one would believe them anyway.

2. They have no proof the Count=Edmond.

3. Edmond has been free so long and was never convicted so no one would care to try and throw him back in jail even if he was outed.

Granted, with his connections and resources, Edmond could easily disappear probably if someone did come after him, but it just seems like an unnecessary risk. There could be some detail he's missed. Why not get rid of the only two enemies who know the secret?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9sdhta/question_about_the_count_of_monte_cristo_spoilers/,2018-10-29 14:20:17,6,1,books

jf2wy6,"""The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo"" by Tom Reiss","General Alex Dumas was the father of writer Alexander Dumas. Although the General himself was quite a remarkable man, his story has been eclipsed by his son's renown and mostly forgotten. Here we chronicle the period leading up to the French revolution through the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte vis-a-vis General Dumas's perspective. Dumas, who is half black, allows Reiss to explore the part that race played in the Caribbean and Revolutionary France, something that most other histories of this period overlook. The writing is fantastic and moves right along making for a quick read at less than 350 pages. Non-French speakers may struggle with all of the French names present, but otherwise the book is a very accessible read with surprising depths of information. Following an incredibly accomplished man through one of the most fascinating times in history who was the inspiration for two of the most famous novels in history makes for a very enjoyable read for anyone that enjoys reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jf2wy6/the_black_count_glory_revolution_betrayal_and_the/,2020-10-21 01:00:35,0,15,books

18qfdz9,I am lost with The count of Monte Christo,"Hello you lovely readers! 

In various „What’s the best classic book you ever read“ threads in this sub I saw sooo many recommendations for The count of Monte Christo so I bought it. I got the whole complete 10000000 pages version because apparently I like to suffer. I like the story, I really do. But there is a problem: It is so complex and intertwined and everybody is somehow connected to someone else in some way and I already have a bad memory and now I’m half way through and lost 🥲 I feel like I am missing major plot „aha“ moments because I forgot something that happened 350 pages earlier. Also this made me take a break reading it so now I’m even more out. 


I tried googling the story to catch up and understand, but all the summaries spoiler everything already. I also don’t want to re-read the first half again because it will take me another 200 years. 


As I am typing this I see that there is probably no way you could help me with this, but it felt really good to rant it all out once. I committed to the book so I damn well will finish it, even if I only understand 30%, and then I can still read the summaries.

Or is there a website I haven’t found yet, that offers summaries only up to a selected chapter?


Edit: Thank you all so much for your replies! I worked myself though sparknotes up until the chapter I am at and also started a reading journal with character descriptions, connections and important plot moments. It really helped and I can appreciate the story again! Very excited for the second half of the book now :)

2m9qso,Just finished the Count of Monte Cristo [spoliers],"As i'm well aware this book has been discussed many times on this subreddit and deserves all the adulation it receives. I loved the whole experience, the prose and the unrelenting steps of vengeance where you see the web of influence the count begins exerting over his enemies.

My one regret from the book came at the moments when Villefort, Danglars, Morcef and Carderousse finally learned the truth regarding monte cristo's past. The book literally built up to these moments of revelation and yet when it came to pass there was very minimal dialogue with the characters and Dantes. They all were in disbelief and uttered some exclamation but that was the extent of it. I would have enjoyed a bit more of an understanding to their immediate thoughts/regrets regarding what they did and why they did it. I felt that there wasn't the same sense of closure i was expecting. 

The one character who i felt did receive this closure was Mercedes. She and Edmond talked extensively about the past and i felt that there was the right amount of dialogue due to them. I understand that the book is all about how the count strikes back at the conspirators and how he manipulates them all to see themselves ruined over their past follies but i would have loved to have basked in their knowledge and understanding of just how much the count ruined them rather than basically ending their accounts at the most satisfying parts of the book.

4br28b,"Just finished the Count of Monte Cristo, again. What an awesome book. [Spoilers]","This is in contention for my all-time favorite book, battling it out with Dune or LOTR for the top slot. This is probably the fourth time I've read it, and I feel like I enjoyed it all the more for reading through it again.

It's hard for me to describe how great of a story this is. The reader is pulled down this path with Edmund Dantes, and Dumas' writing makes me feel his pain and sorrow, his growing rage. When he becomes empowered to enact his revenge, I feel the same cold satisfaction as he begins to slowly subvert and destroy his betrayers. But at the same time, a slowly growing sense of horror begins to permeate underneath of the satisfaction.

As you watch him destroy Cadarousse with a single gift, as he watches coldly while the knowledge he passed on to Madame Villefort so many years ago begins to take root and claim the lives of her family. You especially see this when Maximilien comes to beg the Count for aid in rescuing Valentine from her poisoner, when he coldly admits that he is aware and couldn't care less what the Villeforts do as they tear themselves to pieces.

His cold admission to Maximilien really made it sink home with me that maybe Edmund was going TOO far. When Monsieur De Villefort coldly orders his wife to kill herself... when he sees the body of his son... I can't even describe it. I must have blotted that part of the book out in my memory, because it was frankly traumatic. I experienced the same trauma as Edmund, seeing his ""God-granted"" vengeance go so horribly wrong.

The ending is also amazing, as Edmund finally gets a chance to be happy. Perhaps he'll be able to forget and forgive himself for the terrible things that he did to his betrayers, but the most important thing is that he has an opportunity to do so. 

I think that the length of the book may keep some people from reading it, but I really think that it's necessary. I lived with these characters for hundreds of pages, so when ""misfortune"" struck them, I knew exactly what that means to them. I felt it on a visceral level. I still feel it.

herc5,What I learned from The Count of Monte Cristo,"(spoilers)



I think the most important lesson I learned from the book is that revenge does not satisfy. I knew that Dantès was going to seek vengeance from his enemies, and halfway through the book I was full of excitement; I could not wait to witness the humiliation and destruction that the Count was sure to rain with full force upon the heads of his enemies. And he did. But I must admit, that after each of the guitly persons was struck down, I was left in want of the satisfaction that I was hoping for. I think the Count himself felt this dissatisfaction (especially after his last visit with Villefort), which is part of the reason, I believe, he spared Danglar's life. Indeed, it was the good that the Count did that really affected me; towards the end I cared less for the fate of his victims than I did for his friends. 

I do not know if Dumas was trying to convey this point at all, but it's what I got from the book. It would have satisfied me more if the Count had simply walked up to his former friends and said ""I am Edmond Dantès, the one you sacrificed for personal gain; I have forgiven you. Now I must leave you to live a life of luxury. Adieu.""

9cogf7,I finished reading the Count of Monte Cristo. It was great! But I have some questions...,"Hello there! So I just finished reading the Count of Monte Cristo, and it was an awesome read. At first I thought I would hate it, but found it fun save for a few boring parts. The whole thing felt like an adventure, filled with twists and turns. What I'm wondering is if I missed something from the original version, as I read one of the abridged books. I'm asking this because, some storylines felt incomplete, and in seeing some of the discussions about Monte Cristo, they might have been complete on the original version? For example, the relationship between the Count and Haydee didn't at all feel real. It seemed more like an abusive relationship with Haydee claiming she was as happy as can be despite being a slave, (I understand that he tried to free her, but in the abridged version at least I didn't see their interactions ad positives). At the end of the book it also says that Valentine loves Haydee as a sister, which really confused me considering that neither of them met each other before. I'm not sure if I just blanked out in these parts, or if the abridged version I read was just missing important information, but it did feel incomplete. (I also don't know if this is the right place to post something like this, don't really follow book subreddits) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9cogf7/i_finished_reading_the_count_of_monte_cristo_it/,2018-09-03 19:32:50,15,9,books
2pbkh6,So I just finished The Count of Monte Cristo.,"Almost completely because of the love it receives on Reddit, I spent the last 40 or so days reading the unabridged Robin Buss translation of *The Count of Monte Cristo*.  There's a certain sense of achievement in finishing a book of such mammoth size (at almost 1250 pages, it's probably in the top 20 longest books I've read) even if the sentence structure and syntax aren't particularly challenging.

Some thoughts about the book in no particular order:

-I thought Edmond was going to spend more time in the book in the prison.  He goes in and comes out in the first 250 pages and it left me really anxious to get to the revenge on his wrongdoers.

-When Edmond left the prison and became the Count of Monte Cristo, it seemed like there was a complete shift in character.  The Count (le Comte, the French title I disliked) has almost no similarity to Edmond.  The Count is perfect, unerring, magical, infallible.  I didn't like the contrast of characters and I certainly didn't like how perfect the Count was.  Once the reader realizes how perfect he is, all sense of adversity to him disappears.  

-I didn't like how we find out near the end of the book that the Count fashions himself an instrument of God.  Oh man, I didn't like that, especially because it's obvious that he did what he did because of how he felt about the people who put Edmond in such a bad situation.  It's like he was using God as an excuse to revenge the wrongdoers.  I think he would've been a stronger character if he was outright for personal revenge, rather than religious motivation.

-I loved all the classical references in the book.  Latin is dropped somewhere in almost every chapter, references to Greco-Roman mythology, the Bible, history...it's all great.  Moreover, you can tell from the writing that Alexandre Dumas was a really smart guy.  You can read some great works of literature, like *Slaughterhouse Five*, but you don't get the feeling that Vonnegut was a worldly, cultured, renaissance man.  Dumas clearly wields many of these references with such deftness and aplomb that you can tell the author is hugely intelligent.

-I was majorly surprised to see Edmond not get with Mercédès at the end of the book.  Likewise, it stunned me to see Danglars live, when the whole plot against Edmond started with him.

-It's long.  And I mean it's *long*.  I read the unabridged version, so maybe that's my fault, but man why does it have to be so long?  The Count could've hurried his revenge up and taken it within a couple months of getting out of prison.  The book could've been 600 pages shorter and I would've liked it just as much.  Lengthening it certainly made the feeling of finishing it greater, but it seemed like it unnecessarily dragged on many points through the novel.

-I really wanted to see Monsieur Noirtier get killed.  I was bummed that he didn't.  Also, though I loved the Latin (and even Greek once or twice), the French terms wore me down after a while.  

-In general, it disappointed me a little bit that *The Count of Monte Cristo* wasn't really literary.  It reads like an adventure story. Though the plot juggles a dozen or so of subplots throughout (each of which is nicely tied up), it reads simply, with little foreshadowing (that I could tell, anyway), symbolism, or other devices.  Thematically, there's a lot to mention with whether the offspring of evildoers deserve to be punished, but I think, in general, its message falls pretty flat.

In closing, don't let my criticisms of the novel imply that I didn't like it.  I did, it was worth reading (not re-reading), but I don't agree with the seemingly unanimous praise it receives on Reddit.  There isn't enough to take out of it from a literary perspective and there isn't enough complexity to decode for further enjoyment.  The plot, meandering as it sometimes was, I wouldn't enjoy nearly as much since I know what happens now.  So I do recommend it to those who have not read it (although I assume all those reading this already have), provided that you have a considerable chunk of time to commit to finishing this magnum opus.

Having finished it, can anyone recommend a film adaptation that's good and faithful to the book (as much as you can be in under 150 minutes)?

cgfkds,If you are a fan of The Count of Monte Cristo you should check to see if your copy is missing half a chapter,"For some reason, some editions of The Count of Monte Cristo are missing exactly half of one chapter, and it's a pretty important sequence. (I'm not sure if I need a spoiler warning on a book this old, but yeah, if you haven't read it I'm about to give away some important plot info.)

Chapter 112 is called 'The Departure,' and in some versions, 113 is called 'The House in the Allèes de Meillan,' while in others (like the Penguin Classics version) 113 is called 'The Past.'

In the versions where it is called 'The House in Allèes de Meillan,' chapter 112 ends when The Count and Maximilian leave Paris. In 113 they arrive in Marseille, The Count visits Mercedes in the house where his father once lived, and then he visits Maximilian in the cemetery before leaving for Rome. 

In the Penguin Classics version, Edmond visits Mercedes in chapter 112. Then in 113, he takes a boat to visit his old prison cell. There he finds new inspiration to carry out his revenge and he obtains the old Abbé’s book on the Italian monarchy. Then he returns to the mainland and meets Maximilian at his parent’s graves. 

For years I have wondered why some versions omit the trip to the prison cell. For starters, it's one of my favorite parts of the book. It’s also really important: After Edouard’s death the Count questions if he is right to have taken his revenge. It’s the sight of his cell, where he tried to bash his own head in, and where he remembers the horror he endured and how his last prayer was just that he be strong enough to remember, that reaffirmed to him that he was right all along. Take that away and the story loses something. So why print a 1,000-plus page book and leave off half of one chapter?

a9murd,About Edmond and Haydée in The Count of monte Cristo," Edmond and Mercedes were separated for 20 years and of course the feelings would not be the same. Edmond had affection, but it was no longer as strong a passion as he had felt in the past and Haydee was close to him and was affectionate with him. It was natural for him to develop feelings for Haydee and to follow life with her. A person's feelings can change.

It is an illusion to believe as in the adaptations of 1934, 1998 and 2002  that their feelings have not changed.

hofb2g,[The Count of Monte Cristo] My thoughts as I have just finished it. Please share your perspective as well!,"**Introduction**

I literally just finished The Count of Monte Cristo for the first time. I couldn't find many reviews and discussions, so I thought I'd post here and ask for your thoughts. It's very easy to miss details in such a  nuanced tale, so I think it's invaluable to hear other people's opinions.

&#x200B;

**My experience**

I slowly, and very slowly, read the first 600 or so pages of the book - until I finally gave up. That was six months ago. I finally had the courage to pick it up again. I backtracked around 200 pages, starting from the Count's arrival in Paris, as he honours his promise to Albert. That was two weeks ago. I started getting more and more into it, and these last few days I have been reading over a hundred pages a day. Six months ago I was struggling to read 10 pages a day, having to force myself, to the point I gave up. For some reason having the whole thing sink in for a while reignited my interest in the story, and now I'm really glad to be picked it up again.

&#x200B;

**The plot**

First of all, I wanna mention that the overall athmosphere, gimmick and setting are very much enjoyable. For the majority of the book, you experience the inner drama of human relationships between the richest of families in Parisian society. All that while a vampire, an angel, a God, slowly but beautifuly unveils his masterpiece of a revenge. The book patiently reveals more about the bonds, affairs and sins of these families, and it's pleasing to learn about those facts as you see the Count's masterplan unfolding - and then you can finally delight yourself with their ruin and suffering.

Unfortunately, that's really predictable, isn't it? It's a 1300 page tale about revenge. When I picked up the book, I couldn't wait to see what twist the writer would employ to create a unique and unpredictable tale. Well, today I've learned you don't need to be original and unpredictable to write a great story. From the very synopsis you know exactly what will happen - and, surprisingly, everything goes exactly as you imagined. And that doesn't make the story any worse.

&#x200B;

**The ending**

Something really bothers me about the ending. The author, and therefore the Count, should have a stance on revenge. To either represent it as a foolish decision in life, or paint it as the very name of justice - or maybe something else entirely - it is obvious that the writer must have a message he wants to send, a philosophy he wants to portray. But, in the end, it never really delivered. The Count is first presented with an unflinching will to burn his enemies alive - and then, as Edouard dies, he starts doubting his resolve. He, who was ready to cold-bloodedly murder Albert (and possibly even architected that duel himself - cause I don't think that would be an oversight, cunning as he is). He, who couldn't care less about Valentine being poisoned. Out of nowhere, an insignificant death causes great turmoil in his resolve, and that is never justified properly, in my eyes. Then, he visits his beloved cell in prison, and by an almost random sentance written by his mentor, in an almost delirous state, he completely changes his mind and is certain that he's doing the right thing. He proceeds to take revenge on Danglars, but in the end he seems to doubt himself once again and takes pity on him. He reunites with Maximilien and saves his life. He hopes the good he has done to the couple helps him atone to his maybe too cruel act of revenge. He then seems ready to take his own life. And then after a few words with Haydeé he does a 180 again and finds purpose in his life.

What do I mean by this terribly convoluted last paragraph? His thoughts are all over the place. He doesn't know what to take from the revenge. He probably doesn't know how to feel. He doesn't know if he did the right thing or not. And he doesn't know what to do next. This is a surprinsingly unique take on the philosophy behind revenge - the author has no clue himself! I don't mean to say he doesn't know what he's writing - I mean that he didn't take a stance, didn't clarify anything in that regard. Probably on purpose. This way, the ending itself feels quite nuanced. So much so that I've read people calling it a happy ending for him, while others call it a tragedy.

While the story never delivers with a stance in revenge, it does bring a very beautiful resolution. By that, I mean ""wait and hope"". It speaks strongly to his experiment with Maximilien and his father - and it's interesting to think that both of them could have killed themselves at any moment. Things only turned out well cause they waited and hoped - and so did the Count. It's even more interesting when you look at the whole story in retrospect: if Mercedes had waited and hoped a little longer... just think of how warm the story could have ended. I don't blame her for not having waited for a full 14 years. But it is pretty clear that, even if that would have taken unshakable faith and resolve, if she had waited for the Count to live prison, this whole tragedy would never have happened. He swore revenge while he was in prison - but I refuse to believe he would have carried it out if he left prison to see his father and his lover having waited for him for 14 years.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts**

Reading this book was a very enjoyable experience. I think of it dearly and think it aggregated something to me as a human being. It was not without it's faults, especially in regards to the ambiguous and possibly shallow final conclusion. I appreciate it nonetheless, and currently regard it as a very well-written and emotional whole. Bonus points for the melancholy ending.

Please share your take on the story! I'm sure there will be very different interpretations and a lot of nuance I must have missed. Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hofb2g/the_count_of_monte_cristo_my_thoughts_as_i_have/,2020-07-10 00:55:21,8,18,books
38or0q,[Spoilers follow] Underwhelmed with The Count of Monte Cristo,"I started this epic book (the unabridged Penguin Classics version) after hearing a lot about it. Granted this book has its pluses. I loved the splendid writing and extreme detail Dumas goes into. One of my favorite parts of the book was the education Edmond undergoes under Abbe Faria.

However as the story progressed it became more and more convoluted. Why would I want to read 30 pages about Luigi Vampa. Albert and Franz's tour of Rome was around 10 chapters of unneeded bloat. Chapters with M. Noirtier especially stand out here, his eyes express everything, I get it.

The 'plot twists' I saw coming a mile away (of course Valentine is still alive and obviously the assassin is Madame Villefort). The ending was also really cliched; 'wait and hope'? this just made me roll my eyes.

And Edmond as a totally infallible character who's filthy rich, good looking and can commit no wrong destroyed all the sympathy I felt for him towards the beginning of the book.

In conclusion, I was relieved when the book ended. What am I missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/38or0q/spoilers_follow_underwhelmed_with_the_count_of/,2015-06-05 16:30:12,11,0,books

e86qsl,"For those who liked The count of monte Cristo, read The man who laughs","The Man Who Laughs was originally published in 1869, being the penultimate work of the author. Victor Hugo takes us to eighteenth-century aristocratic England, and the story revolves around Gwynplaine, who in his childhood was kidnapped by a group of kidnapping criminals and later sold to a troupe known as ""Comprachicos.""

It was in the troupe that the misfortunes in his life continued, for the boy Gwynplaine had his face mutilated and such was the damage that the boy was disfigured, so that when looking at his face he always seemed to be smiling. On a blizzard night in the city of Portland, Gwynplaine found a blind little girl, nearly freezing to death with her late mother. Faced with this sad scenario, Gwynplaine decided to help the baby, whose name was Dea.

Gwynplaine and Dea will be sheltered from the cold in the wagon of Ursus, a connoisseur of potions, herbs and at the same time a philosopher. Over time Gwynplaine and Dea grow up and work on various performances with Ursus, something that makes them famous. But Gwynplaine's fame will allow him to discover his origin and his ancestors.

&#x200B;

In London, during a performance in a theater, some coincidences and calamities happen and Gwynplaine, once without a known lineage, becomes the son of a wealthy lord, and with this, he believes he can now fight for the poor and oppressed. However, your connection to the past may endanger your life as well as your love for Dea. It will be up to Gwynplaine to choose between her ideals or to keep her love.

&#x200B;

The Man Who Laughs is a novel full of social criticism, focusing on the privileges and blindness of the nobility of the English aristocracy towards the misery of the poor, coupled with a capricious injustice of late 17th century British law. Another criticism that the author lists, is the aesthetics, the beauty, considering that the protagonist is disfigured and, therefore, is seen as a monster, although it has a good heart. On the other hand, those who are normal, beautiful, and of the desirable standard of beauty are praised, regardless of their lack of scruples.

&#x200B;

The author presents us with a romantic plot in the figure of Dea and Gwynplaine, something that can be seen over time as they get closer and closer. Gwynplaine saved her when she was a baby and took care of her, Dea falls in love with him. Because she's blind, Dea is very afraid of being alone and that gwynplaine will leave her. The relationship Gwynplaine and dea reminds Edmond and Haydee. He slava her, takes care of her and the girl falls in love. The vulnerability of dea is greater because it is blind. There is also Ursus's love for Gwynplaine, but a brotherly love.

1r95ix,"A question about the ending of The Count of Monte Cristo, and how the ending compares to the 2002 movie ending (spoilers)","Edit: TL;DR at bottom  

I first read the book about 9 years ago, and I really enjoyed it and was perfectly happy with the ending. A few years ago, I saw the movie version of The Count of Monte Cristo (2002) with Jim Caviezel, and I thought it was pretty decent. A lot of things had to be condensed for the movie, with some characters left out or combined. But the most interesting thing about it is that Dantes ends up with Mercedes in the end. Haydee is left out entirely and Albert turns out to be the son of Dantes, conceived before he was imprisoned. And I kind of liked that ending.


So that is where I was at, and I just reread the book a couple months ago, and I think the movie has changed how I feel about the ending. Reading the book again, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Mercedes, as she was not at fault for anything. I even started rooting for her, when she is trying to drop hints to the Count, and the Count realizes she only ever loved him. And it is evident that there is still love between them (consider when she melts Dantes' heart enough to force him not to kill Albert). And at the end, it just felt even more wrong that Mercedes ends up broken, weeping, and completely alone. I realize that the book ending is the only true absolute revenge. And that the movie ending makes the story more about the happy ending for hopeless romantics, and a little less about revenge.  

So my main question is: which ending would you prefer? One where Mercedes is left broken, weeping, and alone and Dantes is off romping around the world with a princess half his age? Or where Haydee is freed and grows up on her own, and Dantes spends happily ever after with Mercedes?  

Additionally: Did anyone else have a change of heart similar to mine after watching the movie?  

TL;DR In the movie ending, Mercedes and Dantes end up together, and now I think I prefer that ending, which makes the book ending really sad :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1r95ix/a_question_about_the_ending_of_the_count_of_monte/,2013-11-22 23:55:55,34,29,books
bb9ukc,Discrepancies between Barnes and Noble Classic of The Count of Monte Cristo and Gutenberg project version,"Hey, this is a question for someone who has read one or both. I don't want to google anything and possibly get spoiled.

I'm switching between the Gutenberg project version on my computer for when I read during class, and the Barnes and Noble version when I read the physical. I realize my mistake and won't be doing this again, but I have a question about the plot.

In the Gutenberg version, Franz meets Sinbad (Dantes) on Monte Cristo when he stops to hunt goat on the way to Rome. In the Barnes and Noble version, it seems like Franz is sees Dantes for the first time as the Count of Monte Cristo who he recognizes from the Coliseum the night before.

4ldesl,"Just finished The Count of Monte Cristo based off of the respect it is given in this sub and I really, really did not enjoy it.

I had a very real feeling of empathy for Dantes and wanted him to be redeemed. 

Then the book hit the brakes *hard* for me.  It gets sort of boring and drawn out.  

My major problem is that there is no satisfying resolution.  You are set up to yearn for Dantes to get his retribution but it comes at such a slow pace that I just wanted to finish.

Fernand doesn't meet his demise because of what he did to Dantes, but rather because of another betrayal.  It just feels convenient that he also screwed someone else over.  It was also a stretch for me to believe that Dantes just knows all of this and is able to take advantage of it.

Danglers loses his fortune but gets away (I know there is an abridged version where Dantes confronts him).  I was just left feeling empty that he doesn't get more punishment.

Villefort gets punished because of something that has nothing to do with Dantes.

30562f,Am I the only person who didn't like the Count of Monte Cristo?,"I just finished the Count of Monte Cristo (on audio book), and I have to say, I was not impressed at all. I wouldn't say it was a bad book, but I certainly didn't feel I got enough of a pay off to justify the time commitment. 

I really found it really off-putting how often threat of suicide was invoked when people they didn't get their way (I don't know if that was just how life was back at the time, but I haven't had this issue with other classics I've read). I really didn't like how the Count decides to leave Mercedes to a life of miserable penitence to go off and bang the hot Greek teenager, to me it felt puritanical almost, that Edmond wasn't interested in her because she'd been with another man, but fortunately enough there was a gorgeous virgin just waiting for him. These issues are ancillary gripes though, my biggest issue was that I found vast superiority of Dantes to every other character in the entire novel in every aspect of life to be wholly uninspired, it made the novel feel like it was Dumas' personal fantasy, instead of a genuine story. 

Yet a quick perusal of past topics about the novel seems to imply that I am literally the only person who feels this way. I confess I may have been tainted by the non-novel versions of the story. I've seen the Caviezel movie, the Gerard Depardieu miniseries, and even an anime version of it.
