24q326,Would you care to share you thoughts on 'The thirteenth tale' with me? I've just finished it.,"Loved Diane Setterfield's prose. Her sentences. The way she describes details, her use of metaphors, & how she manages the time line of a really twisted story.

Now, here's my question. Did she really have to name so many times the novels that inspire her? Why so many times? We know that a bit is somehow relevant to one of the stories, but all the time, a constant reminder? 

An another questions, why such a good ghost story didn't end as a ghost story? 

I liked it. It's just that I find that ghost stories are like scared of really being ghost stories nowadays. 

And last, has anyone read her other book, 'Bellman & Black'? Is it a proper horror story?

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

x6x29,I work in a bookstore so I spend my day recommending books. These are the ones I think everyone should read. Warning: This list is a little different from the stuff you normally see here.,"Catcher in the Rye, Brave New World, Catch 22, repeat ad nauseum. All great books, but we all knew that already. So here is my list of other must reads. None of them are all that obscure, but they're all really great books for one reason or another. 

I'm adding some stuff to the original list, like whether the book is a series and how many and stuff, just to clear up confusion

Edit: 2:30pm OK I'm going to go back and edit this so it looks like less of a mess. 


*A Town Like Alice*- Nevil Shute (My favorite book ever. The one I would pick to save from a burning library) (wow I could not have spelled his name less correctly)

*Salt*- Mark Kurlansky

***The Thief* and *The Queen of Attolia*- Megan Whalen Turner** Edit: seems like no one else has read this one. Seriously, one of the best books I have ever read. It's sort of an ancient Greek fantasy heist story espionage thriller. *The Thief* won a Newbery Honor but *The Queen of Attolia* is where is gets REALLY awesome. READ THEM. It's a series of currently 4 books, 5th is on the way

*The Third Policeman*- Flan OBrien

*Revenge*- Stephen Fry

*Band of Brothers*- Stephen Ambrose

*All Creatures Great and Small*- James Herriot

*The Twenty One Balloons*- William Pene Dubois

*The Painted Veil*- Somerset Maugham

*Stardust*- Neil Gaiman

*The Princess Bride*- William Goldman

*Cuchulain of Muirthemne*- Lady Augusta Gregory translation

*The Penderwicks*- Jeannie Birdsall (series of 3)

*The Piano Shop on the Left Bank*- Thad Carhart

*Shopgirl*- Steve Martin

*An Unsuitable Job for a Woman*- PD James

*The Daughter of Time*- Josephine Tey

*To Say Nothing of the Dog*- Connie Willis

*Sabriel*- Garth Nix (series of 3, 4th on the way)

*Dealing with Dragons*- Patricia C Wrede (series of 4, another series just arrived, *Thirteenth Child* and *Across the Barrier*)

*The Hunt for Red October*- Tom Clancy (give it a chance, it's really good!) 

*The Squire's Tale*- Gerald Morris (series of 8 or 9) **OK has no one else heard of this guy?** Do you want to laugh till you piss yourself? Ok then, go read Morris.

*Now, Voyager*- Olive Higgins Prouty

*The Last September*

*Asterix and Obelix*- Goscinny et Underzo

*TinTin*- Hergé

*Flashman's Lady*- George MacDonald Frasier (series of many)

*Good Omens*- Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman (the audiobook is also good)

*Swallows and Amazons*- Arthur Ransome (series of many)

*Danny Champion of the World*- Roald Dahl (did you know that there's a movie? With Jeremy Irons and his son, Sam Irons? SO CUTE)

*Tinker Tailor*- John Le Carre

*The Devil's Dictionary*- Ambrose Bierce (best bathroom book. I keep a copy in our WC for the amusement and edification of guests. Speaking of which, look up the definition of Guest)

*The Ordinary Princess*- MM Kaye

*Catwings*- Ursula le Guin (series of 4)

*Mr Revere and I* (also *Ben and Me* and *Captain Kid's Cat*)- Robert Lawson

*Carry on Mr Bowditch*- Jenny Latham

*Redwall*- Brian Jaques (also the Redwall Cookbook if you're really looking for a giggle) (series of many many many)

*The Reluctant Dragon*- Kenneth Graham (yes THAT Kenneth Graham, also look for the audiobook read by none other than Boris motherfucking Karloff. It will make your life better, I promise) 

*Kenny and the Dragon*- Tony Diterlizzi

*Basin and Range*- John Mcphee

*Circles*- James Burke (seriously awesome, go check it out NOW) (now that I think about it, this is one of the reddit-iest books ever, if redditism can be called a thing)

*The Right Stuff*- Thomas Wolfe

*The Shadow Series*- Orson Scott Card (ignore his personal politics, these are actually interesting and very good page turners)

*The Boat that Wouldn't Float*- Farley Mowat

*Apollo 13*- Jim Lovell

*Billy Budd*- Herman Melville

*The Wolves of Willoughby Chase*- Joan Aiken (also *Nightbirds on Nantucket*)

*Tomatoland*- Estabrook

*Trickster's Choice*- Tamora Peirce (depressed_realist reminded me of Peirce. All her books are good, but the Alanna series, the Wild Magic series are EXCELLENT and the best ones of all are *Trickster's Choice* and *Trickster's Queen*. But you kind of have to read Allana first, or they won't be as good)


And Finally

**The Grey Seas Under** by Farley Mowat, which I think is the best book ever written. And of course the sequel, *The Serpent's Coil*. 



Everything by the following authors:

Terry Pratchett

Dorothy L Sayers

CS Forester

PG Wodehouse

Christopher Moore

Bill Bryson (Especially In A Sunburnt Country)

John Mortimer

**OK I added him!** Mark Kurlansly!!

Neil Gaiman

James Burke

Arthur Ransome

John Le Carre

Susan Cooper (She's most famous for *The Dark is Rising* but also check out *The Boggart*. And let's all just pretend that movie never happened.)

**Edit** I'm off to work after a glorious two days off so I'll be collecting a whole new harvest of books. I'll post more tonight. See you in a few hours folks.

db8tc8,Celebrating Halloween the bookish way!,"I love Halloween! I missed out on it when I was was a child because it wasn't really a thing in my country then. 

October starts tomorrow and I plan to spend the whole month in a Halloween mood and because reading is a big part of my life I've decided to celebrate by reading. I'm going to try to read or re-read one scary short story every day. I love older ghost stories (authors like M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood etc.) and I have quite nice collection of books containing them. I'm going to add some newer stuff too, mostly (but not only) from ""Mammoth Books of Best New Horror"".

Do you have any special reading plans for this year's Halloween season? Do you participate in any Halloween reading challenge?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/db8tc8/celebrating_halloween_the_bookish_way/,2019-09-30 09:07:29,14,19,books
