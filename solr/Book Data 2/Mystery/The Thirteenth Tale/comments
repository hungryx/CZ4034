a31vsi,"Hi!  Thank you for this.  I got in touch with my publisher to find out more, and it's now clear where the error lies.  We meant to say something about The Thirteenth Tale being the first debut to be an instant bestseller on the New York Times list, but the sentence grew too long and unwieldy and it got edited it lost the word 'instant'.  You're quite right about those other novels:  Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian (a novel I remember well) hit the no 1 spot about two weeks after launch, and The Nanny Diaries took around 6 weeks to get there.  J K Rowling's debut took over two years to reach the top of the ranking.  What my publisher and I meant to say was that The Thirteenth Tale was the first debut that went instantly to no1 in the week of launch.  
Thank you for your question which has enabled me to correct what was admittedly an error.  
The typical place to do this kind of research is Publisher's Marketplace which started tracking bestseller lists in 2003.  As you say, the NY Times list has been going much longer than that, so to go back further requires searching and checking individual titles.  ",DianeSetterfield,2018-12-06 16:00:16
a31vsi,How long would you say it took you to actually write Once Upon a River? Do you feel like it takes a special place in your heart over The Thirteenth Tale?,afs1122,2018-12-04 16:39:24
a31vsi,"You absolutely brilliant in your phrasing. How many drafts/rewrites did you do on The Thirteenth Tale? Bellman & Black, Once Upon A River?",INFJFTW,2018-12-04 17:06:59
a31vsi,"You are beyond my favorite author - I wish Audible would tell me how many times I have finished The Thirteenth Tale. I think it was maybe my 20th time through it when I realized the story behind the story in the topiary garden and... why!  


I have given The Thirteenth Tale as gifts and always have extra copies around to give away on the fly...   


Do you ever make book group appearances or SKYPEs? Are there any plans for a US book tour?",INFJFTW,2018-12-04 17:42:29
a31vsi,What were you doing when you learned that The Thirteenth Tale had hit #1?,INFJFTW,2018-12-04 17:53:17
a31vsi,"I'm currently reading Once Upon a River. I reached part 3 and went back and re-read parts 1 and 2 because I didn't want to go through the book too fast. Now I'm about to start Part 3. I haven't loved a book so much since, well, since I read the Thirteenth Tale. 

Thank you for writing. 

BTW I spent a couple of childhood summers on a boat on the Thames and can so relate to your story. 

And I googled the Swan at Radcot and discovered it is a real place. ",frinh,2018-12-20 20:49:11

a31vsi,"It's usually a tiny fragment that gets me started.  With THE THIRTEENTH TALE it was a dream about a fire in a library and a personal story told to me years earlier in France by a student who had been born a twin but his twin died and his parents chose not to tell him till he was adult.  The two things were in a part of my mind where I stored things 'someone' ought to write a novel about.  They came into each other's orbit and made me think, maybe that someone is me.",DianeSetterfield,2018-12-04 17:17:33
a31vsi,"They're great, aren't they?  It's the publisher who makes the final decision, but they are good enough to consult me on their choice.  The reader for ONCE UPON A RIVER is Juliet Stevenson and she is quite brilliant.  She also did the UK audiobook for THE THIRTEENTH TALE.",DianeSetterfield,2018-12-04 17:44:11
a31vsi,"As Anne of Green Gables would say, we are “kindred spirits”!!!! I fully second your sentiment of Diane and the Thirteenth Tale! In fact, it was to meet my favorite author that I came to Arvon in England in 2016. This year (end of July) Diane teaches at Arvon again - this time, the theme is READING FOR WRITING. I am sure it’s going to be an amazing week! I am definitely going. ",victoriaevangelina,2018-12-04 18:03:10

a31vsi,"It's one of my favorite passages. Whenever I host a book group \[I travel between them to play hostess for The Thirteenth Tale\] I always read them the first chapter... and that section is always one of my favorite to portray.   


Inside my head. No. None.  


Thank you for being here... You are sincerely my favorite above all. Thank you.",INFJFTW,2018-12-04 18:02:43

db8tc8,"YESS! 
I'm reading a spooky autumn, starting in September, and ending sometime early in November. 

I have read: We Were Liars by E. Lockhart, Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley, and The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield. The best so far was The Thirteenth Tale!

To be read: The Rules of Magic by Alice Hoffman, Jane Steele by Lyndsay Faye, V for Vendetta, and The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter by Theodora Gross. 

If I run out of titles, I'll just read more crime mysteries, and I have a few back ups too (The Historian, The Winter People, etc.).",ilovebeaker,2019-09-30 13:47:11
