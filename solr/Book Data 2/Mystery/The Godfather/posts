yidfzz,so I read the Godfather,"So one day I saw it in a bookstore and bought it, yesterday I picked it up and it was so good I blew through the book.

The writing wad easy to understand and the pace was good.

What I liked especially is the characters, my favorites being Michael, Don Vito and Santino.

But don Vito was by far my favorite character. I think what I would call him is a Man's man, a man any man would admire and any boy would aspire to be like. He was a perfect balance of compassionate and ruthless, intelligent and kind, criminal but principled. 

I also liked the various subtleties in the book, how one little slip of the tongue was enough to screw things up. Like how Santino screwed up by showing interest in Sollozo or how Barzini revealed his true intentions from just one line uttered at the meeting, no grandiose admissions of guilt like typical stories.

The story was a pretty smooth ride with the only oddity being the Johny Fontaine storyline which was boring and I didn't have much interest. 

Overall, what a book, I will definitely read the whole trilogy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yidfzz/so_i_read_the_godfather/,2022-10-31 14:17:17,393,1592,books

I cannot recommend this book enough. It not only has an amazing plot filled with twists and turns (will probably be appreciated more by those who have not watched the movies), but it's writing is also incredible.

What was the point of the Johnny Fontane chapters? They did not contribute to the climax or the overall story for that matter.

13577vm,Mario Puzos The Godfather,"While I have seen the film I have only recently started reading the book version.

It’s the well known story of a poweful Mafia family in the United States and the seduction and fall of the families favorite son. 

Apart from the great plot it is very interesting from a historic standpoint. It provides insight into Sicilian/ Italian immigration to the USA and just the morals and manners and fashions of Americans in the 1940s.

One thing that surprised me is how.. not evil the Corleone family appeared to be. Part of me thought Don Corleone was a Person from a time and country very different from my own and just had a different  g way of doing business. He is faithful to his wife, loves his children and always tries to do right by them .

All of his victims are other mobsters and crooks and he never targets innocent people. The same can be said of his sons, one of which saved Tom Hagen from a life of starvation and begging. It almost seems like war rather then crime.

10baw9q,Just finished The Godfather,"It’s tricky because I loved the story (I’ve watched the movie but hadn’t ever read the book) but the misogyny was really hard to read. The racism too, of course, but there was much less of that. It seemed like every other page a woman was being beaten by her husband (and no one cared bc she was his property.) Or the men were on the hunt for a (probably) underage girl who was “innocent” and virginal. It was so gross. And the part about Lucy getting the surgery to make her “tighter” for her husband…omg. I realize it was written over 50 years ago, but the whole thing was really difficult to read from the POV of a person living in 2023. I both loved and hated it. Anyone else have these thoughts ?

EDIT TO ADD : I’m not saying that the 1930’s/40’s WASNT racist, sexist, etc.   I’m NOT saying that the book isn’t a good read. I’m saying that, as a person living in 2023 and reading through MY lens, it’s hard to read. It’s just through my own eyes. I’m not saying it’s not realistic for the time. I’m not saying it shouldn’t have been in the book.

17jah6s,Infinite Jest and the Godfather Parallels,"This is going to seem really out there, so rest assured that it’s just a bit of fun. I don’t think any of these connections are at all intentional. 

I’m reading Infinite Jest and I can’t help but be reminded of the Godfather, specifically how the Incandenza family reminds me of the Corleone family. 

1. There’s the father figure who isn’t present for most of the book but affects the story even when he isn’t. The books explore his backstory extensively via flashbacks. He looms large over every aspect of the narrative. 

2. There’s the oldest son who is brash and physically strong, but also a smooth-talking womanizer. He sometimes has a strained relationship with his siblings because he talks down to them. 

3. There’s the middle son who nobody takes seriously because he’s a little dopey or physically disabled. But he helps with his father’s business and represents an honest sincerity which contrasts the rest of the characters in the story.  

4. There’s the youngest son, the main character of the story, who is the smart one, the one who is most recently inducted into the family business (or became a tennis prodigy, it’s equivalent for IJ’s example), and who suffers the dire consequences of his poor choices throughout the story. 

5. There’s even a smaller connection via Joelle Van Dyne/Lucy Mancini. Both are romantically connected to the oldest son and work for the family for a time, but after being left behind, they attempt suicide and end up seeking treatment for their particular disorders (an acid-damaged face/drug addiction in the former case, overly large genitalia for the latter).


I just thought these parallels were interesting, even if entirely coincidental (and I can’t think of two radically different types of novels). 

Are there any books where you found weird and random parallels between events/characters?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17jah6s/infinite_jest_and_the_godfather_parallels/,2023-10-29 19:26:58,3,4,books
12s3ouu,Disc- The Godfather,"Before I start to highly praise the novel, I must tell all of you that I have never seen the movies.

I've had the novel since 2016 and I read it in 2022, my siblings always implored me to read it but I was too much into Anime at that time (I still am but I don't spend the better part of the day watching it.) Funnily enough I started reading it after I was kicked out of college and had nothing going on for me.

The way the book started I was exceptionally good and the I liked all the the Characters, my favorite was Johnny Fontane and he still is because his story never had nay relation with the grand scheme of things, he was just there to let us know what Godfather was capable of and I loved that show of Power. I loved that so much I daydreamed about being him, but I don't like to fight let alone kill.

vyespy,The Godfather - Lucy Mancini,"Did anybody else get to chapter 22 and think *what the fuck*?

The Godfather is a bestselling classic. It's the source material for two incredible movies. 

And... it features a character with an *enormous* vagina.

There are pages and pages dedicated to Lucy Mancini, her too loose vagina and the reconstructive surgery she undergoes to fix the 'problem'.

But this subplot is largely ignored by... well everyone.

It adds nothing to the book. It doesn't further the plot. It's absolutely bizarre, probably medically incorrect and yet I don't see enough people asking what the hell Puzo was thinking when he wrote it.

p3ho45,Godfather is one of the most fantastic books I have read this year.,"I’ll start by saying that I haven’t seen the movie. Most of what I knew prior to the book was pop culture references. Unfortunate that was my introduction to the book and, upon reading it, how much misconception I was given about. Especially when it came to The Godfather himself, Don Corleone.

This character has the respect of an old scarred lion and the subtle brutality of a calculating cobra. But he is one of the most compassionate character I’ve ever read and how he responds to each person who comes to him is with a firm understanding that, while he understands your strifes. what you ask for will be paid in retribution to him.

With how it is written you see the pieces of his character split between his three sons, four if you count the ever dependable Tom Hagen as his in-house lawyer.

p6wozu,"CS Lewis' dedication in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is superb."," ""My Dear Lucy,

your affectionate Godfather,

C.S. Lewis""

The stages of liking, outgrowing, and returning to fairy tales is a comment that resonated with how I've been reading of late. I have been revisiting the books that I read back in school, those that I grew up with. I realise that perhaps I could not have enjoyed these even a few years earlier, and yet, having reached a certain age (how wonderfully Lewis leaves that open-ended), I'm realising that despite what is often said, these are, in fact, stories that I can return to, no matter how much my age may supposedly separate me from the maturity that these books express.

lyploh,Finished reading “The Godfather “and it has made me think about the Mafia’s role in society,"Now I’m not saying that the Mafia is a good thing, obviously I know they are bad eggs, but this book made me understand: I get why the characters or real life people would rather go to the Don for financial, business, family, political or other issues. In their eyes “justice and the right arm of the law” have failed them. Either by not lending a hand, or not providing true repercussions for certain actions. For example: Can’t make a house payment because you had to spend it on your partner for a life saving operation? “Tough luck son,” says society.
 But you go to The Godfather and he will help you out. He finds out that you own a gardening business and five years later your repaid favor is: help him grow and tend for his garden.

kb0k5r,Why do people say The Godfather is a better movie than book?!,"Edit: Spoiler warning 

I recently read The Godfather, I’d had a copy for ages and had never read it, nor seen the film. I recently read the book and was hooked, absorbed and couldn’t put it down. Yes there are some more graphic scenes around Sonny’s “organ” and Lucy’s surgery and the side plots with Johnny Fontane and Nino go well of tangent but this was enthralling. Start to finish was fantastic. I definitely found myself wishing Puzo would “get to it” a little bit I was almost heartbroken when I’d finished it and want to read it again. 
I’m now on The Sicilian with plans to read The Last Don, Omertà and Fools Die (at least) as Puzo creates an underworld and drops you right in it. 

Sure some of the ideas are “old fashioned” but I don’t read a book set in the 40s and expect anything less. 

I watched the film last night and I wasn’t blown away, I understand it’s generally considered to be far superior than the book. Monuments characters like Luca Brasi are brushed over, the immensity of the horses head is lost without the build up of the “fortress” image of the stables and Bonasera’s panic when Hagen calls him is lost. Puzo tells the story phenomenally and the film is less subtle and harder to follow (somehow). Yes I enjoyed the film but I don’t see why people think it’s far superior. I will watch part II & III as the movie buff in me has too but I’m far more excited by the prospects of devouring Puzo’s other work in literature.

I’ve watched maybe six times and every time, the ending always almost brings me to tears. So when I learned it was adapted from P.D. James’ book of the same name, it was a no-brainer deciding what my next book would be. 

After finishing the book, it wasn’t difficult to reach to the conclusion that I enjoyed the movie better. 

While James’ book gives a more in-depth look at how human infertility and humanity’s slow death march towards extinction affects the sexual dynamic between men and women and almost demented ways humans try to cope with a world without children or a race of dead men walking, I feel the book dedicates WAY too much time describing the failing of human civilization and the Regrets and guilt of Theo Faron. It’s not even until after 2/3 through the book where it feels like the plot and story are properly paced and stuff of consequence actually begin to happen.

The Godfather is one of those rare types of stories that I've forever fallen in love with, since the first story I read that featured my favorite trope, a man larger than life. Like The Count in The Count of Monte Cristo, Ged in the Earthsea Quartet, Kelsier in the Mistborn series, Hub and Garth in Second Hand Lions, Westley in The Princess Bride, even Ferris in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 

Michael and Vito were larger than life. I wrote in my review, ""The story focuses on the importance of family and friendship more than anything. It focuses on the fierce pride one has for his heritage. It focuses on the deep, sometimes sacrificial love one person can feel for another. It focuses on compromise, decisions, war strategy, social climbing and power hungry struggles. What it means to kill a person, what a life is worth. The value of the family unit. Of marital unity, of love in and outside marriage. Forgiveness. Of quieting your anger, of letting hateful rage grow cold. And it focuses on, my favorite, revenge."" 

Ever since I first watched Kill Bill as a kid I've been searching for something as revenge-filled, and I thought the book The Count of Monte Cristo fit the bill (and it still does) but as I read The Godfather I couldn't contain myself from gasping and saying ""oh shit"" every couple of pages.

I read the novel a few years back and watched the movie last year. I know both the novel and the movie are considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest in their genre. Now, this post is not simply about comparing a novel and it's on-screen adaptation because most of the times the difference in their 'levels' is not that much or the movie and the novel both are not considered one of the greatest.

Now, coming to my point, the novel is far better than the movie. Or I should say, the novel is one of the best one I have ever read and the movie is one of the worst I have ever watched (not just the adaptations, all the movies). I think the movie is not great, not average, just bad, if not worst or very bad (regardless whether someone read the novel or not).

8zxkul,Thoughts on The Godfather,"WARNING: I don't talk about any details that can be considered spoilers but if you want absolutely nothing known before reading it, well, you've been warned.

Hey all.

I wanted to share my views on The Godfather mainly because they are a bit varying from popular opinion. The book in question is usually held at high regard and there is a lot of hype surrounding it. However, it just didn't live upto my expectations. Expectations highetened by a friend and other reviews.

The author, Mario Puzo, chose to delve into quite a few subplots regarding certain secondary characters. While I eventually saw why this was needed, it slowed the pacing of the story for me (given it's not a fast paced stroyline to begin with). There are 10-20 pages of information on the lives of certain characters, which quite frankly, I did not find amusing. I found myself bored at times and reluctant to pick up the book again. I sort of had to pushed myself to read the last 100 pages of the book, just for the sake of finishing it. 

That is not to say that I found nothing good in this book. The Don's character is fascinating and the character development of a certain character is very well drawn out. The ideology the Corleone Family and other Families live by is also one to think about. It is suffice to say that the book will make you think, however minimally.

In conclusion, I just don't see how it is called one of the greatest crime novels ever. This is just my opinion and I would love to hear what you felt about this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8zxkul/thoughts_on_the_godfather/,2018-07-18 17:33:53,16,1,books

\- The characters seem to be hypocrites who behave like God's. 

\- The perfect Italian wife whose only purpose is to tolerate domestic abuse while pushing out babies. I had to skip paragraphs because I could not stand how Puzo wrote about women. And does he have to use the word 'broads' so often? 

\- Michael and the thunderbolt (cringe).  And how he never told Kay about Apollonia. 

\- Hyping up characters for no reason at all. There were pages devoted to Luca Brasi and we all know how it ended. The ending too was hyped up. 

\- The curious case of Lucy Mancini and her loose vagina. How was this even relevant to the story? 

\- Freddie being the Don's most obedient son but was pushed out and later shunned.

iqz9qc,The Godfather by Mario Puzo is a must read for anyone that loves mafia films.,"The Godfather is probably one of my favorite all-time novels. Not the greatest in writing style, nor editing, but the details it fills into the movies are amazing. My personal favorite is in regard to the first scene of godfather 1, when the owner of the mortuary is asking the don for vengeance for the rape of his daughter. This is a powerful scene, and never really touched on again in the movies. In the book, the don hires two former heavyweight boxers to wait for the two culprits outside of a bar late at night. The entire chapter starts with the two boxers feeling crammed in the car, and cold because of the snow. They are slowly getting more irritated, and then the rapists walk out. The details of the beating are so satisfying that i won’t ruin them, but they basically beat these two guys to an inch of their lives, but still alive. Later on, the mortician receives a call from the don, asking if he’s ready to do that favor. There is an entire chapter about the mortician being terrified about what he needs to do for the mob. Thinking about his wife, employees, daughter. About his entire life always being a good man. That he made a huge mistake. That he should have never gotten involved with don corleone. The anxiety builds up so well, and ultimately he realizes that he only needs to get a massacred sonny ready for an open casket funeral for his mother. This book is so great on so many levels. There’s also a lot about johnny fontaine in old hollywood, fredo in vegas, and the detailed description of how secured the decapitated horse was at the producer’s house. When the producer is taking tom through his mansion, getting to that particular horse is like breaking into a secured fortress.

>The Don considered a use of threats the most foolish kind of exposure; the unleashing of anger without forethought as the most dangerous indulgence. No one had ever heard the Don utter a naked threat, no one had ever seen him in an uncontrollable rage. It was unthinkable. And so he tried to teach Sonny his own disciplines. **He claimed that there was no greater natural advantage in life than having an enemy overestimate your faults, unless it was to have a friend underestimate your virtues.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l1dlz8/what_does_mario_puzothe_godfather_mean_by_the/,2021-01-20 17:18:18,9,11,books
9visw1,Why I didn't like The Godfather,"I recently watched the first Godfather movie (which I really enjoyed) and decided to pick up the book afterwards. I knew that the movie is generally considered to be much better, but reading through the other discussion threads on reddit encouraged me to give the book a chance.

I got to say that there is hardly anything about the book I enjoyed. Obviously part of it comes from the fact that I already knew what was going to happen, but I was still baffled by how bad the writing was. It feels to me like it's all tell, no show. Even the most obvious things are explained over and over again. (Ironically enough, one of the most over-explained things seems to be Vito's subtleness when dishing out threats.) There is hardly any dialogue, which is a good thing in a way, because what little there is, is just plain bad and redundant.

I also felt like none of the characters really go through a change, not even Michael. Sure, it is established at the beginning of both movie and book that Michael wants to have nothing to do with the family's business, but when Vito is attacked, it takes him about two seconds to decide that he will murder two people in cold blood to protect the family. This was my biggest (and pretty much only) gripe with the movie, and I partly picked up the book, because I hoped it would provide a better understanding of Michael's character, but in the end I found myself disappointed.

I'm seriously wondering if there is anything I missed, especially with regards to Michael's character.

mprzio,I just finished Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton for the first time and oh boy I have a lot to say,"To give some context: I have watched every Jurassic Park movie in the franchise, and have played the Lego game (super fun) a few times through. The first time I saw Jurassic Park was on VHS.

I have never read any of Michael Crichton's work, so I can't compare how Jurassic Park is to any of his other works. 

My thoughts: I completely understand that a book and its movie are always different. This is more about: why did they make Hammond's character so much more likeable, friendly, and gave him ""sweet grandpa"" vibes in the movie? Why were *certain characters* kept alive during the movie? Why didn't we see more dinosaurs in the movie? 

And a praise for Michael Crichton: I just came from reading Jeff Vandermeer's Area X trilogy. Vandermeer has a way of slowing down reading with heavy diction and over explainations (not disparaging though, I do really like his work). I was expecting a science based novel like Jurassic Park to be the same way, but it was in fact a breath of fresh air. I so often caught myself 50 pages farther than I had anticipated reading. Crichton organized his chapters based on location or character. A chapter called 'Control' will show us paragraphs about each person in the Control room. A chapter called 'Tim' will only show us everything Tim is experiencing and feeling. This structure lets us as readers get a full perspective of what is going on. I could picture the entire park while reading. Crichton also doesn't patronize his readers. He includes scientific information through a character explaining, or one easy to read paragraph. There is no bore-ya-to-death textbook writing. 

I read 9 books last year, and unfortunately, due to life circumstances, this is the first one I've finished this year. I think this one will stay with me for a little while, as I prepare to read Lord of the Rings for the first time as well.

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the comments, recommendations, and thoughts! I think I will try Andromeda Strain OR Lost World next, based on which one I can get my hands on. Some more thoughts I had: I can't, for the life of me, remember if book Tim or book Lex was the older child. Lex, after her trauma with the T-Rex, reverts to behaviors of a 5-6 year old. Book Lex doesn't know anything about computers! Book Lex says 'aminals'! Book Tim is very.. level headed. Intelligent. Calm in a crisis. Additionally, having seen the movie first, I pictured all the actors in their book roles. Jeff Goldblum for Ian Malcolm was PERFECT. Lex is a completely different character, so doesn't fit. Movie Hammond did a great job, but wouldn't be the right fit for Book Hammond. And on and on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mprzio/i_just_finished_jurassic_park_by_michael_crichton/,2021-04-13 01:17:36,1392,7276,books
cedw25,Pleasant surprise about The Godfather novel.,"(Spoilers)
It’s no secret that women are not treated well at all in Puzzo’s novel, none of them have an active role in the events of the story and get pretty shabby treatment by men, even Vito who cares so deeply about family, has no issue with his daughter having her wedding money taken and being beaten by her husband.

However there was something I found to be really positive and ahead of its time, and which I’m a bit disappointed they couldn’t work in to the film adaption. There was a character named Lucy Mancini, she had a relationship with Sonny and he was the first person she enjoyed sexually because of.... well a medical reason. Later she meets Jules Segal at Moe green’a hotel. Segal is a doctor who was disgraced for performing abortions, but the thing is he doesn’t regret doing those abortions and he’s not portrayed in a negative light at all (on the contrary, he goes out of his way to help Johnny Fontaine and a friend of his). So besides this subversive pro choice attitude, the novel even shows that Lucy deserves to enjoy sex and there’s nothing wrong with her having surgery if something about her body is preventing that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cedw25/pleasant_surprise_about_the_godfather_novel/,2019-07-17 14:53:15,7,1,books

The initial conversations with Tony Fontane and Amerigo Bonasera made me think that Despite being a completely respected person and despite being in such a high position, it feels like Don Corleone tries too hard to convince people that he can get the task done. He takes offense if people don't believe him. In some instances he almost comes across as petty.Is it probably because he respects family and friendship a lot?

Please no spoilers beyond the plot of the Don's daughter's wedding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h9bwbo/the_godfather_livereadposting/,2020-06-15 08:11:34,0,3,books
17l3e3w,"Growing up, I’ve kinda realized a lot of the Harry Potter characters are kinda shitty people","This isn’t even an attack on JK Rowling. It’s just looking back on it, there are a lot of deeply flawed characters in HP. And I’m mainly thinking of the adults.

Snape is the obvious one, even if he’s technically on the good side. But James Potter was also an arrogant bully, just a charismatic and intelligent one.

Lupin was my favorite DADA teacher and top 5 characters overall, but his struggles in the later books leading him to almost abandon his wife and child due to his insecurity really rubbed me the wrong way. Of course Harry knocked some sense into him, and he did go back and tend to his family, but it permanently left a bad taste in my mouth.

Sirius was cool as hell, and was a very loving uncle/godfather to Harry. But he also mistreated Kreacher which partly led to his demise. I guess the “norm” in the wizard world was that house elves were practically slaves so it was considered “normal behavior”, but his brother Regulus was able to overcome that pretty well.

Dumbledore’s the obvious big target. He knew that Harry was a Horcrux, but still led him on the whole way through. And the whole sending Harry back to the Dursleys thing, even if Lily’s charm only worked then, he still visited the Weasley’s just fine. And of course his past with his family and Grindewald and all. A LOT has been discussed around the big D, I won’t bring up everything else.

There are others, like the two wizard presidents, flawed in different ways. 

I’ll look past the main trio’s flaws, because a) they’re kids/teenagers, and b) it’s their story to come of age and mature after trials and tribulations, so they’re better flawed than to be Mary Sue and Gary Stu’s.

On the flip side, some of the supposed “evil” characters also have redeeming qualities. Narcissus Malfoy saved the plot due to her motherly love. Harry’s aunt, despite hating his guts due to her resentment towards Lily, still took him in. I already mentioned Regulus and Snape (the latter I still consider creepy, and he only worked for his personal motivations until the very end, never out of good or evil). 

Wormtail is an interesting one, because it’s less that he has a redeeming quality, more that his main character trait ended up becoming his character resolution, similar to the climax of Lord of The Rings which I will consider peak fiction (pun somewhat intended).

There’s the stable characters with no significant divergence: McGonagall was always cool, the Weasley parents were always loving and kind despite their quirks/somewhat overprotectiveness, Moody was the badass paranoid war vet. And the obvious bad guys like Lucius, Umbridge, and Bellatrix made it easy to hate them as villains.

I guess this post developed from “huh, some of the good guys were kinda assholes” into “People are not always black and white, the good have bads and the bads have good”, and I suppose that’s the takeaway.

Turning this around to JK Rowling, I guess this applies to her as well. Despite her views, she still managed to write a sensational series that’s forever ingrained into our culture, and that’s not an easy feat.

The Godfather and Jaws are some examples. The Social Network: an Oscar winning film made out of a sensationalist nonfiction book. Or even Ready Player One, which is a very middling Spielberg film adapted out of a book many people love to hate.

And there are even cases where the book and the movie are great in their own spheres, sometimes even contradicting themselves: The Shining, The Princess Bride, even Jurassic park.

3wpl40,Does The Godfather glorify the Mafia?,"First of all, I would like to say that people reading this should feel free to post their opinion of this discussion in the comments. However, keep in mind manners when posting or replying in the comments, this is a civil discussion. 

Second of all, let me clarify one thing in particular about the rules and my knowledge of the source material. As a rule, we are ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE GODFATHER, no other source material. We are not ranking Mafia literature and media as a whole. However, other source material is allowed if it is used in a COMPARITIVE SENSE (you are using the material to illustrate a point.) This material does not have to be a book. 

My knowledge about The Godfather is limited to the original source material, the novel by Mario Puzo. I have only watched the first movie. I prefer the book because it is my opinion that the source material is far superior than the movies in this case. (The movie was great though) However, it has been about 2 years since I last read the novel, and I have forgot a decent part of the book, so be forgiving about any factual errors. Just post information about the Book, although if the movie is the same thing, then feel free to post with that in mind as well. 

Now that that is over, let me explain my opinion. Alot of people call out the Godfather for glorifying the Mafia. The most popular reasoning behind this belief is that most people root for the Mafia in the novel. I don't believe that this is a valid point because who a person roots for is completely subjective, personal, and unwarranted. There is also inherent fallacy in this reasoning as well . There are 5 mafia families in New York. The Corleone family is the family that the book is based around. That does not make any of the other mafia families not important, and NO ONE roots for those mafia families. Instead, the mafia families are vilified, with the Corleone family only being painted as more moral at the BEGINNING. This means, in a mathematical sense, that the vast majority, 80% of the New York Mafia, is inherently evil. However, people can make the point that the Corleone family is appealing, and that is all what matters because they matter the most. This is a compelling reason, but it does not delve deeper into the novel. The Godfather does not just show corruption in the Mafia, it shows corruption in society as a whole. Showbuisness, the police, and the justice system are ALL CORRUPT CROOKS. And this obviously isn't in only New York, as seen in the gathering of all the Dons from other mafia's across the country. The Corleone family participates in this society, and has influence in all of the corrupt branches I have just listed. So, the Corleone family isn't as clean as people think, and we haven't even dealt with the majority of the novel. People may still say that even if the Corleone family isn't completely clean, they are still painted as the good guys. Well, this requires a analysis of what the Corleone family does at the beginning of the novel. The only illegal industries that the Corleone family deals with at the beginning of the book is Prostitution, and Gambling, both of which are legal in some part of the country. The Corleone family does not do this on such a large scale as ANY of the other families, and rejects the deal to distribute drugs from Solazzo. The only actual crimes that they do is intimidation, and assault, which happens mostly to OTHER CROOKS. So where is my point in this, you ask? The Corleone family is less of a MAFIA family at the beginning of the novel, and more of an actual business. They progress into illegitimacy later on. Now, the Godfather's most convincing point is the vilification of the traditional Don archetype. This person typically has a tyrannical attitude, and a god complex. Michael, the voice of reason, becomes this kind of person in the novel when he orders the execution of all enemy's of the Corleone family. In this way, he views himself as having control over who lives and who dies. This is what a true Mafia Don is all about, and what makes them despicable in the first place. The way that they pull strings alienates them from other humans. The original Don Corleone was famous for not doing this, and leaving this to divisions in his organization led by Tessio and Clemenza. However, the Corleone family becomes a ruthless, vicious organization during both Sonny and Michael's rule of the Mafia. For those who have seen the famous anime Death Note, two parallels can be made with Michael and Light Yagami, the protagonist of Death Note. Quickly, for those who do not know what Death Note is, I will write a two sentence description: Light Yagami is a incredibly intelligent Japanese boy who finds a empty notebook called the Death Note outside, dropped on purpose by a god of death called shingami. The ability of the notebook is to kill those who have their name written inside it's pages by a heart attack, and Light seeks to create a perfect world without crime by setting out on a moral crusade to kill all criminals, while running away from the police. Michael and Light are both similar in the fact that both have a god complex, and die alone. The significance of both characters dying alone is the symbolism that is drawn with their personalities. They pay the price of their brashness and arrogance by loosing all support, sending a message about the lack of morality in their actions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3wpl40/does_the_godfather_glorify_the_mafia/,2015-12-13 23:31:24,6,1,books

As *Snow Cras*h is signed, I believe that is the single rarest 1st/1st that I have, as only 600 hardcover 1st/1st copies were printed back in 1992, making it one of the smallest first print runs.

I've never finished a ~600 page book in 2 weeks before (NB: I'm posting this a week late cause I've been busy). Of course, that shows how much I enjoyed it, and that it had a lot of action throughout. Well nearly.

I really enjoyed the first third of the book, as in the first film (all three were from one book). The second third was good, but jumped about quite a lot. As for the third part? What a big snore! Okay, the gang-meeting was nice, and then the very end pay-off was too. But seriously, did I buy this to read about some arse of a doctor and his vaguely-mafia-related-piece-on-the-side? No. Nor did I want a sub-plot about some tw@ of a singer/film-star who happens to be pally with a mafia don. The book is great. But just too long! *So* many parts were unnecessary and didn't really help much, and could have been so much shorter, if not left out. But I still overall enjoyed it, very much in fact.

Now, it wouldn't be me if I didn't complain about the book's physical manifestation, and this review is no exception. Firstly, I loved the cover and it really stood out. it's the first time in a while people have asked me what I'm reading because they saw the book, and then I could talk to them about it because everyone and his mum seems to have seen the films. However, my edition had a problem where too much glue had been used so some pages ended up all creased when I turned them. As someone who folds their books over, this causes a big problem, as I can't re-break the spine when this happens and I have to hold it open for too long. But that didn't spoil the overall experience.

I must say Kathy Bates’ acting was on another level, but I enjoyed reading the book more since I am an avid reader.

mo7kke,I just finished Steven King’s Under the Dome and I’m at a complete loss for words.,"So recently, after years of never cracking a book, I’ve gotten back into reading fiction (starting with Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5). It took me a while to settle on a second book, and even though there are many books that may have been more important to the literary canon (Jurassic Park, The Godfather, Artemis Fowl etc), I had already seen those movies/shows so I figured I would pick something a little more out of my element. So a few weeks I made a point every night to read a few pages of Stephen King’s little-discussed *Under the Dome* and I am FURIOUS that it took me this long to give it a look.

I fell in love with everything about this book.  The prose is mature, but not stuffy.  It’s sentimental, but not melodramatic.  It’s funny, but it’s not cartoonish. I can go on an on.  The themes and motifs really resonated with me, especially in 2020/2021, given the overall state of, not just the United States, but the world.  The setting(s) were evocatively characterized.  No matter how harrowing, or how alien the locales seemed to be, King described them in such a way that quite figuratively transported me there.  The main character was richly written, and though this work was a piece of fiction, he really felt like a *real* person.  His motivations, his demons, his highs and his lows.  I could have easily believed that King was writing about a *real* person.  And the plot! I admit that it took me a while to fully comprehend what was going on, but that’s a testament to King’s ability to weave a complicated web that, by the end of the book, reveals itself to be a beautiful tapestry. I would be lying if I were to say I wasn’t emotionally affected by the end of it.

I know it’s not as sexy as some other books out there at the moment, and maybe it’s not as “classic” as something like Tom Sawyer, but I can genuinely say that *Under the Dome* isn’t just one of the best books I’ve read in the past 10 years, it’s one of the best STORIES I’ve read (or watched) in the past 10 years.  If you think it’s gonna be boring, or scary, or “lame” let me assure you that it’s anything but.  It’s endlessly quotable and searingly memorable, and quite possibly the best book you’ve never read (unless you have).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mo7kke/i_just_finished_steven_kings_under_the_dome_and/,2021-04-10 16:10:13,174,283,books

vr0ea4,What shocking moment made you put the book down for a while?,"For me, it was Apollonia's death in The Godfather. This was the first gangster book I ever read, and I was fascinated by the Corleone's dedication to loyalty. Sure, there were some brutal moments, but these were happening to bad people, in the end. After that, seeing Michael, the one family member who wanted no part of the criminal life, grow to fall in love with Apollonia was sweet, because she was a kind lady who did no wrong.

*And then she got caught in a car bombing in chapter 24.*

At first, it briefly flew over my head. But when I reread those words, I was speechless and momentarily stopped reading for a minute. This is coming from someone who read *all* Harry Potter books and didn't react to any of the shocking deaths and plot twists. But this waste of precious life reminded me that the life of a gangster is never a happy one, because it can hurt anyone even *remotely* associated with this.

19evb0g,I don't really like The Revenant so far.,"I stated before, to my friends, that the book was good but now I just don't really like it.

First of all, this book REALLY likes pushing into your face PRECISELY what the characters are thinking, their thoughts, their flaws, their history, literally everything about them. It's like Moby Dick but in Moby Dick that actually made sense. Here it just reads as the book desperately to shove everything along. I actually ended up skipping the entirety of John Fitzgeralds ""history"", only to reread it at a later date. 

Why?

It added fuckall. I just wanted to know what was going on in the current scene. If it was REALLY that important that me, the reader, needed to know that Fitzgerald stabbed a prostitute to death, then reveal it in dialogue slowly. Build his character. Instead it's just shoved in because OOOOH boy we gotta make Fitzgerald look like the absolute pinnacle of fucking evil, so let's say he stabbed his classmate with a pencil. Why did he do that? Fuck you, the author says.

The prose itself is dry, I'm sorry. This reads like one of my old classmates attempt at creative writing. It's just so overly descriptive at one point and so bland on another. It's not consistent AT ALL! But I will admit that I did just finish Suttree so my expectations were a bit too high. 

The only character I have joy reading is Fitzgerald. He's interesting, a dickhead, and the only character that does something DIFFERENT and is admittedly intelligent. The rest are so BLAND and uninteresting.

I will state I haven't finshed the book yet but I really hope it does something. I don't even care that much about Glass anymore.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33600.Shantaram) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

> ""It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.""  
>  
>So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. *Shantaram* is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.  
>  
>Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.  
>  
>As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.

I've read *The Force* and *Savages* and watched the Oliver Stone film adaptation of the latter, so I expected Winslow's style of prose, which pulls you into the action like a fast-moving bullet with its long stretches of one-sentence paragraphs that are entertaining in their sweep.

The book has some pretty dark and violent moments that can only reek of black comedy. From a cartel boss's wife's decapitated head and his children being dropped from a bridge into a river just to settle some kind of deal, to shootouts between rival cartels and factions of the New York Mafia, this is such a treat for bibliophiles who prefer the blood-soaked violence reminiscent of Tarantino.

9zr09b,"I'm Tom Santopietro, author of seven books including Why To Kill a Mockingbird Matters and The Sound of Music Story. I am also a longtime manager of Broadway shows. Ask Me Anything!"," 'm Tom Santopietro and I have two careers: I’m an author and I manage Broadway shows. I’m supposed to have had a third career- lawyer- but after graduating from law school I thought “This is definitely not for me” and headed to New York City to work on Broadway and write books. 

My books are all non-fiction and are all related to the entertainment industry. I’m very interested in performers, movies, and books that are not just loved, but are also so passionately embraced that men and women alike feel the need to re-watch these movies dozens of times, listen to the same recordings for months on end, and re-read favorite books repeatedly. Thus far I have written about Barbra Streisand (The Importance of Being Barbra), Doris Day (Considering Doris Day), Frank Sinatra (Sinatra in Hollywood), the trilogy of Godfather films (The Godfather Effect), The Sound of Music Story, the life story of singer Barbara Cook, and in my most recent book, Why To Kill a Mockingbird Matters. (My website-http://www.tomsantopietro.com has information about the books and two short videos I made about The Sound of Music and To Kill a Mockingbird.)

I wasn’t fully aware of it while writing my books, but it’s now clear to me that I have been writing about family:  The Godfather films, above all else, are about family- family as your protector and your sanctuary- and The Sound of Music is definitely about family, with Maria von Trapp as the ultimate mother figure, one who comforts with an all-encompassing embrace.  I joke that the Corleones and the von Trapps are both dedicated to family, but one family solves problems by singing show tunes, and the other by utilizing machine guns…

My most recent book, Why To Kill a Mockingbird Matters, is also about family- a single parent raising his children in depression era Alabama. The Finch family at the center of the classic novel- and the equally brilliant film- has been embraced by millions around the world to the extent that Mockingbird still sells an astonishing 750,000 copies per year. That fact led me to ask: 

What is it about Mockingbird that people love so much? I think it’s not only the beauty of the language but also because Atticus Finch is an aspirational figure- he represents the American we would all like to be or hope resides within us- a man of principal who will face down a crowd in his pursuit of what is right. In its loving but very clear eyed depiction of the confusing journey through adolescence, Mockingbird strikes a universal chord, and it is no accident that right before President Barack Obama left office, he spoke of Mockingbird’s timeless message: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” 

As for my non-writing life- I work as a manager of Broadway shows. I’ve always loved theatre and when I realized I wasn’t going to practice law (it seemed so dry to me that I would constantly daydream in class- not a recipe for a great legal career…)  I moved to New York to work on Broadway. I started at the bottom of the ladder- I was a “gofer”- as in “gofer coffee- gofer lunch” but over the years was able to work my way up to be a manager of many hit shows. It’s a fascinating world where a wildly disparate group of people come together to try and put on the best possible show. You’re a family- often dysfunctional!- but you’re all in it together. 

I’m a tennis fanatic and live in New York City, with all its crazy energy. When I graduated from law school  I thought I was moving to New York for a 3 week job- and I’ve now been here for 35 years. This is home. 

That’s me- and I hope you’ll ask questions- about books, about Broadway, about tennis, New York- anything. I love meeting new people, be it in person or online. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9zr09b/im_tom_santopietro_author_of_seven_books/,2018-11-23 19:01:57,25,14,books

3gd0od,How do I explain to a 14 year old that the book is better than the movie?,"The 14 year old is my little sister. This came up yesterday when we were watching 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. She was watching it in lieu of reading the book, which was assigned for summer reading. Granted, that is a good movie, and a fairly faithful adaptation (I think. It's been about 12 years since I read it.)

However, it's come up before with other books turned into movies such as Harry Potter. Her mentality is ""I'll just wait for the movie to come out.""

How do I convince her that reading the books is better than watching the movies? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the POSITIVE feedback! Just to clarify, I am not ""forcing"" her to do anything. I would like her to read books (YA, classics, whatever) instead of relying on movie adaptations. I am also not in any way suggesting that books are better than movies. They are two different mediums of expression. While certain movie adaptations are ""better"" than their source material (someone mentioned 'The Godfather' as a prime example), they are in no way a suitable substitute for the actual literature.

u1hmoy,What is the American Equivalent of War & Peace?,"I am about to finish reading Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurty and this to me feels like the closest thing to the American equivalent of War & Peace. Far fewer characters and a much simpler plot than War & Peace, but the story takes place in the old west, a defining time in American history, much like Napoleon’s invasion being a defining moment in Russian history. It definitely conveys thoughts and attitudes of that time as well, being far more psychological in nature than most western novels.

drf764,I very recently got over my reader's block after 6 years with a simple technique... Rereading the original source material of my favorite movie adapted from a novel.,"I was your typical bookworm during up till my senior secondary schooling days (equivalent to high school in the American education system). But as soon as I entered my college campus, the exposure to an all-new world put a definitive full-stop on a hobby which hitherto, I could not have imagined a life without. I had well and truly transformed into a cinephile within a few days and this new passion of mine, unfortunately, resulted in a reduced attention span. As a result, whenever I would pick up a new book to read, I would well and truly lose interest within 15 minutes. This was a problem which bugged me for the next 6 years, and I had entirely given up hope of ever being able to read an entire novel again. That is until I spotted an old, dilapidated copy of an epic novel in my bookshelf. This book also happened to be the source material of what I consider the greatest cinema committed to the silver screen. I'm talking about none other than the Mario Puzo classic, ""The Godfather"".

I had read the novel at a very young age and had really forgotten how good it was until I reread it years later. The fact that the movie was such a faithful adaptation of the original novel kind of eased me in. I found myself being able to read for hours straight. It also acted as a solid reminder of the fact that no other medium could layer a character as much as a novel. The characters I had loved from the film had even more depth in their textual avatar. The cherry on the top was that as soon as I finished reading the novel, I could feel that old hunger of reading more come rushing back. And since then, I have managed to read 2 more novels and an autobiography. 

""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.” 

This iconic line from Godfather III applies very well to my relationship with books. And you have no idea how happy I am that I did indeed get pulled back in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/drf764/i_very_recently_got_over_my_readers_block_after_6/,2019-11-04 09:17:50,1,10,books

14k01a,Is Fight Club worth reading for somebody who has seen the film many times?,"Perhaps an odd question, but I ask because part of the fun of reading a book after I've seen the film version many times is that the book is a much deeper experience (*Lord of the Rings* and to a lesser extent *The Godfather* both spring to mind) and is its own unique experience. I just sampled the first 2 chapters on my Kindle, and I have to say it feels like the film is just playing in my head, without a lot of added depth. The film seems almost *too* faithful.

Either way it seems like it would be a quick read, but I'm just wondering if I'd be more satisfied spending my time reading something that's completely new to me.

Any thoughts?

> Edit: Also, because it could be an interesting discussion, do other people here tend to feel the same way I do about reading the book after seeing the film?

> Edit #2: I decided to purchase the Kindle version (it was less than $8) and I read it in 3 days. I noticed a surprising amount of differences (ranging from the different ending to the subtle additions which I thought helped to clarify the plot as well as solidify the themes and the ""moral"" of the story) between the book and film versions, and I felt satisfied that I read it. If anybody finds this post via the search function and is wondering what I was once wondering, I'd recommend reading *Fight Club* even if you've seen the film dozens of times.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14k01a/is_fight_club_worth_reading_for_somebody_who_has/,2012-12-09 17:58:36,32,30,books

57qx3c,Should I finish the Southern Reach trilogy or leave Annihilation as a standalone book?,"First, I little about myself. I can appreciate open-ended stories and feel satisfied without knowing everything that can be known, so I don't feel a compulsion per se to finish a series just because there are more books. I can enjoy the first season of a tv show and never go back if I feel the story has been told.

I know the Southern Reach series has a lot of fans here, but I would like to discuss its strength as a trilogy. How do the three books compare as standalone pieces? Especially the second book, which I've read very polarizing opinions about. I've heard people compare it to Kafka's The Trial and that wasn't my cup of tea due to the subject matter (bureaucracy), despite liking Kafka. Is the third book a strong finish?

egut8x,"Lets talk about one of those other Dumas novels, in this case: The Black Tulip","The Black Tulip set in 1672-1673 in the Netherlands right before Johan the Witt, the Dutch Grand Pensionary, and his brother Cornelius de Witt are lynched by an angry mob (which takes place in the first couple chapters) for supposedly committing treason. This is an actual event from Dutch history, although decidedly not a celebrated event. The novel focuses on Cornelius de Witt's godson, Cornelius van Baerle, a tulip grower from Dordrecht. Van Baerle stays out of politics and focuses on creating a black tulip, the person who creates a black tulip will receive a reward of 100,000 florins (the equivalent of over $1 million today). Unfortunately, after his godfather's death van Baerle finds himself caught up in politics, just as he is extremely close to completing his quest of creating the elusive black tulip.

As opposed to some of his more well-known works, The Black Tulip is a relatively short novel by Dumas. Which causes the pace to be a bit higher and the story to be more streamlined, there are no side-plots to distract you from the main storyline. The story does very much focus on the concept of envy, revenge and cowardice and how crazy it can make some people act. That said, with the exception of one, all the characters in the book are either good and honorable or wicked and deceitful. There is very little moral ambiguity in the characters, which makes I think limits the reader's ability to connect with the characters. Overall though I thought it was a pretty entertaining book. If you have read it, what did you think of it?

If you want to read some Dumas, but don't want to commit to one of his longer works right away, I suggest checking this one out. You can find [a copy](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965) of it on [gutenburg.org](https://gutenburg.org).

eeu3kf,Movies made in to books? Do the movies disappoint you and leave that constant nagging feeling in the back of your head?,"I have watched many movies which were adapted from books. Absolutely loved some of them having not read the books yet (one flew over the cuckoo's nest, to kill a mocking bird, The Godfather etc). But, recently I read ""East Of Eden"" and ""Grapes Of Wrath"". After reading the books I have watched the movies and they did not impress me. I love Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, loved James Dean as Caleb Trask but major things are missing from both the motion pictures.

&#x200B;

Grapes Of Wrath (Movie) - it misses the heart-wrenching climax from the book. As the book's devotee, I was so expecting to see the same ending in the movie, but no, John Ford decided to end the movie on a different note. And the movie omits the Joads meeting the Wilsons enroute California.

East Of Eden (Movie) - it misses the main pillar of the story - Lee is not in the movie, that baffled me like crazy. Lee and Samuel are the East of Eden. I understand the omission of Samuel but why Lee? Lee was the vision of the family even when Adam was consciously blind to the environment around him and also when he was woke. Lee was the working horse that kept the machine called as Trask Family functioning. Also, the movie tries to portray Adam Trask, thanks to the popularity of Raymond Massey as a stern actor, as a stern, christian father where in the book Adam's character could anything be, but, stern and christian. Adam was the gentlest soul who was deeply hurt due to heartbreak and could never ever be back together as a whole. Credit goes to Steinbeck's writing that a reader would know the subtleties of Adam's love for his twins where Aron gets marginally more and more love than Caleb, time after time.

Do all these bother you? When creative minds like John Ford, Elia Kazan, James Dean, Raymond Massey (Adam Trask) etc try to bring their ingredients to the table and make a completely new dish out of the book, does it make you scream out of your lungs inside your head or you take it with a grain of salt and appreciate the amalgamation of two different art forms - literature and motion picture?

Also, the movies which you have watched which have already been books, are you scared now to go and read them for that experience will ruin your idea of the story imprinted in your mind via the movie?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eeu3kf/movies_made_in_to_books_do_the_movies_disappoint/,2019-12-24 01:35:30,14,0,books
8h86ob,The Top 25 Classic Books on Goodreads,"I've thought for a while that it's a shame Goodreads doesn't allow you to easily sort all books by rating.  I hoped that someone would scrape the data, which was done [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) for the thousand most rated books.  This data is from November 2017, and I've done some cleaning to create a list of the top 25 rated books that were tagged as ""classic"" by at least 500 people.  

I made some decisions about how to handle anthologies.  I allowed some for example Sherlock Holmes, but I left off Shakespeare's collected sonnets.  I also excluded books after 1990, since I'm not certain they can be designated classics yet.

is it a situation where most book readers have read these top ones already? maybe how you wouldn't recommend someone watch pulp fiction or godfather because they obviously have seen those top movies already, you'd go with a more personal recommendation.

i recently read lolita, don quixote, 1984, and the odyssey. loved them, some of the best books ive read. its kind of like with movies, why would you watch some random new film instead of working your way down the top 250 imdb list? now sure, just because its critically acclaimed and liked by many doesnt mean you will like it or have to like it, but you've got a better chance, with added value of enjoying any references and parodies of it, and discussing it more often because more people would have seen it.

i feel i was wasting my time on lesser books, which isnt the same with movies since its easy to watch a lot of movies, but hard to read lots of books since its a big time investment. so you want to make sure its good, so why not use a list of the best, and start from the top?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/338gh2/what_do_people_here_think_of_lists_like/,2015-04-20 14:09:42,5,7,books
4yl7s1,Did the long censorship of Henry Miller cost him his spot in the American literature pantheon?,"I'm a big Henry Miller fan, and I just finished reading Tropic of Capricorn. It is difficult to read it and not see parallels to the style of writing that would be brought into the mainstream by the Beats and more specifically Jack Kerouac a decade(ish) later. 

I am admittedly not a fan of Kerouac, and after being left cold by On The Road many years ago I simply assumed that stream of consciousness writing was not my thing. However, when I read Capricorn, I found it to be the apotheosis of this style and it absolutely worked for me. Kerouac is often given credit for pioneering this type of writing, so I couldn't understand why a book written in 1938 wasn't more frequently mentioned as the true godfather of this form (I am aware that Miller did not invent this style, and also that there are plenty of readers/scholars who do give him proper credit but I am speaking solely as to their place in the broader culture). Then I checked further into the copyright page and realized it wasn't published in America until 1961, well after the Beats had come to prominence. 

So how much did this delay play into how Miller is remembered? Obviously his books were smuggled into America, and maybe you could make the argument that the ban actually increased Miller's profile via his notoriety. Or maybe Kerouac was more easily accessible due to his work being less overtly vulgar? Certainly you'd never see either of the Tropics on a highschool reading list like you would On The Road (and even that is frequently banned). To me it is a shame that Miller is not seen as a more towering figure, and I think Lawrence Durrell summed the difference in their generations up quite well when he said in a letter to Miller 'They are turning the novel into a skating rink; I'm trying to turn it into a spiral staircase.'",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4yl7s1/did_the_long_censorship_of_henry_miller_cost_him/,2016-08-19 20:52:18,5,4,books
v3cgxz,"I spent the last 12 months in a remote wilderness lodge with no internet and cell service, and spent all my time reading. I did a ranking and mini-reviews of the 40ish books I read in that time","EDIT: Damn, wasn't expecting this to blow up! Thanks for all the encouraging words (and awards). Cell data comes and goes here so I'll be checking the thread here and there answering whenever I can. It's really nice to talk about this stuff though because I'm pretty much the only serious reader up here lol

A little background first: In early 2021 my life kind of fell apart very quickly. I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown.

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I really just wanted to isolate myself, lose myself in some good books, and recalibrate my mental state after all the shit that went down. The last 12-13 months have basically just been work, read and hike/camp among the beautiful northern landscapes the lodge was located in.

I managed to read close to 40 books in that timeframe, and I wanted to share my thoughts on them with the sub as reading, more than anything, helped me center myself and get some perspective on my life. I read across a variety of genres and have ranked them with a little mini-review below, from worst to best. I didn't do an overall ranking, but rather ranked the books I read within their specific genres/categories.

**Classics/Literary Fiction:**

8. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: Honestly, this book kind of irritated me in how transparent it was at being shamelessly emotionally manipulative. It was certainly very well-written, but I found Jude just unbelievably stupid as a character and after a certain point in the story, found myself losing any kind of empathy towards him. The rest of the characters are fairly non-descript. The book is kind of morbidly fun to see just how over the top the misery porn can get though, but I hesitate to actually call it “good”

7. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway: I’m starting to think that Hemingway might just not be for me. I’ve read The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises previously, and found them “just okay”. That was my prevailing sentiment towards AFtA as well. I do like Hemingway’s terse, succinct style, but in this one, I felt it actually kind of worked against him because it makes both the war setting and central relationship feel a bit flat. But the worse thing about the book is the character of Catherine. Jesus christ, she is annoying. Just an insipid, silly character. I did like the downbeat, depressing ending though

6. A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this book throughout the first couple hundred pages. It’s dense, slow and filled with a shit ton of what fills like unimportant minutiae. But it eventually comes together, and the slow buildup really manages to create an epic scope and magnitude that are unlike anything else I’ve read from old Charles. It’s a story that demands concentration and attention, and by the final, powerful third act, it’s well worth it.

5. East of Eden by John Steinbeck: An epic, multi-generational family saga, East of Eden is a work that for me works masterfully on both an epic and an personal scale. It’s hard to encompass everything this story does so well in a short review. It’s both a biblical, mythical retelling as well as an intimate character study punctuated with some best-in-class writing. It makes the Salinas Valley into a living, breathing entity of its own, with these macro and micro tales of good and evil spanning its expanse. Also, fuck Cathy Ames. All my homies hate Cathy Ames

4. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: This is my first encounter with Woolf, and it solidified for me that I will be coming back to her body of work multiple times. It was definitely a bit of a struggle getting into it, as you’re jusyt thrown into the deep end with Woolf’s abstract prose and stream of consciousness style. But once you grab hold of what Woolf is trying to do, it becomes a beautifully melancholic story with a pastoral feel that nonetheless manages to really capture a huge gamut of human emotions and perspectives

3. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: Horrifically beautiful. It’s fairly challenging to start, but once you start vibing with McCarthy’s style and writing, the narrative just completely immerses you into it. It’s like a surreal, fever-dream, gruesomely violent vision of the Wild West with gorgeous depictions of the landscape, brilliantly written dialogue and prose that begs to be read over and over, and the most unforgettable villain I’ve come across in literature. This is a novel I can see myself going back to time and time again

2. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I was flip-flopping between this one and Middlemarch as the #1 book in the classics/literature category but it’s very close. This book is, on the surface, “just” a murder-mystery but in actuality is a dense, complex philosophical exploration of various facets of life. This is a masterpiece of character development as we see ideas of free will, morality and family told through multiple different lenses. It’s also a bit of a treatise on religion and the meaning of faith. In short, it’s a *lot* and there’s probably a ton that I didn’t even get in one read-through. Nevertheless, it’s an epic tale that I found both illuminating and entertaining

1. Middlemarch by George Eliot: A wonderful, atmospheric slow burn, and might be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Honestly probably in my top 5 of all time. I found it to be such an all-encompassing look at the things that make us human, and feels both incredibly personal and universal at the same time (kind of like East of Eden). It’s a story about marriage (hit me particularly close to hom) and about sacrifice, with masterfully sketched characters and an exploration of life in era to the minutest details. “Immersive” is a word that gets thrown around a lot for books but that’s what Middlemarch truly is – a totally lived in feeling of a small, nowhere English town a couple of hundred years ago. I found it unforgettable

**Historical Fiction:**

5. Shogun by James Clavell: This is a huge, huge novel, both in its page count, as well as the scope of the story and the characters. Historically speaking, it did seem a little mythologized and perhaps overly romanticizing of the whole samurai/warrior culture, and the main protagonist is a bit of a bland nothing white male fantasy. Clavell’s prose is also merely workmanlike. But as an entertaining story, it fares much better, and is actually very well-paced for something that’s almost 1200 pages.

4. Hawaii by James Michener: This is my first book written by Michener, and I can see why he came to be seen as the godfather of historical fiction. This, like Shogun, is an absolute unit of a book, and although it’s plenty flawed, I came away from it with something close to awe just based on the sheer scope of the timeframe that Michener captures here. the formation of Hawaii in the first chapter is some of the best storytelling I read in the past year. However, this is a book that gets progressively less interesting as it goes and moves into the “present” time, and the characters are little more than pawns. Still recommended though especially if you find Hawaii interesting

3. Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel: Once I figured out that everytime this book uses “he” (which is a LOT), it’s almost always referring to the main character Thomas Cromwell, I started to enjoy it a lot more. It’s really eloquently written and Cromwell is a brilliantly developed character. It’s a story that requires a lot of focus but to me it eventually paid off, and the narrative really carries you along once you get used to Mantel’s idiosyncrasies.

2. I, Claudius by Robert Graves: well-written, funny and hugely informative. Really a slow burn character study of the eponymous Claudius, and the compulsively entertaining look at the back-door dealings and family conflicts of that era in Rome. I thought it also did a pretty great job at exploring the thirst of power and the excesses certain people are willing to go to achieve it. Just a great, multifaceted read overall.

1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry: This book is seriously a contender for one of my top 10 favourites of all time. To begin with, the two main protagonists are just incredibly written and developed, and the attachment you have towards them carries you through to the monumental length of the narrative. It’s an emotionally powerful story with an excellent main plot and smaller side stories that are all great in their own right. Just a truly epic tale told by a master storyteller

**Science Fiction:**

6. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline: I imagine I would have probably liked this book if I was still in high school, crammed as it is full of video game power fantasies and endless pop culture references. But good god, actually reading it as an adult was a painful experience. Other than being a compendium of 80s homages, it fails spectacularly on almost every level. Bad writing, bad characters, tedious, dull storytelling. It’s frankly just awful

5. Foundation by Isaac Asimov: Look, I know this is a foundational (hehe) “canon” text in the sf genre, but I just found it to have too many issues to truly enjoy. The concepts and ideas are great – eye-opening and fascinating – but for me, the book fell flat in almost every other area. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, the writing style is about as wooden as it gets, and the book is very much of its time (i.e. dated af) when it comes to women. Really, this is just a collection of scenes with characters sitting in rooms and talking. Dynamic storytelling it is not, despite the interesting concepts

4. Dune by Frank Herbert: I don’t know if this will be unpopular or not, but I honestly thought Dune was just…ok. I watched and loved the movie, and decided to jump into the book afterwards. While I do appreciate the worldbuilding that went into it – as well as the often weird, surreal 60s drugged-out atmosphere – as a piece of storytelling I feel like Dune has been improved upon over the years. I still respected it as a forerunner of so many different kinds of sff stories we have these days, but taken on its own merits I found it to be interesting but rather turgid on the whole

3. Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: I can’t imagine a more definitive fictional story about Mars than this one. The amount of thoughtful research and extrapolation of science, technology, politics and society that has gone into this novel is simply phenomenal. It honest to god at times reads like an instruction manual for the first Mars colonists, whenever we end up getting there. That does work to the novel’s detriment at times though, as it can feel a bit dry and overly technical at parts. But I still found it to be a grand, immersive read, and the somewhat boring parts were more than compensated for by the overall sweep of the story and the author’s incredible vision of a Martian future for humanity

2. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin: Complex, thoughtful and human. This isn’t the first Le Guin book that will appear on this list either. This book is the best depiction of a realistic utopia I’ve ever seen in fiction, and it does what the best sf does and presents a fascinating “what-if” look at a cool concept. Unlike a lot of sf, it succeeds hugely in two other areas. The first is creating a fully-realized central character – Shevek is an awesome protagonist with a lot of depth and nuance. The second is Le Guin’s inimitable prose, which is elegant and beautiful while still somehow managing to be simple and concise

1.Hyperion by Dan Simmons: This might be the best sf novel I’ve ever read. It’s the rare sf story (imo) that is both excellent from both a literary and “entertainment” perspective. It’s just crammed full of cool ideas and concepts, and I loved the Canterbury Tales-esque structure, which leads to the book’s greatest asset – the characters. I found each “pilgrim” to be fascinating and well-developed, and their respective stories were beautifully told, ranging from thrilling, scary, funny to downright haunting and tragic. The Priest’s Tale and the Scholar’s Tale have both been etched in my mind since I read them. This book is an incredible achievement and to me a high-water mark for the speculative fiction genre

**Horror:**

5. The Troop by Nick Cutter: Not much to say about this one. It’s a pulpy, B-movie-esque story without much in the way of characterization, prose or depth. But it does disgusting body horror better than almost any other horror novel I’ve ever read. Some of the scenes are downright grotesque and repulsive, and I have a high tolerance for that kind of stuff. It’s a quick, easy read and but not particularly memorable outside of the gross-out factor

4. The Elementals by Michael McDowell: A fun, atmospheric and really well written Southern Gothic horror story. This book is akin to Haunting of Hill House in that it deals in subtlety and a sense of creeping doom. It’s a definitely slow burn but that really helps it in building a stifling sense of gloom and dread. The characters are fascinating and it really is very well-written. Highly recommended if you like horror novels focused more on atmosphere than gore/jump scares

3. The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories/The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories by HP Lovecraft: I’m combining these two collections into one as they’re essentially just one big compendium. After reading these, I’ve become a huge Lovecraft fan. I’m aware of his racism and xenophobia but I believe in separating the art from the artist to a certain degree. Anyway, I thought these stories were mostly pretty awesome. I actually love Lovecraft’s verbose, overwrought prose – it really gives the stories a certain level of operatic, melodramatic ambiance. Some of the Dunsany-inspired stories are downright gorgeous. The mythos is fascinating and in the best stories – At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Colour out of Space etc. – he reaches a kind of dark, horrific grandeur. Reading these in the remote northern landscape was truly a fantastic experience

2. The Books of Blood by Clive Barker: Dark, horrific, visceral, erotic – this is an incredible collection of horror short stories. Barker is a hell of a writer – a few levels above most in this genre, and he has a uniquely twisted and dark imagination obsessed with the human body, and in particular, sexuality, and how the body can be a battleground of all sorts of horrors, physical or otherwise. Some of them also have a dreamlike, surreal feel to them. In particular, I was blown away by “In the Hills, the Cities” – it’s a story unlike any I’ve ever read before, mind-boggling, bizarre and haunting. Also of note are “The Midnight Meat Train”, “Rawhide Rex” and “Dread”, but honestly they are all pretty damn great even at their weakest

1.The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson: The amazing show led me to the book, and although the source material is almost completely different other than sharing some names with the characters from the show, it’s an incredible story in its own right. Jackson’s prose is probably the best I’ve come across in this genre, and her ability to create atmosphere and mood is without peer. The setting just feels alive in all its creepy, gothic glory. It’s a fairly small, intimate story but a very powerful, often gut-wrenching one in how it captures the main character’s very human flaws and insecurities. In the end, it leaves us pondering about what’s more terrifying – a seemingly haunted house full of ghosts or the doubts and self-loathing in our own hearts?

**Non-Fiction:**

5. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari: Yeah…I wasn’t really feeling this one. I understand why it’s popular and it did start off very well. But the vast majority of the book is just too full of speculation and the author’s own musings without much in the way of concrete evidence. I also found his mythologizing of hunting and gathering and seeming dislike of the agricultural revolution strange and misguided. The whole book just felt a mile wide and inch deep. Superficial, surface-level exploration without any true insight or in-depth analysis of a complex topic

4. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain: Wow, if ever there was a non-fiction book tailor-made for Reddit, this is it lol. I have to admit, this book did come to me at the perfect time, as I was in a pretty closed-off, solitary mood after making my big move. I liked it well enough, and the insight into analyzing introvert behaviour was fairly interesting. But honestly, for the most part, this book just felt like it was preaching to the choir, about how awesome and helpful introversion is. It tends to conflate a lot of psychological aspects and concepts with a generalized sweep without really delving deep into them. Ultimately, it really feels like a narrative that’s just self-affirmation for introverts. Which I guess is not all bad

3. The Ancestor’s Tale by Richard Dawkins: I’ve always been a huge fan of Dawkins and evolutionary science in general, and this book to me, is his masterwork. It’s painstakingly detailed look at 4 billion years of evolution through certain ancestors that’s structured like the Canterbury Tales. It’s a little different from Dawkins’ other books in that it’s a bit more technical and maybe not as friendly to the layperson – and also missing his trademark snark and cynicism (whether that’s a good thing is up to the read). But it’s incredibly enlightening and informative, and even eye-opening.

2. The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg: If you have any interest in astronomy and cosmology at all, then this book is a must-read. It’s fairly old, written near the end of the 70s, but aside from missing the discovery of dark matter, it’s still very much relevant and probably the best encapsulation of the big bang and the beginning of our universe you can find. It straddles the line perfectly between being appropriate for a casual reader and someone more academic

1. Endurance by Alfred Lansing: Boy did I pick the perfect book to read while living in a cold, remote landscape. Endurance is without a doubt one of the most thrilling, intense stories of survival I’ve ever read. You come away with awe and respect at not only the courage, determination and perseverance of these men, but also at the sheer unfeeling power of nature itself. Some of the events and twists are so crazy that it feels like the contrivances of a Hollywood director – in the best way possible. Lansing captures everything with some truly mind-boggling amount of research from primary sources, and creates an incredibly entertaining – and scary - narrative

**Fantasy:**

6. The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan: This was the only DNF book for me out of my entire list. I had read Eye of the World and The Great Hunt before, and I did a quick summary read-through of those two books to catch me up on the third book. I remember finding the first two books flawed even when reading them as a teenager but tried to give the series another shot. It’s a no go, to be honest. I just can’t over how weirdly juvenile and archaic all the characters and their interactions are. It borders on being cringeworthy and Jordan’s understanding and writing of female characters is just baffling. The plot just seems like more of the same. Bad guy of the week needs to be stopped by motley crew of magically powered teenagers. I’m calling it quits on Wheel of Time for good

5. Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson: I read the first book of Stormlight a few years back and thought it was alright. Have seen rave reviews of WoR and decided to give it a shot and honestly came away really underwhelmed. There are some cool ideas for worldbuilding here but I don’t really find Sanderson to be a good writer at all. Aside from the wooden prose, the characters just come off as shallow, fantasy archetypes and the plot is both convoluted and nonsensical at the same time. Too much time is spent on explaining how powers and magic works – which I also found to be an issue with the first book. I can see the appeal of these books for younger readers as they basically are like spectacle-filled action movies, but they are not for me

4. Red Rising/Golden Sun by Pierce Brown: I read these back to back because they’re fairly quick, easy reads. These are essentially mindless action movies in book form and they were a pretty nice change of pace as I needed something lighter after Wolf Hall. The character is a total Gary Stu, the dialogue is ridiculous and the story is crazy over the top. But yeah, it’s pretty fun, can’t deny that

3. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susannah Clarke: Man, this book might have taken me the longest out of everything I read in the past year, and there were times when I was contemplating dropping it. I’m glad I persevered though because I eventually came to love it. It’s essentially a Victorian novel, written in that era’s style with almost scary accuracy, and a fantasy novel-of-manners. Once you get on its wavelength, you start to appreciate the writing and the beautifully immersive world with some fascinating characters. The footnotes are amazing and the slow burn really helps create a wonderful atmosphere that carries you through to the end

2. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin: Man, Le Guin is on her way to becoming one of my favourite authors. This little book is beautiful and punches far above its weight in terms of ratio of size to content. It’s a small little thing, especially compared to a lot of the bloated doorstoppers common to the genre but for me, it contained more emotion and wisdom than 10 Jordans or Sandersons. Written in Le Guin’s clear yet elegant prose, it has a fairy-tale-esque melancholy atmosphere, as if it’s a story you’re being told in front of a fireplace by your grandfather or something. It’s a story of self-discovery and learning to accept the dark parts of yourself, all brilliantly written. Will be continuing with the rest of the series eventually

1. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe: Preface – I only read Shadow and Claw so far but holy shit. What a book. Mysterious, mystical, weird, beautiful and often frustrating – BotNS is unlike any fantasy I’ve ever read. It probably has the most gorgeous prose I’ve ever come across in the genre, and the usage of allegory and metaphor was really well done. The strange, dreamlike, almost surreal ambiance is what really stood out to me, and despite the obfuscations of the plot and the language, this still makes the book easy to get lost in

That’s it for my reviews/analysis! Let me know what you guys think of these books. I’m in the process of going through another batch of stories and may post another review thread in a year or so lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v3cgxz/i_spent_the_last_12_months_in_a_remote_wilderness/,2022-06-02 16:14:23,668,12848,books
pebsqw,The Count of Monte Cristo - Conflicted about the Ending (SPOILERS),"I'm feeling very conflicted about the ending to this book. While I thoroughly enjoyed, I can't help feeling the Count is somewhat evil or ambivalent rather than good. I also felt what happened with Mercedes was really tragic, and that she suffered needlessly and I felt unfairly. After all both her and the Count had feelings for each other, wouldn't it make more sense for them to end up together, since she never really loved Fernand anyway? 

How did Mercedes fate at the end make sense? Was it fair? Was it unfair? Did how the Count treated her and his feelings towards her match up? Did the way she felt towards him and her actions towards him match up? 

I recently finished listening to an audiobook of the Count of Monte Cristo, originally going into it after watching the movie with the mind that the retribution and revenge that Edmond would exact on his former friends would be fully justified, and that The Count would end up somewhat good at the end.

Couldn't have been further from the truth. If anything I'd go so far as to say that the book differs greatly from the movie on one point particularly. That the Count of Monte Cristo, is far more of a cold cruel and calculating character not often moved by things of the heart, except perhaps when it comes to Mercedes and sparing Albert, but considering the fact that the majority of the book he spends with her son as his best friend I think perhaps shows he did not entirely intend to fight or kill Albert.

I feel that in the book the Count has a fair amount of machismo, making his character equal in braveura to characters like the Godfather, whereas in the movie he's seen more as an avenging angel Christian character which perhaps is what he thought of himself, though in all actuality he was more like a gangster, or tyrant.

I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't help wondering whether or not his revenge on Villefort was entirely moral by the end, and what happened with Mercedes truly left me heartbroken. Most especially when she was looking off at the ocean after her son, still calling the name of the man who never returned to her, except as a phantom bringing death and despair.

Somehow I feel it would've been better, far better if the two of them had ended up together by the end.  I can't fault Mercedes 100% on what happened to her. I think after losing Edmond she must have felt her life was worthless and what would be the point to turning away Fernands advances when now the man she loved was dead, what purpose was there in continuing on when the life she had wanted had been stolen from, and perhaps she was correct in saying that she had been somewhat cowardly, but I know very few women who after losing the man they truly love in such a tragic and violent way would be capable of withstanding such grief and still keep their heads.

I think her choice to marry Fernand was more out of desperation and surrendering to the cruelty of the world than out of any sort of affection for him.

So my question is, wouldn't it have made more sense for them to be together. After all I think it's very obvious to the Count that she still loves him, at that moment in the garden when the two of them were walking together. And if her husband killed himself it can't be entirely blamed on the Count. I can't help but feel that if the Count chose to take Mercedes for himself he could have done so easily, and that she would have willingly run away with him.

I felt that her fate at the end was undeserved, and I think in the process of him visiting revenge on Fernand that Mercedes was collateral damage.

Personally, it would have made just as much sense to me if the two of them had ended up together, and I can't see a reason why they wouldn't except so that Haydee could have someone to be with by the end.

I've tried to explain it logically, in the sense that perhaps there was some amount of guilt in her heart of what happened to her husband and that made it impossible for her to forgive the Count... but really I feel its a little bit of an excuse, or that perhaps they could've ended up together some other way.

The way the book ends on that note is just so tragic and I can seem to reconcile it with myself. Also what happens to Villefort, though much of it is done by the hand of his murderous wife.

I don't know, the whole thing just leaves me unsettled, and part of me can't see why it could've ended well and been just as realistic while still having a good ending. I thought that the tie in with him and Haydee was a bit weak and the result of bad writing, or trying to tie up the plot in a way that gave her character a good ending.

I can't help feeling that the original intention of Dumas was to have these two end up together.

I suppose it was just too much for me really that seen of her watching the ship sail away really broke my heart.

Any thoughts or contributions to this would be appreciated. If anyone could explain a logical reason for the book to end the way it does, please do. Or at least make the ending Mercedes suffer seem fair to me, right now I can't help feeling broken about it and feeling that Mercedes deserved none of the tortures she suffered, and perhaps she suffered as much as the Counts enemies without him realizing it, which I don't think was his intention.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pebsqw/the_count_of_monte_cristo_conflicted_about_the/,2021-08-30 05:31:14,27,25,books
xmbk2j,‘Where the crawdads sing’ by Delia Owens – Book vs. Movie,"  

Every quarter that the book has stayed in the NYT best seller list, I have tried to read this book at least once but couldn’t get past initial couple of chapters. But then I came across this advertisement for $3 per ticket for National Cinema Day on September 3rd and the only name that I knew among the listed movies in my local theatre was ‘Where the crawdads sing’. I had some time to spend and I thought it might be interesting to read the book before I watch the movie. And that’s what I did, I completed the book in two days and watched the movie on the day I completed the book. And I must say the experience was truly awesome!

Let me get one thing straight – it was an okey-ish book (6/10) and a mediocre (5/10) movie. And this post is neither about the book nor about the movie but the contrast that I was able to experience between both media.

As I read the book, I had firmed up my imagery about the lead characters’ appearance, their residences, living conditions, the marsh, the swamp, gas station, shops, roads, court, and all that. And as someone who has never been in the area and is not old enough to have seen similar shops or towns, I had no clue how any of this looked like in real life. So, all my imagery was just dreamt up based on the best of my imagination. And when I watched the movie, I was in for a surprise!

**Characters**

The book is clear about the social strata of all the characters and their wealth. It was also clear about how this was reflected in their appearances and dressing sense. Lead character and her family (except for her mom) was portrayed as ‘dirty’ in the book (or so I perceived). But the movie gave them costumes which reflected their wealth status but was still not ‘dirty’. When you wear old handed down cloths, they may look old but not necessarily dirty. 

Another aspect is that movie must assign characters to actors and thus leaving nothing for imagination when it comes to the appearance. This in a way is a good thing because when I read the book, I had a detailed imagination for their clothing, physique, hairstyle etc., but I did not have any faces assigned. First thing that the movie does is to assign faces. If you watch the movie without reading the book, then may be the faces do not come with any pre-assigned emotions. But if you have read the book, then you feel like you know them and you already love or hate them. Then when you meet the characters, you almost feel like saying, “Hi Kya, how are you?” or “Dude, good thing that you are gonna be dead soon”. Also it was interesting to observe how some faces were totally way out of my imagination. 

**Dialogues and conversations**

A considerable part of the book is about the lead character’s thoughts and other conversations. Book can literally be unlimited in its resources to express these, whereas Movie is limited in time and ways to ‘show’ the ‘thoughts’. So, book won in this regard with its ability to let the reader know about the thoughts. And in particular, I felt the movie left out a lot of significant conversations. May be that is where my take on the book is differing from that of the Director/Screenwriter.

**Scenery/Geography**

This is where the movie wins hands down! As I said in the beginning, I have no idea how these marsh or swamp or anything related looked like. I did not know how big a ‘shack’ can be or how it can have water around it and still can have car access. I was thinking of extremely constrained and dingy spaces where it was not possible to have the idea of ‘rooms’. I was way off in imagining how trees, grass, shrubs and water can all be one place. But the movie was an eye opener. The way it has portrayed the whole geography, it was a treat as someone who has never been to anywhere close to all that. I think we are wrong when we say imagination is unlimited (or may be it is just for me). What I could ‘imagine’ about how all the water, marsh, swamp, roads and the ocean was very restrictive without having any past experiences. But the movie just shows it in front of us. Another aspect is the roads/buildings in general infra structure. The moment I hear the years 50’s and 60’s, I imagine them just a cut above the towns portrayed in Clint Eastwood movies. Paved roads instead of dusty roads and motor vehicles instead of horses. But 50’s and 60’s are way closer to our period than to the period of ‘The good/bad/ugly’. (Mental note to self: That movie might have been made in the sixties but it didn’t show the sixties.). There were nicer buildings, running water, electricity and good roads. Of course, ‘visual’ is the strength of the Cinema as a medium and it truly lived up to that.

**Emotions**

This dimension is really interesting! Movie media won in showing the facial expressions, intensity and the physical reactions. It is kind of obvious but the non-verbal expressions are the forte of a visual medium. But the written text is capable of detailing the nuances about what goes ‘within’. If the visual can show *how* a person gets angry, the text wins over in explaining *why* the person is angry. 

In short, I was able to experience the strengths and weaknesses of both media – cinema and novel – by going through this. I don’t think I will recommend either this book or this movie as a standalone experience to anyone but I think if you have the time and inkling, undertaking a project to watch the movie immediately after reading the book is a good idea (Or vice versa. But in that case you already have the imagery and faces to have some prejudice). Godfather was the most notable movie adaptations that I have come across earlier but it is one heavy book and three pretty long movies. So when you pick, I suggest something of a quick read and one single movie.

**TL/DR:** Watched the movie adaptation on the same day I finished the book and it helped me contrasting the take of both media on the same underlying content.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xmbk2j/where_the_crawdads_sing_by_delia_owens_book_vs/,2022-09-23 22:39:47,5,4,books
858r80,I just finished the Harry Potter series for the first time,"Wow. What a journey.

My mother bought me book one when I was around 10 years old. I read the first couple of chapters but for some reason was determined that it wasn't for me. Now, I am an avid reader and I enjoy fantasy mostly (Douglas Adams is my favourite author). My girlfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan and we agreed to make a deal: I would read Harry Potter and she would read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I couldn't be happier to have agreed to this arrangement. I started reading the first book on Christmas eve, and I finished the last book today. I finished the series in just under 3 months (this statement is not meant to be boastful, this is just a testament to how addictive these books are). I want to take a few moments to point out some of my favourite moments of the series. 

Prisoner of Azkaban: I absolutely loved the suspenseful ending of this book. In each book, Rowling did a fantastic job to keep you guessing all the way to the end, but the last seventy pages of this book was when I fell in love with the series. Not only is Sirius Black on our side, but he is Harry's godfather!? The way the time-turner was described was very satisfying and everything just worked out perfectly. 

Goblet of Fire: The Quidditch cup and the Triwizard Tournament are both, of course, immensely entertaining. Again the ending and Harry's dual with Voldemort was brilliant. 

I may anger some people here but I will simply say of The Order of The Phoenix and The Half Blood Prince that it was very interesting to learn more about the intricacies of the story. To learn about Tom Riddle's life and his rise to power, and of Dumbledore and their relationship was important to set up the last book. 

The Deathly Hallows: Oh man, what a finally. This was definitely my favourite of the series. I just finished it today so it is still fresh. What an incredible ending. To all of you who read these books as they were released, I can't imagine having to wait for the last book. I also can't imagine the pressure Rowling must have felt to deliver. To say that she did not disappoint is an understatement. 

Nearly the entire book is a roller coaster. Harry, Ron and Hermione's struggle to find the Horcruxes. The ongoing doubt in Dumbledore. I never lost faith and I was surprised that Harry did! They successfully break into the ministry and steal Slytherin's necklace from Umbridge! Ron leaves.. Harry and Hermione barely escape Godric's Hollow.. They are reunited with Ron and find the Sword of Gryffindor! (one of my favourite lines: 'That makes me sound alot cooler than it really was,' Ron mumbled. 'Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,' said Harry. 'I've been tryting to tell you that for years.') But who cast the Doe patronus? They escape from Lovegood's! They are caught and brought to Malfoy Mannor and escape with the brilliant help of Dobby who is tragically killed. They break into Gringotts, find Hufflepuff's cup and fly out of the bank on the back of a dragon, but without the sword! How will they destroy the rest of the Horcruxes? They are saved by Aberforth and enter Hogwarts. 

The last few chapters are gold. 

The Battle of Hogwarts. Harry saves Malfoy and Goyle AND is still able to claim the lost Diadem.

The entire series you aren't sure about Snape, but then he kills Dumbledore at the end of book six and the jury is out. Snape was serving Voldemort all along, Dumbledore was wrong and should have listened to Harry. The chapter 'Snape's tale' was incredible. Dumbledore was right, and he had the sense to sacrifice himself for the greater good. His foresight and wisdom was incredible to keep Snape in Voldemort's good books but also at the Head of Hogwarts. You really feel for Severus, for his sacrifice. He was such a crucial part of Dumbledore's plan. 

Harry is a horcrux! Of course! Rowling gives clues throughout the series, for example in the chapter 'Bathilda's Secret'. I hadn't guessed that he was a horcrux but I had a feeling that they were more deeply connected when I read: 'And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedbroom [...] and he screamed with rage [...] and his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain ...' 

When Harry is walking toward the forest, to his (presumed) death and he passes Ginny without stopping, you can feel his plight. If you didn't cry when he uses the Resurrection Stone to conjured his parent's, Lupin and Sirius.. you might want to see a doctor. 

Then to top it all off, you finally get to see how badass Mrs. Weasley is! Defeating Bellatrix one on one and calling her a bitch! Perfect. 

Was also nice to see that, (surprise surprise) Harry and Ginny, and Hermione and Ron end up together. What a perfect ending to an amazing series. 

If you made it this far, thanks! Please comment if you want to chat about your favourite aspects of the series. 

TLDR; This series was amazing, I should have read it sooner. Book seven was an incredible ending. Bravo Rowling.

3yo426,At the end of 2014 I sold my car and started using the public transportation.

5gu3eb,List of Books Most Mentioned as Highly Influential by Redditors in the recent Megathread,"TLDR: I spent too much time yesterday reading a Reddit post so I made a list.

According to the [the recent mega thread by u/Fonzie401] (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5gfq2f/catcher_in_the_rye_aided_in_my_transition_to/) 
asking what books had a lasting impact on your life, I have attempted to read every single comment (as of yesterday evening) to determine
what books were most mentioned as having had an impact on Redditors' lives.  Because this post made it all the way to the Front Page, it seemed like a great opportunity
to see what books were most impactful on the Redditor community as a whole.  In doing my tally, I included all ""me too"" comments in the tally where it looked like the Redditor 
was also affected by the book in a life-changing way, but excluded from the tally mere statements of agreement that the book mentioned was ""really great!""
Forgive me if I missed one or two or if my tally is slightly off.  I did make a threshold of 2 Redditors claiming the book to have been life-changing to be included below.  
Also,  I tried to be methodical, but may have missed a few.  I'm sure someone could write a computer
program to do what I just did for purely statistical mentions of books, but I read each comment analytically since some mentioned a book as NOT being 
impactful.  So, without further ado, I present to you the non-scientific, non-comprehensive, but hopefully enlightening list of the books that have been most life-changing to your fellow Redditor community:

1ij3w2,True-Crime: A Comprehensive Introduction to The Genre [OC],"Hello all!  In honor of r/books becoming a default sub, I thought I would make my first contribution.  I am an avid reader, and my favorite genre, by far, is True-Crime.  My hope in this post is to make it yours as well!  


I discovered my love for True-Crime at a very pivotal point in my reading career.  My taste was always evolving: I got into reading via coming of age novels, moved on to nihilistic and existential works, had a brief foray into science-fiction, then moved on to The Greats because of my Literature classes in college—with some occasional pop-fiction to break up the monotony of old-school literature.  


But I was getting bored.  I had sucked the marrow out of fiction, and found myself wondering aimlessly around Barnes and Nobel one afternoon, looking for something new.  I eventually stumbled upon Columbine by Dave Cullen.  I thumbed through the pages and thought it sounded interesting.  After a slight internal debate, I decided to buy it.  It was a hard back—a true impulse buy—as I usually shop at Half Priced Books.  It had just come out and was actually on the New Release shelf—I wasn't even purposely browsing True-Crime... or non-fiction, for that matter.  

Little did I know this spur of the moment buy would send me down the rabbit hole and ultimately change my Official Reader Allegiance from fiction to non-fiction!  

What follows is a comprehensive guide to my top-five favorite True-Crime books.  

1\. In Cold Blood by Truman Capote  

Really, there can be no other number one.  This is the Citizen Kane of books; this is The Godfather of True-Crime.  In writing In Cold Blood, Truman Capote basically invented True-Crime as we know it today.  Everything about this book is literally perfect.  From the prose, to the pacing, to the character development, to the unbelievable story, to its place in the pantheon of American Culture as the basic beginning of America's obsession with violence.  As a writer myself, no single book has more affected the way I write.  Capote's use of punctuation is truly something to behold.  He wields the English language with such beautiful, elegant efficiency that my tiny little brain can't even begin to describe it to you.  Capote somehow writes the quadruple murderer as a sympathetic character, which I still can't wrap my brain around.  At the end, you feel bad for everyone—not just the murder victims.  

After reading that, you might find what I'm about to say next befuddling: Don't start here!  Seriously.  In Cold Blood, in my opinion, is not the best place to start your journey.  It is the 12oz, prime-cut Filet of True-Crime—truly the best.  But if you start here, you run a double risk:  Firstly, it's very wordy, and some people struggle to get into it, finding it boring—kind of like drinking a fine wine before you've trained your pallet; you have to have a pre-existing love of the genre to fully appreciate it.  Secondly, it is just too damn good.  You might run the risk of never reading another True-Crime book that you like more.  Start with a cheese burger before you buy a Porter House.

2\. Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders by Vincent Bugliosi  

In my opinion, there are two kinds of True-Crime books.  There are ones written after the trial, generally by a journalist doing research, and then there are ones written by journalists/lawyers that actually sat through the trial.  Helter Skelter is the latter, and it's the best of its kind.  Trial witnessing True-Crime authors are a double edged sword.  On one hand, they can be boring and overly detailed, on another, they can be enthralling, offering a candid, behind the scenes look at all the players in the case.  The detail of Helter Skelter is something to behold.  It is also unique because, rather than just acting as a lawyer, Bugliosi is basically a detective in the book.  He constructs the case from the ground up, and goes head-to-head against Manson and his cronies.  If not for Vincent Bugliosi, Charles Manson could have very easily walked free.  Never have I walked away from a True-Crime book with a more visceral, comprehensive feeling of understanding.  After reading it, you feel like an expert on the case.  The added intrigue of Sharon Tate being murdered while 8 months pregnant (Roman Polanski's wife at the time) and Abigail Folger, airess to the Folgers Coffee fortune, only add to the insanity.  

Nothing I have ever read reads more like a horror movie than the events that transpired on Ceelio Drive.  When asked what they were doing on the property, Watson replied, ""I'm the devil, and I'm here to do the devil's business.""  You can't make this shit up.  What I eventually learned through reading so much True-Crime is how hard someone will fight for their life.  Frykowski, Abigail Folgers boyfriend, was stabbed 51 times, beaten over the head with a pistol enough times to bend the barrel, and shot twice.  It was said in court testimony that he literally fought to the final stab wound.  

Helter Skelter is truly a masterpiece, but I still wouldn't recommend starting here.  It can at times be a bit tedious, and its detail can only be fully appreciated by true fans of the genre.  

3\. Columbine by Dave Cullen  

Columbine holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the genre.  In making this list, I was tempted to make this number one.  But this is not my ""favorite"" True-Crime books—these are the best.  Columbine is a guilty pleasure of mine.  I have spent countless hours arguing with people about it, as it is a polarizing book.  Ultimately, though, it's a great book.  What I find most fascinating about it is, if you're anything like me, you probably think you know a lot about Columbine.  I was in highschool at the time of the tragedy, and it dominated the news cycle for months.  As a result, I thought I had a handle on the hows and whys of the shooting.  Not the case.  

Did you know that Columbine was actually a failed bombing?  They placed two huge propane bombs in the cafeteria during peak operating hours that failed to detonate.  Had they, the body count probably would have been in the hundreds.  There were also bombs set in the boys cars, meant for first responders, that also failed to detonate.  Their plans were much more elaborate and evil than you know.  The shooting was an afterthought in their minds.  The bombs were the goal.  They threw over 100 explosive devices while carrying out the massacre, they even taped matchbook striking strips to their forearm so they could grab, light, and throw as quickly as possible.  They kept detailed journals leading up to the event.  One mother called the police on Eric Harris upwards of 15 times, claiming he was dangerous.  There was actually a search warrant filed for Eric Harris' house almost a year before the massacre that would have uncovered guns, ammunition, and pipe-bombs… but it was never carried out.  The Sheriffs department successfully buried most of this informaiton.  Columbine wasn't just a shooting, it was a failed bombing, a massive failure of law-enforcement, and ultimately a world changing event, as it helped write the social script for all the school shootings to come.  From Dunblane to Virginia Tech to Aurora, this single event started the shift away from serial-killing and towards spree killing.  

Columbine is a brilliant introduction to the genre.  It is a simply written page-turner with complex, multi-level characters and heart-wrenching stories.  It is also a great introduction to Psychopathy and the mind of a killer.  

4\.  The Murder Room by Michael Capuzzo  

Of all the True-Crime books I've ever read, The Murder Room is the most unbelievable.  There's an old saying: Truth is stranger than fiction.  Never has the sentiment been more applicable than to this book.  The Murder Room is about The Vidocq Soceity, a small group of the best detectives in the world that meet four times a year to discuss and solve cold cases.  They have a 90 percent success rate and their powers of deduction border on super-natural.  Seriously.  The sory centers Richard Walter, perhaps the greatest living Criminal Profiler; Frank Bender, absolutely the greatest living forensic artist; and William Fleisher, the customs agent and organizer of the group.  

The dichotomy between Walter, the loner, brilliant, logically deductive sleuth and Bender, the totally off the wall, hedonistic mad man is perhaps my favorite duo in any book I've ever read.  They are such great foils and both of them are totally larger than life—not to mention some of the most unbelievable crime solvers that ever lived.  With their powers combine they form an unstoppable duo.  Walter has written some of the preeminent essays on serial-murder and ranks amongst the best serial-busters that ever lived.  Benders amazing ability to literally see dead people is completely unexplainable.  As an atheist, I've always found anything supernatural to be laughable, but, plain and simple, there is simply no explanation for Benders talents.  At one point in the book, he takes a completely faceless skull (just a bottom jaw and top of the head; nothing but a gaping hole where the nose, eyes, and mouth would be) and somehow recreates the likeness from a dream.  The mother of the deceased girl recognized his bust on a missing persons board and her daughter was returned and properly buried.  Do a quick Google search about John List, the murderer who Bender helped put away with perhaps the most uncanny age progression bust in Forensic Art history.  

There's True-Crime about killers, and True-Crime about people that stop killers: this is the best ever about those that do the stopping.  

5\.  The Night Stalker by Philip Carlo  

The Night Stalker is one of the most meticulously researched true crime books I've ever read.  It goes into great detail, not only about the murders, but also about the court case and subsequent obsession many women had with Richard Ramirez after the killings.  It reminds me a lot of Helter Skelter in that it goes into great detail about the actual court proceedings of the case, which I personally find very interesting.  It is also unique in that Philip Carlo became very close to Richard Ramirez.  You might even call them friends.  Carlo is very good at presenting both the good and bad sides of murderers.  The truth is, we like to view them in a vacuum, assuming they have no redeeming personality traits.  The True-Crime books that really succeed in my eyes are the ones that present them as believable people with both faults and strengths.  Serial-murderers are not caricatures; they are real people—in the flesh!  Richards sense of humor shines through the whole book, and was bar none the most shocking thing about it.  He's a genuinely funny guy and Carlo doesn't try to down play that.  He's also a sadistic murderer, and luckily, he doesn't down play that, either.  

And so, there you have it.  In my opinion, the five best True-Crime books ever.

Whatever you do, however you read them… just save In Cold Blood.  The word masterpiece was invented for books like it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ij3w2/truecrime_a_comprehensive_introduction_to_the/,2013-07-18 02:04:26,31,56,books
7pxefm,"""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" -Book review in Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists. About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions & Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

hy59i,"Hypothesis: The movie is never, ever better than the book.  Care to disprove?","The best example that I can think of is Jurassic Park.  Great movie, yes, but the book was better.  I also just read Starship Troopers, then watched the movie.  Book wins again.  Any ideas?

I guess I should add a caveat to this challenge:  the book had to come first, no books based off of movies.

2gjsme,Just read Sinuhe the Egyptian by Mika Waltari and I must say this book is quite underrated!,"I'm going to try and be as quick and short as possible and I'm still wrapping my head around the whole thing, so I apologize, if I don't give the book enough credit/give it too much credit. Let me start off with the fact that I'm a **huge** ancient history and ancient mythology nerd,  I've read countless pieces on the greek mythology, ancient egyptian culture and customs etc.

 Recently I stumbled across Sinuhe the Egyptian, a historical fiction novel, and my father backed the book up by claiming this was his favorite novel, when he was my age. So I got up to reading it.

And it was glorious! The story consists of the biography of Sinuhe, a fictional character, based on a real persona in a later Egyptian timeline, and he describes his entire life throughout the reign of six pharaohs (all real historical figures naturally). The writing style is therefore purposefully archaic and relatively simple and that only adds to the immersion factor. There's also this lethargic/melancholic emotion that dominates throughout the entire story. All this contributed to immersing me in the culture and life of the ancient egyptian and also added to my enjoyment.

So as I stated in the title, I think Sinuhe doesn't get enough credit around here. I hope that with this post we can at least discuss what you guys think of it (if someone has hopefully read it) and also hopefully give other history fiction readers a chance to look at a relatively not so popular book.

Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2gjsme/just_read_sinuhe_the_egyptian_by_mika_waltari_and/,2014-09-16 11:06:19,22,74,books
406izr,Specific content/themes found in one book and then again in the very next (unrelated) book you read?,"This just happened to me recently, which is why I wanted to see if it has happened to anyone else (I'm thinking it must've). Let's say you're reading a book, and there are certain references, pieces of content, or themes that you recognize and remember. You finish reading that book. And then, in the very next book you read, you find the same references, pieces of content, or themes again! Over and beyond general themes due to, say, genre, I mean.

For me this actually happened twice in quick succession. First, I was reading AMERICAN GODS by Neil Gaiman and came across a reference to those ""Find the Indians"" eye-training thingies. And then, when I was done that book, I began to read THE SHINING by Stephen King and found references to them again! That was the big one. The second (more minor) occurrence of this for me was finding themes of 'masks' in THE SHINING -masks/unmasking at the historical Ball, the hotel using Jack as a mask, etc.- followed by starting to read TRIGGER WARNING by Neil Gaiman and right in the introduction he talks about masks, too.

Has this ever happened to you? What were the books and what were the references, pieces of content, or themes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/406izr/specific_contentthemes_found_in_one_book_and_then/,2016-01-09 14:52:00,10,4,books
