19b2b4k,Finished ‘Salems Lot,I thought it was great the book is enthralling. What really stood out for me in the book was the use of reality and truth which makes his writing feel so real. First the child being punched by his mother and then later Richie Sawyer raping his wife repeatedly after discovering she had been cheating. The scene where Richie put a double barrel in Cory Bryant’s mouth and he shit himself felt so real to imagine. I think it’s his use of true aspects from life that make it easier to buy into the story. I’ve heard all over that you have to write true or honestly and that really showed in his writing here. The suspense which is built from the beginning of the book is terrific as well. Phenomenally well written book the subtle hints toward Bram Stokers Dracula is nice to see as well. I think it really reads like great modern literature. Would definitely recommend this one I learned a ton while reading it and it was also a fun read.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19b2b4k/finished_salems_lot/,2024-01-20 03:33:36,39,46,books
18xx7n7,Reading Salems lot.,"
I just read the scene where Sandy Mcdougall punches her baby in the face. One of the most horrific things I’ve read. Was very graphic, but I think it just shows how great of a writer King is. You really sympathize with the characters. Really awe inspiring writing. So far I’ve really enjoyed the way King introduces characters and the graphic depictions are amazing. Cormac McCarthy in Blood Meridian has similarly graphic imagery but his writing style is very different. Love it so far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18xx7n7/reading_salems_lot/,2024-01-03 23:11:50,39,29,books
1apzx26,Salem's Lot Prologue *Spoilers*,"I finished Salem's lot recently and like most of King's works I really enjoyed it and read it quickly. The one part of the book that kind of annoyed me was the prologue which features a man and boy and takes place after the events of the book. 

You can find out who the man is from the first chapter alone, and while I initially thought the boy may be one of Glick children, it doesn't take too long to figure out Mark Petrie is the boy. This took quite a bit of the tension away from the book as you know these two are destined to live, and can infer the rest of the characters are destined to die. I felt less invested in Susan's and Ben's relationship as it seemed obvious she wouldnt make it to the end.

The epilogue and the prologue are also fairly similar in this book. I think the prologue would make more sense if they flashbacked to younger Ben going into the Marsten house, or even Hubie Marsten on the night he killed himself and his wife.

I genuinely enjoyed the book but was just curious if anyone else felt this way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1apzx26/salems_lot_prologue_spoilers/,2024-02-13 18:00:46,8,15,books
u37ur5,Salem's Lot is a lot better than I thought it would be,"After working through a stack of classics I was expecting King to come off mainstream and simple (some idea from out the ether of the literary elite) so it's been a pleasant surprise to find out how wrong that was. At least with *Salem's Lot*. 

To write stuff of this quality at 6+ pages a day, is unfathomable. Most lit authors struggle with outputs less than a third that. 

If he were focused on ideas and poeticism, i.e. if his talent-capital was spread more between social commentary and tighter concentrations of prose, he'd have probably won a Pulitzer by now.

His prose are beautiful as they are, though. Clean, smooth, varied, way more creative than his reputation suggests. Intelligent characterisations, perfect pacing, masterly worldbuilding. Let alone, the staggering strength of his storytelling. He's a phenomenally good writer. 

Most broader readers seem to agree to some degree, but in the more pretentious pack that I come from, the ones who read Dostoevsky and Woolf and Foster Wallace and so on, there's a vague sense of superiority there, which is complete and utter bullshit. 

Might all be obvious to his fans, but by the defensiveness in his speech for winning the National Book award (among other things) it's clearly something he's wrestled himself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/u37ur5/salems_lot_is_a_lot_better_than_i_thought_it/,2022-04-14 03:18:16,61,77,books
12ky5pa,Salem's Lot is dissapointing...,"Ok, so just bear with me because im not the best at putting my thoughts into words but I really want to talk about this book because it annoys me how much potential it had before it all suddenly just petered out. Honestly this book dies a slow painfull death by the end (That might be a bit dramatic, I know)

This book is fine, maybe even good but it could have been great. King nails the atmosphere for the intire book through, the way he made the town and people feel so real and eerie is amazing and I love that he doesnt immediately start with the vampires. The build up of all the odd things that happen and then the sheer panick that some of the scenes convey-like the scene where the gravedigger has this constant unsteady feeling that Ralphie/Danny (Cant remember at the moment) Glick is staring at him through the coffin and then digs him up to find the boy staring up at him- is pam sweatingly brilliant. And the almost nonchalant way of how mark just waves away Susan who is floating at his window makes that scene so much more unsettling.

But for all the great suspence and build the book ultamitely left me unsatisfied. Here are some of my reason for that.

1. Barlow, for all his show and talk, is maybe one of the worst villians I have ever read. He gets all this buildup only getting his name mentioned while Straker goes around and does all his dirty work and when he finally shows his face he has some good moments. The interaction between him and father Callahan are good and his appearance at the Peatrie house is equally great. So you might be wondering why I am even talking about him, well its because even after everything I have mentioned, all he has planned and the lives he has ruined for **HUNDREDS** of years....he just dies, Ben just finds him and kills him. My honest reaction was, Huh? Thats him done? No big fight, no suspensfull action where we think he's going to win but then Ben manages to fight back? Someone please tell me im missing something. I just dont get it.
2. I have a similar problem with Mark, it doesnt matter that much but it made me question what the pages I read where even there for. And my problem is that Mark is potrayed as this cool, calm and colected individuall, who is so much brighter and more mature than most people his age, but it felt like when ever his bravery was called into action in the last third of the book he just turned into a complete craven, begging Ben not to go to the Marston House, and crying when they finally got out of there ( This is maybe a bit harsh from me being that he lost both his parents and just survived a vampire invation of his town, but still.) 
3. This is going to be short because I dont know if everyones books had this, but if they did, Please someone tell what the need of those 2 ekstra stories where? I dont mind them as much as the first 2 points, and I actually liked the first ""short storie"", but the second one whith the letters and stuff was a slogg to get through, I realize that it just may be a reflection on my taste but I dont understand how I was supposed to ingnore what I just read and go Into this new Storie with new characters, It just led to me not caring for anything that happened.

So yeah, what did you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12ky5pa/salems_lot_is_dissapointing/,2023-04-13 18:18:19,21,27,books
vm7pni,Salem's Lot was awesome and a great intro to King for me,"I just finished this today and I really loved it. I read somewhere that King is a master at characterization and I can easily see why. He trusted the audience to sink its teeth into this story and really get to know the town itself. The Lot was essentially the main character - how the vampirism impacts the trajectory of this individual society was really creative. I also really enjoyed the prologue and how it was essentially the ending! 

When Ben & Mike burned the Lot, it made me think back to the fire in '51. Did anybody else think that fire was intentional - maybe other people also tried to drive away vampires? Maybe I'm thinking too much into it.

Good stuff all around. I was creeped out for sure and thoroughly entertained all the way through. I'm not sure what King book I should start next so if there are suggestions I'd love to hear them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vm7pni/salems_lot_was_awesome_and_a_great_intro_to_king/,2022-06-27 22:47:51,53,120,books

oj181x,Just finished 'Salem's lot by Stephen king,">Buckling your seatbelt and letting the story take over, however…that is called “storytelling.”

Guess what? Story did take over. Finished it in just 2 sittings. Good job Mr. King. ^I ^still ^don't ^believe ^in ^vampires ^tho, ^sorry 

Now was it scary? Nah, it wasn't. It wasn't as scary as I thought. Story is pretty good. Some scenes gave chills. Barlow's character was pretty good but I would prefer Count Dracula. 

The best scene imo was the description when all the vampires sleep. It was chilly. A bit. 

And the scene where Ben and Jimmy go to mortuary and the woman starts vibrating and they fight, was creepy. I could see it in my imagination pretty clearly. 

Jimmy's death saddend me. I was starting to like him, and he falls on knives! Seriously, Authors gotta stop doing this. I started liking 3 characters and all of them ended up dead(not sure about Callahan tho, he's living as vampire ig)

Overall I enjoyed it. It's my 2nd Stephen king book.

p6s1gw,[Spoiler.] I don’t get the hype for Stephen Kings ‘Salems Lot.’,"So I have a few complaints about this book. I do recognize that it is his second published book, hence why his writing style has not matured yet, but I can’t understand the hype around this book? I watched youtube video reviews and read posts on this book and nobody has anything bad to say about it.

I found much of the book to be either redundant or anti-climactic. Redundant because of the fact that he essentially goes into minute detail of practically every resident in Jarusalems lot. This in itself takes up a good portion of the book in which he could have taken the time to flesh out what the Vampires are and what their motivations were. Personally I wish he took a more obscure way of presenting the Vampires rather than them just being the stereotypical, run of the mill ghoulies. I think the book could have been condensed to a short novel or even a novella.

In terms of the anti-climatic portion; I found what was supposed to be the best part of the book to be bland, and predictable. There was no real twists or depth to anything that happened. Also what in hell is the point of father Callahan? My friend told me about father Callahan and hyped me up for what I thought was going to be a Van Helsing esque type character. Instead he goes in, gets defeated and leaves…",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p6s1gw/spoiler_i_dont_get_the_hype_for_stephen_kings/,2021-08-18 14:17:07,46,21,books

f92yuz,I just finished 'Salem's Lot by Stephen King. Loved it.,"I'm a fan of Stephen King but I definitely haven't loved everything I've read of his. I think his classics/essential novels are definitely better, even though I couldn't finish The Stand. I hadn't read 'Salem's Lot or watched the movie and didn't know much about it. I knew it was about vampires, which I didn't think I'd like. But I picked it up and read it, and thought it was fantastic! It was so scary and thrilling, and such a page-turner, especially from the end of the Part 1. If you haven't read it, I really recommend it if you like Stephen King, horror, suspense, vampires, or just a good story.

557lcc,"Just finished Salem's Lot, my first Stephen King book...","I've never given King a chance for some reason. Horror/fantasy/monsters were never my preferred genre. However, recently I finished watching Stranger Things and I LOVED it, then I heard that it's partly inspired by King so I decided to give Salem's Lot a try, not knowing that it's a vampire novel. 

I liked the story and I loved how King develops the characters, but I really don't care for vampires. They just do do anything for me. It's hard to describe I guess, but Stranger Things seems sort of realistic... secret government testing gone bad is exciting, where undead bloodsuckers isn't appealing to me.

o462u5,Back to Stephen King - Just Read Salem's Lot,"I used to love Stephen King when I was a teenager, and lately I've been in a reading lull and between authors. I figured now was the time to go back to King and his brand of horror, and Salem's Lot has always been on my list of his classics that I never got around to. I finished it last night and thought I'd share my thoughts here. Spoilers ahead? I mean the book came out 46 years ago.

The first thing I'll say is that if I hadn't known King's style as an author I probably would've been off-put by the pace in the first act with the establishment of the cast and scenery of the Lot, especially considering how much of a placeholder Ben Mears is for the reader (or well, maybe just the author in this case). I realize the slow and steady pace of the first act is a hallmark of his style though, so if you're coming to his work for the first time just settle in and let the story unfold at its own pace. Having said that, getting through the first act is well worth it as the second and third acts ratchet up the intensity and horror successively.

Secondly, I'm sure this has been said before but Salem's Lot draws strong (purposeful and direct?) parallels to Bram Stoker's Dracula. Using everything from high-level plot points to character mapping, Salem's Lot is a tribute to the progenitor of the modern vampire genre. If you enjoy Stephen King's style and you enjoyed Dracula (and if you haven't read Dracula yet I highly recommend it) you're probably going to enjoy Salem's Lot as well. Ben Mears fits nicely into Jonathan Harker and Arthur Holdmwood's roles in Dracula, with parallels between Straker (and Hubie Marsten) and Renfield, Susan Norton to Mina Murray/Lucy Westenra, Matt Burke and Father Callahan to Van Helsing, Mark Petrie to Quincey Morris, and Jimmy Cody to Dr. Seward. The only downside to this tribute is that a lot of the dialogue felt more akin to what one would find in Dracula, being overly flowerly and unnatural for the modern (mid-70's) setting.

The last thing I'll say here is that I think reading Salem's Lot this late in the game probably undercut the impact it would've had when it was first released, or at least the impact it would've had before a lot of the more recent vampire genre entries came out. These later entries seem to have taken quite a bit Salem's Lot in terms of depiction of vampires (jet black eyes, only being affected by actual faith and not just the symbols of it, etc) so some of the aspects of vampirism might feel par-for-the-course if you've had any other exposure to the genre. Similarly, the fact that it was set in (and written in) the mid-70's in a small town setting felt a bit dated given the trend towards city living in the last 46 years, but I suppose you could say the same thing about Dracula and the fact that it was written and set in the late 1800's and was modern for its time. 

Overall I really enjoyed Salem's Lot, and while I don't think it is representative of his work overall it's still a great read. As his second major novel (correct me if I'm wrong here) you can tell it sets the tone for a lot of his later work.

9j7x8m,Irked by Salem's Lot?,"So, last year, I had this amazing Gothic Literature class at UNCC. My professor was super creepy (he once faked being poisoned when we read Rappacini's Daughter, slumped to the ground in front of the podium and just...laid there for five minutes straight, before leaping up and lecturing as though nothing happened. He also brought a huge spear to class like twelve times to defend himself from vampires, which was awesome). But I struggled to read Salem's Lot by Stephen King. I liked the main character, Ben,  I liked the head vampire, Barlow, who was a well-written villain (my professor's creepy reading of him might have helped solidify my liking him), as was Straker, but I disliked the child, Mark. The fact that the child, of all people, fought off vampires, and aided in destroying Barlow, was just...I don't quite know how to describe it, but I did not like it. The fact that he, often times, was more competent than the adults also irritated me for reasons I can't find the words to explain. I both liked and disliked the huge cast of characters, which was interesting, but also annoying to try to keep track of. 

I've been thinking about trying to revisit it, and maybe read more King, since I've heard Lovecraft inspired him, and I'm quite fond of Lovecraft. Is the idea of hyper-competent children a theme in his other works? I saw Silver Bullet a few Halloweens ago and disliked it for similar reasons.

n7g5sv,I love the intricate and slow burn degradation of Salem's Lot by Stephen King,"The way we as readers get the little vignettes into the small town life of the Lot and as the darkness of the Marston House spreads, we see that life break down.  It doesn't even glamorize small town life like some books might, but we see the humanity exposed to such inhuman malice.  

It starts out slow, but we also see the exponential spread of the vampirism, how an actual disease may spread until a once lively town is now a desolate, menacing husk of what it once was.  

And in the end, while our characters defeat the progenitor vampire, they still leave behind a corpse of a town and it certainly doesn't feel like any kind of true victory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n7g5sv/i_love_the_intricate_and_slow_burn_degradation_of/,2021-05-08 03:22:22,22,38,books

The Marsten house adds such a creep factor to the story and just makes such a great setting.

713zkb,"I was trying to read Stephen King's Salem's Lot recently, and I think King is a bad writer.","I'd read The Green Mile many years ago in middle school. So I decided to try *Salem's Lot* within the past week. I ended up reading the first 60-80 pages or so (I can't tell the exact amount, I'm on an ebook reader).

I found some parts genuinely interesting. Take this sentence for example: ""It was a moment he remembered for years after, as though a special small slice had been cut from the cake of time."" That's a great sentence. Efficient use of metaphor and great pop. The whole meeting between Ben Mears and Susan Norton in the beginning was interesting and good writing. And when he told her about coming into the house as a kid and finding the guy hanging, I could see how it was scary and good.

The problem is that right after that, King felt the need to do a panorama of random characters throughout the town. It was terribly boring. Instead of focusing on these two interesting characters, he killed it by bouncing from character to character for a while. I didn't care too much at all, I just wanted to get back to the Susan Norton/Ben Mears part of the story. 

I think the shift in perspectives also reflected a real decline in writing quality in the book. For example, the section of the book with all these viewpoints begins with this sentence: ""The town is not slow to wake — chores won't wait."" Can you say cheesy? 

As well, the whole scene where Straker meets with Larry to buy a house...I found that poorly written. Look at this quote:

""'I have been sent to buy a residence and a business establishment in your so-fair town,' the bald
man said. He spoke with a flat, uninfected tonelessness that made Larry think of the recorded
announcements you got when you dialed the weather.""

""So-fair town"" is not something anyone would say, except a cliched outsider. The whole idea of him being ""flat"" and ""emotionless"" kept re-appearing in the scene, and frankly it also came off as a cliche.

These aspects of the writing bothered me to the point where I don't know if it's worth it to keep reading the novel to get to the good parts with Ben/Susan. I feel like King can write really good dialogue sometimes. Again, everything good about the book so far for me came from the Ben/Susan interaction. I found the writing seriously declined and it felt like King just wanted to give a panorama of the town for no real reason. I guess it gave the town a little more 'life' beyond Susan and Ben (which it didn't need), but it seemed like just filler. Even the guy at the graveyard that found a dead cat hanging on his rail was a big yawn. So, my last page read was the end of the conversation between Straker and Larry.

Edit: Because rumors were shared over the back fence, of course! As with a lot of things I've learned from the description of this town, I'm too young to get the reference. They also eavesdrop on one another through the phone lines, a concept for which I just barely had the context.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iubm1r/salems_lot_is_filled_with_colloquialisms_and/,2020-09-17 03:39:48,21,31,books

6fw4fx,Is this a misprint? (Salem's Lot),"I recently pick up an older copy of the book and the first part of the book the pages are all out of order. Is it meant to do this because it doesn't seem like it.
The page order goes as written: Author's Note, 1, blank, Prologue, page 4, page 5, page 8, page 7, page 6, page 11 page 10, page 9, blank, Part 1, page 16, chapter 1, blank, page 19 page 18, page 17, and then blank
It's only until after chapter 2 that the pages fall back in order. Does this happen to anybody else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6fw4fx/is_this_a_misprint_salems_lot/,2017-06-07 20:26:43,4,5,books
1oflpe,Regarding 'Salem's Lot,"Hi guys,

Just a quick question to ask whether the writing style of Salem's lot is the same as employed in the short story from Night Shift called 'Jersuamem's Lot. I understand they are sequels, but am curious as to whether Salem's Lot uses the same gothic horror type of writing because I loved it.

3pdcsm,"Giving Stephen King a shot ('Salem's Lot). Story is good, prose seems lacking. Looking to discuss.","This is my first Stephen King novel. It's a quick read, which I guess is a good thing. The plot is fun, but I'm discovering that some of his prose and dialogue is actually pulling me out of it. Sighs of frustration are occurring more often than I would like. I look forward to and enjoy the moments of terror and suspense, but a good chunk of the writing is simply lackluster, flat. Anyone have similar reactions? Is this par for the course of King's writing? Am I expecting too much?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3pdcsm/giving_stephen_king_a_shot_salems_lot_story_is/,2015-10-19 16:32:04,24,2,books
68q1lt,"I just read 'Salem's Lot and it was terrifying. I have questions, however. (Spoilers)","So I read the Dark Tower last year, and it involves this book somewhat, so I wanted to read it. I finally did.

Damn is it good. I'm not too happy about how easily it seemed Barlow got defeated in the end, if I'm being honest. After all the talk about how dangerous he was, it was like....ok?

Also that Vampires seemingly cannot come awake during the day. Like even in a pitch black interior, with no light, if it's daylight, they're asleep. Makes daytime feel a little...too safe.  I wish I had more follow up with Ben & Mark. I also kinda wish more of the town had fought back. Granted, having read IT & DT, I understand Stephen Kings whole ""When the right stuff comes together."" mojo. 

My main question however, comes to the end of the book. The diary of the Boothe fellow. I thought I was following pretty well what happened, satanic rituals, summoning the undead, ect. It honestly made me afraid while reading in the dark in my bed.  It reminded me of Lovecraft. Especially that ending in the Church.  Cosmic horrors and all.

I just want to know how any of that involved Barlow, or Marstens Correspondence with Barlow, or Bens vision when he was a kid. 

Also, the final entry was 1971...4 years before the main story, and someone was living in the Marten estate at that point, at least that's what it points to, but as we know from the main story, nobody had.

I was tired while reading, but that part struck me.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/68q1lt/i_just_read_salems_lot_and_it_was_terrifying_i/,2017-05-02 00:58:47,13,14,books
1zrhwa,Slightly disappointed with Salem's Lot [Spoilers],"Okay. So I'm very new to King. The only thing I've read from him prior to Salem's Lot was ""The Man in the Black Suit"" and I loved it. I already think he's a beautiful writer so this isn't about that.

What I'm having issues with is that Salem's Lot has been praised as his best novel(?) however I just finished it and am really disappointed. The book was chilling and terrified me along the way which was good! Though I honestly felt that it went downhill after Susan died. I felt that many of the characters in the book lacked common sense, and by the end I was even kind of hoping that Ben would die because I thought he entirely deserved it. The only person in the book (who is my hero) was Parkins Gillespie for having the sense to leave the town before he died. Now I know there would be no book if Ben and company fled, but I really am frustrated with their actions. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I honestly can't find one review where someone didn't like this book. I think it was beautifully written and is very frightening no doubt about that, but really, the characters completely turned me off about half way through >=[",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1zrhwa/slightly_disappointed_with_salems_lot_spoilers/,2014-03-06 23:35:37,5,3,books

Overall, it's not my favorite SK book, but the epilogue was an incredible surprise. So much so, that I'm going back and reading the Classic Dracula.
