19b2b4k,"P.S. any input on what I should read next? I was thinking either the shining, finishing wind through the keyhole (and the rest of the Dark Tower Series), or finishing Don Quixote (I think it’s really great, but I took a little break from it and read ‘Salems Lot).",KaptinNiceGuy,2024-01-20 03:35:09
19b2b4k,"So glad I found this post! I finished 'Salems Lot about a week ago and wanted to read more Stephen King books. Like you said, his description of reality is amazing. I haven't really read any other authors who write and turn it into a movie as I read. My favorite character has to be Mark the little boy. The trauma he's faced made me cry along with how he described Jimmy's body to Ben. So sad. Such a great first book to read by Stephen King.",bigbarbellballs,2024-01-20 14:01:44
19b2b4k,I read Salems Lot a few months ago and enjoyed it as well. I also read Christine by King and thought it was much better. I would highly recommend it,Seizee,2024-01-20 18:31:46
19b2b4k,"I've never read the talisman, but couldn't agree more about your assessment with '63. I also like the small interaction with the kids for Derry (It).

One other thing i forgot to mention to OP, Needful Things is similar in structure to Salem's Lot, although  IMO, Salems lot is superior",Bradburys_spectre717,2024-01-20 12:35:45
19b2b4k,"The Stand is a big book, but very good. Great character development and scene setting. If you enjoyed ‘Salems Lot you will enjoy The Stand. Pet Sematary is also very solid and about 1/3 (1/4?) the length of The Stand.",Fegundo,2024-01-20 15:13:11
19b2b4k,"I have read both the abridged and the unabridged; if you pick it up, go for gold and do the unabridged. It has more of the detail you were talking about with 'Salems Lot.",lyan-cat,2024-01-21 00:19:25
vm7pni,Salems Lot was also my introduction to King and from there I went on to read over 30 of his books. My suggestion for your next one would be either IT or Pet Sematary.,samuelangus,2022-06-28 01:29:05
qqtcc0,If you dont know book 5 and thereafter of Kings Dark Tower series ties in heavily to Salems Lot.  Most of his books tie in one way or another but Salems Lot tie in is stronger than many.,Nightgasm,2021-11-10 12:35:42
qqtcc0,"Oh no, i've read through Carrie before Salems Lot, on Halloween infact. Other than that i only read Dolores like 2 years ago",Eizen96,2021-11-10 14:25:41
f92yuz,Salem's Lot is definitely a great book and the film is great also! It's one of the scariest I've seen and it's directed by Tobe Hooper who did The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Salems Lot.,Jorge777,2020-02-26 09:45:51
557lcc,"King books that directly influence Stranger Things: IT, Firestarter, Tommyknockers.

Yes, The Shining is great, but it is nothing like Stranger Things, much like Salems Lot wasn't.",doctor_wongburger,2016-09-30 13:20:21
557lcc,"If you start King's Dark Tower series, the disgraced priest from Salems Lot makes a return in volume 5 (or 6 - hard to remember at this point).",bmtri,2016-09-30 13:25:26
9j7x8m,He has a short story about the history of Salems Lot that is his most Lovecraft-esque work,Lamont-Cranston,2018-09-27 00:20:28
n7g5sv,Salems Lot and The Stand are by far my favourite king novlels.,poppypodlatex,2021-05-08 06:43:30
9wt4tj,"Its been a while, but its my top King pick. I was bummed watching both adaptations after and feeling as though neither one did the book justice.

I never read dracula, maybe I should give that a whirl.

Years ago I started Anne Rices Vampire Chronicles, what I read were good, except writing errors cause Rice hates editors fucking with her writing so she repeats herself a tad and drifts into homoerotic vampires, no thanks, but Lestat is still awesome.

I read the first Charlie Harris vampire book (True Blood basis), the first book is basically season one. But I was always kinda against it anyway simply because she based it in New Orleans... Where Anne Rices vampires frequent.

Blah.

Salems Lot was an awesome ""classic"" style vampire book though. Aside from King, prolly the best Vampire book I ever read.

9wt4tj,"I read that this summer, along with Dr.Sleep. loved The Shining, Dr. Sleep was decent. Shining, along with Eyes of the Dragon, and Salems lot are my top King picks. 

I'm glad I read The Shining, I can see how king was upset with the movie. Doesn't do justice to Torrence's character and the evil that creeps in. ",pop_skittles,2018-11-14 04:16:01

Pet Semetary scared me though. ",,2016-11-30 15:06:44
713zkb,"So I haven't read Salems Lot (yet) but Stephen King is probably my favorite author. Something I've noticed about him is that even when the book starts out slow, it has a fantastic ending that ties everything together. He does add details that honestly aren't always important, but that's what I love about his writing style! Its not for everyone though. One thing I've had to remind myself in the past of is the time period he is writing for/in.

Like I said, I haven't read this one in particular, but my two favorites are 'the girl who loved Tom Gordon' and 'duma key' by him (the latter scared the hell outta me). I think that if you're still considering continuing, you should; but if it comes to the point (or if it already has) that it's a chore to continue, don't. You won't be happy and I personally think it can leave a bad taste in your mouth for the author, which could cause you to miss out on something you could potentially love in the future. 

Sorry, I don't know if this was helpful at all or just rambling, but if you want to try something else of his,  the two I mentioned are my recommendations!",Bdbmissmafia41,2017-09-22 06:12:09
713zkb,"I've tried Salems Lot, Gerald's Game, and The Dark Towers to no avail. I WANT to like him. I want to finish a King book. But I'm right there with OP. Sometimes the writing just goes on and on and on and on and on....",dumbolddoor,2017-09-21 02:54:36
713zkb,"Salems Lot is my favorite King book and am shocked someone didn't like it.

But I am old also.  

(the TV movie with the guy from Starsky and Hutch scared the bejeezus outta me as a lad also)",pblood40,2017-09-20 02:04:23
39qf01,"It had a cameo, if I'm not mistaken (could be, since it has been so long), but Salems Lot is *very* important for the series. 

Also I very highly recommend the Dark Tower series.",TerrorEyzs,2015-06-14 06:14:07
23vmuc,"I liked The Vampire LeStat and the others in The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.
Salems Lot was one creepy book, though. ",,2014-04-25 02:05:51
1oflpe,"They are very different from one another. The novella is nearly explicitily Lovecraftian (and is written as a diary, like Dracula interestingly enough). 


'Salems Lot on the other hand is like...well no one really. You can certainly find the Stoker influence on the plot, and there is certainly a gothic touch (not nearly to the same extent as the short story) but it is Stephen King to the core. The people are all mostly sympathetic though frequently evil and cruel. The town is the books main character, and the ratcheting tension is far more effective IMO.

I'd go for it, one of my favorite King books.",powderizedbookworm,2013-10-15 04:47:29
3pdcsm,"I actually just reread Salems lot last week and I was dis pointed it was one of the first adult novels  I ever read (at 13/14) and loved it always will be one of my favorites because its importance to me, but I re read right after finishing two of his later works under the dome and 11/22/63 and you could tell how early he was in his career with The Lot, try The Stand and if you dont like it hes not for you.
