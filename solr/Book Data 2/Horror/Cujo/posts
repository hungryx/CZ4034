574n53,Cujo by Stephen King [SPOILERS],"I posted in this sub 3 months ago about how I just finished my first Stephen King novel, 11-22-63. I was recommended a ton of Mr. King's books to read and I've been going through the list as fast as I can. I've enjoyed all of them so far, but Cujo. Man, I don't even know.  
It's a very well written book, I found myself connecting with the characters more than I did in his other books. I've been with someone who cheated on me, I've dealt with car problems, I've dealt with business deals gone awry and trying to fix them, I don't feel like there was a single character I couldn't' connect with on some level.  
The final struggle in the book with Donna and Tad are trapped in the car was so well written, I couldn't wait to get past the other characters stories to get back to the people trapped in the car, trying to find their way out. When Donna finally go the courage to get out of the car and make a run for help, having a huge battle with the dog, finally being triumphant, then her husband shows up and she's immediately concerned about her son.  
""How long has he been dead, Donna?""  
That single line ruined my week. I finished the book a week ago and I've not picked up my tablet to start another. I wasn't expecting it. I was expecting, hoping, praying for everything to be fine and them to get the help they desperately needed. Donna defeated the dog! She won...  
What was everyone else's take on this book? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/574n53/cujo_by_stephen_king_spoilers/,2016-10-12 15:27:09,10,8,books
3ix70j,"Unreasonably upset by something in Stephen King's ""Cujo"" (Possible spoilers in description)","I finished reading *Cujo* by Stephen King a few days ago and I cannot shake the relationship between Vic and Donna. I have never, for some reason, felt more alone than when I read about Donna cheating on Vic with Steve Kemp. I have read books and seen movies with infidelity before, but for some reason, reading all of the scenes with Donna and Steve and then Vic finding out what happened through the note and then the following thoughts of what will become of their marriage throughout the course of the book, I felt incredibly vulnerable for some reason. And in my opinion, it was incredibly irrational for me to feel so strongly for this couple.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3ix70j/unreasonably_upset_by_something_in_stephen_kings/,2015-08-30 03:55:48,10,17,books
