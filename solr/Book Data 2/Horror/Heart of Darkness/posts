17zmvtt,2013 Collins Classics edition of Heart of Darkness.,"I just bought the 2013 Collins Classics edition of 'Heart of Darkness' and noticed something strange. At the end of the book, there's a glossary, but half of the listed words are common English words like 'but,' 'gem,' 'want,' 'sensible,' 'folly' etc. While there are some less common words and some with double meanings as well, many nautical terms, which are less familiar to most readers I assume, are missing. Does anyone know why these particular words were chosen for the glossary?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17zmvtt/2013_collins_classics_edition_of_heart_of_darkness/,2023-11-20 11:55:19,2,6,books
yihi9n,Just finished Heart of Darkness,"Been working my way through the ""classics"" over the last few years and just finished Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Can't say I liked it. Really a novella, so it was quick to read, but not sure I really understand why this is regarded as a  significant literary work. If it's more of a snapshot of the time period, then I can understand it, I think War and Peace is a good example of that.

1578j0k,Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim vs Heart of Darkness,"What do people here think about the two books?
I wonder if I'm in the minority of readers who loved Lord Jim (a personal favorite of mine) and really did not like Heart of Darkness? Not to say that I don't appreciate HOD as a literary text, but I did not have any fun reading that book. I don't think Conrad's writing is very easy to read in either book, but it felt to me that his writing almost suited the ambiguity in Lord Jim better?

178w0rq,What are the less obvious character parallels between Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now?,"I am currently reading *Heart of Darkness* and having a hard time getting it as I read (the more I remember who the characters are, the more I start to get the novella). I watched the 1993 television film adaptation of the novella twice so I already know what happens generally, and I have watched *Apocalypse Now* a few times so I am getting a lot of its overall themes. My question is, what are the less obvious character parallels between Joseph Conrad's novella and Francis Ford Coppola's motion picture adaptation? Coppola took a lot of influence from the novel, more so than the screenwriter John Milius, so I feel like if I can understand which *Apocalypse Now* characters exist originally in *Heart of Darkness*, I might have a better time reading, and by extension a better time understanding the picture.

The obvious parallels are Charles Marlow/Captain Willard, Mr. Kurtz/Colonel Kurtz, and the Russian Trader/American Photojournalist. The others that are less obvious but seem to make sense to me based on my own observations are the following:

* The Helmsman/Chief Phillips.
* The General Manager/Colonel Kilgore.
* Fresleven/Captain Colby.
* Congolese Natives/Vietcong.
* Secretary/Colonel Lucas.
* Head of the Company/General Corman.
* Mr. Kurtz's African Mistress/Colonel Kurtz's Montagnard wife (whose scenes were largely cut out).
* Mr. Kurtz's Intended/Colonel Kurtz's wife.
* Swede/the ""regular Army"" soldier that the Chief refers to.

What is lost on me is the lack of a real and direct connection between a character in *Apocalypse Now* with the Brickmaker, the Chief Accountant, or the Doctor in *Heart of Darkness*. I read some of the original 1969 John Milius screenplay of *Apocalypse Now* and the civilian character (who exists in the picture as the ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" intelligence officer) is described as wearing a white tropical suit, which describes the Chief Accountant more than any other character in *Apocalypse Now*.

Also, the Pilgrims are lost on me. Are they better represented by Kilgore's Air Cavalry soldiers (if the General Manager and Kilgore comparison makes sense) or by the French Colonialists at the plantation in the picture, or both?

Any insight would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/178w0rq/what_are_the_less_obvious_character_parallels/,2023-10-16 02:47:53,3,0,books
l85yvw,Should Heart of Darkness not be taught in schools?,"We recently started reading HOD in my English class for our unit on Impressionism and I’m loving the deep descriptions so far. 

Today in class, we touched on the criticisms of HOD, particularly ones related to how the natives are depicted and whether the book conveys racist sentiments. Some of my peers believe that the depiction of the natives and Africa itself are quite damning for the book, and they believe we shouldn’t read it. While I understand their point of view, I didn’t find it reasonable for them to be judging Conrad based on our 21st century standards of what is right and wrong. 

Was he probably racist by our standards? Yes. But I’m assuming that, for his time, he was probably quite progressive in his views of colonisation. 

Conrad was a product of his time, so why should his literary contributions be disregarded just because he doesn’t mesh well with our 21st century ideas?

Am I off base here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l85yvw/should_heart_of_darkness_not_be_taught_in_schools/,2021-01-29 22:17:31,37,52,books
une2v5,Confused about nautical terms in Heart of Darkness,"Here is what it says: 

""The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.""

""We looked on, waiting patiently—there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood; ... we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow’s inconclusive experiences.""

The way I interpret this is that they are going downstream with the ebb of the tide, so they need to wait until it is done rising and begins ebbing again to continue downstream. In particular, what does it mean that ""the flood had made"" and that ""till the end of the flood..."" Does the former sentence mean the tide had begun to rise?

Maybe I should ask on a sub about sailing!

moijq7,Heart of Darkness review.,"Since I was in a depressed mood I thought why not read something to cheer my spirits up, and read Heart of Darkness. Sarcasm over. You know, I was surprised this was a novella considering how it's always listed next to the other bricks of classics but it's good because the dense language will try your patience. But I feel that's it's greatest strength and weakness. When talking about diseased Africans working themselves to death it helps if the prose is able to convey that care and boy does it ever. 

The setting and the attention to the sickly bodies of the Africans is given special attention and the contrast to white characters who are in dashing clothing with their parasol umbrellas, good imagery for the juxtaposition.

But again, the writing. I was trying to read this while my dogs saw a crow on the fence and kept having to reread the same bloody page or be lost to what was going on. 

All in all, heart of darkness demands your full attention and worth the read. It might bum you out but hey it's 2021.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/moijq7/heart_of_darkness_review/,2021-04-11 02:33:52,15,20,books

e5x9ll,Thoughts on Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad,"\- At long last, I have done a few of these reviews now, and mostly have always freely recommended books to the general audience. I am not so cavalier in my recommendation of Heart of Darkness, though I think the book itself is excellent and a worthy classic. It is by no means an easy read stylistically, and the themes of this book may be tough for some to handle. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading this story (took me a mere 2 days since I couldn't put it down), and I acknowledge there is hidden a certain genius in the way the story is narrated. I am quite sure some of the English quips went well over my head at times, and I would gleam more of the symbolism expressed on a re-read. But I feel I can put together an adequate enough composition of my thoughts after a once-through read.

\- In a very basic summary, the story is about an ambitious, English river boat seaman, Captain Marlow, being commissioned by a trade company on the Congo River to perform excursions in the ivory trade amongst the various stations along the river. One of these journeys is to retrieve a dangerous, eccentric agent of the company, Mr. Kurtz, who has become deified by one of the tribes. Horrors and madness ensue.

\- The symbols of light and dark permeate all through this short story, and I am quite unsure if I can accurately pinpoint their true intentions. Ultimately, this is a story told with Imperialism as its central theme, and being written by Conrad around the early 1900's, I am fairly certain it is intended to put Colonialism in a negative light. I mean the managers of the trade company are true buffoons in their dealings (or lack thereof) with Marlow, and their ""pajama'ed"" lackeys seem to only be interested in firing their rifles and cowering at the first signs of danger along the river. Yet, the native people are also painted in a light that makes them look, I don't know, sub-human to the reader, interested only in warring with one another, eating each other, and serving white masters. If light and dark are symbols of good and evil in this work, I am not sure which side they are meant to represent. The story is steeped in racist ideology and language, so very obviously the white colonial Europeans have ""hearts of darkness"". Even Marlow, a character more sympathetic to the tribes, has many a racist thought throughout and regards the people of the Congo as pitiful savages. Maybe the true reveal here is that no matter how progressive, no matter how en""light""ened we believe we are, our perspectives concerning other races and cultures are merely different shades of opaque. No one is purely transparent. The novel goes out of its way to notify the reader of the river's darkness, the darkness of certain rooms and stations, even constantly hidden behind the damn jungle is nightmarish darkness. Everything and everyone is bathed in darkness.

 \- The character of Mr. Kurtz is an engima, and I would love to hear others take on him. He is not directly present in the story for long, yet his shadow is felt throughout most of the book. He is a gifted agent of ivory with the skill of winning souls through speech and oration, and has found himself a god of a ferocious tribe on the Congo. On the one hand, Kurtz seems to be the only man truly respecting (somewhat) of the cultures of these tribes. He can verbally communicate with them in their language, and attends their rituals of dance. He even may have taken a lover out of one of the more superb women of the tribe, Yet, even in his conclusion, his ultimate aim is his own fame. He wants to be known for his ivory, his bizarre ideas, his plentiful substance, his plans, his legend. The other characters are both fearful and captivated by him. Hypnotized even. As mysterious of a character as I've ever encountered in a tale, and I truly would love to hear others thoughts regarding him. 

\- Ultimately, this book is well worth a read even if just remember how recently peoples of different colors and races were treated so inhumanely over silly objects like ivory and diamonds. The countries of Africa have been raped and pillaged by Imperialists since forever. I think, in reading Heart of Darkness, it also calls for internal reflection and challenges us on our own prejudices, perspectives, and images of ourselves. Read this book if you have the mental fortitude to be contested. Its vivid descriptions of the scenery along the Congo is also quite, quite beautiful and poetic.

&#x200B;

\- As an aside, I also recommend Apocalypse Now, a movie based on this book. One of my favorites of all time (Marlon Brando as fucking Col. Kurtz!), and what got me interested in the book to begin with. Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/e5x9ll/thoughts_on_heart_of_darkness_by_joseph_conrad/,2019-12-04 10:24:20,31,24,books

k2weoj,Did Heart of Darkness invent a whole new story structure?,"I was thinking recently about how Heart of Darkness employs a unique story structure I haven’t seen in other stories before its publication. The structure I’m referring to is one where the protagonist travels deeper and deeper into a hellish landscape towards a final confrontation with a satan-like character, all the while losing his faith in the righteousness of his moral code. 

Dante’s Inferno comes to mind as a possible counterexample, but in that story the protagonist’s moral beliefs don’t change much by the conclusion of the story. His journey only seems to bolster his conviction in the righteousness of Christian morality. However, I can think of many stories who have used a similar story structure to Heart of Darkness since the novella’s publication (e.g. Blood Meridian, Apocalypse Now!, Spec Ops: The Line, etc.).

Anyway, I’m curious to know if there are other stories published before Heart of Darkness that use the story structure I mentioned above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k2weoj/did_heart_of_darkness_invent_a_whole_new_story/,2020-11-28 21:47:09,17,53,books
5h32rx,Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,"I need to talk about what this book makes me feel. I've tried explaining it to friends and they don't understand, so I am leaving this here for your consideration.

I have been reading my entire life. I started with LOTR as a sixth grader and never looked back. I have read every genre under the sun, I have written papers on dozens of authors to varying amounts of success and I have never struggled with a work like I have with this one. The inability to grasp the scope of Conrad's work is driving me nuts. I have been collecting quotes from all the books I've read this semester and every time I look at snippets I've pulled from HoD, I feel something akin to despair. This work is brilliant. I have respect for it in a way that I've not felt for any other work of literature. I fear it in the way a young boy fears his father. Conrad's prose is stunning. Every sentence is so layered that I can't find the one thread that will pull it apart. And I'm not even sure if I want to find it. It's unbelievably frustrating.

I made the terrible mistake of choosing this work for an analysis paper. I feel so insignificant. It's like someone handed me one of those Crayola paint-by-number gags and told me to paint the Sistine Chapel Ceiling. I've started and restarted this paper four times now. I'm running around the book, trying to trace lines around its shape to try and contain it, to understand it, but I can't get myself to run past so many different things he's written that deserve to be wondered at.

If I were to validate this post, I should ask if you've ever felt this about books in general, though I dare not ask which books those are. I cannot afford to know the answer right now.

>!The brick-maker never actually agrees to procure rivets and the conversation trails to some weird story about an old hippo that roams the banks at night.  So why does Marlow get excited about rivets? Or does he assume that the brick-maker's misconception about his influence would compel him to get the rivets in hopes of favours in return? !<

>!What was Mr. Kurtz attempting to do that night when Marlow chased him in the grasses? And how does Marlow convince him to go back with them? It is evident from the Manager's conversation with  his uncle that Kurtz sent down immense ivory. So why didn't the Manager and Marlow just take the ivory and return leaving Kurtz behind? What were Kurtz's 'immense plans'? Was it to break free of the Company and establish himself as the supreme using his influence over the natives? Is that why he is referred to as a threat to the Company? !<

>!What is this charm that Kurtz has? Why did the natives worship him? I understand that Kurtz is symbolic of imperialism but the reasons behind his charm seem vague and obscure. Marlow's description of him seem inadequate to justify his influence over people. Even Marlow, at times, refers to him as hollow within, greedy for wealth, power, recognition- a mad soul.

c1c8g4,Question: Heart of Darkness - what the heck is the big deal?,"Just finished Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. I am trying desperately to figure out why this is generally thought of as a classic...perhaps your collective minds could help me out?

My impressions:
1. The alliteration is comical: there is such dense use of this that it actually stops me dead in my tracks pulling me out of the story (what little story there is). I understand that it is supposed to be a formative poetic tool but at the expense of interrupting narrative?
2. The misogyny is offensive, even by the standards of the time. Women are dismissed and only feature to be used to paint the picture of the men.
3. It is extremely racist. From the outset Conrad seems to relegate anyone not white to being a savage.  I understand that the ISSSC is possibly meant to be a satire of the Berlin Conference of 1884, but the persistent narrative through the eyes of Marlow goes beyond the point where one could justifiably say that Conrad is trying to balance a colonial point of view.
4. What’s the point of the story? Some dude, who everyone keeps claiming is a genius (whose genius is never demonstrated), loses himself in the Heart of Darkness and turns savage himself to prove that no matter how much better we think we are we will all eventually go native(?!); then some other dude gets sent to retrieve dude no. 1 and questions himself and everyone else? 
5. Characterisations are poor and 2D. Except perhaps the Russian harlequin, who we only briefly encounter. The main protagonist is described as being mysterious and great, without actually being demonstrated as such at any point!

All in all, I have had this book on my list of classics for a very long time. It’s regularly pushed as one of the ‘great classics’ but having finally got round to reading it: I find a pale, pointless pontificating waste of my time.

Life of Pi is obviously more of a religion based angle, but still loved it. I read Heart of Darkness in high school for fun, but just re-read it and loved/appreciated it way more as an adult.

I thought the most comparable book to it was The Beach by Alex Garland. It's one of my all time favourite books and so I wasn't sure if I was just comparing subconsciously, or if anybody else had any other insights?

Personally, I found Mr. Duck in The Beach similar to Mr. Kurtz... a sort of omnipresent character, morally ambiguous, sanity questionable (one character says this about them, another character says that), clearly losing it as the story continues, and have a huge impact on the protagonists. I also liked how both Marlow and Richard gradually lose their interest (maybe not interest, but their vision) of their journey and where they are, and can start to understand Mr. Kurtz/Mr. Duck. By the end of HOD, Marlow has a sort of disillusionment of the civilized world when he returns; Richard has a similar sort of vision of the world when he's back as well, beyond the ""I have a few nightmares/carry a lot of scars"" ending. I took that as he is more ""okay"" than Marlow was, but is still clearly affected by what happened. Both are damaged in one way or another because of what happened to them in their stories. Similarly, in Lord of the Flies, the young boys all have their crying moment at the end, as well as the officer stating that he expected more of the boys. Obviously, he didn't know what was going on in full, but can recognize that they have lost all of their civility and control on the island.

All of these books also carry a lot of vicious violence that occurs while not being in a more public setting, deaths, characters all losing control of their basic civilized actions that they would never do if they were not isolated/in the ""real world"", like the boys killing Simon in LOTF, the murders and deaths that happen in The Beach (euthanizing Christo, them tripping out and attacking the dead body/Richard at the end), or some of the actions and outlook on life that occurs in Heart of Darkness, like Mr. Kurtz's final words or how Marlow reacts to his death. I loved the paragraph after Kurtz's death that Marlow talks about Kurtz being admirable for still having something to say about life before he dies. Do you think that some character deaths within these books are similar in any way? I.e., maybe Simon and Kurtz - both seen as insane and unlikable but still have significant deaths. I also think maybe back to the zebra's horrific drawn out death in Life of Pi could be compared as well.

What do you think? I'd love to discuss a few of my favourite books and how they are related. I know that Garland has straight up said he was inspired by Heart of Darkness and Lord of the Flies, so I couldn't help but relate those. Not too sure about Life of Pi fitting in as well, but I'm interested to hear other opinions as well :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dpo12l/spoiler_reread_heart_of_darknesscomparisons/,2019-10-31 14:06:57,8,10,books
49guci,"Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad Discussion","So I just now finished Heart of Darkness, and wanted to share my thoughts and get yours as well. I'm about to go to sleep now, but I'll definitely see your responses in the morning. For now, I'll start the discussion by sharing my own impressions of the book. If you're short on time or patience one, I'll leave a Tl:Dr at the bottom. Finally, apologies for any typos as this was written on mobile.

To put it plainly, I really loved this book. Joseph Conrad is a word smith unlike any I've quite encountered before. Perhaps the fact that he had to learn English gave him a greater appreciation for it's nuances. Whatever the case may be, his prose is something special, and as a hobbiest writer myself, I can only pray to one day write half as good as he. His discourse on the Thames was exactly the kind of intellectual musing I love to see, when done well, his speculation of chickens falling victim to the 'cause of progress' was superb, and his description of the African interior was truly engrossing.

I've dipped my toe into these late 19th and early 20th century works as of late. Many of them, to me, feel mellow dramatic and over expesitionary. I've found it difficult to invest in the stories and even more so in the characters. This simply isn't true with Joseph Conrad, further evidence in my suspicions that I've not been reading the best the genre has to offer. (I'm looking at you Jules Verne and Bram Stoker. Possibly Kafka too, but I'm willing to give him a second, better prepared look.) I found the character of Marlow sufficient, an easily sympathetic protagonist with his own perspective on the world he finds himself in, and even further fleshed out as, per one of the stories themes, some of his darkest instincts are revealed. Conrad's best character work however, is no doubt in the vivid descriptions of his side characters. From the knitting woman at the company office, to the scheming, staff wielding Pilgrims, to the wild tribal witch doctors, Conrad uses adjectives and phrases I've seen and will continue to see in works, yet molds them together to form an interesting silhouette of a character. Some aspects are caricature-esque, yet generally there is enough depth to keep you invested. His handling of the native peoples is particularly fascinating-he neither condemns them as bestial 'subhumans', not tries to redeem them as 'noble savages'. He presents them, again per the books theme, as hold overs of a savage human past, a past that remains a part of us even now. 
 
This idea and perhaps more importantly, how it's presented, is what cements this book as a truly unique experience. At its onset, I thought perhaps it might be a social commentary on the Western world's assumed superiority over the wildernesses primitive peoples. Especially in the earlier acts, it appeared it might also do this from the lens of comedy, albeit rather dark comedy at that. And while the comedic elements are there and enjoyable, the latter half of this short novel quickly dispels these notions. With the arrival of Kurtz on the scene, it quickly becomes a series of revelations both in the plot and subtext that I can only describe as intense. In the words of the young Russian, this book went on to 'expand my mind', and superbly accomplishes it's desired effect. 

Criticism are few and far between. The comedy at time for me did seem a little much for what I thought was going to be a dramatic story, but, as I said, the latter half more than balances that aspect. The prose and arrangement of this story is of the more complex, meatier variety, and so for that I found myself lost at points both in the plot and subtext, though I'll chalk this up to my own intellectual lacking. If anything, it gives me a reason to read it again. Having said that, I'll take this time to ask you, the community, one question that is specifically nagging at me. That is, what prompted Marlow's loyalty to Kurtz? Upon his arrival, Marlow can clearly see that this man has committed atrocities, raiding villages and sticking the conquered heads on pikes. His inner dialogue suggest he disapproves, yet at other times he seems to hold some kind of grudging admiration for the ivory trader, and even sides with him against the manager and Pilgrims. What is the dichotomy that we're seeing here?

Tl:Dr To sum up, this book was a fantastic read, and I highly recommend it. Conrad's prose is one of the more enjoyable I've read, directing the English language with a precision and power that few native speakers have. The majority of his characters are vivid, if perhaps shallow, and the concepts and the themes he presents are in parts captivating and disturbing. A must read for those wishing to expand their intellectual horizons.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/49guci/heart_of_darkness_by_joseph_conrad_discussion/,2016-03-08 04:52:24,19,32,books

8fcdb5,Conrad - Heart of Darkness,"I finished this last night, and unlike some things I've read, this really made me want to discuss the work further. I've been trying to read analysis that isn't sparknotes (such as http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/eng109/Modernism_Heart2007.htm ) but that seems hard to find unless you know the right phrase to search for. Anyways.  

There are two things that stand out to me as worth discussion (though I have little to add to the discussion). The first is Kurtz' dying phrase, ""The horror! The horror!"" I'm not sure what meaning is to be had from this. Was this a reflection on his own life, a plea of regret (similar: Kurtz reconciliation with The Russion, giving Marlow his letters)? Was it a sudden existential realization, the terror of death (natural, but not really present thematically)? Some disgusted remark on mortality (the indignity that a god such as Kurtz should die)? Perhaps a continuation of another theme present in the work, obsession to the point of insanity? Perhaps a summary judgment by Conrad on colonialism. I'm not sure. But this phrase ties into my second point, which is Marlow's interaction with the widow (betrothed?).   

For me, these last few pages were a major section of the book. This is one of the few places that Marlow admits having emotional reactions, where he seems especially human (contrast: he is the only calm person when the boat is attacked). Marlow didn't really have a plan for the remaining notes from Kurtz, and he doesn't really know how to respond to the widow, even though a year has passed since he got back. I feel like he finds the social engagement stressful and starts echoing back what she says, at a loss for what to say to her.  As their meeting concludes, is it a moral failing on Marlow's part when he can't tell her Kurtz' last words, and instead tells her exactly what she wants to hear? I'm not sure. But I think the narrative, as told by Marlow, is perhaps his way of coping, that telling others this story will relieve some amount of guilt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8fcdb5/conrad_heart_of_darkness/,2018-04-27 15:09:59,9,13,books

This book was the next on my list that I was readily available through an online library (trying to keep my costs low when its not a relatively newer book), and was excited to start! 

One thing I notice right off the bat, and I guess which is actually my biggest complaint is the narration style of the book and how he provides no real line breaks between character dialogue and the Marlows own inner monologue. 

I will admit that once they reached the congo, that the pacing of the book definitely took a turn for the better, and was a part that I thoroughly enjoyed.

I stated that I hated the heart of darkness by Joseph conrad, I dropped it on the 35th page. But after returning to it after encouraging statements on from users, I can say that they were right. The the rest of the book is amazing in many ways, including the metaphors and symbols that were so aggravating actually improved my experience with the book a lot. In fact, I feel as though the rest of the book made the first third make more sense to me as I felt that first part was meant to be dull to showcase normal life while Marlow went further in the further he went from society and into this bizarre and horror filled world at the heart of which is kurtz who resembles in my opinion the very act of the colonization of Africa itself, its very heart. And at the end when no one cared about marlows story showed the sheer apathy the people felt at the time, while kurtz fiancee also made feel that the pathetic belief of the common people that colonization is this amazing and wonderfully thing, and that they could not handle the truth of it.

As this is a very contemplative book, I took this question  to heart, and poured endless hours pondering if he did the right thing. As a ethics lover, I question the morality of such act. Is the lie inheritly unethical? Or one should consider the ends only? Is living with truth worth the shattering of your lovely crafted dream? If holding the stick that will destroy the belief of someone else, knowing it for a lie, would you destroy it anyway? 
I realized this question in specific is treated on of my favorit movies, Angel's egg. Where the protagonist is forced to the same choice, but chooses to destroy the belief. I wonder if Mamoru Oshii was inspired somehow by Joseph Conrad.

3s89bk,Heart of Darkness is such a quotable book!,"I'm reading Heart of Darkness for the first time in years, and I've been blown away by Conrad's writing. There are so many passages that I've just had to stop and consider. Here are my two favorite so far. It's one big block, but really he makes two separate points:

“I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavor of mortality in lies,—which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world—what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see—you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream—making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams. . . .""

9m0ghu,[Spoiler] What do you think of this unique Heart of Darkness theory on Kurtz?,"All throughout my reading, I, as others, assumed Kurtz was a real character based on a real person. Just recently, I heard a perspective that completely shocked me and changed my view. Insanity is a central theme of the novel, and of course, a person that has lost their mind would likely attempt such things as inventing a fictional character to cover for a time they cannot remember. What I am proposing is that the extreme solitude and isolation of the jungle (combined with the immense pressures it still applied) drove Marlow to forget what he was doing and align himself with the natives for a period. Given the descent into savagery experienced by all of the other pilgrims, it is not a stretch to believe Marlow himself would have gone insane; the scenes in which he dances around as he waited for the boat to be fixed suggest he certainly wasn't perfectly rational. Marlow is also racist at numerous points through the book - he may be against imperialism in retrospect, living in the civilized city, but in the jungle, these behaviors change easily, and all the slurs he uses against the natives, all the suggestions that they are nothing more than an object, seem to imply he did not see them as equal to him. That being said, he does possess the ability to respect them and work with them, as 'Kurtz' did, shown in his treatment of the dead steerer. All this being considered, with all the similarities between Marlow and Kurtz, I think it is plausible that Kurtz is just part of Marlow's imagination. Marlow uses him as a way to distance himself from his inner savagery, to remind himself that the second side of him may be a separate person entirely in terms of his actions, but he is still the same person regardless, and the savage element of him lurks within, ready to break out, no matter how aware he is of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9m0ghu/spoiler_what_do_you_think_of_this_unique_heart_of/,2018-10-06 23:05:15,10,9,books

I suppose that the most thought provoking about what I read is that *this sort of thing happens today.* Dehumanization is something that you'd expect to see in the past or in fiction, but never in the real world today.

78cvxj,Finished listening to Heart of Darkness and am whelmed. Did i do something wrong?,"Hi all, 
I'm a new music teacher (like less than 2 months) and have found myself with about 3 hours a day where I just drive because of my long commute. To help fill the time between listening to NPR and Biggie I downloaded some audio books. The first one I listened to was Heart of Darkness and to be honest I feel that I didn't get it. There wasn't anything about the book that really impressed me in any way, the way the narrative was brought forth as a story told to a group that we are told didn't want to to hear it didn't feel compelling, nor was there any real pay off for me, either with the discovery of Kurtz, the way he died, or Marlow's interaction with his widow. I was neither overwhelmed or underwhelmed, just... whelmed. It felt like nothing truly mattered because everything was awful and horrifying and nothing changes. 

I am forced to wonder then if this might have been the point. From reading other people's perspective on this book and from Thug Notes I gather that the main idea was that both the savages and the Europeans contained their own heart of darkness, one symbolized by the jungle and one by the dealings between people. Could the ""rambling storyteller"" approach be a commentary on how neither will change? Even though civilization can take over, there will still be darkness, so what is there to do but talk about a trip, recognizing all the awful things but never actually doing anything about it. There was no change in any of the character's, no growth, no one learned anything productive. Kurtz was still crazy when he died, and Marlow was simply wearied by the thought of everything he experienced, was not empowered or given the tools to change anything. He received knowledge without purpose and could not bring himself to act on it. The listeners to the story never wanted to hear it in the first place and only interact when Marlow insults their professions and so nothing comes of them either. Nothing that happened to Marlow even made for a good, enticing story and the fact that he told it for over 3 hours only makes it that much more useless in it's quest to prove a point to the listeners in the book.

So, is this the point, that nothing matters and everything is bad so why bother, or am I just completely missing everything that is really happening and I should listen (or physically read) again?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/78cvxj/finished_listening_to_heart_of_darkness_and_am/,2017-10-24 02:36:37,14,2,books
3fs0d5,Thoughts on Heart of Darkness (and Apocalypse Now),"Recently read Heart of Darkness. 

I enjoyed it. But was surprised by how little impact I felt in the moment of Kurtz dieing. Having already seen the movie I was expecting more build up to the moment of the 'the horror' line being uttered. Rather anticlimactic to be honest, and in that moment I felt disappointed.

I think the main reason for feeling this is how well it's done in the movie. There, it's a gradual descent into chaos. Heart of Darkness felt like more like 'blacks have it shitty, most of the whites are morons' over and over, there was no descent.

After thinking about it, I find the reason for this difference between the two is that, the 'the horror' line is actually referring to two different things in the movie and in the book.

In the movie, the scenes beforehand graphically display the horror Kurtz is talking about, we are restricting ourselves to the war in Vietnam and circumstances that arise from it (Kurtz and his natives).  
In the book, 'the horror' is actually about life [in general]. The Congo is merely a backdrop. Which actually makes sense considering how what was happening there was not something unusual; it was happening everywhere in the world. Vietnam on the other hand, an argument could be made that the specific combination of powers at play was unique (I can only think of Soviets in Afgh as a suitable comparison, maybe?). 

I may have been disappointed in the moment of Kurtz dieing, but the next two pages made up for it. Here's an excerpt:

> Droll thing life is - that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself - that comes too late - a crop of unextinguishable [sic] regrets. I have wrestled with death. [...] I was within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. [...] He had summed up - he had judged.

Reading some of the comments from old threads that I looked up on Heart of Darkness, there does not seem to be a consensus on what 'the horror' is referring to. One person wrote he thought it was Kurtz imagining nobody learning of his achievements...
I think the quoted paragraph - among other things - shows that Kurtz is talking about life. Of course, it's Marlowe saying these things, but considering both characters are written by the same person (aka the author) I think it's safe to transfer the intention over.

Anyways, I may be talking total nonsense, was wondering what others are thinking.

tl;dr what are the differences between the book and the movie in what they're referring to with 'the horror

7ubnvn,(SPOILER) Just finished Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and here is my impressions.,"I apologize for my bad English and such a bad impressions. Hope you guys can bare it with me. The book as a whole, is very dark and depressing. A little background is that I was introduced to *HoD* by the video game, *Spec Ops: The Line* (2012), and then the Vietnam War epic, *Apocalypse Now* (1979).

And above all comparisons while, all three has different themes, settings and work as a standalone, I feel personally that *HoD* won for me.

Unlike *AN*, *HoD* is more emotional resonant (especially towards the end) with the themes are much more clearer than the movie. And this is where *AN* pales in comparison. It makes me understands Mr. Kurtz’s character even more. I have to admit that the narrative is very draining. Considering that it was a frame narrative, thus it explains that I get to finish the book in one sitting unlike my first encounter. But those things I just mentioned is what makes me appreciate and love *HoD* a lot more. You will understand why the characters behave that way and Conrad’s usage of the prose is very powerful. Like in *AN*, I just felt that my time was wasted for that very flat ending. Sure, the soundtrack is amazing, the acting is very realistic and the visuals are well-done. But that’s just it. The ending is just flat and it didn’t pay off.

I closed the book and it kept me thinking about something. I don’t know what it is, but it was something. I do recommend that EVERYONE to read this book, at least once in a lifetime. This is a very short book, but beneath it, lies a thick and dense 115 pages filled with allegorical passages like the book itself.

21iyen,Heart of Darkness a Comedy?,"I'm a college student writing a paper for a literary theory class and had a question for my fellow redditors concerning Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. When re-reading Heart of Darkness, I had the thought that many of the events happening to or around Marlow were over exaggerated. To me, over exaggeration is usually reserved for either comedic or satiric purposes. This leads me to believe that in a certain way, Heart of Darkness can be viewed as a satirical or comedic work of Fiction. Now, I know there are many critics, students, and teachers that might disagree but I have taken to the internet to see if there's anyone who's either had my same idea or could see why it could be viewed as such.

1q5mvg,A question about Heart of Darkness and 1984,What are the links between Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and 1984 by George Orwell in terms of their social and historical context. Really struggling to wrap my head around this in relation to my coursework.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q5mvg/a_question_about_heart_of_darkness_and_1984/,2013-11-08 04:34:57,7,0,books
5oeg5q,Links Between Heart of Darkness and The Brothers Karamazov,"I was reading BK for fun while I was reading HoD for a class, and I stumbled across a number of eerily similar passages in the two. Sure enough, I discovered that Conrad had actually read the French translation of BK a few years before HoD came out. All this ended up becoming my final essay for a class, and I thought you guys might enjoy seeing some of the passages in parallel. If you haven't read them, feel free to turn back now. (Note: These quotes are from the Pevear / Volokhonsky translation of BK.)

----

I argued that this passage from BK inspired Heart of Darkness outright.

[Dostoevsky, P. 303-304](#s ""No science or self-interest will ever enable people to share their property and their rights among themselves without offense. Each will always think his share too small, and they will keep murmuring they will envy and destroy one another. … For everyone now strives most of all to separate his person, wishing to experience the fullness of life within himself, and yet what comes of all his efforts is not the fullness of life but full suicide, for instead of the fullness of self-definition, they fall into complete isolation. For all men in our age are separated into units, each seeks seclusion in his own hole, each withdraws from the others, hides himself, and hides what he has, and ends by pushing himself away from people and pushing people away from himself. He accumulates wealth in solitude, thinking: how strong, how secure I am now; and does not see, madman as he is, that the more he accumulates, the more he sinks into suicidal impotence. For he is accustomed to relying only on himself, he has separated his unit from the whole, he has accustomed his soul to not believing in people’s help, in people or mankind, and now only trembles lest his money and his acquired privileges perish. Everywhere now the human mind has begun laughably not to understand that a man’s true security lies not in his own solitary effort, but in the general wholeness of humanity. But there must needs come a term to this horrible isolation, and everyone will all at once realize how unnaturally they have separated themselves from one another. Such will be the spirit of the time, and they will be astonished that they sat in darkness for so long, and did not see the light."")

These same ideas of isolation, wealth, absurdity, and an inevitable end were echoed in this passage from HoD:

[Conrad, P. 72](#s ""Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word ‘ivory’ rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I’ve never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion."")

----

[Conrad, P. 74](#s ""They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as everything else – as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had. They intrigued and slandered and hated each other on that account."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 313](#s ""For the world says: “You have needs, therefore satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the noblest and richest men. Do not be afraid to satisfy them but even increase them”—this is the current teaching of the world. And in this they see freedom. But what comes of this right to increase one’s needs? For the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; for the poor, envy and murder."")

The last line is actually embodied in Heart of Darkness. The poor are embodied in the lost pilgrims. Kurtz showcases the whole process, going through maniacal states of envy and murder to achieve his wealth and ending up isolated and spiritually dead.

---- 

The following passages don't need elaboration; the connections are pretty obvious.

----

[Conrad, P. 135](#s ""I wasn’t arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear – concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible intensity."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 69](#s ""Evildoing should not only be permitted but should even be acknowledged as the most necessary and most intelligent solution."")

----

[Conrad, P. 137](#s ""But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries [Kurtz] had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham distinction, of all the appearances of success and power."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 108](#s ""Can there be beauty in Sodom? Believe me, for the vast majority of people, that’s just where beauty lies—did you know that secret? The terrible thing is that beauty is not only fearful, but also mysterious. Here the devil is struggling with God, and the battlefield is the human heart."")

----

[Dostoevsky, P. 44](#s ""Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern a truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others. Not respecting anyone, he ceases to love, and having no love, he gives himself up to passions and coarse pleasures, in order to occupy and amuse himself, and in his vices reaches complete bestiality, and it all comes from lying continually to himself and others."")

[Conrad, P. 143](#s ""He had faith – don’t you see? – he had the faith. He could get himself to believe in anything."")

----

Overall, I thought Heart of Darkness sought to elaborate on and explore the philosophy from The Brothers Karamazov. It was an interpretation of Conrad's own experiences in the lens of Dostoevsky.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5oeg5q/links_between_heart_of_darkness_and_the_brothers/,2017-01-16 23:45:53,0,9,books

I have a general rule that I try to give a book 100 pages before calling it quits. I have been pleasantly surprised many times by how much a book changes pace when I give it a chance, but with Dark Rivers of the Heart, I should have called it much much sooner. I understand that the narrator isn't always a good guy, but a line has to be drawn when every single female character has had their breasts described in detail, and one of the narrators threatens to rape a five year old girl (yes, really). Its really a shame because the general plot is very interesting, but ruined with constant verbal violence against women. I'm not even sure if I'm willing to try anything else written by Koontz.

7p4rdo,"Heart of Darkness is a pretty great classic! But my gosh, this 100-page novella took me so long to read because of its slow start...","I have to read this book for an English course and I'd recommend it to anyone that loves wordy, well-written, poetic, slow, and descriptive literature. It reminded me a lot of Lord of the Flies by William Golding, although I dare say I enjoyed that book more than this one.

I think what hurts this book for me is its slow first part. In the first sentences you are bombarded with complex descriptions of the setting and nautical terms that are hard to explain in a few words. Everything about the first few pages were hard to follow in my opinion. It got a bit better, but not so much. One night I spent around an hour and a half reading only 15 pages of the book. I got pretty hopeless. I kept feeling as though I would never enjoy it and I thought the book was incredibly pretentious.

However, after a few tries, I finally reached the second part, and the book instantly started becoming a lot better. The plot started to move along and the author's style seemed a lot more simplistic than it was in the first part. It still was by no means simple, but it was a lot easier to follow. Before I knew it, one night I read the whole third part of the book in an hour and a half. I was heavily invested in the story by that point, and the ending was incredible and hard to stop thinking about. 

I think the moral of the story here is that there are some books that just don't resonate with you in the first chunk, but if you commit to reading them, you're in for some great art. I similarly had this problem with (guess what) Lord of the Flies when I read it a while back. The first chapter was really hard to follow and sit through, then all of a sudden, I became more and more intrigued until I was completely invested near the end of the book. I dunno. There's something about old books that make them have this horrible, hopeless start, but when you invest your time into them you can really start to see why they are so well liked. 

What about you? Have there been some books that were incredibly hard to get into, but once you perservered, you really liked them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7p4rdo/heart_of_darkness_is_a_pretty_great_classic_but/,2018-01-09 04:49:40,10,28,books
25z4cv,Some Help/Discussion on Heart of Darkness -- I'm Teaching HoD to High School Seniors!!,"Without going into too much background, I'm building a final response/essay assignment for the students who have finished reading HoD.  They need to demonstrate understanding, construct a reasoned interpretation, and be able to analyze the text.

I'm wondering if you could discuss some of the following questions so I could get ideas about whether I should use them or not, and what direction people go when they try to answer these questions. As a class, we have discussed these things in some way at some point along the way:

1. Throughout the book, Marlow seems to contradict himself when at some points he is sympathetic to the plight of the natives and the abuses they are going through, or positive in his descriptions of the natives while being negative in his descriptions of the Europeans; yet he quickly turns around and calls them ""savages"".  According to Marlow, what makes a 'savage', who can be a 'savage', and how is that different than how the Europeans typically used the word? Use references to the text to prove your point.

2. Is Marlow a hero? Why or why not?

3. The author sets us up with a simplistic view that all humans fall into one of three categories; or perhaps, that they exist someplace between, or within multiple categories: The Believers, the Superstitious (the Savages), and the Scientists.  Chose one of the following characters and discuss what category(ies) they belong in: Marlow, Kurtz, the Intended, the Native Mistress, the Manager, the Natives, the Fireman, Kurtz's Savages.

4. Several prominent authors and other commentators have argued that this book is racist, and that it should not be taught in schools.  Discuss this idea, take a side, but address both sides of the issue while using the text to support your answer.

I hope you can take some time to think about one or more of these questions and spit out an answer.  Thanks.

But it also seemed they were angry at him. It seemed to me that natives wanted to prevent Kurtz from leaving, with them attacking the boat and all.

3. What's with the lady witch doctor? Was this Kurtze's lover or something? 

4. Whats the deal with the papers? Marlow mentions that he might have gotten the papers mixed up. It seems to me that Kurtz wanted to keep some of the ivory for himself and bring home some wealth for his family. Did the company steal from Kurtz or did Kurtz steal from the company?

Hemmingway's work (can not confirm for myself, but I only read The Old Man and the Sea)
Kite Runner (can kind of confirm) and A Thousand Splendid Suns (haven't read this one)
Johnny Got his Gun (fits the description perfectly, in my opinion and from my experience, next to ASOIAF THE one book, that must be on the list)

>Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies…*especially* the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood *actually* starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold.  
>  
>Yet, even as Jade drags us into her dark fever dream, a surprising and intimate portrait emerges… a portrait of the scared and traumatized little girl beneath the Jason Voorhees mask: angry, yes, but also a girl who easily cries, fiercely loves, and desperately wants a home. A girl whose feelings are too big for her body.

ptbat0,Just finished The Song of Achilles and it was a lot more heart-breaking than I could’ve ever imagined…,"I had heard this book breaks you into pieces but I didn’t know how…

All along, Achilles is being painted as this impenetrable beast who’s impossible to destroy, how his pride is of importance to him, and how at the same time he loses his mind and wants to set fire to the world when his Patroclus dies, how he willingly and lovingly walks into his own death. the prophecy was fulfilled through the most heart-breaking way. they were each other’s doom all along, Achilles died because he was mourning the loss of Patroclus and Patroclus died because of Achilles’ arrogance.

I also liked the irony that all along, Patroclus was “the best”, not Achilles, simply because of his kind heart and beautiful soul.

The bond they created over the years, from teenagers to young men, and how they fell in love through pain, grief, sorrow, and heart wrench is just soul-crushingly beautiful.

“In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.”

10f90t1,"Dark Matter by Blake Crouch is a sci-fi thriller that is way too fun to put down! A thriller done just right - it's extremely gripping and surprising while also following its own rules, and maybe most importantly it's got so much heart - the characters are so fun to root for!","This is my go-to recommendation whenever a friend tells me they are in a reading slump. Absolutely one of the most exciting, staying-up-too-late-reading inducing books I've ever read!

Here's the setup (back of the book style, but in spoiler tags in case you like to go in totally blank):

>!Jason Dessen is walking home one night when he realizes he is being followed. A strange man in a geisha mask abducts him at gunpoint, drives him to an abandoned building, takes his phone and clothes, and injects him with a strange drug. !<

>!When Jason wakes up, he’s surrounded by strangers congratulating him for something he’s supposed to have achieved. In this world he’s not a college professor - they say he’s created something that seems impossible. He looks for his wife - but in this world she says she’s not his wife. His son was never born.!<

>!Is this world real, or a dream? And no matter what this place is, how can he get back to the people he loves?!<

There are a couple of things that really make Dark Matter stand out.

It uses a few different kinds of thriller hook to keep you invested, all in the same book. First, it sets up a mystery that the reader will figure out before the characters. It's so exciting to explore and keep turning the pages in the first third of the book to figure out that first mystery. Later, it drops a big twist that most readers will absolutely not see coming - but it makes perfect sense with the rules of the world that have been established to that point, so instead of it being frustrating and coming out of nowhere, it feels absolutely spot on, and puts the characters in a really tight spot. And third, the story is told from a first-person perspective, which really succeeds at both making the action feel real and getting us to root for Jason. The pacing is incredible.

Second, the relationship in the book between Jason and his wife is really well developed. The relationship feels both real and just about as perfect as any relationship can be - and that makes it so, so compelling to root for Jason to figure this thing out and get back to his awesome wife and son.

This isn't a book with tons of new sci-fi ideas or big new groundbreaking themes - its about being excited to turn the next page. If you are looking for a book to break out of your reading slump, or just want something fun to read - this one is for you!

I guess I was expecting something like the bride test, which is pretty light hearted and I liked it a lot (haven't read the kiss quotient lol), so I was kinda knocked out by how dark the book was. I went in without being prepared at all and came out in shambles.

For context, I am an Asian (Chinese) girl who plays the piano (as a hobby) and is going through a lot of emotional/mental burnout in school and work that my parents aren't acknowledging.

A few years back I hit a peak in my piano playing and I really loved it and stuff. My parents didn't really push me to do a lot better but encouraged me to continue playing and signed me up for some competitions and stuff. During some of the competitions/performances I messed up and my performance started to become more and more unstable to the point where I developed a lot of stage fright that I was gonna mess up and I would disappoint people and embarrass my parents and me.

Luckily, my parents were fine with me stopping my piano competitions and performances in general because they didn't want me to pursue a career in music anyways, so I was able to pull out of that relatively unscathed except for the fact that I currently see my piano playing as a burden and don't really like touching it that much lol.

Currently, I'm going through a lot of stress and burnout from school and work and just am very uncertain/turbulent about my future career and life. I don't believe my parents understand this at all and tell me to just suck it up because ""I'll get over it if I work hard enough"". The problem is that I just can't and started actively avoiding working on projects that can improve my skills.

Anyways, I started reading The Heart Principle and I just resonated with the book so much (other than the romance part lmao). The way Anna's sister and mother talked to her reminded me so much of my parents and reading this just felt like reading my parents talk to me.

This book gave me so much stress and anxiety as I read it and I keep seeing a lot of people on Goodreads saying it doesn't accurately portray burnout or that there are too much suffering or that the sister doesn't seem like a real character at all. I felt a lot of stuff from this book and honestly feel like the suffering is exactly the amount I see some of the adults in my life go through.

All in all, I'm so glad I read this book because it's like a shoutout to how I'm living my life and, despite all the anxiety I went through while reading this book, it is an incredible book that I feel like a lot of people like me can resonate with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wdtj7p/i_just_read_the_heart_principle_and_im_so_upset/,2022-08-01 21:48:20,2,18,books
tyy7lj,Hiroshima by John Hersey is one of the most saddening and heart-wrenching book I have ever read in my life.,"I've been really stoked about Japanese literature recently, much to my passion to take it up as my Masters in the future, and I've been exploring a lot from Tales of Ise, No Longer Human and other literature that archived many historical moments in Japan, but I never expected how much this book has given me such an insight on the effects of war and it affects the lives of innocent people in ways they we're never able to comprehend.

Hiroshima by John Hersey is reportage that retells the memories of 6 hibakusha or ""person affected by the bomb"" during the exact time an atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima. There was so many in-depth details that Hersey noted on each of their accounts during that time. From a woman who only just want to talk to her coworker, but got plummeted by a huge bookshelf that made her suffer an agonizing pain for weeks without help from anyone that rotted and debilitated her legs, a mother of two who almost lost her children from the rubble and did everything she can to make sure they don't die from debris or radiation, and horrifying descriptions of mounds of bodies of people, and unfortunately children who were assigned to clear of some lanes for raid spots, either burnt alive, their flesh spewings from the intense burns of radiation, or constant pus flowing out of their injuries, there was so many suffering, tragedy, pain I felt in this novel that I just couldn't finish it straight.

It took me two weeks to finish it just because each time I opened up and read something there is always either a person barely surviving from the effects of radiation, or someone scared, and lonely in the dark, smoky, hot environment and the stench of burning flesh and radiation that couldn't comprehend anything that has happened to them. Imagine you're just living your life, probably reading a book, watering plants, playing with your friends or hugging your mother, than all of a sudden in one split of a second a burst of light flows through everywhere around you, and in an instant all you see is a desolate land of ashes, broken structures, black clouds and unimaginable agony all around you, I haven't experienced anything like this, but just imagining it is something that I will never ever forget in my life.

And it also made me wonder of the people in Ukraine right now, I despise politicians that will let their own people suffer under their self-interest and greed at the cost of unncessary bloodshed, violence and gore. And just like the hibakusha, Ukrainians are all just victims of war, surviving the onslaught of a violent man that willingy obliges to destroy the innocent lives of people withour considering how much life they still have to flourish only to be disrupted by gunshots, explosions and mental turmoils.

Hersey is a legend for making such an appalling and eye-opening autobiography towards the inner tragedies of war. Its depressing that the hibakusha become the ""testament"" for people to see why these forms of conflicts should never be considered, when all we they have to consider is if the innocent life of a person is worth destorying for our own interest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tyy7lj/hiroshima_by_john_hersey_is_one_of_the_most/,2022-04-08 07:41:34,18,21,books
gzp5a5,A man with a beautiful and pure heart lives in an ugly and racist world. This book is my most prized possession gifted to me on my 12th birthday.,"[The book is the biography of George W. Carver](https://i.imgur.com/WeKv0y9.jpg) written in Marathi language (The closest relative to Sanskrit). 


The book is very colourfully illustrated by watercolour paintings. Here are some examples :

1. [The receipt of George's mother being bought as a slave.](https://i.imgur.com/pZsP9Yk.jpg)
2. [George chasing butterflies in the garden. And a picture of his owner Moses.](https://i.imgur.com/BjHg17b.jpg)
3. [George observing a Bird's nesting process.](https://i.imgur.com/XXm0CGi.jpg)


The words chosen by the author are incredibly selective and beautiful and the magic might be lost in translation in my opinion. 
To give you an example, to refer to African Americans she doesn't use the word ""Blacks"" or the ""N-race"" word but goes on to invent a word -  कृष्णवर्णीय (Means of Lord Krishna's colour). Krishna is shown in several Hindu depictions as a dark skinned person.


[A page that really broke and haunted me as a 12 year old reading this book was this one.](https://i.imgur.com/cwYqriq.jpg) It depicts a very young George witnessing a horrible thing.
""It's about evening. The sun has already set. Some people are excitedly lighting a bonfire. Some people are dragging a coloured person towards it. The mob has sticks to push him into the fire. Everytime he starts to run from being burnt alive, the  mob shouts and poke their sticks. Some people are lifting their children on their shoulders for them to clearly be able to enjoy the sight of a lesser human being burnt alive. George was horrified by the ugly faces of the crowd in the light of the fire.""

Being an Indian kid, I had known nothing about what racism is and had no idea about the civil war history. We later learnt that in history class in 10th grade.

[The last page of this book is really touching to me.](https://i.imgur.com/Vg6HrOO.jpg) As we go on a journey about the Peanut Man's inventions and his selfless sacrifices for the farmers of Tuskegee, it ends with a beautiful message.

Rest in Peace, George W. Carver.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gzp5a5/a_man_with_a_beautiful_and_pure_heart_lives_in_an/,2020-06-09 15:19:54,13,73,books
2kn4jd,"Just finished The Hellbound Heart, and it was fantastic. What are you guys reading this Halloween?","
I spent the last couple of hours reading The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker and I must say, I could hardly put it down. It was frightening, fun and macabre all at once. I had seen the movie (Hellraiser) but aside from the portrayal of the Cenobites it really didn't do the novella justice. Not only was the story well-conceived and well-executed, but the prose included lots of juicy, delicious bits like this:

>Well, here he was. They could save each other, the way the poets promised lovers should. He was mystery, he was darkness, he was all she had dreamed of. And if she would only free him he would service her - oh yes - until her pleasure reached that threshold that, like all thresholds, was a place where the strong grew stronger, and the weak perished. Pleasure was pain there, and vice versa. And he knew it well enough to call it home.

>Spring, if it lingers more than a week beyond its span, starts to hunger for summer to end the days of perpetual promise. Summer in its turn soon begins to sweat for something to quench its heat, and the mellowest of autumns will tire of gentility at last, and ache for a quick sharp frost to kill its fruitfulness. Even winter — the hardest season, the most implacable — dreams, as February creeps on, of the flame that will presently melt it away. Everything tires with time, and starts to seek some opposition, to save it from itself.

And my personal favorite line:

>No tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering.

So what are you guys reading to get spooked this Halloween season? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2kn4jd/just_finished_the_hellbound_heart_and_it_was/,2014-10-29 03:34:07,7,2,books
4wthf9,The Stormlight Archive has filled the ASOIAF-sized hole in my heart for now.,"  I have been waiting *years* for George R.R. Martin's *The Winds of Winter* to come out, and at this point and time I've pretty much just given up. I love fantasy novels (have read *Lord of The Rings* and *The Hobbit* many times and have read countless others including Wheel of Time and a few Dark Tower books) but the ASOIAF series, to me personally, is incredible, although the latest book was the weakest of the five.


 However, after so many delays on TWoW, I decided to take a break from the Fantasy genre altogether. But then, a year later on a thread here on this subreddit, someone recommended a series by Brandon Sanderson called *The Stormlight Archive,* so I went to my local Barnes and Noble and read the first chapter. 


  After finishing that first chapter, I immediately bought *The Way of Kings* and have so far read 500 pages of it in about 2 weeks. I'm seriously hooked! I knew Sanderson would do a good job because he has done fine work with finishing The Wheel of Time series, but I did not expect just how good it would be. I don't want to spoil anything for people that haven't read it, but while it may have a slower pace and less twists and turns than ASOIAF, plenty still happens and I have definitely grown attached to all the main POV characters, Kaladin especially.


  While their writing styles and world building are pretty different, there are many similarities; magic, mythical creatures and lands, no ""main"" protagonist, very mysterious antagonist. And honestly, the best part is the fact that Sanderson is quite consistent with how quick he releases his books, one book about every 2 years.


  So although there are only 2 books in this series out at the moment, they are both 1000+ and the third is just around the corner. Although i'm barely halfway through the first book, I highly recommend this series to anyone that is fatigued by waiting for The Winds of Winter, or even if you just need a new fantasy series to get into!

6i6nsm,"Cuore (Heart), by Edmondo de Amicis","I’m reading a remarkable Italian novel called Cuore, written by Edmondo de Amicis (""Cuore"" is the Italian word for ""Heart""). It was published in 1886, shortly after the Italian unification, and it soon achieved enormous popularity in Italy and abroad and became a classic of children’s literature. In less than three months 41 editions were needed in Italy and it was immediately translated to 18 languages and published throughout Europe. By 1923 it had been translated all over the world and had surpassed the at the time extraordinary figure of a million copies.
 
The book, inspired by the author’s two sons, is an imaginary diary written by Enrico Bottini, a 9-year-old schoolboy in the third form of an elementary school in Turin, in the north of Italy. As the preface puts it:
 
>This book is specially dedicated to the boys of the elementary schools between the ages of nine and thirteen years, and might be entitled: “The Story of a Scholastic Year written by a Pupil of the Third Class of an Italian Municipal School.” In saying written by a pupil of the third class, I do not mean to say that it was written by him exactly as it is printed. He noted day by day in a copy-book, as well as he knew how, what he had seen, felt, thought in the school and outside the school; his father at the end of the year wrote these pages on those notes, taking care not to alter the thought, and preserving, when it was possible, the words of his son. Four years later the boy, being then in the lyceum, added something of his own, drawing on his memories, still fresh, of persons and of things.

Generations of Italian children were raised with this book, where it was required reading at schools. Because of its patriotic and nationalistic values, it remained popular even during the Fascist regime. At the same time, because of its emphasis on social issues such as poverty (the author would later join the Italian Socialist Party) the book was also very influential in the countries of the Eastern bloc in Europe, and later became also popular in China and other Asian countries, and in Latin America.
 
De Amicis’ aim was to teach moral and civic values, such as kindness, compassion, humility, respect, love for family and friends, solidarity between social classes, work ethic and patriotism. He used very moving plots and language: this book is a tear-fest if you are susceptible to sentimentality, sometimes tears of sadness but often because of feel-good emotion. If you don’t like sentimentality you are not going to like the book. It is utterly and unashamedly sentimental, hence its title, and also didactic. The book is easy to mock now, being too sentimental, preachy, utopic and idealistic for modern sensitivities, depicting a world where there is clear right and wrong instead of moral complexity, but if you can see it in its context and don’t mind that it’s old-fashioned you may find it very readable, moving and charming. As someone said in a Goodreads review: “a child who has read this book could not become a bad person”.
 
In time, the book also faced criticism as some of its values were contested, starting with Umberto Eco’s famous “In Praise of Franti” in 1968 (Franti is the “bad boy” in Enrico’s class, the only one whose heart the teacher Perboni cannot reach, and who for Eco is the only one who rejects the rhetoric and classism of bourgeoisie society).
 
Another highlight are the stories that Enrico’s teacher tells the boys, one every month, each of them about a boy who is in some way a role model. Some of those have become famous on their own as short stories or novellas, one of them perhaps even more popular than the whole book. I’m talking about ""From the Apennines to the Andes,"" the story of Marco, a poor Italian boy whose mother has to emigrate to Argentina to be able to support her family. But after she writes to her family that she is sick, her letters stop coming. So Marco decides to go to Argentina himself to look for her. He manages to cross the ocean and travels across Argentina to find her, having many adventures during his journey and meeting some wonderful people. A good number of movies, animated series and TV shows have been made about that story.
  
To get you a taste, here’s a short passage where a new boy of immigrant parents comes to the school. The boy is from the far-away south of Italy. He has a different accent, wears different clothes and even looks different from the other boys, with brown skin and very dark hair. Being different, and human nature being what is it, the boy would normally be a target of mockery from the other boys. However, this is how the teacher introduces him to his new schoolmates:
 
> (…) The director went away, after speaking a few words in the master’s ear, leaving beside the latter the boy, who glanced about with his big black eyes as though frightened. 

>The master took him by the hand, and said to the class: “You ought to be glad. Today there enters our school a little Italian born in Reggio, in Calabria, more than five hundred miles from here. Love your brother who has come from so far away. He was born in a glorious land, which has given illustrious men to Italy, and which now furnishes her with stout laborers and brave soldiers; in one of the most beautiful lands of our country, where there are great forests, and great mountains, inhabited by people full of talent and courage. Treat him well, so that he shall not perceive that he is far away from the city in which he was born; make him see that an Italian boy, in whatever Italian school he sets his foot, will find brothers there.” So saying, he rose and pointed out on the wall map of Italy the spot where lay Reggio, in Calabria.
 
Then the teacher calls on a boy, who  is one of the leaders of the group, to welcome him in the name of the class. The boy does so and both boys shake their hands and embrace, while the others applaud:
 
> (…) All clapped their hands. “Silence!” cried the master; “don’t clap your hands in school!” But it was evident that he was pleased. And the Calabrian was pleased also. The master assigned him a place, and accompanied him to the bench. Then he said again:—
 
>“Bear well in mind what I have said to you. In order that this case might occur, that a Calabrian boy should be as though in his own house at Turin, and that a boy from Turin should be at home in Calabria, our country fought for fifty years, and thirty thousand Italians died. You must all respect and love each other; but any one of you who should give offence to this comrade, because he was not born in our province, would render himself unworthy of ever again raising his eyes from the earth when he passes the tricolored flag.”
 
>Hardly was the Calabrian seated in his place, when his neighbors presented him with pens and a print; and another boy, from the last bench, sent him a Swiss postage-stamp. 
 
In another passage, when Enrico is reluctant about going to school because he finds it boring, this is part of the pep talk his father gives him:
 
> (…) Reflect in the morning, when you set out, that at that very moment, in your own city, thirty thousand other boys are going like yourself, to shut themselves up in a room for three hours and study. Think of the innumerable boys who, at nearly this precise hour, are going to school in all countries. Behold them with your imagination, going, going, through the lanes of quiet villages; through the streets of the noisy towns, along the shores of rivers and lakes; here beneath a burning sun; there amid fogs; in boats, in countries which are intersected with canals; on horseback on the far-reaching plains; in sledges over the snow; through valleys and over hills; across forests and torrents, over the solitary paths of mountains; alone, in couples, in groups, in long files, all with their books under their arms, clad in a thousand ways, speaking a thousand tongues. From the most remote schools in Russia, almost lost in the ice, to the furthermost schools of Arabia, shaded by palm-trees, millions and millions, all going to learn the same things, in a hundred varied forms. Imagine this vast, vast throng of boys of a hundred races, this immense movement of which you form a part, and think, if this movement were to cease, humanity would fall back into barbarism; this movement is the progress, the hope, the glory of the world. Courage, then, little soldier of the immense army. Your books are your arms, your class is your squadron, the field of battle is the whole earth, and the victory is human civilization. Be not a cowardly soldier, my Enrico. 
 
In other entry, Enrico is sent to the girls’ school to take a copy of one of his teacher’s stories, since one of the schoolmistresses there had asked for it. He witnesses this incident there:
 
>Opposite the door of the school, on the other side of the street, stood a very small chimney-sweep, his face entirely black, with his sack and scraper, with one arm resting against the wall, and his head supported on his arm, weeping copiously and sobbing. Two or three of the girls of the second grade approached him and said, “What is the matter, that you weep like this?” But he made no reply, and went on crying.
 
>“Come, tell us what is the matter with you and why you are crying,” the girls repeated. And then he raised his face from his arm,—a baby face,—and said through his tears that he had been to several houses to sweep the chimneys, and had earned thirty soldi, and that he had lost them, that they had slipped through a hole in his pocket,—and he showed the hole,—and he did not dare to return home without the money.
 
>“The master will beat me,” he said, sobbing; and again dropped his head upon his arm, like one in despair. The children stood and stared at him very seriously. In the meantime, other girls, large and small, poor girls and girls of the upper classes, with their portfolios under their arms, had come up; and one large girl, who had a blue feather in her hat, pulled two soldi from her pocket, and said:—
 
>“I have only two soldi; let us make a collection.”
 
>“I have two soldi, also,” said another girl, dressed in red; “we shall certainly find thirty soldi among the whole of us”; and then they began to call out:—
 
>“Amalia! Luigia! Annina!—A soldo. Who has any soldi? Bring your soldi here!”
 
>Several had soldi to buy flowers or copy-books, and they brought them; some of the smaller girls gave centesimi; the one with the blue feather collected all, and counted them in a loud voice:—
 
>“Eight, ten, fifteen!” But more was needed. Then one larger than any of them, who seemed to be an assistant mistress, made her appearance, and gave half a lira; and all made much of her. Five soldi were still lacking.
 
>“The girls of the fourth class are coming; they will have it,” said one girl. The members of the fourth class came, and the soldi showered down. All hurried forward eagerly; and it was beautiful to see that poor chimney-sweep in the midst of all those many-colored dresses, of all that whirl of feathers, ribbons, and curls. The thirty soldi were already obtained, and more kept pouring in; and the very smallest who had no money made their way among the big girls, and offered their bunches of flowers, for the sake of giving something. All at once the portress made her appearance, screaming:—
 
>“The Signora Directress!” The girls made their escape in all directions, like a flock of sparrows; and then the little chimney-sweep was visible, alone, in the middle of the street, wiping his eyes in wonder, with his hands full of money, and the button-holes of his jacket, his pockets, his hat, were full of flowers; and there were even flowers on the ground at his feet.
