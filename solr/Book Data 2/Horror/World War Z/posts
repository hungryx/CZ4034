tg61x8,World War Z by Max Brooks,THIS BOOK IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ITS PREDECESSOR. A documentary in a book form. Wait a BOOKUMENTARY 😂. The movie and the book differs a LOT LIKE A LOT LOT. Loved the book from start to finish. How Brooks portray each part of the war in different perspectives taking place around the world is the real highlight of the book.

lxa1it,World War Z is one the best books I've ever read.,"Just finished the ensemble audiobook. What a ride. I had seen the movie before I read the book. And now I'm super disappointed in the movie. I didn't care much for it before but after the book it's now just a massive missed opportunity. But enough of the movie. This was one of the most efficient reads I've ever had. Every story, every word, every theme, perfectly executed. Not a single wasted line. Everything felt necessary and needed. I now feel the immediate need to buy a shotgun and a cabin in the woods.

""Don't worry everything is going to be ok"" is right up there with ""Don't Panic"" in book quotes to remember during a crisis",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lxa1it/world_war_z_is_one_the_best_books_ive_ever_read/,2021-03-04 02:03:08,1457,10197,books
sn421r,So I just finished reading World War Z: An oral history of the zombie war..,"Let me start out by saying I just started getting back into reading a few months ago and have focused heavily on fiction: Jurassic Park/The Lost World, Harry Potter, Project Hail Mary(loved that one), and a few others. Primarily as escapism since I’ve had a doozy of a time trying to deal with everything that’s been going on the past few years. But WWZ shook me because of how real of an approach Max Brooks took. 

I hadn’t even realized it was a book, and only found out from a comment on a post about the movie adaption. Figured I would give it a shot and that it would follow a few stories typical to conventional Hollywood Zombies. Nope. I’m still processing the magnitude of detail and thought that went into this book; the emotions that arose from each and every story within; and the meaning behind it all. 

A question that keeps nagging at me is how would we deal with something as catastrophic as the zombie war? I mean now we have experienced Covid which has brought devastation to so many people around the globe, but that seems like a cakewalk in comparison to the zombie war. The book in my mind try’s to take many countries in to consideration and acknowledges their beliefs and cultures. We are all human, but that doesn’t make us all the same. 

Honestly I have no idea how the world would react. You could say we would react rationally and nip it in the bud as quickly as possible because we have the technology and means to do so(in some places). But on the other hand humans can be and will react very irrationally in times of immense stress or from ignorance and naïveté. But that’s what makes us human right? I think sometimes we forget that we’re not as indestructible as we want to believe. That we’re failing every step of the way as we evolve and the book try’s to emphasize that - to me at least. 

Idk I could probably go on for  while and talk nonsense about this and I’m sorry if what I just wrote makes no sense. In depth discussion on literature of any kind has never been my strong suit, but I want to know your thoughts! What did you get out of it? How do you think we would handle something like that? Which story within the book was your favorite? Personally I loved the story of Tomonaga Ijiro.

Edit: omg I didn’t realize this would get this much attention! Sorry for the huge wall of text this was my first long post so thanks for the feedback. I spaced it out so hopefully that helps.

Edit 2: (can I make 2 in the same edit? Idk Reddit rights and wrongs) I will be listening to the audio book ASAP",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sn421r/so_i_just_finished_reading_world_war_z_an_oral/,2022-02-07 23:11:52,421,2090,books
w1zx41,Thoughts on the book World War Z by Max Brooks?,"Just a clarification here: The original World War Z book by Max Brooks was nothing like the movie that came out with the same title. 

I feel that despite being a zombie thriller, the book was surprisingly meaningful and deep. I like how Max Brooks portrayed political and cultural differences when writing the interviews held with different people around the world. The way meaningful ideas and words were interspersed with relaxed and genial commentary was something unique that I haven't really observed in many other books.

What do you all think about the book? Do you think it's a one of a kind masterpiece or do you feel that it is weird and lacks true value?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/w1zx41/thoughts_on_the_book_world_war_z_by_max_brooks/,2022-07-18 13:53:26,452,1385,books
r0us1e,World War Z is an amazing book and I don't think that I will ever forget it,"This is my favorite book ever. The way it was written was so good and the interview format was perfect. I was scared for a lot of the book and a few times I cried. The image of the battle of Yonkers will forever be in my brain. 10/10

The concept of the Quislings was really intriguing and I found that the cultural variations in the names of the zombies like G's in America or Zed Heads in Australia were really cool. 

I kept imagining myself at the start of the great panic having to escape while fighting with other people for supplies

I think that the consistency of the governments was really accurate as they wouldn't all just crumble at the first signs of a zombie outbreak

The only part I didn't love was the interview with the ex astronaut. I kept finding myself wanting to get back to the hordes",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r0us1e/world_war_z_is_an_amazing_book_and_i_dont_think/,2021-11-24 03:06:29,943,7108,books
jojp5a,Finished listening to 'World War Z' last week. Amazing work of fictional non-fiction.,"First things first.. the only thing common between the book and the film is the title (and the presence of zombies, obviously).

This is a very interesting book and I was hooked right from page 1 and the myriad stories of different people from different cultures was very thrilling to read. 

I'm an aspiring writer myself and to me a work like this is a great learning experience. I mean, Max Brooks very smartly created so many characters, and explored so many cultures from around the world and told so many stories all in a single connected work –which is no easy feat for a fictional work.

But yes I was also distracted in between when listening to the audiobook as I listen to the books when I'm doing household work (cleaning, cooking, etc) But all through the book, I kept thinking how cool it would be to have each interview/chapter in the book as a separate episode in a TV series.

Amazing book, and I highly recommend it.

**EDIT**: Thank you all for the amazing interaction on this thread, and a special thanks to a particular user for my first Reddit Gold! 

**My takeaway from this book is this: When mankind faces extreme odds against its survival, there will undoubtedly be chaos, destruction and a seemingly endless tragedy. But even in the face of such a catastrophe, the only thing that ultimately matters is the very trait that gives our species its name: *humanity.* We're going to need a great deal of it in the coming decades if we want to be around on this planet longer.**

16diguf,World War Z was so ahead of its time. So worth reading as an adult if you read it as a kid.,"I was looking at my audiobook list and had heard that WWZ had a full cast of narrators like American Gods. But holy shit, Martin Scorsese  ? Simon Pegg ? Nathan Fillion  ? Henry Rollins ?! The narration alone is outstanding. But the political commentary has aged like wine. Russia devolving into the ""Holy Russian Empire"" and marching on Belarus and Ukraine after winning their conflict with the undead was outstanding. I loved that they included points of view you never see in other zombie stories, like the blimp pilot, the feral woman, the scuba diver, and the commander of the International Space Station.


I guess it's fine that the only part the movie really represented was the Israeli peace with Palestine, but hearing how the other side of the world saw this coming and did everything to warn the rest of the world. Only for very few countries to take it seriously and even less prepare effectively? The Chinese government trying to secretly lock down an infection at the cost of their own people , sound like anything in recent events ? I know it was inspired by SARS but lord did it take on new meaning reading it after 2021. Also the con man who strong armed Phalanx and other methods of taking advantage of fear mongering. While the US government and media too woried about the election cycle to adequately inform the people. How many bogus gimmick solutions did we see in 2020 ? How many assholes got rich from different snake oils ? I know Max Brooks is no fortune teller, and that these examples largely come from max being inspired by the past and history repeating itself. But my God, credit where credit is due. 

Not to mention most authors deeply research 1 maybe two worlds to really deep dive into. But the Chinese submarine chapter was practically a book on its own. Each character feels like a person who is well versed in their own expertise. Let's talk about Mark Hamill as Todd. What a believable vet, narrated by the GOAT. Spectacular decision given that Todd gets 3 important chapters. Every time I hear The Trooper, I think about the bit with the Raj Singh square stacking bodies till they form their own fortification. 

Like I said, if you read it in your teens, it's well worth revisiting in 2023. I dug up my old paper back, I may track him down for a signature.

It was cool reading the stories of the different types of people all around the world that experienced this event throughout its timeline.

But one thing that kind of disappointed me was the biggest thing that made me love the movie, the fact that the zombies were runners. The walking zombies of the book don't seem as threatening and adrenaline inducing as the movies' runner zombies.

10f0rmz,World War Z - not good,"Very rarely do I like skim milk. Even less rarely do I skim a book. I apologize. It is late, I am tired, and that line sounded more clever in my head.

 But that brings up three important points: I skimmed the ending of World War Z out of sheer boredom, World War Z is more a clever idea (or collection of clever ideas) than an actual book, and whole milk is the superior dairy choice.

World War Z (or WWZ, as I shall refer to it from here on out), sounds great on paper. It is a cool idea, and it is filed with cool ideas. Most of the stories recounted by the survivors are clever and interesting, and yet they are not explored as stories. Take the survivor who lived in the catacombs. Zombie apocalypse in the catacombs? Terrifying. Survivor retelling exposition about surviving in the catacombs? Yawn.

That is the problem I had with WWZ: it is all exposition, from page one until the ending, it is nothing but one-sided conversation. You know the kind of conversation to which you reply “wow.” “No way.” “That’s crazy.” “Wow.” And internally you’re wondering when this person will shut up or when you can slip away unnoticed.

Seriously, I am curious: did this book actually scare anyone? Because, despite being a novel that uses zombies to give a political and sociological analysis of humanity’s response to an epidemic - this book is advertised and sold as a horror novel. Horror means scary. I expect to be scared. Not once did I find myself scared, or even tense, or even concerned! 

While I acknowledge and even respect the author’s research and the knowledge packed in the book, it almost becomes another flaw, as it sometimes feels as though he is flexing his research muscles rather than including necessary details for the story (and again, I don’t think there is much of a story here).

wd20h5,World War Z was a better movie than book.,"I know, I know, they’re completely different in terms of plot structure and just about everything else outside of ***zombie apocalypse***. I’ve read the book and seen the movie many times. 

I’m biased bc I’m a Brad Pitt stan. But I legitimately like the zombie movie they made. The opening sequence with the news flashes, the Children of Men-esque way the violence and chaos is introduced and the satisfying and plausible resolution to the conflict make for an entertaining watch for me every time.

Also Brad Pitt.

The book was good too, just way different. I’m aware the book came first but I didn’t read it til after I watched the movie.  Honestly they should have just given the movie a different title, that’s how different they are.

15etwsm,"Finished World War Z, the geopolitics felt like they had the depth of the average Hollywood action movie","First I found the concept interesting, the idea of seeing a zombie apocalypse on the macro scale and with the government actually surviving and fighting back. It's not something done often and it was something I was looking forward to explore. Though imo the format held this back, as I didn't feel very interested in the story or the characters, there was a lack of engagement and tension and the author isn't really good at making different characters. All felt like they kinda had the same ""voice"" so to speak.

But the politics and other countries, it felt like the writer did zero research or purposefully put stereotypes into the book. Like the Japanese blind expert samurai and his otaku student. Or the Russians using human waves tactics and WW2 weapons.

And then the geopolitics really felt like Bush-era American wishful thinking. Like the US government initially ignoring it, then getting their shit together led by a ""great man"", then going back to reconquer the US then the world. Literally ends with the US wanting to conquer Russia. Pakistan and Iran nuking each other. North Korea deciding to suicide their country instead of just guarding their borders, for some reason. China not being able to handle it until there is a civil war and they turn democratic. And probably the worse: Cuba being able to handle it, but only after being essentially colonized by Americans who bring capitalism which makes Cuba a great power, all with Castro letting it happen.

mle0vu,World War Z is NOT a good book.,"I have seen praise of this book and it's audiobook soooo many times in reddit that I finally decided to read it (listen to it actually).

I was terribly disappointed. I can't believe all the hype is all I could think while listening to it. For me all the characters seemed the same guy, like the author was proyecting himself or something in them. They even talked the same way or similar expressions. Sometimes the writing was just bad.

I couldn't bear all the stereotypes of the different countries either. I could tell it was written by an USA citizen before looking the author up.

It had some interesting ideas in the 'zombie world' not brought up before, and it could make an ok book, but here I have seen it portrayed as a masterpiece and all time favorite. I can't understand it. If this book is in your top list I felt you haven't read that much. 

I guess is my fault for trusting blindly. I have learned my lesson.

Just to warn others that could be thinking of reading it: if you want a light reading without much thinking and are really into zombies this could be for you I guess. But if you have high expectations and think this is a must read you are gonna be disappointed.

Maybe someone agrees with me here?

EDIT: I think my point is not clear for the comments I got. I understand people like and love this book. ""If this book is in your top list I felt you haven't read that much"", this was unfair. My point is this book has way too many posts and comments praising it, and how reddit works the voices that don't think alike get silenced.

I'm a huge fan of audiobooks, and this production is amazing. Each interview has a different voice actor, with accents and their telling the story. No ""he coughed out the last word."" they just cough.

[He's accompanied by Alan Alda, Kal Penn, Nathan Fillion, simon Pegg, Common, martin Scorsese, rob reiner, among many other stand out names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z#Cast)

If you haven't heard of the book or only seen the movie (the book is nothing like the movie) here's a brief summary.

It's a mockumentary of the events leading up to, during, and after of a global zombie outbreak. The ""author"" in the narrative is a journalist who interviews people from around the world. From the first doctors to recognize the infection, to a shot down air force pilot, to a child who's mother tried to mercy kill her but only left her mentally handicapped.

Also, and this is dark, but it's really good to read right now with the corona virus spreading. The similarities are.... spooky.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/f8ume8/shoutout_to_world_war_z_audiobook/,2020-02-24 17:26:04,12,17,books

tv7fk,Looking for books like World War Z.,"Hi r/books. I'm looking for books that follow the form of World War Z. Multiple perspectives, unknown to each other, describing, revealing an event in hindsight. Preferrably in the same log/ journal/ interview form.

To elaborate, a story in letter or journal form, all ""written"" by the same protagonist, is not exactly what I'm looking for.

Genre doesn't matter, I take almost all.

Something like House of Leaves with its footnotes and annotations would also fit.

I just really liked WWZs approach to story-telling and would like to read more like that.

Any recommendations?

Thanks in advance to whoever answers, as I'm actually going to bed soon. Will be back tommorrow night.

Edit: Wow! That's a big reading list! I'll definitely pock up at least a few. Thanks everyone!!!

-Rant - Chuck Palahniuk

-Robopocalypse - Daniel H. Wilson

-Zombie Apocalypse - Stephen Jones

tlwv6o,World War Z and Zone One are the perfect zombie back-to-back read.,"
My opinion if course. These books are extremely different, in scope, content and detail, and to me that is perfect. Each complimented the shortcomings of the other.


World War Z- massive scope covering the start, duration and end of the war. Huge cast of international characters, each with a unique anecdote and perspective. It's really more of a thought experiment (what if?) than a story, but it's really engaging to go along for the ride.


My main criticism is that the book is too short! Just as I got really hooked on a chapter, it would end- but perhaps it's a strength since nobody overstays their welcome, and you don't have to think too hard about any plot holes. I did notice that a lot of the characters sound kind of the same, but having such a big cast each with a totally unique voice would be an incredible literary feat, which WWZ isn't - but it's still a fun read!


Zone One - follows a single protagonist for 3 days. We do get a lot of backstory for the main and side characters, but it's incredibly intimate and brooding. The setting, New York city, is a character in itself and really ""comes alive"". This book is a meditation on modern life, and beautifully elaborates on Romero's ""zombies in the shopping mall are us"" kind of theme. It has an ever present sense of DREAD, while also capturing the extreme banality of the apocalypse and explores the PTSD of the ""survivors"". 


I wouldn't call this a criticism, but the book is a sloooooow burn, intentionally so. It's also filled with descriptions, musings and sidetracks that many readers would find ""boring"", but it's also intentional (I was reminded at times of American Psycho). The author can really paint a picture with words, but sometimes it felt like he had the thesaurus open for every word in a sentence...


I give book these books a hearty recommendation and will definitely do a back to back reread in the future!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tlwv6o/world_war_z_and_zone_one_are_the_perfect_zombie/,2022-03-24 03:44:10,8,15,books
1hc5zu,World War Z audiobook(s),"Ok, so normally I detest audiobooks.
I dislike another person reading my books and it just brings me out of the world I want to be in.

But I love radio dramas because of the different casting and the oral story being portrayed.

So I recently found ""World War Z: The Lost Files: A companion to the Abridged Addition"" which has a superb cast and I think I want to buy it.

Here's the problem, I've been dying to read World War Z for the last several years after reading The Zombie Survival Guide and I don't have the original audiobook, so would I have to buy both the abridged audiobook and the companion?

I don't want to listen to the abridged version and then go back and listen to an out of context companion piece, and it seems like listening to them together would be a bit jarring.

Has anybody done this before that could recommend something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hc5zu/world_war_z_audiobooks/,2013-06-30 00:03:16,31,3,books
hxn0an,World War Z - my favourite slump saver,"Whenever I get into a reading slump, and just can't get into another book, I find the best thing to do is read something light and easy to read. World War Z is usually my go to for that, and I must have read it a dozen times, and every time I read it I think to myself ""Wow... this book is bad"".

I love the concept behind the book, and the post war world that Brooks builds is fascinating. He's clearly done a hell of a lot of work in researching zombies, weapons and tactics, but just once in all that research could he not have talked to a real person? Do a little research into what people outside of America sound like? Every character in the book is written in the same voice, and it's such an American voice it makes it hard to differentiate where people are supposed to be from. The Japanese character slips in a few Japanese words (although only American known Japanese words), but no one else in the world uses their own dialect, their metaphors and similes, their slang. They all have a great understanding of US-centric politics throughout the war, referring things back to the Battle of Yonkers even when, by his own account, most countries had their own version of the battle. Even little things beging to stand out - the Australian who talks about the ""Limeys"" (Poms, surely?) or the Frenchman, talking about the French Resistance who says ""and yes, there was a resistance"" (has anyone ever doubted the existence of the French Resistance?).

Even more frustrating is Brooks' weird centre politics that permeates the whole story. They may stray slightly from the centre at times, but it all comes back to the similar conclusion: ""democracy"" and ""capitalism"" wins, everything else loses. I'm not here to argue politics, just to question why every single person ""interviewed"" from countries all around the world seem to have the same beliefs, even when Brooks is trying to insist they don't.

And yet, despite all that, it's still an engrossing book. The story is great and it's such a page turner I'll finish it in a day or two and quickly move on to something much better. So congrats to Max Brooks, for writing what is simultaneously the bets and worst zombie book on existence, and for inspiring me to continue reading. I'm sure I'll read the book another dozen times over the next 10 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hxn0an/world_war_z_my_favourite_slump_saver/,2020-07-25 13:48:24,4,9,books

But that is kinda weird!!!! you have USA administration which clearly states that the new president administration was trying to ""clean up the mess of the last brushfire war"" in the first four year term, which I assume it means Iraq war (2003-2008). and then the great panic hits them really hard in the last year (guess 2012). On the other hand, consider Jurgen Warbrunn the Mossad spy, he says he was in Kindertransport (1939) during WW2 (let's assume he's 10 cause they rescued kids were infants up to the age of 17 ). So at the time of interview he is like 104 years old ?! (considering 10 years from great panic to end of the war and the fact that all interviews take place 10 years after that) Same goes with the blind Japanese hibakusha, that guy was a kid in WW2 and that makes him like 98 or something like that. (which means he was in his 70s when he went to live in that national park and killed many Zs) For the Chinese doctor, he was a young doctor (say 25-27) during soviet union and China border conflict (1969).

15z8cd,What does /r/Books think of World War Z by Max Brooks ?,"Whatup, r/books. 

I read WWZ a few years ago and today i've listened to most of the audiobook, and I remembered how much I loved it, and was wondering what the general consensus on it is here ?

It's easily my favourite Z-related thing thus far. The way that Max Brooks has thought out to incredible depth the actual impact that an apocalypse of that kind would have on the whole world is fantastic - he's clearly put a lot of effort into imagining how it would effect international relations, the economy, and social structure. I also really like the way the narrative unfolds; it's built up kind of like a series of short stories, but as you progress through the stories you get more and more of an idea of what went on, until by the end you have the complete picture. I also like the way a load of things are implied or mentioned briefly and not explained any further.

In my eyes, this and TWD are the finest examples of zombie-lit and they go hand in hand - TWD shows how an outbreaks effects people, and WWZ shows how it would effect the world as a whole (rather than other zombie related things that mainly focus on FUKKN KILLN ZOMBIESSS YEAHHH). Overall, one of my favourite things ever written. 


EDIT - My favourite chapters are probably the downed pilot in the swamp (the whole Frontline USA section is amazing) and yonkers for the action shit, and windsor castle/iran + pakistan/cuba/south africa for the levels of thought put into them. And the one about the merc who defends the reality show house thing.

98r832,I just finished listening to the Complete Edition of the World War Z audio-book.,"I read World War Z in high school during the height of the Zombie fad. Coming back to these stories today, I can easily say these stories have only gotten better with age, and to some extent, more tragic.

First off, the voice cast is easily the greatest of any audio-book I've ever listen to, and perfectly brought to life these characters who's voices had only existed in my mind. Alan Alda just is Arthur Sinclair (the US government official who organized the American wartime economy), Henry Rollins remains one of the scariest men alive as T. Sean Collins (the mercenary guarding the celebrity house), and Eamonn Walker's duel performance as Xolelwa Azania / Paul Redeker and David Allen Forbes (the Englishman who was stationed at Windsor Castle) is nothing short of brilliance. I found myself tearing up at multiple points in the book, not from sadness but from some combination of nostalgia and inspiration. When Forbes describes what Queen Elizabeth meant to the British people during the war, when Terry Knox (the astronaut who remained behind on the ISS) breaths his last, or when we're told the story of the dogs that served during the war... yeah, someone's cutting onions in here again.

Its stating the obvious to point out that what makes World War Z great has little to do with the Zombies (though Max Brooks' attention to detail in this area is just as impressive today as it was nearly a decade ago when I first read it), but I can't help but come back to how these stories don't even need the Zombies to be Zombies to work. The story could have been about a more literal plague, or an actual war with some unifying enemy. It doesn't really matter. The greatness of this book lies in the people and their experiences not as combatants, but as survivors. How they lived through the nightmare of an event that robbed them of their homes, loved ones, and even the sense that tomorrow was worth living to see, is far more compelling than the battle tactics of the living dead.

2qwhgi,What is the timeline of World War Z (Spoilers)?,"I have read this book 3 times, and I am listening to it on audible, but I still can't figure out the entire length of time from the beginning of the outbreak to the point where everyone is being recorded. 

For example, I remember in the beginning that it had been 12 years since the US was liberated, and a decade since the liberation of China. 

So how long did the epidemic last? How long was the gap between the first outbreak to the liberation? The ages of the characters is throwing me off heavily. 

For example, the age of the feral woman who remembered the outbreak as a little girl, never really gives an age but she's old enough to look like a model. 

But then the Chinese doctor, the Vice President, the DeStRes director, the mayor of the fortified city, Jurgen Warmbrunn, etc... where all at least 40 at the time of the outbreak, but likely much, much older. 

How are they still alive in an era where the life expectancy has dropped like crazy? If my guess is right, they're all pushing 60 at minimum... 

I am also curious how if my guess of 20 years is correct, how exactly did they US and other countries survive for 8 years before liberation? How long was the pull back behind the Rockies? Shit, how long did the government leave all the blue zones east of the Rockies?

Max said that it's about his mother's battle with cancer, and how every specialist (every other country) he went to would tell him, ""Don't worry.  Everything is under control.  We'll take care of this.""  Eventually the cancer took over and she passed.  She died while he was writing World War Z.  It helped him cope.

I haven't read World War Z, but I'm curious about what you guys think about this.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/37ffvv/world_war_z_is_a_metaphor_max_brooks_mothers/,2015-05-27 06:05:37,6,4,books
fljm3c,People who have read World War Z by Max Brooks - how much of what happened in the book you've noticed to play out IRL in our current crisis?,"I have read that book maybe 10 times. Every day passes and I get chills to my core on how much of what happened in the book has played out in real life.

To those that haven't read World War Z: It's a book about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. A journalist from the UN interviews many people that lived through the ""Z War"". Unlike most zombie stories, WWZ describes the beginning, middle and end of the zombie apocalypse (95% of all zombie films just focus on the middle).

I don't want to spoil the book for anyone that has not read it, but it's great. Remove the ""zombies"" part and you will feel like reading a history book written in 2120 about the Coronavirus pandemic.

Yes the pandemic in the book involves zombies, but everything else - The Great Panic, the gag orders and censorship, the misinformation, false cures, the aloofness of the population, the fact it also originated in goddamn China...

The reason I loved the book so much was that unlike the your run of the mill Z apocalypse movie, it felt soo real. Like it actually happened. And when the Coronavirus epidemic begun I assumed some things will play out like they have in the book. But I didn't imagine **so many things would be the same.**

I kind of wish I haven't read it. Predicting so much of what happened weeks before is disheartening and scary, even though it has helped me prepare my family. I wonder what you think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fljm3c/people_who_have_read_world_war_z_by_max_brooks/,2020-03-19 22:50:44,17,3,books

3euidf,Just finished The Martian and saw a lot of similarities between it and World War Z.,"The Martian is the first book that i have read in a long time, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it held my attention unlike many other books. I guess I'm a bit of a sucker for the whole sciency bit, and noticed that for parts of the book it felt as if I was reading Max Brooks' World War Z, with the first-person commentary and lots of acronyms and information only a specialist would know about a certain topic.

The book also was continually interesting, engaging, and very funny. Props to Andy Weir for writing such a good book and letting me enjoy reading again. World War Z is still my favorite book of all time, but The Martian is probably a close second, now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3euidf/just_finished_the_martian_and_saw_a_lot_of/,2015-07-28 01:57:31,7,2,books
1o7eei,Could someone help me out with World War Z?,"Hi, I was hoping one of you could help me out. I've recently listened to the Abridged audiobook version of World War Z without realising that there is an expanded unabridged version available. Anyway, I got myself the 'Lost Files' which apparently is everything that wasn't included in the abridged version. I was wondering if one of you could help me find somewhere that lists each interview title in the correct order; a list which makes it clear which interviews are part of which audiobook version if possible. I hope that makes sense. I'd really appreciate any help any of you could give me.

28x5gt,"Okay u/us2lach, because of your comment on the recent World War Z thread, I'm reading ""The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two""",">Is anyone else aware that the book's format is based on another book 'The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two' by Studs Terkel.
The book won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. I haven't read it yet and would love to hear from anyone who has. Reading these comments it seems like many of Brooks' stories could have almost been lifted directly from real life WWII accounts (minus the zombies of course) and I would love to know how similar some of the parts are.

Well, us2lach, I got sucked in at the first account: John Garcia, a native Hawaiian. He worked as a pipe fitter apprentice at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. He was 16 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked.

>...I started to go down into the pipe filter's shop to get my toolbox when another wave of Japanese came in. I got under a set of concrete steps at the dry dock where the battleship *Pennsylvania* was. An officer came by and asked me to go into the *Pennsylvania* and try to get the fires out. A bomb had penetrated the marine deck, and that was three decks below. Under that was the magazines: ammunition, powder, shells. 

>I said, ""There ain't no way i'm gonna go down there"" I was young and sixteen, not stupid, not at sixty-two cents an hour.  (Laughs.)

>A week later, they brought me before a navy court. It was determined that I was not service personnel and could not be ordered. There was no martial law at the time. Because I was sixteen and had gone into the water, the whole thing was dropped. [Garcia later explains the meaning behind 'gone into the water' and what martial law on the islands meant.]

Some of the people he interviews are naturally better storytellers than others, so for some accounts, I feel like I'm at that part in the Tom Clancy novel where he leaves the characters and waxes rhapsodic about some kind of military maneuver. I'm currently skipping around a bit, since he divides the book by topic, and will eventually go back to the jungles in the Philippines. 

I definitely recommend it. I watched *Band of Brothers* so some battles and names are familiar, but the accounts about battles in the Pacific are pretty gruesome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/28x5gt/okay_uus2lach_because_of_your_comment_on_the/,2014-06-24 00:07:11,0,0,books

tbbwu,Random House is Finally Going to Release an Unabridged Version of the World War Z Audiobook,"From the [World War Z Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WorldWarZ) page: ""NEWS: Random House has finaly agreed to begin production on an unabridged version of the World War Z audiobook with all the characters. Casting will begin immediately. Max Brooks will post each new booking as soon as they’re recorded.""

On one hand, this is GREAT news. WWZ has one of the best audiobooks I've ever heard - however, it does have the HUGE flaw of being abridged. On the other hand, this ""casting"" news makes it sound (to me) like they're going to have to recast and re-record the whole thing. Which kind of stinks. The WWZ audiobook has an amazing reading cast - Alan Alda, Rob and Carl Reiner, Mark Hamill, John Tuturro, Henry Rollins, etc. - so I'd hate to see any of them replaced.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tbbwu/random_house_is_finally_going_to_release_an/,2012-05-07 16:14:44,1,2,books
