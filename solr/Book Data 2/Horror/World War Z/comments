tg61x8,"The zombie survival guide is not really a book, certainly not a prequel, it's just a parody on a survival guide but with zombies in mind. It's also not really meant to be read as a novel, you more or less pick chapters you'd like and read that, and do that a couple of times before finishing it, if you can finish it. I think I've read 80% of it.

It has nothing to do with the World War Z story. He probably used a lot of the same ideas in the story.

tg61x8,"The one thing the movie could have done that would have essentially saved it and not only kept it in line with the book, but also had justified the whole movie...was if the interviewer had left Brad Pitt's tent in the last scene and a voiceover narrates the opening part of the book.
Pitt's character would basically be one of the interviewed and thus, his story written down on what the audience sees in the final shot of the film, the notebook titled, ""World War Z.""",Outrageous-Career-91,2022-06-06 23:44:13

tg61x8,"It’s up to you. The survival guide reads like the straightest-written piece of parody ever. Max goes into *ridiculous* detail on how one would feasibly survive a zombie attack - weapons, tactics, optimal defense locations, “history” of prior outbreaks, etc.

There’s a section near the back of the book labeled “classes of zombie outbreaks,” which range from Class 1 - a handful of zombies in, say, a small town setting - all the way up to Class 4: the Zombie Apocalypse. World War Z reads like an expansion of that section to the length of an entire book, where he plays out the hypotheticals of how modern society would, somehow, get to the point of becoming the non-dominant predator on Earth, and how we’d eventually claw our way back.

If you read the survival guide first, there’s an added level of detail you’ll appreciate in WWZ, because Max is utilizing the rules he built out in the first book. You’re gonna read “interviews” from survivors, who offhandedly mention tactics or weapons they used, and go “Oh yeah, I remember that being the right move!” or, “Oh shit, I can see right away where they fucked up.” It’s a good time, and I was glad to have read the guide first, but ultimately WWZ is standalone, and doesn’t rely on your prior knowledge.",PunyParker826,2022-03-18 16:23:41

tg61x8,I always considered the Zombie Survival guide to be a book that released in World War Z’s universe. Like post zombie apocalypse. The world is returning to normal. You’re in school and the first book the teacher gives you is the ZSG.,zombiebreath77,2022-03-17 17:24:51
tg61x8,"Army corporal Todd Wainio, I believe. He's the character you see at the most varied times in the story. Most of the ""interview clips"" are one person who had memories relevant to one part of the over-arching story. Todd, voiced by everyone's favorite jedi, is at a major army catastrophe at the beginning, then again as we start to get our shit together in a useful manner, then after the whole March across the continent to New York City.

You could make a fair argument to his character being as much the protagonist of the whole story as the interviewer.

World War Z is the only zombie book I can refer to as ""literature"" with a straight face. And the main reason is that it starts from the beginning by telling you that the apocalypse is over, and that we made it. Every other zombie storyline ever is just ""the Dark Smurf"" over and over. This one book was different, and better.  Until they decided to make a movie named after the book, but as much like every other, lesser work ever as possible.

This strikes me as equivalent to a producer noticing that the Bible is the biggest selling book of all time
 So he buys the rights to the name ""The Holy Bible"" and puts it on a movie about lesbian motorcycle gangs having a dance contest on a space station.

That's how close World War Z the movie was to the book of the same name.",Bard2dbone,2022-03-17 13:05:48

Like some jump in effectiveness can be attributed to experience, but after getting completely overrun, some cool axes let them just wade through nearly a million zombies (not hyperbole, that's the number the character gives) to take back New York?

It wasn't bad, it was certainly better than Robopocalypse (which tried so hard to be World War Z with robots and just kinda sucked) but it was pretty weak in parts in my opinion. I'm glad you enjoyed it though!",paddywagon_man,2021-03-04 04:18:46

lxa1it,I read the book years ago way before the movie and as soon as I saw the trailer I knew it was nothing even remotely close to the book. Was honestly kind of upset they even called it world war z when it seemed like it had almost nothing in common with the book. My favorite bits were the stories from Todd the american soldier. Especially when he describes the battle of yonkers and the total incompetence of the American government reacting to a crisis.,thatdude658,2021-03-04 19:36:34
lxa1it,"This was a subject I ranted over a few different times. The book World War Z is the only zombie based story I've ever seen that I can refer to as 'literature' with a straight face.  The movie World War Z is absolutely not special in any way.  The producers took what made the book special and threw it out on the first draft. 

For anyone who is unfamiliar with one or both: This is much like an executive noticing that the Bible is the highest selling book of all time. So he buys the rights to the name ""The Holy Bible"" and decides to make it into a movie. The movie he makes is called ""The Holy Bible"", but it is about a lesbian motorcycle gang that gets into a dance competition on a space station.

THAT is how close the movie was to the book.  What makes WWZ the best zombie apocalypse book EVER is that it starts ten years AFTER the apocalypse is OVER. The whole time, no matter how incredibly creepy and awful the stories that the survivors tell in their interview segments are, you know that it's all basically over and no longer an existential threat. Oh sure, there are still zombies. Submarines are frequently covered in them. Anywhere that has permafrost is likely to have zombies thaw out and reanimate each summer, so volunteers have to go looking for 'zombie-cicles' while they're still dormant. And the book has the most believable representation of what a real Bond villain would be like that I've ever seen.  He's super-wealthy. He lives in a repurposed Antarctic science compound. And every human on the planet hates him and wants him dead.  

Whereas the movie is just like every other zombie movie, ever. Small group of uninfected surrounded by hordes of undead...fade to black. Bleh.

And the 'cast of thousands' audiobook was one of my favorites, too. Although it drove me a bit nuts when Alan Alda's character couldn't pronounce the name Vo Nguyen Giap. I kind of feel that his character would have known how to say Nguyen. SO someone should have told Alan how to say it.",Bard2dbone,2021-03-04 08:20:39
lxa1it,"World War Z is, to me, a nearly perfect example of Science Fiction as a genre, and I am going to use this post to shamelessly articulate my many feelings on this subject!

Firstly: what is the difference between Science Fiction and Fantasy? To my mind, it's not space ships versus dragons. It's whether or not you explain how the spaceships work or how the dragons breathe fire. It is *also* whether the characters are able to use these explanations to solve problems.

Dragonriders of Pern, for example, is 100% nitty gritty Science Fiction. Mechanisms of fire breathing and teleportation are explained and utilized to overcome significant challenges, especially the teleportation.

Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, I'd say something like an 80/20 blend of Sci-Fi/Fantasy. *Lots* of technical explanation for how the magic system works, but also a sizeable chunk of Blame-it-on-the-Gods and good old fashioned political maneuvering.

Wheel of Time (pre-Sanderson, at least), still a mix but much heavier on the Fantasy. There's still a *lot* of technical explanation of how various elements of the fictional world work, but the magic system is never really explained beyond the level of metaphorical description (at least as far as I recall, it's probably been a decade or so since my last re-reading). Interpersonal politics does about an equal share of the narrative heavy lifting and the magic is frequently used as sort of a signal/literal prophecy fulfillment.

Tolkien is about where I stop seeing anything science-y. Pretty much all explanations of magic boil down to elvish ancestry or some level of divinity. Problems are solved with courage, determination, or ingenuity and don't generally involve any understanding on the part if the characters about how magic works, even if they're using magic to solve a problem (such as the Very Scary Giant Spider and the Perfume Bottle of Elvishness). I'm sure some space opera examples exist, but I think I must have found them full or uninteresting in the first 50 pages because I don't think I ever read any to completion. (I'd love any recommendations anyone has for me!)

Now that that baseline is set (and I do welcome any debate on my definitions!), Why do I adore the book this post is about so much?

World War Z is... Such a lovely example of 'what if' fiction. It's structured as a series of interviews, so you get literally dozens of different perspectives and situations with the same overarching root cause. Each interview looks at different physical locations, circumstances, and points in the timeline of this massive fictional problem (zombies, and all associated baggage) and goes into detail about how humans collectively solve (or, in several cases, fail to solve) the problem. I won't cite any examples because I don't know how to use spoiler tags properly and it's just such a *good* book! The fictional situation is horrific, but the overarching story is hopeful and inspiring, with the final note being that humans are adaptive problem solvers who can overcome anything if we put our collective mind to it. Our biggest weakness is our reluctance to be team players.

I heard there was a movie, which did not follow the series-of-interviews structure at all. I am probably never going to watch this movie because it will be nothing but a disappointment.

If somebody decided to do a limited TV series (say, a dozen or so hour-long episodes) in the correct format (differeng time/location/cast/problem each episode), I'd definitely be interested in that.",Blewbe,2021-03-04 12:22:11
lxa1it,">World War Z is one the best books I've ever read.

It's not bad, and the start is strong, but each 'voice' becomes more of the same towards the end of the book. I was disappointed by the end.

The 'movie' should have been a 'series' with each episode a single voice.",NSWthrowaway86,2021-03-04 05:54:25
lxa1it,"I generally don’t like zombie stories because they end up being about how humanity loses. Oh sure, a few survivors may prolong their lifespan by a few days or months and make it to some remote island. But by and large, humanity and our civilization is done for. I feel the same way about horror movies where the protagonists all die.

World War Z works for me because it’s not about zombies wiping us all out, it’s about how there are enough creative, smart, and brave people in the world to overcome even the worst and most terrifying problems.

For a history class in college, I wrote a paper about how zombies in pop culture/media are used as metaphors for various ""others"" in society (communists, terrorists, etc.). I had a blast with the project, since I was able to watch dozens of zombie movies as part of my research. I was unable to completely finish World War Z before my paper was due, so I finished it after the semester ended. During this time, I was also working campus security. For night shifts, that meant walking around the empty campus and locking up buildings. 

After reading the chapter of WWZ where someone was in an apartment building hearing the zombies come up closer to them (especially how the author described the noises the zombies made), I spent every night shift absolutely TERRIFIED of walking in a building alone. I would have to look at the floor when checking doors because I was so scared I would see a zombie on the other side of the door.

w1zx41,"So much zombie media focuses on what is to me the least interesting part of the zombie apocalypse - the bit where people run around in small groups scavenging - and not the leadup/outbreak/collapse/rebuild, which are all far more interesting.

Side note: if I see one more character wake up 30 days into the zombie apocalypse I might scream.

I understand that some bits of media are trapped in that period as if The Walking Dead group ever found a community that wasn't secretly cannibals or whatever and settled down, the story would end. However, they end up being tainted by an increasing sense of nihilism - for all of the masturbatory self-reliance that they espouse, humanity as a whole works best when people work together, which people are naturally inclined to do.

World War Z was great precisely because it did a deep dive into the kinds of stories that zombie media often downplays or skips entirely.",aquirkysoul,2022-07-19 01:40:59

Brooks worked with epidemiologists, military officials, social scientists, economists, tons of different people all to make the book reasonably plausible under the presumption that Solenum is a real condition and transmissible.

While it's not the best written thing in the world, it's fun to read or better listen to the audio book (complete edition, not the condensed version).

So the next time someone tries to tell you about how the true losses of this war are ""our innocence"" or ""part of our humanity""... Whatever, bro. Tell it to the whales.

w1zx41,"Simon Pegg in his review of this book said, the author – Max Brooks – must know something more about such a pandemic to come up with such a vivid description of the zombie war.

That is very much the case. The details and the intricate imagination of this book about how the society fell apart, rebuilt itself and reclaim the world after a decade long war is a brilliant read.

This book is structured as a series of interviews taken by the narrator. He travels across the globe and documents how the war has affected people from various walks of life. There are military personnel, there are young people, there are even moms who are just looking out for their kids. The book reads like a transcript of these interviews with minor details and body language of the people while the interviews are conducted.

After playing games like Dying Light where the dilapidated city of Harran and its night runs haunt you for a long while even after the game is finished, I was expecting a similar rush after reading this acclaimed book. But I was ill-informed. This is a book not about zombies, but society and people. Such games usually have an escalating threat level with different, deadlier zombies are slowly introduced to raise the difficulty level and to keep you on your toes, this book takes a completely different approach.

There are not a lot of different types of zombies in world war z. The classic slow-moving, brain-eating zombie is the only villain of this book. They are often deadlier in swarms. The focus of the book is on the impact on society. This new threat turns the well established conventional forms of attacks and army tactics over their heads. This new threat is slow-moving but deadly, one-track in thought, absolutely relentless and non-negotiable nor curable. This slow but consistent tension is a thrill of a special kind and it wears down everything in their path like a water stream slowly erodes a rock.

The way Max Brooks handles this pandemic is spectacular. He considers the current geopolitical equations, religious quarrels and issues of national pride across the globe. He then brings about a single all-encompassing menace to counter all these others and showcases how the society collapses upon itself. From capitalist supply chains to communist world orders, everything topples on the account of a slow-moving brainless creature. This social commentary is subtle and leaves you with the chuckle on many occasions in the book.

This reminded me of the TV series Battlestar Gallactica. The threat of Cylons is always on the heels. The entire humanity is on the brink of extinction and it is thought-provoking to see over four seasons how power structures rise and fall in the single spaceship. Max Brook’s World War Z brings about similar thoughts to mind. It brings a mirror to society and forces us to start thinking about the collective good and reprioritise (cough relentless march of global warming cough). The intimidation of this particular threat is almost convincingly real and seeing how the USA/world handled Covid pandemic, such mirrors need to be polished and kept handy.

However, the nature of the narrative is like a transcript and that has resulted in a lot of frustration in the tone of the interviewees. Almost all the interviewees sound hyper, over-eager and somewhat annoyed with the interviewer. This gets old at about midway of the book, and you crave for some freshness or change, which does not come.

The end felt a bit rushed. There is a section for goodbyes at the end, and that could have been fleshed out a bit more.

The book is an oral history and the descriptions are vivid and almost visual. It has a great opportunity to be a fantastic movie. After seeing the trailer of Brad Pitt starer from the year 2013, I feel the book still needs to be a fantastic movie. I wish I would not see the movie and taint my experience with the book, but FOMO.

Overall, it is a great read and must for the sheer brilliance of creativity. Max Brooks creates a lived-in disaster with elaborate details and tries to cover many walks of life.",vaikrunta,2022-07-19 12:03:35
w1zx41,"This came up a couple days ago, so I'll just repeat what I said then here:

World War Z. It has all the subtlety of a brick thrown through your living room window. All the things it wants to say are about as insightful as /r/im14andthisisdeep. And, just in case the reader somehow still doesn't catch on, it cranks the ludicrousness to 13. He knows themes he wants to talk about - for example, opportunistic capitalist uses outbreak fear to make money, or military thought is rooted in 'the last war' - but he has absolutely no skill to portray them in anything but the most rudimentary, baseball bat over the head way - opportunistic capitalist has to hide in Antarctica because of what he did, or the military gets slaughtered by the zombies because the thought of getting above a zombie horde incapable of the concept of elevators was apparently outside the grasp of thousands of soldiers.

Aircraft-dropped bombs, as well as artillery and anti-infantry tank shells *are going to be laying waste to entire swathes of zombies at a time*

The amount of impact force those things put out **pulp things**. The zombies wouldn't have a head to destroy 

>Also becoming relatively useless once the zombies get so close as you'll hit your own troops.

....do you know what sort of distances artillery fires at?

The standard US 155mm howitzer has a range of **13 miles (21km)**.

Zombies are so slow you can just  mount infantry in trucks and slowly roll them down a road, dropping shells behind them the entire way.

>The M2 is a relatively decent point, but you still need multiple hits as the zombies don't stop when torn in half

Sure they do! A crawler-zombie is *a mission-killed zombie*. It starts crawling, you walk up and shove a bayonet through their eyesocket. Done.



>Also most guys are trained in suppression tactics and IIRC in world war Z they start running out of ammo.

That is because the author is a fucking moron that doesnt know how the US Military works.

The US Military has plans to fight invasions on both coasts at the same time. The main strength of the US Military is its logistical arm.

Every US military member has to qualifiy on rifle marksmanship as a part of basic training. Are they snipers? No.

But they are still expected to be able to hit a target reliably.

r0us1e,"*World War Z* is a book that I have... thoughts on. I've read it several times and still consider it one of the best zombie stories ever made in any medium, and having *The Zombie Survival Guide* as a companion makes it even better. It's an absolute blast to read, and there are parts of it that are still frighteningly prescient today, especially when you look at how we mismanaged the response to COVID. People are still gonna be discussing this book twenty years from now. To this day, there is little else like it in the zombie genre.

In other ways, however, it is just as shockingly dated, and not just in the surface details and aesthetics like the GameCube reference and the parodies of various celebrities and politicians. Major plot points would probably be completely rewritten if this book were written today.

One thing I noticed when rereading *World War Z* a few years ago is that you can tell it was written in the Bush era. The values of the book are very ""mid-late '00s liberal/libertarian blogosphere"" in how the government is portrayed (especially amidst the War on Terror), not anti-government *per se* but with a definite sense that they and society in general are wasting their time and need to start focusing on the things the author deems important. The internet was still seen as the great hope for dissident views to get out and challenge a broken mainstream media consensus, before we realized just what a cesspool it would turn into. Had the book been written today, I have no doubt that it would portray the internet in almost the exact opposite light that it did, not as a lifesaving beacon of truth whose only problem is that its users are too self-absorbed to actually do anything, but as a font of misinformation and lies that makes the Great Panic ten times worse.

The interview with Breckenridge Scott is a case in point. In hindsight, it can be read as a great satire of not just the boom in alternative medicine and the damage it caused, but also of dirtbags like Martin Shkreli and Elizabeth Holmes. The thing is, you kinda have to stretch the actual text to get to that reading. Scott's not an alt-med grifter who thinks he knows better than everyone, or a Silicon Valley ""disruptor"" who thought he could outmaneuver the old ""dinosaur"" companies. No, he's explicitly described as a part of Big Pharma who got as far as he did with his vaccine (and Phalanx is explicitly called a vaccine) because the entire medical establishment was corrupt, from an FDA that had been captured by the drug companies to doctors who got rich prescribing medicines they knew were worthless. As a sendup of the emerging opioid epidemic, fueled by unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies and ""pill mill"" doctors and pharmacies, those critiques were spot-on, but as a commentary on the COVID response? In real life, it was the old-fashioned pharmaceutical and biotech industries that pulled through with actual working vaccines made with revolutionary new technology when everybody else was selling snake oil, and doctors who fought back from the start against the misinformation being spread about COVID. Some of the book's cynicism about people acting stupid is definitely warranted, but there are places where it goes too far. That section was an unwelcome reminder of a time in the not-so-distant past when anti-vax and alt-med woo was way more broadly accepted than it is today, including among people you'd think would know better.

The entire section on Japan also feels *really* uncomfortable if you know the first thing about Japan's brand of right-wing nationalism, falling into the same trap that a lot of Western media does in fetishizing imagery that has some rather questionable stuff behind it. So, post-zombie Japan is a country where a revived Tatenokai, an organization originally founded by Yukio Mishima that staged a harebrained coup attempt to restore the Emperor's authority, are a mainstream and widely accepted part of society that's presented to the reader as just ""badass zombie slayers with katanas""? Huh.

This was a problem with a lot of ""cool"" geek media in the late '00s and early '10s, especially the fetish for the apocalypse as some kind of great proving ground for badasses. To its credit, outside the Japan chapter *World War Z* mostly avoids the worst excesses here, emphasizing just how screwed most of us would *actually* be if we got thrown into a real-life zombie movie while giving doomsday preppers a generally unfavorable, even mocking treatment. I loved the bit where the pilot describes finding a wannabe survivalist in an SUV full of gear who killed himself because it turned out he was all talk and fell into despair when things actually got tough. But a lot of the zombie media that came after was just ""cool, exploding heads and shit, and nobody to tell me what to do!"" You even had groups like the Zombie Squad that explicitly used a hypothetical zombie apocalypse to get people interested in survivalism. To be fair, there were also doctors, scientists, and FEMA personnel who used zombie media to get people interested in epidemiology and emergency preparedness, but in its pulpier and more popular forms, I believe you can draw a straight line between a lot of that culture and the fetishization of guns and societal breakdown that permeates so much of American right-wing politics today, especially among a certain breed of younger conservative.

One book that I really recommend is Max Brooks' most recent novel *Devolution*. It's a smaller-scale story about one group of people surviving a disaster that only affects Washington state, but in a lot of ways, it is basically ""*World War Z* if Brooks wrote it today"". The satirical targets are updated, mocking ""back to nature"" cottagecore/solarpunk types, corporate greenwashing, the wellness industry, Elon Musk, and Jordan Peterson, but the tone and style of the book are very similar.",KevinR1990,2021-11-24 18:43:38

If you like that genre of writing, I recommend you try out Michael Crichton and Richard Preston. They both have written a lot of fictional non-fiction, as you put it.

I actually remember Max Brooks’ previous book, *The Zombie Survival Guide* as being the moment when I felt Zombies had overstayed their welcome.  The book was good, but it felt like the movie Scream to slasher movies—it dissected the genre elements so effectively that it made it clear that this was an overstuffed field, and not much new was really being done with it.  

Of course, plenty of people I’ve talked to have said that the Dawn of the Dead remake was when it tipped the balance, or even earlier.  Zombies have been shambling around for a long damn time, and people have gotten tired of them pretty frequently.  

Despite that, I do think World War Z stepped into that overstuffed field and absolutely justified its existence in a way the Survival Guide didn’t, and aside from maybe Romero’s better attempts, is pretty much the pinnacle of the classic Zombie fiction genre.",sdwoodchuck,2020-11-05 17:34:14

The roads are clogged with refugees and abandoned vehicles, so they aren't able to move the fuel they'd need to run those tanks. The air fields that the planes take off from are being overrun, so they can't send them out. The resource networks to create the bombs that kill zombies at an extremely low level of efficiency are shattered by the spreading infection. The military disaster of the book, Yonkers, is specifically shown to be a failure due to poor planning that came about due to the propagandistic nature of the battle. There are many unnecessary assets there to demonstrate the power of the US military, yet they didn't bring enough ammunition to keep firing all of it. The soldiers are wearing unnecessary gear because they can. They're all hooked into a communications network that only brings them frightening information. Even with all of those disadvantages, they are succeeding until an unexpected terror comes into the situation and panics some of them.

There's been so many zombie movies/books/video games that if the idea of a zombie apocalypse existed within the universe of World War Z, the book would be a ten pages long account of how everyone started shooting zombies in the face.

It's like every horror movie where a character walks toward an obvious trap (don't open the door! They're still out there!) that could have been avoided had that character ever seen a cliche horror flick.

The opposite of this is movies like The Avengers where the characters are quite aware of comics, and realize that they are an archetypal ""superhero"". There are even points in the movie that point out the similarities between their actions and those of a comic book, making suspension of disbelief easier for the audience if we think they know how ridiculous the plot/dialogue is.

I've just graduated from university in Politics and in my geopolitics module we studied World War Z as a reflection of fears of mass migration, international cooperation, and contemporary anxiety caused by a hectic lifestyle.

The zombie genre has been, since its inception, a placeholder for commenting on societal fears — which brings me to my question:

Do you think we can expect a resurgence of the zombie genre in the coming years as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic? 

I know the ""zombies as a fear of globalised pandemic"" has been done already, so, personally, I'd expect to see zombie films, TV shows, and books from developing countries as their government's disastrous handling of the crisis and lack of a spotlight in first world media (think Yemen, for example) are the perfect groundwork for fresh takes to revive the genre.

hi2btv,Will Pitt and Fincher ever make World War Z 2?,,2020-06-29 16:26:45
hi2btv,"All good questions. 
1. I don't think writer's block is as real as ""writer's fear"". I'm not sure writer's dry spells are all about an actual lack of ideas as opposed to to thinking those ideas suck. The only solution is just to do it. Push through, take things in drafts, don't worry about it being good at first. Take the time to polish and chop and make subsequent drafts ""finished enough"" as my dad would say. Then when it gets out there, walk away and try not to obsess on how it's received. 
2. For me, sometimes writing in another's voice helps with a particular format. When I wrote ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" I channeled the dry, no-nonsense language of real survival manuals. In World War Z, I tried to sound like Studs Terkel in my introduction. In The Harlem Hellfighters, I had to study, exhaustively the interviews with the last remaining Hellfighters to get a sense of their language. That's just how I work, and, if I've learned anything, it's that there is no RIGHT way to do something as subjective as fiction writing. 
3. Wow have I ever trunked a novel. Zombie Survival Guide was written in the 90s, when no one cared about zombies. In fact, I never thought it would ever see the light of day. 
4. Sorry, can't do chocolate milk (unless I have a few lactaid pills nearby!)",MaxBrooksAuthor,2020-06-29 18:37:16
hi2btv,"For me, the story dictates the format: 

1. Zombie Survival Guide: A straight out manual because it's all about 'how to' survive a zombie attack. Simple. 

2. World War Z was an oral history because Studs Terkel's ""The Good War' showed me that an oral history is the best way to tell the massive story of a global calamity. 

3. Harlem Hellfighters had to be a graphic novel because it's a story about race, and race, skin color, is visual. I didn't want the readers to forget what color these soldiers were because these soldiers were never allowed to forget. 

4. Devolution made for a perfect 'found journal' because I wanted the ending to be a mystery. If it was an oral history, we'd know who survived and who didn't. If we find the journal but not the writer, we are left wondering what the hell happened.",MaxBrooksAuthor,2020-06-29 17:29:27

47qaqz,"> e

thing is, the explosive force in question in the book tells not of the fragmentation rounds (in fact i think there was a part of the yonkers battle where they said they wished they used some form of fragmentation instead of concussive) in normal explosive pressures on the human body, cells rupture lungs collapse and bones can pretty much shatter, not all at the same time mind you, or yea all at the same time. 

the thing this book made a good point of, is these aint normal human beings anymore, I mean fuck if they can survive crush depth of the ocean floor for some inexplicable reason, then they can survive explosive pressure. 

yes you can blow out a significant portion of ""zeke's"" body, but they'll still come at you. they'll crawl with their fingers, they'll crawl with whatever they've got left, they'll even freaking wiggle their way to you. The point in the book, especially at yonkers, is not the extremes of our current military potential, it's how the battles were unlike everything they've ever had to compete with. 

take your single mechanized division, how many of them will be obtaining a solid headshot ratio? how much ammunition will they have available to them? artilliary will mostly work on explosive force alone not fragmented, and even if it were fragmented, how much of the fragmentation will actually destroy a ""zeke"" brain? how far would the mechanized division be from the horde itself?

not only that, but suppose there is an absurd number of zeke's coming at them, how many would they actually manage to kill before they're overrun? and if they're overrun you've got a bunch of well protected skulls going around being pretty much invincible to most of the very EXPENSIVE weapons our militaries might have.

your mention of the M1A2, yea it's not gonna be taken down easily, but aside from the canisters and auto gun on the top, what else do these tanks have against zeke, crushing them? you'd need to drive in circles popping lots of skulls to get close to the point of killing enough of them before the fuel hungry M1A2 can even be considered for use in a situation with zeke. 

most, not some, Most of our militarys might relies on targets susceptible to explosive pressure, or concussive pressure, that 20mm round is expensive, there are lots of zekes, that 20mm round (unless somehow its fuse based and fragmented) will not kill zeke, they will still keep crawling. what are you gonna do? have billions of 20mm rounds for an entire horde of zekes? fuck no, that'd be a waste of time, and not only that but you'd just end up wasting valuable resources. yes claymores are a viable tactic....against a few zekes, then the resource option comes into play again. unless the minefields are riddled with extremely high compact and heat resistant shrapnel producing metals for larger areas of upward fragmentation, all you're gonna do is ripp off a few legs and slow down not even half of the zekes in a 10ft radius of the mine itself. 

and again, this is fiction, it's got an element that takes away the majority of military might in our world. our world relies on the ability to basically shred the human body through explosives, but in world war Z, they aren't really affected by it, their bodies can absorb the blasts pretty well, sure the force itself might cause a bunch of fractures in the bones, but so long as the bones are reletively intact they still function.

I did listen to an older version my library had that was properly unabridged, but it was only the one narrator,  and for a book with so many voices, you really want different narrators  (also, this guy wasn't great).

I’m not entirely sure it was ever marketed as a ‘horror’ story, though. It’s loosely based on a book about the Second World War, ‘The Good War’ by Studs Terkel. It’s an account of what happened, using a journalist as a framing device, and told through first person accounts and anecdotes.

I think World War Z deals with something horrific, without being a horror. It explores a global trauma, something unimaginable, something that will leave a scar on the human psyche forever, but it’s not a sensationalist horror story.

10f0rmz,"I respectfully disagree. I’m not sure how far you got into the book, or if you finished the book, but the book is not just a scattered bunch of random POVs up until the end. They all track key developments in “World War Z” with the beginning obviously starting with the first instances of outbreaks in China, then progressing through rumor and rural spread, then eventually the Great Panic, and then the brink, then humanity fighting back, until the end when it seems the apocalypse has been largely halted and reversed. The POVs, especially as you reach the middle and end, often tell a personal story that ties directly into the larger sequence of events in the story. It builds, and I really did feel a strong sense of urgency as the story went from rumors of outbreaks to shit actually hitting the fan. And then the sense of triumph and strength as the countries began to really learn from events and adapt. I mean just compare the POV from the Battle of Yonkers to the later reclamations and new tactics used by the American troops at these end of the book. 

At least when I read it I certainly felt like there was a broader narrative being advanced behind every single POV and that there absolutely was motion and urgency. But to each their own I guess.",,2023-01-18 23:43:49

I disliked the World War Z movie as well. With the popularity of the “mockumentary” format and true crime style documentaries, I would love to see someone take another run at this, as a limited series on a streamer. The hook of the book for me was that it was an oral history with people telling their moments of interaction with the big events, to preserve a historical record. It seems like a natural to do it like that, or maybe in the style of a Ken Burns documentary with talking head narration interspersed with “found footage” style sound and video recordings. Ring camera footage of zombies approaching houses, or lab security cameras, or audio transmissions with the astronaut stuck in space. Interviews with the doctors who treat the astronaut after he returns etc. Like my wish for a Disney+ MCU tv series following insurance claims adjusters in the wake of superhero shenanigans, I’m just gonna keep putting this out there til it manifests or something!",katchoo1,2023-11-12 16:23:08

It doesn't matter if they would have to fly internationally for sets or not, the fact is that they would have to be all over the place even within one country, constructing completely new sets only to tear them down after shooting a single episode/scene, and that is just for the cheaper episodes that can be shot traditionally.

Overall, World War Z is a completely different beast than TWD when it comes to cost. For comparison, the entirety of TWD's last season was only shot in three primary locations: the prison, the Governor's town, and random fields/forests in between. ",ScalpelBurn2,2013-06-06 01:23:04

Other characters and stories fall flat, and can find themselves mimicking generic zombie movie cliches. The end also alls short, because it revisits some of the characters, many of whom you've completely forgotten about simply because there are so many.

Literary wise, it might not have been anything impressive, but in terms of world-building it was top notch.

hxn0an,"I also really enjoyed World War Z. I recommend trying the audio book next time you find yourself on a long drive. It's fully voice acted out, and I feel does a great job of finding the individualism in the characters the book may seem to lack from some perspectives.

Personally, I thought the diversity between the manner of how the different countries/regions handled the crisis throughout the book was well thought out. I also didn't find that they necessarily favored capitalism or A-typical western idealogy in the book. If anything, I would argue the opposite, as it was clear the in the story, the US specifically seemed to have mishandled the crisis more than any other country. In fact, it was South Africa, Latin America, and sections of the Middle East that were the most independently successful at maintaining the extinction level event the overarching story was foretelling.

If there was one consistent negative I recall, it was how the 3 largest ""super powers"" of the world systematically botched the crisis in their own unique way. (China, US, and Russia).

I'll concede for sure though, that World War Z is the hardly work of literary genius, but a fun page turner that by the end, does a decent job convincing the reader that these events are somehow part of history.

That might not seem relevant since it's still earlier than the setting of the book, but the impressive thing is that he survived the *bombs*. [Both of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Yamaguchi). There were 164 other double survivors in some sense, and I haven't found the a list of all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if some were still alive today, years after the setting of the book.",cybishop3,2015-05-14 18:38:49

1b4lfq,"I'm not generally a fan of zombies, so I'm probably not the best judge...but I ended up really liking World War Z. BUT, instead of reading it, I listened to the audio version. Which is much more a full-cast performance than a simple reading. It's more like a radio drama than anything else. Well-known actors, and I think even some music and sound effects. Very enjoyable, and might move along faster than reading it yourself. ",jedikermit,2013-03-28 00:28:28
15z8cd,"I read World War Z a few months ago and LOVED it. I was pretty sick of all the cliche zombie films coming out over the past few years, but when I started reading this book, it was unlike anything I'd ever read before in that arena. If there is a way to make a zombie apocalypse seem realistic in any way, this is your book. ",womanwithoutborders,2013-01-05 11:15:28
1easc5,"I don't know if it's particularly relevant to your complaint, but are you familiar with how the book is structured?  Rather than actually being a cast acting out a story together, *World War Z* would probably be better approached as a series of very brief short stories all set in one world.  Each individual story only has a cast of one person, there just happens to be a lot of them.

Sorry if I'm telling you something you already know, but it's a good book and it would be a shame for you to miss out on it if it could be helped.",lordnequam,2013-05-14 20:44:50
98r832,"World War Z is a very good book, and an incredible audiobook. Normally, I much prefer books to audiobooks, but in the case of  World War Z I make an exception. 

I think that part of the reason that I like World War Z so much is because it's about survivors. Zombie stories tend to be about the end of the world, and how human society ends. 28 Weeks Later, Dawn of the Dead, The Girl With All of the Gifts, etc - they're all stories where basically, humanity loses. At best, the typical zombie story ends on a note that indicates that humanity is barely hanging on, like on the Walking Dead. In World War Z, humanity is devastated, but the human race survives, and is on the path to rebuilding itself.  

The tragedy is balanced by the knowledge that the sacrifices that people made were not in vain. ",MRCHalifax,2018-08-20 11:40:08
98r832,"I haven't read the book, but a long time ago I saw two chapters performed by actors.  Some kind of fan project.  I don't know if they were on Youtube, if they got pulled, or what happened to them, but they were great.  Both were just a person sitting at a table telling their story.  If i recall correctly, they weren't reading from paper.  It was really good, and I can see how the audiobook must be a powerful experience, I'll have to add it to my list.

I've tried finding them again, but since the movie came out, any video clip search for World War Z is flooded with junk.",ChronoMonkeyX,2018-08-20 20:44:50
d7qvn,"I must sadly disagree with both recommendations. I think American Gods felt like ""Sandman 2"" which is not a bad thing. I enjoyed his first mixing of myths more.
As for World War Z I enjoyed parts of it but felt let down as a whole. The author was great when describing large scale events but was not so adept stories of individuals struggling with the Zombie plague. 

As a recommendation I enjoyed ""To Reign in Hell"" by Roger Zelazny. ",LokiLittle,2010-08-31 20:24:25

936r7,"World War Z... I went into it expecting it to be a badly-written gore-fest... I emerged on the other side thoroughly terrified and with a great awe of Max Brooks. This book is filled with humanity pushed to the brink, and amazing stories of survival from people who learned to live with constant terror. Aside from every character mysteriously having the same badass, 'who gives a fuck' attitude, this book was incredibly imaginative and well written. Plus, I love me some oral biographies. ",svonnah,2009-07-21 22:10:53
fljm3c,Question for you all; what other books have you loved? World war z was an amazing book. Will Wheaton did a great job on the audio book too if you didn't catch that.  Looking for other like minded readers suggestions!,jlcohen81,2020-03-20 02:59:54
jvwpw,"I'm still trying to figure out how how I feel about this movie.  My favorite part of World War Z was the way it was written as interviews POST zombie invasion. However, that wouldn't make a very good movie I don't think, and the pictures so far make it appear as if it's going to be a single story and not a collection of different stories.  

Am I wrong? I sort of hope I'm wrong.",OddballEducator,2011-08-27 06:02:08
jvwpw,"I'm going to respectfully disagree with you there. For me, there's a difference between ""based on a book"", and ""a movie version of a book"". With it being titled World War Z (as far as we know, considering everyone seems to be referring to it that way), I'd expect it to cater to book fans, rather than an ""inspired by the book"" piece. ",fuzzypandabuttmunch,2011-08-28 23:21:04
3euidf,"I'm not sure if I agree that the books are similar. The only similarities I can see is that they are both just fantastic books. When I finished both, I couldn't wait to recommend them to others. 

*The Martian*... themes that jump out for me are hope and perseverance. Mark Watney never gave up. The book made me feel happy when I finished it. 

*World War Z*... a great book. Shockingly great. It put me on a long path of reading every zombie book I could get my hands on. That being said, it is a dark book. There are some seriously disturbing things (church story, north Canada story...). By virtue of how the book was written, several short stories set in the same universe linked by the narrator, it is hard to pick one or two themes. Maybe that humanity is both wonderful and terrible. When I finished it, I felt a little wrung out. There were so many highs and lows. I needed a few days to absorb what I read. 

Another book written in a similar style, and feel as *World War Z* is [*Robopocalypse*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18625107-robopocalypse) by Daniel H. Wilson. I think you may enjoy it. ",trekbette,2015-07-28 03:16:46
3euidf,"I see where you're coming from in terms of the books being quite different, and I agree. What I meant in terms of similarities were that when I was reading, all the technical and very in-depth stuff being explained by someone in the field felt just like something from World War Z. They are very different in their own rights, and I love them both to death.",mizuromo,2015-07-28 04:22:38
1ilwr8,"Well, the big one is the book that *World War Z* took its style from -- Studs Terkel's *Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression*.  

Fewer zombies, though.  But an amazing read.",Joywalking,2013-07-19 03:33:40
kme8h,"For sure you don't. The survival guide isn't really literature, it's just a fun book to read while pooping.

World War Z is really amazing though, but I'm a sucker for journal entry format (kind of) books",Brocbrocbroc,2011-09-21 05:39:46
kme8h,"I would say read world war z first, because the survival guide is just that, a survival guide, and after reading z, what he talks about in the survival guide fills in some of the technical gaps",severinggecko,2011-09-21 04:50:40

lvzio,"I have an autographed copy of World War Z at home... 

When I was a kid my sister tied me to a chair (long story) and I fell forward and split my chin open. I still have a fairly prominent scar that looks funky in my beard and I always give my sister a hard time about it. 

So last year when Max Brooks gave a talk at the school where my sister teaches she sent me a copy of World War Z she had him autograph with ""To admiraljohn: I hope this makes up for the chair incident"". 

... and it does. :)",admiraljohn,2011-11-01 10:56:03
2ikx4u,"it is a case by case thing.

signed ARC's for ""Infinite Jest"" are not at all rare. Even signed, they are worth a third to half of the signed first edition

But there are about 8 copies of the uncorrected Proof for ""Broom of the System"", and even unsigned, one of them is worth more than a signed first.

if the book was highly anticipated (the author already famous, and the book is likely to sell well), there will be a lot of ARCs.

if the author is beginning, and relatively unknown, there will be fewer ARCs, and they're rare by comparison.

""World War Z"" appears to trade around $250-300 for signed firsts, which seem relatively common. I'd imagine the ARCs occur in larger numbers.

signed firsts will almost always outprice unsigned ARCs (except in extreme cases like the DFW example above)",strychnineman,2014-10-07 19:43:27
