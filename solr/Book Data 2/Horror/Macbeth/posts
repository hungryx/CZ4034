13yecz7,"Macbeth is a literary masterpiece that, in my opinion, kickstarted psychological genres of literature","Macbeth is the shortest, bloodiest and by far most exciting play Shakespeare has to offer, and I feel like despite its presence in the school system (England) people don’t really realise it’s ingenuity.

Seriously, it’s arguably one of the first stories ever written to truly focus on the psyche, the *why* of characters. Macbeth isn’t some evil, 2D character, he really struggles with the thought of regicide, a strong theme in relation to the great chain of being, convincing himself that he doesn’t need to kill to claim the throne initially but eventually, with Lady Macbeth’s persuasion, he executes the unforgivable sin of murdering a King (Maybe a few decades too early) and it’s here, the aftermath of such an obscene act, that the play truly flourishes, as Macbeth descends deeper into his tyrannical madness, a consequence of his reliance on the unnatural witches, who themselves even begin to see Macbeth as wicked.

And all it comes to a crashing end with his overconfidence ultimately being his demise, as his kingdom built on blood falls apart under its own wickedness; “All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this here spot,” Lady Macbeth says in her final soliloquy, and in my favourite quote of all, remarks that “What’s done can not be undone;” a terrible realisation echoing from an earlier sentiment in the play- “What’s done is done.” It comes full circle, the true scale and horror of her actions have set in, which are all too much for her as she eventually takes her own life.

And to end with, since this is way longer than I expected, my favourite soliloquy- “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.”  I interpret this as the effect of godlessness on Macbeth, stemming from killing God’s appointed regent on Earth, as early as from when he was unable to say amen. He is resigned in this speech, somber and almost nihilist; psychologically, what with Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, and Banquo’s long line of kings shown earlier, perhaps he has acknowledged his fallibility, even if none of woman born can harm Macbeth, what toll has it taken on his person? What kingdom is there left to rule?

This play is really quite spectacular, a classic tragedy, the fall from grace of a once noble servant to a tyrannical, immoral usurper. Really, read this play. It’ll take hardly half an hour but it’ll be worth all the more.

(BTW, I tried to post this on literature but it didn’t work? Anyone know what’s up with that?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13yecz7/macbeth_is_a_literary_masterpiece_that_in_my/,2023-06-02 14:30:24,37,84,books
wqhe8q,Some weird things about Macbeth,"I watched the film version in 2015 but I never got a chance to read the play itself until recently.

The most inconceivable part in the play is the prophecy of ""not harmed by person born of women"", from the witches. Nevertheless Macbeth was slaughtered by Macduff who was ""delivered prematurely"". The book editor remarked that it was from Caesarean method, but how by all means does that make Macduff NOT born of women? The 2015 film didn't answer the question either.

And the witches prophesized that Banquo's children will be king, but at the end of the play it was Malcolm, the son of old king Duncan who ascended to the throne instead of Fleance the son of Banquo.

In the film, the Birnam Wood prophecy was broken after Macduff burned the trees, which made the final dual battle scene in the fire embers and ashes quite eye-catching, and I even thought that was the original play. Well, the original play stated that the prophecy was broken after the English soldiers cut down the trees to camouflage. I'll say the film adaptation is much better on this one, but I think a lot of Shakespearean readers might disagree.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wqhe8q/some_weird_things_about_macbeth/,2022-08-17 06:17:16,19,3,books
dgi2g9,Macbeth (Shakespeare),"""...this even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice to our own lips.""
For all these years, I was oblivious of the phenomenon that Shakespeare was. Until recently, I was too ignorant to appreciate the beauty of his words, character sketching and storytelling. After having read one of the masterpieces of English literature Macbeth, now I can understand why he is regarded what he is regarded as.
At the very start, the witches say: Foul is fair. Fair is foul. The foundation is laid that there will be a lot of equivocation (double speaking). 
The way Shakespeare gets into the minds of his main characters and explores their darkest thoughts is breathtaking. The suspense keeps you hooked until the end.
The language and the literary devices used are the icing on the cake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dgi2g9/macbeth_shakespeare/,2019-10-11 17:04:15,16,21,books

j2kxhe,Understanding lines from Macbeth,"Good morning everyone! I’m reading Macbeth and am enjoying it, I know the premise of the play but the execution is what I find so enthralling. I’ve never taken the time to read a Shakespeare play, I’m glad I took the leap for a dollar :)

Anyway, I have a line I’m trying to understand better. It’s from lady Macbeth after she has read the note from her husband. 

She notes the suspicions of the prophecy and how graces received should be watched? 

Act 1 scene 5

Thou wouldst be great, 
Art not without ambition, but without 
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst
    highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false.
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have,
    Great Glamis,
That which cries “Thus thou must do” if thou have it;

I get confused at the word “holily”, and I think wrongly win is her dislike of Macbeth receiving the crown vs. earning it, I could be completely wrong. 

Also, if anyone knows hidden Shakespeare gems  please let me know :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j2kxhe/understanding_lines_from_macbeth/,2020-09-30 12:11:50,3,10,books
mwn7w3,False sense of security in Macbeth,"In Macbeth our protagonist is introduced to a false sense of security as early as Act 1 particularly in Scene 3 when Banquo and Macbeth encounter the three witches at which they present them a prophesy. Another example of this was in Act 4, Scene 1 where Macbeth talks to the three witches and the apparitions which assures Macbeth wouldn't be killed by anyone born of woman which provides him with a sense of false security from there to the end of the play. I am wondering how other events of false sense of security affected Macbeth's actions throughout the play.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mwn7w3/false_sense_of_security_in_macbeth/,2021-04-23 04:23:52,2,4,books
mhho9d,"Sparknotes has the graphic novels of Macbeth, Romeo & Juliet,& Hamlet up for free on their websites.","I don't want this to turn into another purist debate about how seeing live plays are better or something like that. 

If you enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy graphic novels then I highly recommend checking out the versions in the links below. There are other graphic novelized versions as well that come from other publishers. 

For those on the fence about Shakespeare or maybe you were forced to read him in school and it left a bad impression, then I would highly recommend checking out the graphic novelized versions as well. Part of making these click for me was being able to see what was happening when were learned about him. The graphic novels do the same thing by allowing you form a visual, but you can read them at your own pace. Hopefully afterwards, it'll make these works seem less intimidating so you can check out his other works. Or you'll realize that this isn't your thing for whatever reason and that's okay too.

I wondered to myself today as I read through parts of the play I didn't understand how it's possible that after 500 years we still find Macbeth interesting. Macbeth wasn't really popular when Shakespeare was alive, it was only after his death that the world fell in love with him, so much that it has been taught for more than 100 years in high school.

38y4iu,[discussion] What is it about Shakespeare's Macbeth that makes it a go-to comparison for some modern works?,"Having not ever read Shakespeare's Macbeth, I'm curious what it is about that story that makes it a comparison to some modern works I'm reading.  Example: I just finished the first few installments of the anime/manga Berserk.  Multiple summaries and plot outlines suggest it is akin to Macbeth.  If anyone knows about Berserk, they'll know how dark and demonic it becomes.  Is Shakespeare's Macbeth really an accurate comparison to works like this? What is it that makes them similar?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/38y4iu/discussion_what_is_it_about_shakespeares_macbeth/,2015-06-07 20:56:29,10,7,books
24tf7p,An intriguing analysis of American Psycho with comparisons to Dante's Inferno and Macbeth.,"I recently watched *American Psycho* and decided to pick up the novel as well. However, I couldn't help but do some additional research to try and figure out what others thought was going on in the story and what some of the ambiguity implied.

In that process I stumbled across the following blog posts that do a very interesting dive into the novel and bring up similarities it has both with Dante's *Inferno* and *Macbeth*. I wouldn't have immediately connected those dots, so I thought it might be interesting to you all as well.

It's a 4 part series:
