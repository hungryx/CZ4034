w1fhdz,I just finished Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about Carrie.,"I love a Supernatural High School Girl  Revenge Story. 

But somehow I‚Äôd never read Carrie.

Stephen King feels like he‚Äôs been in the zeitgeist lately, and like I said, I Iove a bullied high school girl revenge story. 

You know: Heathers, Mean Girls (different genre but still), the parts of Yellowjackets that are a homage to King, Carrie in particular. 

 I‚Äôd seen snippets of the movie here and there, of course. Who hasn‚Äôt? 

‚ÄúI never much cared for Carrie White,‚Äù King says at one point in On Writing. That was all I really knew about the book instead of the movie.

I found his admission a little haunting, especially when he goes on to describe two girls who were horribly bullied at his school and their bleak experiences. 

He also talks about trying to keep Carrie‚Äôs physical description intentionally vague in order to get readers to conjure the girl most bullied and maligned in their high school. Gulp.  

Anyway, I was at the library yesterday and I figured the book was worth a shot. 

Carrie reads really different from Bullied Magic Girl stories I‚Äôm used to. 

Most surprising to me: there‚Äôs a lot of sympathy and nuance for the people who bully Carrie ‚Äî often more sympathy for them as they do terrible things, than there is for Carrie herself. 

In fact, one piece of the book I was struck by is how much DISGUST is elicited by Carrie, both in the characters‚Äô reactions to her and in her physical descriptors. King brings up Carrie‚Äôs snot color 5 times at least.

Parts of this I like.  I like that Chris, the antagonist that catalyzes the practical joke that makes Carrie unleash her fury, is clear in her motivation. Chris is interesting without her behavior ever being excusable or explained as Because of Her Trauma ü•≤. Same with her dirtbag boyfriend. 

Same with Sue Snell, who is ultimately the protagonist of Carrie. I was also shocked Carrie wasn‚Äôt the main character! But it makes sense. 

This book is ultimately about guilt, about why and how we ostracize others, and what we do with our power. 

Sue, as a result, is the person the book is really about. It‚Äôs about Sue‚Äôs terrible behavior and subsequent guilt. Sue‚Äôs feelings of hate and disgust instead of pity for Carrie. And her complicated and sometimes selfish motivations for altruism. 

There are also lots of stylistic pieces of the book I found compelling and want to emulate in my own writing. There‚Äôs so much well done POV shifting, a clear sense of time that builds suspense.

There‚Äôs also a very real sense of how people talk even when it gets... very Stephen King (at one point a character says ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the type to load his shotgun with buckshot instead of rock salt in green apple season.‚Äù Steve, what?)

It‚Äôs definitely Sue‚Äôs book, not Carrie‚Äôs. 

Briefly checking out remakes of the movie and noticing how different they are.  Especially in newer versions, Carrie is so much more intentionally sympathetic. She has more agency or at least, more Hollywood Hotness. 

 I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî do you think King is so sympathetic to Sue because The Weird Kid hadn‚Äôt been reclaimed in 1979?

 Because we still hated The Weird Kid instead of glorifying her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/w1fhdz/i_just_finished_stephen_kings_carrie_its_not/,2022-07-17 19:37:30,424,2978,books
zv1c3n,"I just read Stephen King's ""Carrie"". I have a Doubt","Carrie's father Ralph White died before she was born. His Father as said in the book died seven months before her birth, but later on in the book it was said that when Margaret White tried to kill Carrie before she was even a year old, Ralph stopped her. How is that possible?  Did I miss an important point or misunderstood something in the book? I literally stopped reading at the point when ralph stopped Margaret from killing Carrie and started recalling everything I know about Ralph and even read few starting pages in the book (regarding Ralph's death). I didn't search the internet at that point because I thought I might encounter spoilers. I finished the book; I think this must be a Plot hole or a writing error.

10o2e4b,Carrie Soto Is Back,"I'm a big TJR fan - the first book of hers I read was Evelyn Hugo, which I absolutely loved and devoured in one sitting, and then I read and loved Daisy Jones, Evidence of the Affair and Malibu Rising as well.

I was really excited to read Carrie Soto and was waiting for it to come out, but then I didn't get to it until now since I've been in a reading slump. And I absolutely loved it! I binged it until past 2am because I couldn't put it down.

I am a tennis fan so I think that definitely contributed, but I just absolutely loved the entire book. First and foremost, Carrie's character development is incredible. She is definitely a prickly character and I can see why people would find her unlikable, but I found her refreshing and very rootable (which I know isn't a word but still). Javier might be my favourite character, though. I absolutely love his relationship with her and his ""Let me feel it and say it. You're the meaning of my life"" brought me to tears. Also the scene with them finally eating ice cream sandwiches!

I like Carrie's relationship with Bowe a lot too and felt that the development of it was very natural. I like that he told her ""I love you"" and she couldn't say it back right away but he was okay with that. And the way he supported her after losing Javier was so heartwarming. I also like Carrie's friendship with Gwen. It was really nice to see that respect and support between them. It was definitely a big moment when Carrie apologized to her. 

And I love Carrie's rivalry with Nicki. I was worried that TJR would write Nicki as fake and catty but Nicki really was a big fan of Carrie's and genuinely respected her. But also wasn't afraid to tell her that she was looking forward to beating her. I love that. And I loved it when Nicki called Carrie out on not respecting Nicki the way Nicki respected her. I totally didn't see the turn of Carrie coaching Nicki but I loved that. 

I feel like I've used the word ""love"" a hundred times üòÇ I have to say, when I saw Carrie in Malibu Rising, I definitely never thought I'd be so captured and moved by her story. But I expect nothing less from TJR. And I'm sad we won't get another installment in this universe but grateful we got Evelyn, Daisy, Nina and Carrie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10o2e4b/carrie_soto_is_back/,2023-01-29 07:57:25,24,43,books
36uv7a,I read my first Stephen King novel - Carrie.,"I finally got around to reading Carrie, finished it in a couple of hours. It was not spooky at all - just disturbing. And the ending left me disappointed - I was expecting redemption in a more obvious form.
How different are Stephen King's other books from Carrie? I'm thinking in particular of the Dark Tower series - I found it highly recommended here but I don't know if I'll enjoy it.

zi4yk7,Carrie Soto review,"I'm seeing a lot of negative or underwhelmed reviews of Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed it. I would agree that it is not as good as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but while always enjoyable, none of TJR other books are as good as Evelyn Hugo. I would agree that in spite of some clever writing there are parts the plot which lag. 

But I really enjoyed reading the character study of an unashamedly ambitious and driven woman. A spiky, aggressive and emotionally underdeveloped woman. We see the price she is made pay for her 'unfeminine' attitude. She is a very unusual character to see portrayed sympathetically. 

I kept thinking about how toxic the Tennis Press has been over the years. To Martina Navratilova because she wasn't as pretty as Steffie Graff and I imagine because they knew she was gay, Martina Hengis for grunting, Venus and Serena for every little bloody thing, just plain bullying Naomi Osaka off the tour because she didn't want to do press. 

Yes Carrie Soto can be unlikable as anything. But she is still a great character.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zi4yk7/carrie_soto_review/,2022-12-10 22:00:55,12,63,books
v560l3,Carrie: Stephen King's first novel.,"Stephen Kings first novel , 1974's ""Carrie"", was among the several books I've read during my highschool years. An icon of horror that was adapted into a film in 1976 and a story that I found most interesting.

The tragic and horrific story of the novel's titular main character Carrie White and the life she lived through is compelling; her abusive religious mother, the bullying she was subjected too and the psychic powers she had developed and the eventual and tragic end that would befall her.

The layout of it is pretty interesting as well. The book is also interspersed with what look articles and testimony about the coming and aftermath of the events that take place in the story. 

Asides from the 1976 adaptation there was also (strangely enough) two musical adaptations, one in 1988 and another from 2012. And there was also a 1999 sequel film, a 2002 tv film adaptation and also th 2013 remake. But I believe many King fans would prefer the 1976 film and the original novel any day of the week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v560l3/carrie_stephen_kings_first_novel/,2022-06-05 04:43:49,8,29,books
n156hn,Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser (possible spoilers),"I apologize if this book has been discussed before, but I did a quick search and did not find any in depth discussions regarding the book.  For those that haven't read the book, I have marked spoiler in case any spoilers come up in the discussion, but as far as the first post, I'll try to avoid spoilers and just open it up for discussion.  

I just finished reading the book and it was a great read, especially the latter part of the book was hard to put down.  Although some of the themes are more adult/mature, I am surprised that the book isn't mentioned more in schools.  I really enjoyed the in depth descriptions of the characters' thoughts/feelings/motivations/longing.  It was also fascinating to read about Chicago and New York from a different era since I have lived in both cities.

tx3oro,Theodore Dreiser‚Äôs Sister Carrie from 1958 Moscow,"So I have been reading Sister Carrie recently. I am reading in Hungarian. The book was translated  and published by Foreign Languages Publishing Home in Moscow, 1958.
And I have found a bit interesting sentence in the book (40 page). 

I write it for the person who know nothing about the book: The main character (Carrie) went from Columbia City to Chicago to look for a job‚Ä¶ And she got a job in a shoe making company. At first he thought it will be fun and the factory will be clean etc. But it was dirty, the chair was uncomfortable etc. And then the ‚Äúwriter‚Äù wrote these:

‚ÄúUnder better conditions this kind of work would not have been so strenuous, but the new socialism, which provides pleasant working conditions for workers, has not reached the big industrial companies yet.‚Äù  
(I wanted to take a picture but the group not allows post with photos)

After I read this sentence I dropped my jaw, I was really angry and I laughed at the sam time. And this is just one example of the hundreds which were translated and published by the Soviet Union.

kqg3af,Could Stephen King debut with Carrie in 2021?,"*Carrie* is the fourth King book I read, and it's not my favorite from him but it was a really quick, perfectly disturbing read. Obviously it launched King's career, but I found myself wondering if a new male author could ever debut his writing with this story today. It seems rather pervy for an adult male author -- especially an unknown one -- to open with a detailed scene about a teenage girl's mensuration. It's pretty tame compared to many of King's later works but I found myself wondering if it'd go over well today, or if any respectable publisher would even take it up. Does anyone else have any feelings on *Carrie* and how it might be responded to were it written now?

Edit: To be clear I'm not condemning King, I liked the book and its content. I just personally found it shocking that a male author could make his debut writing about periods and launch a successful career out of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kqg3af/could_stephen_king_debut_with_carrie_in_2021/,2021-01-04 19:40:18,14,10,books

In 2018 my post-apocalyptic murder mystery BANNERLESS won the Philip K. Dick Award for best novel.

This month I released THE GHOSTS OF SHERWOOD, a novella about the children of Robin Hood and Lady Marian. The sequel, THE HEIRS OF LOCKSLEY, will be out in August.

Here's a video of me reading from THE GHOSTS OF SHERWOOD: https://youtu.be/LVZSWw_rIkU

I have a note on my bulletin board: if I ever think about going back to school, start a book club instead.

An Air Force brat, I grew up all over the country but put down roots in Colorado. I knit, ride horses, birdwatch, scuba dive, travel, and generally collect more hobbies than I have time for. So far, my yarn and cross-stitch supplies have outlasted the pandemic stay-at-home orders. . .

3sfrcu,Shower Thought: What Makes *Carrie* Frightening,"Hi everyone! Lurked in r/Books for awhile, but something I thought of while in the shower compelled me to post. *Carrie* is one of my favorite Stephen King books (and possibly one of my favorites, period). I watched the 1976 version of the movie, and while there were jump scares and dumb moments like Carrie's hand popping out of the ground where the house used to be, I didn't think that it was ""scary,"" per se.

Unlike the movie, I found that the book was frightening to a fault. Why? Because Carrie's experiences and reactions and feelings could have been **real**. I realized in the shower that anyone in real life could have unleashed such wrath against classmates who were bullies, or a school that dismissed her, or even an abusive mother whose views of her child were corrupted by her Christian beliefs. The telekinesis blew the whole thing out of proportion, but it's the intent, the malice, the undying desire to destroy everyone and everything in one's path that makes this book truly scary.

I recommend the audiobook version as it is narrated by Carrie herself, and her daughter, Billie Lourd. She is an amazing author! I never knew how witty and well-spoken she was. 

The book itself is semi-autobiographical, in that it deals with her life, but mostly from 1976 onward, though it touches upon earlier moments.

I have learned things of Star Wars that I never knew before. I won't put them down here, as I don't want to spoil a great book's hidden treasures for you all.

4dym57,"Just finished reading ""Carrie"", my first Stephen King novel. I have some questions... (Spoiler Alert)","I found this novel to be incredibly moving; simply heart breaking from beginning to end. There are two parts in particular that I would like some clarification on: 1) After Sue finds Carrie laying in The Cavalier parking lot, they have a conversation. Was this conversation held telepathically? And if it was does that mean Sue Snell is also a TK? 2) Who is Amelia Jenks in relation to Carrie?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4dym57/just_finished_reading_carrie_my_first_stephen/,2016-04-08 21:53:12,3,17,books

5o21r7,Having a hard time reading The Princess Diarist by Carrie Fisher. What do you do when a book makes you really emotional?,"I picked up The Princes Diarist a few days after Carrie Fisher passed away. As someone who battles mental health issues and likes Star Wars I figured I would love it. 

And I do. It's an amazing read so far. However I'm having a tough time with it. I love it so much, love her writing style, that I keep getting emotionally overwhelmed that she's gone. I'm a 20 year old guy so naturally Princess Leia was a favorite of mine, and this books just makes me sad, like a best friend I never knew I had is now gone. 

Anyone ever deal with anything like this? How do you get through it or maybe it's just the experience I have to have. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5o21r7/having_a_hard_time_reading_the_princess_diarist/,2017-01-15 04:33:17,6,5,books
