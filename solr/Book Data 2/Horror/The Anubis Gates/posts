abwnlc,What's the strangest book you've ever read?,"For me, it has to be *In Watermelon Sugar* by Richard Brautigan. It was utterly bizarre and yet wonderfully colourful and vivid. It's been more than a year since I read it, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.

*As I Lay Dying* by Faulkner is also a contender, as is *The Anubis Gates* by Tim Powers. The former is full of strange little ramblings and insights and has very little in the way of a plot. The latter took me completely by surprise and wasn't at all what I expected when I started reading it.

Please include the reason(s) for your choices! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/abwnlc/whats_the_strangest_book_youve_ever_read/,2019-01-02 19:24:21,123,50,books
3pa4yt,Recommended Author if the Day: Tim Powers,"I did a recommended author of the day for a couple weeks but let it drop because interest seemed to be mild at best. But I have since seen some people say that want more of that here. So I decided to at least continue until I've crossed off my initial list.

Today: Tim Powers. This author is a little hard to categorize--my favorite kind.  Most of his more recent stuffs involves historical figures caught up in some kind of supernatural or mythic goings-on.

Examples are Kim Philby in Declare, Einstein in Three Days to Never, Christina and Gabriel Rossetti in Hide Me Among the Graves, and Thomas Edison in Expiration Date.

Expiration Date is actually the middle book of trilogy that starts with Last Call and Ends with Earthquake Weather.  Last Calls which involves gambling, poker and The Fisher King is one of my favorite books by Powers. I was less enthusiastic about the two others.

In his earlier work, I love both The Anubis Gates and The Drawing of the Dark--revived Vikings running amok, what's not to like. I am not even going to try to describe the Anubis Gates--you have to check it out for yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3pa4yt/recommended_author_if_the_day_tim_powers/,2015-10-18 22:36:32,9,30,books
