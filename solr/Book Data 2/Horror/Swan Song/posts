x93co5,Some Love for “Swan Song” by Robert Mccammon,"Non-Spoilers for those Semi Curious

I wanted to make a post here about Swan Song. I’m sad that I’ve finally finished the book after a couple of weeks. I took my time as I loved the journey with Josh, Swan, Sister and so many other characters we come to journey with. A lot of people seem to have a great distaste for it; mainly if they are hardcore Stephan King fans. Will even go as far as to call Mccammon a watered down Stephen King. 

I couldn’t disagree more. It was apparent to me that Mccammon put his heart into Swan Song. In it is skillful writing and care for his characters. The world is disastrous but through his characters you find hope and still even plenty of dread there being any worth in the end. 

I say try it. Even if you don’t particularly like it. It is very memorable and a amazing read.


NOW FOR SPOILERS



There were so many things I loved about the book. Let’s see. The characters to start. I see so many mad about how the characters are an obvious good or bad, but I disagree. I mean these are ordinary people. You have a homeless woman who had lost her daughter by drunk driving. You had a wrestler who wasn’t in his children’s life because of a divorce. A young girl with a mother who wasn’t at all perfect but found joy in her own life with plants. 

The settings and scenes were amazing. The scenes with the president at the beginning of the book were descriptive and haunting. As it should’ve been to get across the gravity of such a decision that would change the world. 

So many more scenes. The grocery stores. Sister going through the Manhattan tunnel. Protect the child. Swan offering the Apple. Brother Tim saying God taught him AOK.

Like I said the characters is what gripped me the most for some reason. They ranged in different ages and circumstances. Some plain evil, ordinary and just completely pure. I usually don’t love the goody goodies, but swan captured me somehow. After the seven year time skip, and the revelation of her job’s mask. I actually teared up when she ran for carriage in tears cause a woman screamed in terror at her appearance. 

The ending took me a while to get passed. Between Sisters goodbye and josh parting from swan it was lot for me to get through lol. Yet somehow, Mccammon still finds a way to give you a sense of dread with, mellburry bush playing in the wind as Josh travels back to Mary’s rest. To me that was brilliant. 

I read a article that Mccammon thought many times of writing a sequel, but decided to leave it the past. He mentioned how the Stephan king comparisons had discouraged him and even made stop writing for a while. 

As much as I’d love a sequel and another adventure with Josh and Swan again or any other character he’d make in this setting. I believe the ending is just as good. 

I wanted to have some kind of positive post for this on Reddit especially. Nothing against those who don’t like this book or compare it to the stand. I just wanted something out there that showed they loved it to bits.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x93co5/some_love_for_swan_song_by_robert_mccammon/,2022-09-08 15:25:34,206,771,books
t1mfah,"In light of recent events, I started reading Robert McCammon's post apocalyptic epic, 'Swan Song'.","Not going too much into spoiler territory, I'll just say it is about the aftermath of a nuclear war between, well, you can guess which two countries. I'm about halfway through and find myself really gripped by the story. I don't often read dystopian type novels, I have, however, read 'The Road' and really enjoyed it.  

'Swan Song is often compared to 'The Stand' by Stephen King, which I haven't read yet. I think that'll be up next.

16xdv5c,"Why do I rarely find anyone who has read Robert McCammon? Mine, Wolf's Hour, Swan Song, Boy's Life, Gone South, and so on--the quality of his work seem to me as though he would be a much more widely read author.","I was having coffee with friends today and the topic of books came up.  Someone asked the group to toss out their top recommendation. 

I said ""Swan Song"", and for the first time, literally ever, someone else jumped in with ""Absolutely; I describe it as the less-hacky and more focused cousin of The Stand."" 

Disclaimer: I am only relaying the conversation. I did not call Stephen King a hack writer. There has been enough bloodshed.

Anyway, once everyone put away their pitchforks (satisfied they had well and truly corrected such literary blasphemy), he and I both sort of marveled that we ran into someone else who had read Swan Song. We both agreed it was baffling that we'd never happened across anyone else who knew who Robert McCammon was, much less read anything he'd written.

While I don't hold all of Robert McCammon's books with the same appreciation as I do Swan Song, he strikes me as undeniably gifted and well beyond the average novelist. Probably like a lot of you, I have always devoured multiple novels per month. In my experience, *most* novels are forgettably fine reads, and that's perfectly OK. McCammon, though, really stands out for me. I just sort of mentally lump him up there with Crichton, L'Amour, King, and Douglas Adams as ""Even if you aren't into the genre, you'll likely find something to enjoy"" sorts of authors.

Thinking about it, I only stumbled across McCammon by chance in a discount bin over a decade ago, and it feels . . . I don't know . . . incorrect(?) that it would have been so easy for me to never have known he wrote anything at all.  I know he stopped writing for a while, but that doesn't help me understand why (in my experiences) neither he, nor his prior existing works, are very well known.

So is it just an odd coincidence that I happened to avoid anyone who has read his books for nearly my entire life, or is there some actual reason that he doesn't seem to have enjoyed the same level of popularity and recognition as authors such as King?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16xdv5c/why_do_i_rarely_find_anyone_who_has_read_robert/,2023-10-01 21:43:24,129,140,books
p2sn74,Robert McCammon's Swan Song is One of the Best I have Ever Read.,"During the quarantine of 2020, I did not read a single book. Or one that I can remember.

This, of course, was bad. Spending all of your time on social media, especially a website like Twitter, will erode your mental health like spending your free time in a radioactive crater. Eventually, you will get cancer. And die.

Thankfully, though a variety of factors, I kicked my addiction to social media, and left Twitter for good.

One of those factors was Swan Song.

Now, I am a gamer. I play a wide selection of video games, and my favorite video game series is Fallout. You could tell that if you went on my profile, and I could go on a rant about how deep Fallout New Vegas is, the excellent world-building of Fallout 1, and how Fallout 2 has literal hundreds of cultural references to other media. Fallout has made a big part of my identity and shaped who I am.

But, all the entries Fallout does get boring after you play it for the thousandth time, so I wanted to read something. Something post-apocalyptic like my beloved series, but also thoughtful, not having just mindless action but not so philosophically it makes your brain cramp out.

Swan Song was this.

Firstly, I must thank Swan Song for just making me read again. It brushed away a lot of the cobwebs in my mind caused by not reading for an entire year (I am still mad I was a dumbass and sent my year on Twitter instead of reading and running and playing Fallout).

The extremely bare bones of bare bones plot summary is that the world got nuked and you follow three plotines of survivors, Joshua and Swan, Sister and Paul Thorson, and Colonel Macklin and Roland Croninger. Throughout the book, they all come together and eventually meet each other in the end, to a final confrontation. It's amazing to think about what the characters went through to get to where they are in the end and how they changed. 

I believe the main strength of Swan Song was not its plot, but simply how it is written.

There is just something that makes you read it, eager to know more. Even though it is 919 pages (in my paperback version), I barely got tired of it. The only times I got frustrated was when I thought it didn't spend enough time on the Colonel Macklin/Roland Croninger storyline and too much on Swan/Joshua and Sister/Thorson.

Not only that, I just realized as I writing this on many plot lines and characters there are. The thing is, the way McCammon writes is that I remember distinctly which characters are who and their personality. They are unique. I never groaned when a new character entered the picture. I was excited.

Even the minor characters spice up the story. In one scene, the main antagonist of the book, the Man with the Scarlet Eye, convinces a woman to kill herself for fun after she finds him doing things with his anatomy humans cannot do.

Little snippets of data about how other groups of humans and communities are doing feel so realistic. You seen how people and communities are reacting to the nuclear holocaust, so hearing about how people are suffering don't feel like they were added in and actually exist.

Lastly, one of the most emphasized parts of the book is on the characters humanity. They can get injured, disfigured, even killed. They aren't immortal. They feel human emotions like sadness, grief, jealousy, zealotry, ruthless, but there are moments were they hope, laugh, love, and persevere against the onslaught of this new world.

One of the morals of the book is that people are people, with flaws and all.

You see the faces of evil, quite literally in some parts with the Man in the Scarlet Eye, yet there are people like Swan who still hope for the best of people, and try hard to bring them together, to cooperate and not steal, to love and to not hate, and to replace suspicion with friendship and camaraderie.

Once upon a time, humanity had a love affair with fire...

His descriptive writing is unlike anything else I’ve read, he makes you fall in love with characters, and he leaves you living in his world.

The book was originally recommended to me here on Reddit. I didn't quite realize what I was getting into when I bought it on Kindle but man, this is a massive book! Took me almost two months to fully get through it.

McCammon's a really strong writer. He captured the absolute horror and desparation of a post-apocalyptic world. The imagery is brutal, harsh, and unforgiving. But it definitely works.

I found myself connecting with a lot of the characters for different reasons. They each have their own motivations that you understand completely. Each character's arc could've been their own book, and it all came together in a fantastic last quarter of the book.

I kind of wish I would've went physical on this one just so I could display this mammoth of a book on my shelf and say I conquered it. Overall, it'a a truly fantastic read for any fan of post-apocalyptic fiction.

hfdezw,Swan Song > The Stand,"Discuss.

Swan Song is darker and bleaker, but the story imo is much more compelling. There's a greater sense of dread and danger all throughout the book. The characters are better developed, and the villains are arguably more interesting. The Stand also kind of falls apart in its second half and the ending is *terrible*. SS otoh keeps its momentum all throughout and ends on a much stronger note.

Robert McCammon is also a considerably better writer than King, on a technical level.

Firstly, the ring being a crown seemed like a major red herring. The ladies tested it in the trailer and it formed a shield of light around Swan, then the crown was never used again. I was hoping to see her use it against Friend and the Army of Excellence.

Secondly, I really really really wanted to see Josh hulk out just once. We spend the whole book hearing about how huge he is and about his wrestling career, but he never just goes to town on anyone.

otdnk6,Swan Song by Robert McCammon: Thoughts after finishing (and a question)...,"First of all, let me say that I LOVED this book (even more than The Stand, which was previously my favorite post-apocalyptic book) but there was one thing that bothered me: The crown.

There is so much build up to Swan wearing the crown:

- Sister sees it in a vision through the power of the glass ring itself

- Leona reveals The Empress tarot card (depicting a beautiful, powerful woman wearing a crown) in a psychic reading with Swan

- The Man with the Scarlet Eye calls it a crown, fears it, and tries to find/destroy it

- Josh looks at The Empress tarot card and realizes (in what is written as a shocking epiphany) that it's not just a ring but a crown

All this and Swan only wears the crown once... in a throw-away scene where she's locked up with Sister and Sheila (and it is described as emitting a glorious light that forms armor all over her body). Everything in the story seems to be building up to Swan finally donning the crown in a final, climactic battle with The Man with the Scarlet Eye, but it never happens...

My question is: Why? Why did McCammon choose to sidestep this conclusion? Was he setting up a sequel? Did he want to avoid using a MacGuffin to solve the final problem? Is it a thematic comment on Swan's aversion to exercising power over others?

I should add: I do like the way The Man with the Scarlet Eye ends up being destroyed by the same evil he promoted/empowered. It makes him seem totally weak and ineffectual in the face of true righteousness (which is par for the course in terms of his face-to-face encounters with Swan), but it still feels anticlimactic that Swan never put on the crown and used its powers to truly become The Empress.

I love post apocalyptic stories and have been reading only those for some time now so I’m not used to feeling this much euphoria after finishing one. 

One thing I’m still curious about; what power would swan gain from wearing the glass ring as a crown for long enough? Is it just a shield that protects her?

9k372c,Discussion about Swan Song by Robert McCammon.,"I just finished it today and while I loved the first half of the book something about the ending just felt so off. They built up this crown having powers for swan and then just dropped it at the end. I was really expecting it to have a final showdown that incorporated it but nope, it’s just a crown that makes you glow. The cheesy ending with sunlight. I can’t put the exact moment it started getting worse but I think Roland becoming his own king to just becoming a pawn again to the devil was when it started to go downhill. He becomes his own man and just regresses like ten minutes later. Then the devil just shows up and takes over the largest army? That’s not really doing it by mans hand if you just become the new general of an army.

a6299f,"If you love Stephen King's The Stand, you need to read Robert R. McCammon's Swan Song.","Both have similar themes (the apocalypse, good vs evil), but Swan Song is so much more than that. Robert R. McCammon has a way of writing that, when you're finished with his novels, you feel as though you've actually seen the adaptations of them. His writing is incredibly visual. 

Years ago, someone saw me reading a Stephen King novel and asked me if I had read The Stand. I told them yes, several times, in fact. They then asked if I had read Swan Song by McCammon. I told them I'd never even heard of the author. Long story short, I read Swan Song, and I've read nearly every novel Robert R. McCammon has written since then. It turned me into an immediate fan.

However, she doesn't put the crown on again after that scene, and it's hardly even mentioned anymore until the very end, and then only in passing.

2b58wq,About Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon,"First of all I'd like to point out that despite what you may have heard, read, or even believed, after reading the description on the back, Swan Song is not a knock off of the Stand by Stephen King.    I have read both and enjoyed each for their own merit.  The Stand is a popular book around here, well known and well loved.   I hear little of this affection for Swan Song.    It is a beautifully written experience with it's own nuances, themes and distinct characters.  If the Stand plays out like real life then Swan Song is more akin to an opera.   The evil characters are darker, the good characters, more innocent.   You fall for each character as you are supposed to, with empathy, sympathy, pity, and, at least in my case, something like genuine care.   These characters are thrust into action that feeds your primal emotions like a well tuned overture.   It just satisfies.

tl;dr: Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon =/= the Stand by Stephen King, both are well worth it.   If you loved the Stand give Swan Song a similar chance.

aujxs0,When narrator of an audio book makes your brain feel inadequate - Swan Song narrated by Tom Stechschulte,"I am very much into post-apocalyptic novels and Swan Song by Robert McCammon has been on my to-read list for quite a while. I usually do my reading via Kindle, but from time to time I listen to an audiobook, if there's some long driving to be done, or if I am struggling to read a book and need a bit of a push, listening to an audiobook seems to help with that. 

This was not the case with Swan Song, as it was a great read from the get go and I just wanted to do some additional ""reading"" on my daily drive to work, as I was very curious about what happens next. I was about 30% at that point of a 956 page book. 

I picked up the audio book narrated by Tom Stechschulte, and boy oh boy is he good. The book has quite a few characters and each has a it's own distinct voice. It feels like each sentence has been thought out - the voice flows like a river, it has short pauses at appropriates times, not sure if there's a technical term for it, English is not my first language. It felt like I was listening to a radio drama.

I could not pick up the kindle again - I could not miss the narration for one minute, as my own imagination felt inadequate to continue reading and creating the world after hearing Tom Stechschulte.
