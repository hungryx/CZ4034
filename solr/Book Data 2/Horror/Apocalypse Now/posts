178w0rq,What are the less obvious character parallels between Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now?,"I am currently reading *Heart of Darkness* and having a hard time getting it as I read (the more I remember who the characters are, the more I start to get the novella). I watched the 1993 television film adaptation of the novella twice so I already know what happens generally, and I have watched *Apocalypse Now* a few times so I am getting a lot of its overall themes. My question is, what are the less obvious character parallels between Joseph Conrad's novella and Francis Ford Coppola's motion picture adaptation? Coppola took a lot of influence from the novel, more so than the screenwriter John Milius, so I feel like if I can understand which *Apocalypse Now* characters exist originally in *Heart of Darkness*, I might have a better time reading, and by extension a better time understanding the picture.

The obvious parallels are Charles Marlow/Captain Willard, Mr. Kurtz/Colonel Kurtz, and the Russian Trader/American Photojournalist. The others that are less obvious but seem to make sense to me based on my own observations are the following:

* The Helmsman/Chief Phillips.
* The General Manager/Colonel Kilgore.
* Fresleven/Captain Colby.
* Congolese Natives/Vietcong.
* Secretary/Colonel Lucas.
* Head of the Company/General Corman.
* Mr. Kurtz's African Mistress/Colonel Kurtz's Montagnard wife (whose scenes were largely cut out).
* Mr. Kurtz's Intended/Colonel Kurtz's wife.
* Swede/the ""regular Army"" soldier that the Chief refers to.

What is lost on me is the lack of a real and direct connection between a character in *Apocalypse Now* with the Brickmaker, the Chief Accountant, or the Doctor in *Heart of Darkness*. I read some of the original 1969 John Milius screenplay of *Apocalypse Now* and the civilian character (who exists in the picture as the ""terminate with extreme prejudice"" intelligence officer) is described as wearing a white tropical suit, which describes the Chief Accountant more than any other character in *Apocalypse Now*.

Also, the Pilgrims are lost on me. Are they better represented by Kilgore's Air Cavalry soldiers (if the General Manager and Kilgore comparison makes sense) or by the French Colonialists at the plantation in the picture, or both?

Any insight would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/178w0rq/what_are_the_less_obvious_character_parallels/,2023-10-16 02:47:53,3,0,books
qcv9et,Anybody who is excited for sometime of apocalypse or major world ending event. Needs to read The Road,"I just finished listening to The Road and damn I have not had a book consume me like that in a long time! I literally started it during my morning workout, listened to it on my commute to work, and listened to it while at work, and finished it when I got home. I literally sat in silence for 30 minutes after. It is an amazing and depressing book about Hope.

Anyways back to my original post I live on a pretty conservative/rural area and I know a lot of preppers for the most part they are cool and genuine in their want to survive if society collapsed, but there are a few i talk to that I am like “damn bro you are messed up.” They literally say things about how they want the world to end so they can go back to their ancestral ways, they also say stuff about how it would be way more exciting then what they are doing now, and how their masculinity has been stifled and they need something to happen so they can bring that masculinity out. It is very strange (and the memes they share on Facebook wild stuff)

If you are one of those people please read The Road, nothing has made me more scared for the end of civil society than that. 

Great book, feel free to have a discussion about it below. Definitely an S tier book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qcv9et/anybody_who_is_excited_for_sometime_of_apocalypse/,2021-10-21 16:11:03,380,1352,books
hrp4tz,I'm Kimi Eisele. I wrote a novel about the apocalypse and now we're kinda living it. AMA,"My novel, THE LIGHTEST OBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE, is set after the US electrical grid goes down, which follows a number of other catastrophes (trade imbalances, school loan defaults, natural disasters, and also a flu). But it's a hopeful story about love and community and how our best traits might emerge, even when everything feels impossible. At heart, it's a love story and there are bicycle brigades, backyard chickens, low-power radio, and homemade jam. It took me a long time to write and it felt like we faced the apocalypse many times along the way. All to say, are you ready? What do you need to be ready? 

The paperback came out last week (!), so it's probably at your local bookstore or library, or you can order it here: https://bookshop.org/books/the-lightest-object-in-the-universe-9781643750484/9781643750484

5c837l,"I’m Dominic Selwood, historian and crypto-thriller author. I write fiction and non-fiction. My latest thriller, The Apocalypse Fire, is out now, AMA!","I’m the author of the Ava Curzon trilogy. She’s a former MI6 officer, now an archaeologist specializing in the Middle East. Her first adventure, The Sword of Moses, threw her into a struggle with neo-Nazis, Knights Templar, British and Israeli intelligence, and some unpleasant black magic. The prize was … well, better if I don’t say.  Her second adventure, The Apocalypse Fire, sees her pitted against the leader of an ancient Russian cult who have some pretty … unusual … rituals.  This time the goal is to prevent conflict in the Middle East, and there is a race to unravel ancient clues related to the Turin Shroud, Rasputin, and a lot of other mysterious stuff.  As always, the adventure is tightly bound into some of the weirder things from history.  

When I am not writing Ava, I write about historical anniversaries and events for the Daily Telegraph and some other papers and magazines, and I do some TV work explaining history. 

And for the rest of the time, I’m always happy if someone gives me a guitar, bass, or drums, a loud sound system in a pub somewhere, and the chance to bang out some loud 1970s and 1980s heavy metal :)

3fs0d5,Thoughts on Heart of Darkness (and Apocalypse Now),"Recently read Heart of Darkness. 

I enjoyed it. But was surprised by how little impact I felt in the moment of Kurtz dieing. Having already seen the movie I was expecting more build up to the moment of the 'the horror' line being uttered. Rather anticlimactic to be honest, and in that moment I felt disappointed.

I think the main reason for feeling this is how well it's done in the movie. There, it's a gradual descent into chaos. Heart of Darkness felt like more like 'blacks have it shitty, most of the whites are morons' over and over, there was no descent.

After thinking about it, I find the reason for this difference between the two is that, the 'the horror' line is actually referring to two different things in the movie and in the book.

In the movie, the scenes beforehand graphically display the horror Kurtz is talking about, we are restricting ourselves to the war in Vietnam and circumstances that arise from it (Kurtz and his natives).  
In the book, 'the horror' is actually about life [in general]. The Congo is merely a backdrop. Which actually makes sense considering how what was happening there was not something unusual; it was happening everywhere in the world. Vietnam on the other hand, an argument could be made that the specific combination of powers at play was unique (I can only think of Soviets in Afgh as a suitable comparison, maybe?). 

I may have been disappointed in the moment of Kurtz dieing, but the next two pages made up for it. Here's an excerpt:

> Droll thing life is - that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself - that comes too late - a crop of unextinguishable [sic] regrets. I have wrestled with death. [...] I was within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. [...] He had summed up - he had judged.

Reading some of the comments from old threads that I looked up on Heart of Darkness, there does not seem to be a consensus on what 'the horror' is referring to. One person wrote he thought it was Kurtz imagining nobody learning of his achievements...
I think the quoted paragraph - among other things - shows that Kurtz is talking about life. Of course, it's Marlowe saying these things, but considering both characters are written by the same person (aka the author) I think it's safe to transfer the intention over.

Anyways, I may be talking total nonsense, was wondering what others are thinking.

tl;dr what are the differences between the book and the movie in what they're referring to with 'the horror

4d1rzt,[SPOILER] Apocalypse Now and Heart Of Darkness,"Apocalypse Now has always been one of my favorite movies, and I've seen it prbably more than 20 times. I just finished Heart Of Darkness and I was hoping to get a clearer understanding of the meaning of both the book and the film when I was done. I get that they're both trying to show how bad colonialism/foreign intervention is, but surely there must be more. Are they about how civilized society has suppressed mans inherent ""savagery""? Are they about the duality of man? About good and evil?

AMA!","Hi! I'm Max Brallier and I write stuff for kids and adults (but mostly kids).
 
My series The Last Kids on Earth is now an animated series on Netflix – which I'm lucky enough to get to produce and do some writing on.
 
I've written something like 30 books, including: [the Mister Shivers series](https://shop.scholastic.com/parent-ecommerce/books/mister-shivers-beneath-the-bed-and-other-scary-stories-an-acorn-book-9781338318531.html), the [Galactic Hot Dogs](https://www.simonandschuster.com/series/Galactic-Hot-Dogs) series, the [Eerie Elementary](https://www.scholastic.com/branches/eerie.htm) series, and [Can YOU Survive the Zombie Apocalypse?](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8864550-can-you-survive-the-zombie-apocalypse). I used to write lots of activity/journal books for Cartoon Network shows.  
 
I co-wrote an R-rated action-horror movie for [Fangoria called VFW](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vfw) which premiered at Beyond Fest last month.
 
I do a lot of school visits. I do a lot of book touring. 
 
I have some ADD which makes writing **HARD** and I've got a bunch of tricks and stuff to make it easier. Also: anxiety and depression, to round things out -- which I only mention 'cause it effects writing life, for sure.

I used to work in marketing for the publisher St. Martin's Press and my wife was a non-fiction editor, so I know a decent amount about that side of the business (y'know, if you're into that sort of thing). 

I live in New York City. I just bought an e-scooter and I'm hoping it doesn't kill me. My favorite food is milkshakes.

I'm on social media 'cause I'm addicted even though I hate it. Here I am: Twitter: @maxbrallier Instagram: max_loves_pants
