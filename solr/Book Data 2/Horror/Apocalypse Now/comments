4ps7kp,"Dispatches is amazing. I love Apocalypse Now, and this book gives you the same feeling as the movie. 

Years ago I did extra work for some crappy Cinemax adult show, and it took place in a strip bar. So there I was, reading a book about Vietnam with naked girls dancing for a camera. Very very surreal. ",Cloudy_mood,2016-06-25 14:52:14
4ps7kp,Hope I won't get any hate for this... Apocalypse Now is my favorite movie of all times with Full Metal Jacket being up there pretty high aswell. Sad day.,generalgranko,2016-06-26 01:05:06
4ps7kp,"Wow, I'll be the first to tell you that Apocalypse Now is a amazing movie. It is what a movie should be, action, immersion,  and what I consider a dark movie. It's perfect for people who can really get into it. 

It'll leave you feeling confused at the end, with food for thought and a weird sense of what the hell did I just watch. ",SERTNETDAT,2016-06-26 02:15:29
4ps7kp,"Dispatches was just incredible. It was also amazing to see snippets of both Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket come to life - it really brings home how crazy war is when you see something in a film and years later see the same scene in a non-fiction work. 

This book is, for me anyway, writing at its very highest form.

RIP, and thank you for documenting so brilliantly.",,2016-06-25 13:36:27
4ps7kp,He's credited with writing the narration for Apocalypse Now. The title should have been more specific.,magelanz,2016-06-26 00:40:18
4ps7kp,"So glad to see someone mention Tobias Wolff's *In Pharaoh's Army*. One of the great books by one of my favorite authors, and very different in feeling, having been written by a guy in the service at the time.

I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Michael Herr today. I read *Dispatches* years ago, but I really fell in love with him (well, post-learning he'd written the voiceover for ""Apocalypse Now"") when I read his short memoir *Kubrick*.

In case anyone is interested, he appeared to have been sort of STUNG into writing it because, almost instantaneously after the death of Stanley Kubrick, the British screenwriter Frederic Raphael (who had collaborated on ""Eyes Wide Shut"") had written a sort of nose-pinched, vaguely insulting (vaguely self-praising) memoir about the great director. Herr, who had known Kubrick for many decades, was I think it's fair to say very upset, even for a Buddhist.

It's a wonderful book, especially given his ear for capturing talk and small nuances of character. And what a character to write about! It was not at all unusual, for instance, for Kubrick and Herr to have ""strenuous intercourse"" -- i.e., 5 to 6 hour trans-Atlantic phone conversations. I highly recommend it. It's a shame there weren't more books, but we were fortunate to have him at all.",MakeItHilts,2016-06-25 23:22:22
178w0rq,"Your list is pretty thorough.  Re: *Apocalypse Now* used *Heart of Darkness* as a loose general guide, in the late 1960s but it was merged with separate Vietnam War stories also compiled by Milius, the first writer.  Plus adapting some quotes from the Arab-Isreal Six-Day war and just plain thinking things up.  Also much came from newspaper clippings covering Vietnam War personalities and events which were aggregated. 

Then when Coppola bought the rights and rewrote it, as a **second writer** he added elements of Dante’s *Inferno* to go with the boat ride after the Air Cav assault.   Also Coppola brought in Micheal Herr, a longtime combat correspondent in the Vietnam War, as a **third writer**.  So there’s a lot of different threads that got weaved into the *Apocalypse Now* storyline than *Heart of Darkness*.",IronyElSupremo,2023-10-18 01:14:57
178w0rq,I have also seen that a few times and it is my favorite documentary. It even gets more intense at times than *Apocalypse Now* itself.,obscurespecter,2023-10-16 03:00:38
4d1rzt,"I recall reading Heart of Darkness some time after watching the movie, without knowing about the connection between the two. As I was reading the book I started thinking ""damn this is eerily similar to apocalypse now"". A wikipedia check later I was left feeling dumb and smarter at the same time.

I liked the subject of human degradation too, and that sort of loss of hope vibe. The ""the horror"" thing",madkeepz,2016-04-02 17:39:11
