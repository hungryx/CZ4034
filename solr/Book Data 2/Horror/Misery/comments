6isq9t,"Nice article. King really got it all. I believe some of his books will be redone as until 20xx. He just finds the feel of a time with a great, chilling story and studios can go from there. 
Though most King adaptions might have been dud, so many are really good or classics, looking at (I'm sure I'm forgetting some) shining, green mile, stand by me, apt pupil, Misery and #1 IMDb best movie Shawshank redemption.
A truely amazing achievement. He might become the most movie adapted writer ever (if he not already is).",Erich_LeRouge,2017-06-22 11:45:13
6isq9t,"Hollywood has ruined King's reputation in a lot of ways.  I'm a big Stephen King fan and so many times I've been made fun of by people who've never read one of his books and base their judgement of him based on the shitty adaptations of his books.  My husband was one of them.   I finally convinced him to read The Dark Tower series. He read it, finished the last book and immediately picked up The Gunslinger and read the whole series again.  It is hard for him to admit he was wrong but he did in this case.  He's gone on to read The Stand,  IT and 11/22/63. 

There have been some good adaptations like: Misery, The Green Mile, Shawshank, The Dead Zone, Carrie, The Shining (I know not everyone agrees on this one but I really love the movie.  I think Kubrick really captured the surreal, creepy descent into madness).

King just continues to impress me.  He's still putting out quality work this late in his career. I was blown away by 11/22/63. I thought it was one of the best books he's written.  Also really enjoyed the Mr. Mercedes trilogy.  He's a great writer.  He has me hooked within the first 2 pages.  Few writers are able to draw me in that quickly.

6isq9t,"Authors are rarely given permission to write the movie script based on their book.  It was William Goldman (author of The Princess Bride, and Butch Cassiday and the Sundance Kid) who adapted Misery into a screenplay.  When studios get a good author to adapt a Steven King novel, it becomes a good movie.  When studios try to chintz out and hire some hack to adapt a novel, it rarely becomes a good movie.

4ux4ed,"I'm 21 and have been making an effort to recapture the desire i had for reading when i was younger (Started as a pre-teen obsessed with Goosebumps, Harry Potter and Deltora Quest).
Misery was the FIRST book i started this process with about a year ago, and what a book it is. Annie Wilkes is absolutely despicable, and i think the strong emotional response that everyone feels towards her is because of the setting (or lack thereof) that the book traps you in.

You never really leave her house in the mountains, as a reader you are hopelessly trapped in Annie's isolated world of mental torture and anguish. It's perfect for her character and i totally agree with your perception of her as one of fiction's most terrifying villains.

I've now become a huge (albeit new) fan of Stephen King's works. I read ""Hearts In Atlantis"" twice on a trip through Europe and now i'm up to the third book in ""The Dark Tower"" series. 

I have a new all time favourite writer :)",,2016-07-28 13:43:26
4ux4ed,"Saw misery when I was 14. Can't watch anything with Kathy bates in it. 

Fun fact for those who don't know: Annie Wilkes is cocaine and Misery outlines Kings issues with addiction. Wilkes forces King to write another book much in the way a psychological/physiological addiction ""forces"" a user to consume more drugs. 
",MikeAlpha93,2016-07-28 04:02:29
4ux4ed,"I agree with most of this, but I wouldn't say she lives in a world where she's the only real thing. 

Yes, she is selfish and stubborn in the childish sense... But, her world is fantasy. Not of herself, but peopled by the pulp-fictional and melodramatic characters in her books (ostensibly her only form of entertainment or connection to the world). These are her friends and family. 

She has deep mental problems but she is also lonely, so she retreats further into an insular psychological place made up of her favorite novels and characters. This habit has over time become a delusion that compounds her instability, and might explain the complete lack of remorse she shows for her volatile and violent actions against Paul in the real world (since she is so disconnected from it).

For Annie Wilkes, it's not about abusing another human being; it's about channeling and rescuing her favorite fictional character. This is the only way she knows how to do that. 

There's also the implication that her actions are a mirroring of the melodrama of her books - outward blame and violence, love and sorrow. She wants to embrace misery (because she is depressed and doesn't know it) but lacks the basic empathy to access such an emotion. Both Misery and misery have forsaken her. She yearns for feeling, and the violence and manipulation is an expression of her frustration for the fact that she simply cannot feel in the same way Misery does.

Otherwise, yeah... she is a terrifying, fascinating, psychopathic creation.",,2016-07-28 10:57:25

Annie Wilkes is so realistic; I can absolutely believe that there are many people like her in the world and they just don't act on it because they'd get caught. Obsessive fans are a terrifying thing and King completely nailed it when he created Wilkes (or she created herself, who knows with King?) - I immediately thought of her when [some nutters tried to kidnap Joss Stone](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/03/joss-stone-would-be-killers-jumbled).

4ux4ed,"The book and the film adaptation are both classics. The changes made were totally the right decision because what works in a novel with internal dialogue and more time to develop characters doesn't necessarily suit the visceral, fast pace of film. The horror in the books works incredibly well but could be very campy if translated to film. In the book you get much more of a sense of the emotional and psychological toll that the experience has on Paul while the film gives two great actors the chance to really embody the characters and have some fun - same goes for The Shining. Love when a great book is adapted in a way that makes it a very different but equally brilliant experience. The climax of the Misery novel still gives me the heebie jeebies though.

One of his newer books I thoroughly enjoyed that doesn't fall into the typical ""monster"" genre is 11/22/63. Without spoiling anything, it's about someone that finds a way to step into the past and experiment with ways to change history.

py0ggr,"The Green Mile was first written and released in six 75 page (approximately) monthly instalments. As with any episode based piece, each instalment finished with a cliff hanger which is probably partly why it made such a good movie; it was already structured as a series of acts, like a play.

I always liked how Kings writing style and subject matter developed and overlapped through this period. In Misery (1987) Wilkes was tortured by the continuity trick that was played in the cinema serial and gave Sheldon a bollocking for using the same device in his ‘resurrection’ of Misery. 

Nine years later King tests himself by writing the Green Mile in instalments. The direction of each instalment was influenced by readers reactions to the previous instalment, but he knew he must avoid the dirty birdy plot device despised by Wilkes. 

Similarly, King wrote the Dark Half after his stint writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. This is among his best IMO.

1ke02m,"This has always been my problem with King. I find his stories that use the supernatural use it like a crutch, and the real world counterparts of his stories are a lot more frightening to me.

For example:

IT  - could easily be a story about kids / grownup kids facing down a serial rapist.

Christine - how far obsession will drive some people.

Carrie - how far bullying will drive some people.

The shining - how far loneliness will drive some people (coupled with a preexisting condition)

The Stand - could have been a standard after the end story, albeit one that focuses a lot more on the politics of an after the end type society. All the religious stuff kind of ruined it for me. Instead you could actually call it an examination of how humans perceive normal events, and coincidences, as divine in origin when most of their standard societal systems are stripped away.

firestarter - the aftereffects of heinous experiments done by the CIA (eg the unabomber)

There are plenty of King works that don't lend themselves to this mental exercise, but the ones that rely minimally (or not at all) on the supernatural are the most horrifying to me - Misery.

g29nmb,"I read that book a couple of years ago. It was actually the 1st Stephen King book I read. I had a question about the book though. Does the Misery book that Annie makes him write have any significance to the story?

g29nmb,"No, not really. But I don't think *Misery* is remotely happy. Short of Annie coming out on top, it has about the same ending I'd imagined most writers would have settled on. It also has that same tone *Thinner* ends on, in that the reader can extrapolate their own darker ending from what King heavily implies. One of the reasons I think that *Cujo* (minus all the Castle Rock references) would have made an excellent Bachman book.",HugoNebula,2020-04-17 11:57:51

If you’re interested in picking up another King novel I’d recommend The Dark Tower. If you like the first one, there are another 6 to follow.

2mqflm,I love Stephen King and enjoyed Misery. There is a claustrophobic quality to the book. It is limited in it's settings and most of it takes place in the protagonists head and a small home. The atmosphere is close and uncomfortably cloistered.  King does an admirable job of creating a horrific tale out of the most ordinary of circumstances. One human against another.,Just1morefix,2014-11-19 03:22:11

9n6bkv,"King wrote a thriller with Misery. It’s not scary, it’s suspenseful though. It’s only suspenseful if you empathize with the characters, as with all thrillers. The villain is classically evil and wonderfully written. I guess she is scary in her own way. 

Now then, spookiness is not the same as scary. Getting spooked involves more than getting scared. You can get scared by a loud noise, but you can get spooked by an unexpected disembodied voice that you hear whispering over your shoulder, in the dark, when you think you are alone  but you know you are not, and that voice it telling you in a cold breath to come play. 

I don’t think Misery was a good choice to test how spooked you can get. Other people have some better literature for it. ",ArthurBea,2018-10-11 17:45:20

I thought they were all very good, though. I’m a big fan of King despite his quirks.

1331pwz,"Cormac McCarthy writes about the American experience. What you find depressing or overly burdened with misery is because that’s how he views what happened. Remember “Blood Meridian” is not a fable, it is based, more or less, on reality. 

Yes his books are violent, yes they are graphic and in some cases haunting but I can’t think of a writer who does it as well as him. Unceasing bleakness may be an attribute of his but it is utterly compelling. I finished “The Passenger” last week and I was so eager to read the follow up, “Stella Maris”,  that I read the book I chose as a break between the two in three days. Both books are, as you’d expect brilliant but bleak. 

Suttree is very good but different; it’s not anywhere near as violent as “Blood Meridian” and it’s not as epic as the Border Trilogy in terms of scope. It’s more of a personal, central character focused story. I’d recommend it but if you’re having problems with McCarthy’s bleakness, maybe read someone else in between.",,2023-04-29 19:31:47

From what I understood she wanted Misery to continue, but she might have wanted to read it forever, so I'm not sure she would have released him, maybe she wouldn't have killed him but she would have kept him alive for as long as she could.

6x4nn7,"I know this is common knowledge, but OP is new to King so I'm reposting the obvious so he can see the book in a more literary light.

Misery is one of King's deeper, more allegorical works. In the 80s, King suffered crippling drug addiction. In Misery, Annie is supposed to be his addiction personified, cocaine in particular. King had been wanting to get off drugs and try writing new styles, but felt the drugs were forcing him to keep doing more of the same ol' same. Paul's struggle alone in a creepy room fighting Annie is really a junkie's horrible attempts at getting clean. At the end of the book, the author has successfully changed his style, written a new hit book, and right when he thinks he has hit the happiness jackpot, he enters a room and hears Annie's voice. This doesn't mean a killer attacks him, but that his addiction can't be beat by something as simple as success, Annie will always be lurking in the back of his head no matter what he does.",doctor_wongburger,2017-08-31 10:07:20

3hseba,"Depends on the part.
The first draft, where [Minor Spoiler](#s ""Sheldon isn't really trying and adds Annie as a character"") is important because the details affect how Annie reacts during the pages that follow.

The second draft, where [Minor Spoiler](#s ""Sheldon has his characters pull Misery out of a bee sting-induced mistaken burial, and the stuff that follows with the bee-goddess"") also has some value, because the content of these scenes include objects that King uses as motifs as he goes along. If you're also the guy/gal who blanks out and skips over every time Annie says ""And now I must rinse"", then you're okay to skip. If you're looking to draw poetic art value, then read the manuscript sections for artistic context.

tl;dr--Unless you like reading for symbols and art value, you're okay to skip. ~~And if you're treating this like a James Patterson thriller novel, shame on you. /s~~",8andahalfby11,2015-08-21 03:21:49
