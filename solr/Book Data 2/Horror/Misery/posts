4ux4ed,I just read Stephen King's Misery and Annie Wilkes (the antagonist) is the most terrifying villain I've ever read,"King vividly portrays her with such clarity at how terrifying she is. Obviously bipolar (and not medicated) with wild mood swings, obsessive, anti-social, and sociopathic, even psychopathic. She lives in a world where she is the only real thing and no one else matters. She refuses to take responsibility for any wrong-doings, and what she has to accept she justifies in any way she can so she can to be the victim. She tortures and mutilates Paul and immediately blames him for making her do it. She kills people and blames him for making her as well. But what makes her the most terrifying is that there is nothing supernatural about her; people like her can and do actually exist in the real world.

xgn3b4,Currently reading Misery by Stephen King! Halfway in and I love it.,"I had never read this book before, and had actually never even read a Stephen King novel before. Even though I love the movies The Shining, IT, etc. So far I really love this story though and I know there‚Äôs a movie version so I want to watch it after I finish.

I usually have a hard time picturing things in books very vividly, but with King‚Äôs writing I feel just how eerie the cabin is, how creepy Annie Wilkes is, how disgusting it was to drink water from a cleaning bucket. 

I‚Äôm currently in the part where he is rewriting Misery‚Äôs ending for a second go-around because Annie hated his first version. (Don‚Äôt know how to hide text as a spoiler but I‚Äôll tag this with spoilers, sorry)

Was a little confused by the court references? I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôll make sense with time. Also the consistent mention of the ‚Äúbird from Africa‚Äù is still s bit unclear to me.

py0ggr,Misery by Stephen King,"I just finished reading Misery. This was the first time I read a horror book and the first book I ever read by Stephen King. And I absolutely loved it. It is so well-written and even through there are just two characters and the story takes place in one location, something interesting is always happening. There were so many moments when I was literally on the edge of my seat and scared out of my mind. Some of those were when Annie squeezes the life out of the rat, the hobbling scene of course and when she kills the cop. These just sent my heart racing. 

Annie Wilkes is horrific and the way her actions, manners and thoughts are described, the way she keeps getting worse and worse gradually, it's just brilliant. I thought that it was a really interesting choice to tell the readers the story of Annie's past through Paul reading her Memory Lane book. It added to the horror and tension of the book and made it impossible to stop reading without getting to know the extent of Annie's horrific past. 

It was so good. No book has made me feel how this one did and I am looking forward to reading more of Stephen King.

15dbr2x,"Stephen King's ""Misery"".","Stephen king's ""Misery"" is one of two books (the other being ""The Tommyknockers"") that was published in 1987. And this Saturday night I have finished it.

We follow Paul Sheldon who is an author of a famous series of historical romance novels wakes up one day in a weird place, that being a secluded farmhouse in Colorado in the middle of winter. And not only that he wakes up to immense pain that includes a dislocated pelvis, one crushed knee and two shattered legs. Plus the strange greeting he gets from the woman who had saved his life: ""I'm your number one fan!""

That number one fan is Annie Wilkes, a large former nurse who is adept with controlled substances and other forms of abuse, which include an ax and a blowtorch. She is also a dangerous psychotic with a bizarre sense of good and bad, fair and unfair.

And when she discovers that Paul has killed off her favorite character, Misery Chastain, in his latest novel and that he has written another novel that she considers nasty, which was also a novel that Paul wanted to write, and is the only copy which she has in her angry hands. And in her eyes that makes Paul a Don't-Bee.

Now she wants him to be a Do-Bee when she buys him a typewriter and a ream of paper and she tells Paul to write Misery back to life. With him now bound to a wheelchair, dependent on drugs and locked in his room Paul has no choice. He has been reduced to an entertainer that is now held by his captive audience. He is a writer in serious trouble but even writers have weapons of their own too.

For many readers of King, including myself, the main antagonist of the story Annie Wilkes was based on his fear of meeting a very fanatical fan. And Paul Sheldon, of course, was based on author himself who at the time was still struggling with alcoholism. Of course this was also adapted into a film in the 90s as well. This is, for me, a really good work of psychological horror.

PS. I used to have a paperback copy of this book back in 2011 and was in the process of reading it at the time. But that got lost during the tornado of may 24 that happened in the Ozone and Clarksville areas in Arkansas. Now I've got the Viking hard cover edition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15dbr2x/stephen_kings_misery/,2023-07-30 04:06:56,14,13,books
wz4vcy,Misery by Stephen King,"First of all - HOLY FUCKING SHIT! WHAT A BOOK!

While it is difficult to write a book with many characters, it is equally difficult to write a book with fewer characters. That too set only inside a house, mostly inside a room? Almost impossible. But Stephen King did it like a piece of cake. 

The plot was tight, didn't take more than 4-5 pages to be set and it was a ride there onwards. A proper psychopath with a character, a proper protagonist. The only complaint I had with the book was the huge 'Misery's return' story in between. It's not that I didn't like it, it just felt like it dragged the story a bit. 

For me Misery was a bit more scary/thrilling than IT. What are your thoughts on Misery?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wz4vcy/misery_by_stephen_king/,2022-08-27 14:56:26,34,89,books

One book I've avoided thus far is Misery, simply because I've seen the film so many times. I unfairly assumed that the film was complete replica of the book. And boy was I wrong. 

I read the book in a day and was gripped from start to end. There were several exhilarating points where I could feel my pulse racing. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement.

Update ( WITH SPOILERS) 

This book is simply amazing. I just finished it and I can‚Äôt believe the toll it took on me.

Groaning and trying to string together the words ‚Äúdirty bird‚Äù with a damaged throat..her weight falling on him, Her fingers peeking under the door, the fact that she was still alive as Paul hid/slept in the bathroom.. super creepy.

ka6odv,"Misery by Stephen King , what did you guys think? (Spoiler)","This is personally my favorite Stephen King book , the story is very well executed and the ending feels rightfully earned. This story is most well known through the 1990 movie ""Misery"" , while that Is a great movie i highly recommend you read the book. There is more detail and events that didn't make it into the movie that was very interesting.

What did you guys think of the hobbling scene? I personally wasn't scared but the suspense of that part is insane and really well written . I think after that part when Paul says ""at least it wasnt my penis"" was really funny to me for some reason . Did you guys get scared at all? 

What did you guys think of Annie Wilkes as a villain? I adore her character and arc , her dialog is very well written and just feels unsettling. I like how just generally evil she is , they part where she kills the rat right in front of Paul is really unsettling but is really good.

This is the first stephen king book i have read. I really liked the fact that this book only has 2 major characters in it, paul sheldon a writer and annie wilkes. Annie wilkes is paul's biggest fan. I really liked the interaction between the two. The book is not overly complicated (partly due to the few characters), but shines when it comes to character development. The reader really gets into the feelings and things paul goes throught.

Many people say this book is really gruesome, but i would not say the same. It has gruesome parts, but there are only a few. The parts that are gory are not as gross as they could have been or as i had in mind when i heard that this book was gruesome.

6x4nn7,"Just got through my first Stephen King book (I know I know, crazy), Misery. Just wanted to share my thoughts.","Obvious spoilers below.

First off, I am blown away by Stephens writing. Even if one doesnt like the plot of this book (I dont see why anyone wouldn't), his writing alone makes it worth the read. The way words flow, so simple yet so true and relatable, never ceased to amaze me. His analogies are so good, they remind me of Jeremy Clarksons from Top Gear. They can both describe something in a really strange but simple way, one which makes you think ""Ha! It is like that!"". Truly an obvious master of his craft.

Annie was an amazing villain. Truly insane and unstable, a force to be reckoned with and one that was always unpredictable.

Paul came off as a little pathetic (not by Stephens fault, but as a character himself). Maybe Stephen wanted to make a character that was somewhat pathetic, I'm not sure. He wasnt really resourceful. I was blown away that he didnt go for a knife the very first time he left the room. Okay, he was in a lot of pain and took a bunch of drugs, so maybe thats somehow understandable. But the second time? Come on. One would have to be an idiot to not find a knife and literally wait by the door actively waiting for Annie's return. But no, even on his second escape out of the room, he didnt get the knife.

My biggest ""wtf are you doing Paul?"" moment was when he was left alone in the basement. There was a clear description of a lot of jars stacked on the table. Any reasonable person would have smashed a jar or two in a dark corner, and gotten a nice big shard of glass as a weapon. When Annie came down again and told him to climb on her back for a piggyback ride, he could have sliced her throat ten times before she even knew what hit her. But no. 

Im just going to go with the fact that Stephen chose to keep Annie alive, so Paul could kill her dramatically with the Royal and the manuscript which she forced him to write. It obviously makes for a much better story.

Anyway, just wanted to rant. What next book of his should I pick up? I am not too keen on supernatural thrillers, I prefer things like Misery. Mr. Mercedes perhaps?

Also, has anyone watched the 1990 Misery movie, and if so what were your thoughts? I've seen a few clips, and still not sure if I should watch it.

10accf,"My brother is going to jail for 2 years on some trumped up bullshit. Can anyone recommended some books about struggle, suffering, misery, inspiration, or human redemption?","Long story short my bro did some pretty expensive damage to a person's property about ten years ago, to the tune of about $70k. He can't get off probation until he pays it off even though he's been trying and has it down to about $20 grand. He went and got a DUI recently and it looks like he's going to do a year or two now on the probation violation.

So I'm looking for some books to encourage him. Preferably non-fiction, something like Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning (I just sent him that one, he liked it.) Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10accf/my_brother_is_going_to_jail_for_2_years_on_some/,2012-09-22 05:29:20,7,0,books
