15565ce,Benchley’s Jaws: is the shark part of a curse?,"In spirit of the season and with shark week coming up, I re-read the novel Jaws for the first time since I was like…12. It’s a bit better than I remember it being, but there was a part that made me appreciate it more.

Near the beginning of part 2, they mention a lady who works at the post office who is also a bit of a town historian. She can tell you Amity is named after Amity Hopewell, a person who was convicted of witchcraft a long time ago. The narrative then describes a bunch of other bad things that have happened in the town, including a fire that burned the entire town down except one church. Kind of implying the town is cursed.

Having been a huge fan of the movie, I decided to shake up my reading by holding on to the theory that the shark is a part of that curse. It holds up really well. There are several mentions of the shark being supernatural; Hooper, the expert; is wrong about the shark constantly when he applies science to it, Quint gains a weird psychic connection with the shark in the last chapter, and the shark starts doing extremely un-shark like things. I’m kinda convinced the shark is supernatural.

There really isn’t anything in the internet I can find that talks about this book in such a way, so I was wondering if anyone who may have read this book might have some thoughts? The theory does not apply to the movie at all by the way.

sj4ptk,Jaws by Peter Benchley,"Just finished Jaws. What a disappointment of a book. And the subplots? The fuck was with it. Like it didn’t even lead the story. It would just be a 100 pages or less books without the subplot. The Shark has only a guest appearance ffs. And the review behind the book says and I quote

""Relentless terror…Jaws proves
once again that you don't need
demons
or exorcism to
create
blanching, relentless terror.""

Lol Philadelphia Inquirer for the review.

I only felt lethargy no terror. I mean it started out good (the first 2 chapters) then came the heinous subplots not leading to any shit. 

I am a bit arsed because I was a big fan of the movie (when i was a kid) and then reading the book the movie was more interesting.

The one other thing I loved about the book was how all the characters were fucked up with the exception of Hendrickson. It was kinda realistic.

Anyways this is my opinion. Don’t try to argue with me but add yours too.

It was just I expected a bit more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sj4ptk/jaws_by_peter_benchley/,2022-02-03 00:25:51,17,0,books
rz5i6j,Jaws got me back into reading.,"
I used to read a lot. When I was a kid, but pretty much stopped reading outside of school just before high school started. I would do the summer reading programs and everything. I thought I was just a guy who didn't love reading, but I was just impatient and unfocused. Towards the end of my most recent semester at college I made a spur of the moment decision to go into the library to kill time before class. It was amazing to see how much they really had. Just going through each shelf I'd find books about anything. However one book really stuck out to me. That was Jaws. As I inspected I realized it was a first edition from 1974. I just had to borrow it. And pun intended it just hooked me. I just recently finished it (a day before it was due). Just being given the privilege of being able to read a great book but an old one too, was just amazing to me. I'm so excited to continue exploring the vast collection that library has to offer. 

Edit: It took me some time to get through the book as I had little interest in some plotlines. What kept me reading was Sheriff Brody and his interactions with community. I sympathized with his struggle and got a wave of satisfaction in the end. There were moments where Peter Benchley's writing shined further engaging me in the story. However his wording can get a little strange sometimes where I had to read lines multiple times to understood. I also loved the vocabulary in this book. I learned so many words reading this book, and didn't need to google all of to understand their meaning. Overall a great book from almost half a century ago and shows why it was quickly adapted to the screen a year later.


TLDR: I was an impatient child who have up reading until I discovered my school's library.

I'd love to hear your opinions on the book if you have read it. I know I had tons to say when reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rz5i6j/jaws_got_me_back_into_reading/,2022-01-08 17:50:48,7,3,books
m86fkb,Just finished reading 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley,"I wasn't disappointed, but I think I found the rare example of a movie being better than the book.  For instance, I felt the romance novel parts of the book detracted from the suspense of the novel and shoehorned Hooper into the 'villain' role.  The movie wisely left that aspect out.  Also, the tension of the hunt at the end of the movie built so well, and the character interactions devolved so well, that by comparison the climax at the end of the book felt more like a particularly ill fated fishing trip.  Thoughts?  Are there any book(s) that fall into the 'movie was better' category for you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m86fkb/just_finished_reading_jaws_by_peter_benchley/,2021-03-19 01:47:30,17,12,books
cjvjdc,Chief Brody in Jaws and Jaws 2,"So Jaws is one of my favorite novels and the novelization for Jaws 2 is....certainly a book but reading through Jaws 2 is making me realize how depressing Brody's life is. He's stuck in a dead marriage with a wife who cheated on him, has migranes and PTSD, mild alcoholism and a job where anything he does causes every official body in a 100 mile radius to jump on his ass. I never was a huge fan of Brody, he always struck me as not the best person but now I'm just starting to feel sorry for him. Oh and there's also a subplot in these books about sharks or something I don't really remember",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cjvjdc/chief_brody_in_jaws_and_jaws_2/,2019-07-30 18:03:16,2,10,books
unygzu,A long rant about Peter Benchley's Jaws (1974) but also how it teaches a lot about storycraft (and effective screenwriting),"I finally read Jaws, having heard for so long how good it was, and obviously being incredibly popular at the time. Wow - it has to be the most disappointing fiction I've ever read. I'm hugely surprised at how amateur the whole thing felt, in every single aspect. It really feels like it was knocked out in a rushed way for cash, making itself up as it goes, without any redrafts or thoughts about theme or structure. There's a positive here though - the adapted screenplay fixes *so much*, comparing the two is hugely informative.  

Firstly, why I hated the novel so much:

\- the dialogue is cliched to the point of parody. Every character sounds the same, giving short self-conscious staccato responses that feel unnatural and/or glib. The exception is Quint, who is written like a two-dimensional belligerant pirate (p323 '""Attack me, will you?"" said Quint. ""You'll take no man with you, uppity fuck!""'), but still talks in cliches: P299 '""He'll come up"" said Quint. ""Mark my words.""' '""That's what I'm afraid of"". ""I would be too,"" said Quint. ""I don't think I'd like five thousand pounds of pissed-off dinosaur trying to eat me"".' 

\- there are typos. I don't know enough about publishing or how 40 years of proofreading wouldn't have corrected these by now, but they surprised me. P218: '""Oh yeah? I should of brought my suit""'. The last page, during the climax: ""He screamed, an ejaculation of hopelessness, and closed his eyes, waiting *far* an agony he could not imagine"". 

\- being that the shark is the big enemy driving the narrative, no real suspense or fear is developed. Aside from the Kintner mother at the police station complaining about her son being killed, there are NO emotional reactions from anyone about the opening girl, the boy, a random old man, Ben Gardner or Hooper. Instead it focuses on businesses whinging about staying open, and tourists coming to try and get a look at the shark (then being disappointed when they don't). Basically all that's at stake is the local community economy, and Brody's pride as the Chief. By the time the three are on the boat, any anxiety about the shark is overshadowed by Hooper's excited fascination for it. For a book taglined ""the ultimate holiday nightmare"" and described so much as an ""unrelenting horror"", it's devoid of suspense. The shark really barely features. When Hooper dies, despite Ellen having slept with him days prior: 'She had been sadder at the disintegration of Larry Vaughan than she was now, for Vaughan had been a dear and close friend. Hooper had been a 'lover' in only the most shallow sense of the word. She had not *loved* him... She was sorry he was dead, of course, just as she would have been sorry to hear that his brother, David, had died. In her mind they were both now relics of her distant past' (p310). If you found out someone you'd got to know over lunch then fucked at a motel room just days prior had been brutally eaten by a shark just an hour prior, is that a natural response? 

\- there is no emotional depth or intelligence here. Ellen sleeps with Hooper in an act of spontaneous desperation, but then doesn't reflect on her actions and is barely in it again. Brody suspects but chooses not to enquire, then its forgotten about. When he's about to call someone to confirm that Hooper cheated on his wife: p309 'But he surpressed the impulse and moved on to his car. What's the point? he thought. If there was anything, it's over now.' *What's the point in finding out if your wife just fucked someone else?* *Are you kidding me?* Brody's crisis of guilt and pressure amounts to drinking at a dinner party and struggling to socialise. Even then, and at all other times, he's consistently delivering the usual self-conscious cliches in a flat way. 

\- stuff just doesn't make sense. After Hooper dies, an oceanographer who's lived away for years, an editorial is printed by the local journo that includes ""He was a friend, and he gave his life so that we, his friends, might live"". They didn't even *know* him! 

\- structurally it's a mess. The first half is given over to town politics. There's then a long, extremely tedious dinner party scene where nothing happens beside Ellen and Hooper touching each others arms. Then a subplot about Ellen cheating with Hooper that comes across as emotionally immature, like something from a young adult 50 Shades book. Then a subplot about Mayor Vaughn having some sneaky business dealings buying up cheap properties during the panic, which is contrary to him wanting to catch the shark. This goes nowhere, and is resolved by him showing up to Ellen's house, looking thin and pale, and sadly telling her that he's now moving away (saying how much he loves his wife, while also trying to convince Ellen that her and him would have been the perfect couple - it's bizarre). The shark dies literally *three paragraphs* from the very end of the book, by simply sinking into the sea having harpooned a few times prior. There is absolutely *no* emotional reaction from last survivor Brody, to Quint dying, the shark dying, or his own survival.  

Things from the screenplay that weren't in the book:

\- Quint's introduction and offer

\- Ellen seeing the shark book and realising the danger of their kids playing in the boat

\- The false promise of a captured shark

\- Hooper showing up to the Brody house, him and Brody cutting open the captured shark, realising it's not the one, then going out on a boat to find the Gardner boat, Hooper seeing the head and dropping the salvaged shark tooth

\- The Brody kid witnessing the rowerboat death and being in shock

\- That shock influencing Brody to put pressure on the mayor to hire Quint  

\- Quint's whole personality and wit

\- The Orca being a single trip, rather than across three consecutive days where they return to go home between

\- The comparing scars/ Indianapolis/ singing stuff

\- The oxygen tanks and climax

The screenplay did such a fantastic job of truncating the scenes to be more efficient, meaningful, and carry through a coherent theme and vibe. I'm not sure how much of this was down to Carl Gottlieb, I imagine most of it as I find it hard to imagine that Benchley had a single clue about such things at this time. I'm just shocked that the book was ever highly regarded, it just confuses the hell out of me. If I'd been handed it as a first draft from a friend trying to write a first book, I'd have still felt a bit embarrassed reading it.

o8nmgb,OMG....OMG.... I just finished Jaws and its like... Omg,"Since I was a little girl and discovered the Jaws movie it has been my absolute favorite. I'd watch it back to back, once their was a 24 hour marathon, all jaws back to back non stopped I watched everyone. As an adult I discovered Jaws is based on a book, so being a fellow book worm I put it on my list. A few days ago I finally bought it and have been reading it off on when I wasnt working. Like most book readers I prefer to read the book first and become disappointed in the movie later but I couldnt this time. So I can only say OMG! the book is so much more darker than the movie and the feeling of revenge stronger. At first I didnt like Brody, seemed like an ass, unlike the movie. Hooper and Ellen were not the people I thought they were. This book turned my view upside down but I loved it. And I still love the movie! Quint was way more Interesting. He might have been my favorite character.

Sorry for being vague but didnt want to include spoilers. I strongly recommend reading this book. 

Now I need to be the actual book form.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o8nmgb/omgomg_i_just_finished_jaws_and_its_like_omg/,2021-06-27 01:41:16,16,7,books
