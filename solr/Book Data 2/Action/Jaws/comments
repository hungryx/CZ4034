>How many times have you come out of the cinema and heard someone snidely remark they preferred the book, as though this somehow connects them to a richer, more highbrow tradition?

>This might ring true when it comes to literary masterworks like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, adapted into two so-so versions nearly four decades apart (equally dull, for almost opposite reasons). But the reverse is often the case with popular fiction, which benefits from the immersive, visceral quality of the cinema.  
>  
>Peter Benchley’s 1974 novel Jaws, which turns 50 this year, was a smash. Despite critics’ reservations, it was on the New York Times bestseller list for 44 weeks. Yet when we think of Jaws, images from Steven Spielberg’s 1975 film adaptation are what come to mind – along with John Williams’ iconic theme music.  
>  
>Spielberg’s Jaws keeps the simple –  and stunning –  narrative architecture of Benchley’s novel intact. A shark terrorises a small beach community that depends on wealthy tourists for sustenance. Brody, the chief of police, keeps the beaches open due to political pressure from Mayor Vaughan; when more attacks occur, marine biologist Matt Hooper comes to help. Together, they contract wild shark hunter Quint to help them kill the great white.  
>  
>But the tone of grand adventure that defines Spielberg’s film marks a major departure from the novel. In Benchley’s work, more energy is directed towards exploring the minor social and political lives of its small-town denizens than in staging an epic showdown between man and beast – and, crucially, it differs radically from the film in its characterisation. In Spielberg’s world, the main characters are likeable, heroic, whereas in the novel they’re petty, broken and bitter, wading through the messes their personal lives have become.  
>  
>These differences are not simply evidence of a young director’s desire to make the material his own. They map the changing consciousness of American popular culture in the 1970s, from a resolute focus on the violence simmering within United States society and policy (the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War) to an attempt to forget about these things through spectacular, anodyne entertainment.

18xekv8,"Thinking back on it, I’m not sure if there is a character that’s more dramatically changed from adapting a book to a movie than Hooper from Jaws.  Hooper from the book is a true shitbag.",prussbus23,2024-01-03 13:46:11
18xekv8,"On a side note, I searched for Jaws on Barnes and Noble’s site to add it to my wishlist for later and I noticed many books with very similar titles. They weren’t related to Jaws but had titles such as “The New Home: An absolutely gripping psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist” and “The Stranger Next Door: The completely unputdownable thriller with a jaw-dropping twist.”

What do you guys think about titles like these in an online bookstore? Personally I think it seems a tacky and I don’t even read the synopsis, I just skip over them. Also, do you think this is tied to AI books or just bad marketing?",JasonZep,2024-01-03 15:22:20
18xekv8,This has nothing to do with Jaws or marketing and everything to do with how search works.,scdemandred,2024-01-03 17:45:30
18xekv8,"I suppose. I think I thought i was being a cool, grown-up kid by reading this “adult” novel, and I suspect returning to it now 30+ years later would reveal some flaws I missed.

That said, an adaptation by a good screenwriter could maybe tweak some of the awful people to make them more integration. But then again, Jaws is such an iconic film, remaking it would likely invite mostly ire.",scdemandred,2024-01-03 23:57:10
18xekv8,"Yeah, the “mass market drivel” was certainly not in reference to Jaws, more the contemporary movie landscape.",scdemandred,2024-01-04 00:03:08
15565ce,"In the way better than they should be novelizations of Jaws 2 and Jaws The Revenge by Hank Searls, this connection becomes explicit.  The ""revenge"" in the novel has to do with an angry voodoo priest in Jamaica connecting to the shark to get revenge on the Brody family.",ohdoubters,2023-07-21 02:13:51
15565ce,"Oh wow, I don’t remember that at all. Granted, I haven’t read Jaws since like 1977 or something.",MissDisplaced,2023-07-21 02:46:01
sj4ptk,It rare when the movie is better but it happens. Forrest Gump was the same for me. To be fair jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time and watch it multiple times a year so no way the book would beat it for me,,2022-02-03 00:32:18
sj4ptk,"I preferred his Beast to Jaws.

That said, it’s probably been 15-20 years since I read both.",,2022-02-03 01:36:49
sj4ptk,As someone who watched the movie and read the book in a short window of time I agree with you. What you described is the reason why Jaws is a rare case in which everyone agrees the film ia the better version of the story.,BackStrict977,2022-02-03 12:01:05
rz5i6j,"I also enjoyed Jaws and read it as a teenager and remember thinking the affair plotline that isn’t in the movie was very scandalous. I was a sheltered child from the generation where watching sharks being eaten on screen was worse than sex in a book lol.

Unrelated, but In Cold Blood was the book that re-ignited my passion for reading after several years If you are looking for something  to read next!",Joe434,2022-01-08 18:31:34
m86fkb,"I heard some cool trivia about Jaws recently...  
  
Apparently it’s one of the rare instances where the book cover image (the iconic painting of the naked girl swimming and the shark coming up underneath) was SO good that the movie producers bought the rights to use it as the movie poster!  It’s like the ONLY promotional image of the book/film. 
Also cool...the original painting was ‘toured’ through the US to promote the film and...disappeared! Nobody knows what happened to it! Either a fan stole it, or it’s in some producers office somewhere.",Vibratorator,2021-03-19 02:05:20
m86fkb,"I'm gonna say *Mary Poppins.* The book is fine, but the movie is a classic. Obviously may or may not appeal to any particular person. I think probably a lot of musicals would be the same: as well as all the acting, set design, camera work and editing, there's a whole additional layer of artistic content in the songs.

Also, *Jurassic Park*. I really enjoyed the book, but then when I saw the movie, I mean come on. What a masterpiece.

Edit: also, I agree about *Jaws*. I only got round to the novel a few years ago, out of curiosity. It seemed, like, competent—a better novel than I could write—but the movie, I will watch any time.",dbulger,2021-03-19 02:33:11
m86fkb,"I think Jaws is okay but I remember enjoying reading ‘Beast’ exponentially more. It’s also been quite awhile since I read these.

As far as the other part of your question I think there’s an argument to be made for Fight Club. Not to make any knocks against the book, because it’s outstanding. But the movie is just a home run in my opinion.",bilgemonkeyflyguy,2021-03-19 02:00:14
cjvjdc,Jaws 2 book? Is it Peter Benchley? Also does it follow on the plot from the book or is it a novelisation if the film?,,2019-07-31 16:38:18
cjvjdc,"It's not by Peter Benchley and it's based on an earlier draft of the screenplay. It still picks up a few years after Jaws but adds in some things that weren't in the movie, and if you thought the shark in Benchley's book didn't get a lot of screen time you haven't seen anything because it's barely in Jaws 2. The book focuses more on Brody butting heads with a cop from out of town he arrests for trying to shoot a seal and his son getting his diving license (Brody isn't even aware there is a shark until the last 50 odd pages of the book)",ShinyBlueChocobo,2019-07-31 17:07:12
unygzu,"I read the book in my school library as a teen and was shocked by how little it resembled the film I loved.

Even Jaws 2 is better than the original novel.",UniformUnion,2022-05-13 09:12:50
unygzu,"There is a good book called, “The Jaws Log,” written by the screenwriter, Carl Gottlieb. It’s kind of a dairy he kept during production, where a lot of the script was written, and an overview. It’s a really good look at the making of the movie from a writer’s point of view.",jaymickef,2022-05-12 23:37:40
unygzu,"Thanks for drawing my attention to this, I've ordered it and can't wait to read. I think Gottlieb's work on Jaws was absolutely terrific and contributed as much to the film's success as Spielberg's overshadowing direction.",XInsects,2022-05-13 12:40:47
unygzu,"Hi, guys. Jaws is still better.",UniformUnion,2022-05-13 09:10:42
unygzu,"Hey, just letting you know I read The Jaws Log. It was a great read from a practical filmmaking perspective, and yes Verna Fields seems an amazing woman. I wish there had been more about the scripting, Gottlieb doesn't refer to it much at all. I get the feeling though from his brief mentions of the novel and Benchley that he (Gottlieb) thought it was pretty shit to. Thanks for the recommendation!",XInsects,2022-07-10 16:20:10
o8nmgb,"I'm old, so I read the book before the movie was even made. It was a great book! I have to admit that the >! tawdry affair between Hooper and Brody's wife!< always seemed out of place and unnecessary. >! The mob connection also seemed a little over the top, but it provided a solid reason that the mayor was so intent on keeping the beaches open that he was willing to sacrifice people's lives to do so.!<

Jaws is one of the few movies that I thought the film was better than the book.",BogBabe,2021-06-27 04:40:01
o8nmgb,"I prefer to watch the movie first and be surprised by how much better the book is!

I did enjoy the Jaws book (it’s been a while since I read it)",RockyDify,2021-06-27 02:44:32
o8nmgb,"""Jaws"" the book is basically a retelling of Ibsen's ""An Enemy of the People"", isn't it?",Jack-Campin,2021-06-27 12:20:21
