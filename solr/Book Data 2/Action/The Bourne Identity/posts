nj12f3,The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum is the best book I've ever read,"Excuse me if this isn't your genre, but if it is, I doubt there is a finer book written. I've read dozens of other Ludlum novels, it's like he was on a whole other plane when he was writing the first Bourne book. I still remember being in my college dorm and watching the Matt Damon movie with half a dozen other guys and feeling so disappointed in the movie at the end (when the other 6 were going ga-ga)

There are obviously other great books out there, and 'best' is very subjective, but I have a lot of Alistair Macleans, Fred Forsyth, Tom Clancy (very average imo) and while there have been a couple of books that maybe in the league of Bourne Identity, none have equaled or surpassed it

Alright, peace out fam.

35q69g,Just read The Bourne Identity. I never really seen the book or series ever being discussed except in regards to the films. [Spoilers],"First thing, I don't know how to tag anything so, sorry about that.

Ok, so I just read the first book lets not go into the other books because I haven't decided to read them or not. I can obviously see now that they are very different plots with very little similarities, and in a way I feel this is the first book where I feel the film is much better. How did you guys feel about the book, specially if you read it *after* watching the film.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/35q69g/just_read_the_bourne_identity_i_never_really_seen/,2015-05-12 16:32:55,46,13,books

zrdhlw,The Bourne Evolution by Brian Freeman,"Brian Freeman's rebooted Jason Bourne series started back in 2020, but I was only recently able to get my hands on copies of his first two books, *The Bourne Evolution* and *The Bourne Treachery*. I read the first one and figured this would be the best place to talk about it (given that the Jason Bourne-focused subreddits are mostly dead these days, and anyway tend to focus more on the films).

On the whole, it was a GREAT read! I'm a die-hard Jason Bourne fan, not just of the movies, but the books as well (perhaps even *moreso* the books!) The Ludlum originals are literary treasures to me, and I loved the Lustbader continuations - but the latter, as enjoyable as they usually were, often felt like a totally different animal from Ludlum's Bourne.

Not so with Freeman's Bourne, who really feels like Ludlum's character, albeit transplanted from the 80's to 2020. The plot, the pace, the tone - everything feels like a Ludlum novel if it was written today. Someone who knows Bourne primarily from the films might find it a bit jarring just how 'talky' this book can be, but it's actually very much in line with the verbosity of Ludlum's original characters.

There are a TON of references to *The Bourne Identity* which I enjoyed! At the same time, Freeman's description of Bourne makes it easy to picture Matt Damon while reading.

Freeman, whose own books I haven't read, is primarily a psychological thriller author, and it really shows here in how he delves into Bourne's psyche - something Lustbader occasionally tried to do but often only superficially.

Abbey Laurent, the female lead of this story, *really* felt like a reinvented Marie St. Jacques (>!though Marie is also alluded to as a past love of Bourne's who's now dead...in that regard Freeman has gone the film/Lustbader route!<). And one of the primary antagonists, Ms. Shirley, felt too much like a Bond henchman for my tastes...but she's really *something*.

I do have a couple of nitpicks with this book but they are fairly minor ones. The book spends *way* too much time in the US for my liking (I associate Bourne with globetrotting adventures!) There is a pretty fun setpiece towards the end in Nassau, but it feels a bit too *Bondian* for a Bourne book, but that's just me. But none of these ruin the book (far from it).

Has anyone else here read The Bourne Evolution or any of Freeman's other novels?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zrdhlw/the_bourne_evolution_by_brian_freeman/,2022-12-21 07:22:57,5,9,books
njpkev,Alistair Maclean is likely the best thriller/mystery author of all time,"Don't get me wrong, I wrote a post earlier about this but Robert Ludlum's Bourne Identity is my most favorite book of all time. And he's damn near the best author in my opinion too. Damn near.

Alistair Maclean takes the crown for me, only because he has written books literally decades ahead of his time. I was shocked to learn the dude died years before I was even born because reading his books, you hardly ever realize the story is set in the 60s and 70s etc. It is simply mind blowing, how someone could've done that. Most people know about his most famous classics like guns of navarone, but I personally feel that was nowhere NEAR his best work (it was an amazing book, no doubt) but hear me out: 

1. Fear is the key - Probably the best storyline overall

2. Where eagles dare - Probably the best action flick on paper ever written

3. When eight bells toll - Exciting AND funnier than most hollywood comedies of the 21st century combined. His protagonists are witty like it's nobody's business

The list could go on but you get my point. I dunno, I just wanted to put this out there. There's got to be people who think this too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/njpkev/alistair_maclean_is_likely_the_best/,2021-05-24 04:32:13,12,16,books

kofw0i,Spy novel fans – what do you make of the genre's subcategories?,"I've been getting very into spy novels lately and I've been fascinated to notice the formulaic nature of the genre. It seems to me that spy novels tend to fall into one of three camps:

1. The classic Cold-War era spy novel: Westerners vs. Soviets. The hero is a Western spy, usually with a calm, suave demeanor and a strong sense of duty. These novels often involve going deep undercover. They're morally philosophical and very classy, but can be politically dense. Think John Le Carré.
2. The classic post-Cold-War spy novel: action-packed and military-centric. No countries will be thrown under the bus, so the plots can be oddly evasive of politics – at most specific the villains will be a terrorist faction of such-and-such unstable country; more likely they will be arms dealers who enable the violence rather than dealing it. The heroes are hardened, ""don't-f\*\*\*-with-me"" military types with a cynical sense of humor, if any. Think Jack Reacher, Gabriel Allon, even Bourne to an extent.
3. The subverted or mistaken-identity spy novel: I realize this description is much more broad, but it has to be because honestly, so few books fit into it. It can be Cold War (""Our Man in Havana"") or post-Cold-War (""Anonymous Sources"" by Mary Louise Kelly; the works of Chris Pavone). The main thread here is that the main character is either not a spy, or does not spend most of their time on the page working amongst the typical machinations of an intelligence agency. They're an outsider or bystander for at least part of the book, which totally changes the way the plot unfolds to the reader.

I love elements of all these genres, but especially the third one – which is a shame because I find it very, very hard to come across books which don't fit into categories 1 and 2. However, this isn't a call for recommendations. It's a call for perspectives from die-hard fans of the genre, who probably see more nuances than I do. To those people I ask:

How would you divide up the sub-genres of the spy novel, if you think they even exist?

Which sub-genre do you gravitate towards? What do you love about those books that keeps you coming back?

Alternately, how do you escape from these formulas and find variety?

I feel like I'm still a newbie to the genre, so don't hate me if I've misrepresented it – open my eyes and help me dive deeper!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kofw0i/spy_novel_fans_what_do_you_make_of_the_genres/,2021-01-01 18:11:52,16,28,books
gwjy69,Shibumi (1979) & The Art of Subverting Expectations,"Hello everybody I've recently been able to get back into reading a bit more during my time in quarantine and want to bring some under discussed or unappreciated books to light for discussion. Today I wanna talk about a book that is pretty polarizing for those who have read it and give my thoughts about whether or not its worth a read in the first place (be warned, a pretty long post with some light spoilers for the novel throughout) 


*Shibumi*, published in 1979 by the notoriously private author Trevanian (pen name of Rodney William Whittaker), is a book concerning the life of recently retired international assassin Nicholai Hel and his conflict with the nefarious collective known as the Mother Company. It debuted with widespread critical acclaim and helped Trevanian establish himself as the reigning king of airport paperbacks.


Now there wouldn't be the need for this post if *Shibumi* was universally loved here in 2020, as from what I've found (at least on this website) is that some people really hate this damn book. And to be perfectly honest, I can see why.

To understand the reasoning behind the hate for *Shibumi*, you have to understand Trevanian, and how he had a bit of an ego. Trevanian was a college professor with an array of accolades to his name, including a prestigious Fulbright scholarship for study in England. The man was pretty damn smart to say the least, and he made sure you knew it. The guy seemed to take a perverse joy in ""slumming it"" in the world of fiction, denouncing rumors of his true identity being the likes of Robert Ludlum or a collective of authors, and dismissively stating that he didn't really care to read anything published after 1900. Additionally, Trevanian was a bit irritated by the fact that audiences had not realized that his previous work, *The Eiger Sanction* was supposed to be a spoof, so for this novel, he took special care in beating it into the audience that this book was indeed satire, among many other things. All of this academic pedigree and gleeful condescension are etched throughout *Shibumi*, and god help you if you try to take this book seriously.

*Shibumi*, at its surface level is a globetrotting spy thriller akin to James Bond and Jason Bourne, but in reality its more of a satirical cross between Zen Buddhism, Archer, and the adolescent power fantasies of a horny 14 year old boy. To get things clear from the get go: if you go into this novel expecting bloody violence and pulse pounding action, you're gonna be sorely disappointed. The first third of the book details the early life of the protagonist Nicholai Hel (we'll get to him later, don't you worry) and his upbringing in 1930's Japanese occupied Shanghai. The next third is spent on a long jaunt through the caves of the Basque countryside, and the final third is where the typical action movie plot starts rolling along. This plot structure alone, is why *Shibumi* and its author exceed at subverting the expectations of the audience. For starters, Hel's entire career as an assassin is relegated to exposition and offhand references, with the story picking up with Hel as a recently retired contract killer in his early 50's. We the audience are expecting wet work and womanizing, not a Japanese board game and spelunking. Trevanian's deliberately slow pacing and plotting make the reader know that he's the one in the drivers seat, and we're just along for the ride, and there's nothing we can do about it. This intentional withholding of the typical tropes of a spy thriller are what usually piss suspecting readers off about *Shibumi* the most, with the spelunking chapters normally being the litmus test for whether or not someone's got the patience to make it to the end of the book or give it up entirely. The other reason is... well you'll see.

Nicholai Hel is one of the most batshit characters in fiction I have ever read. You think ""Mary Sue"" (this phrase is a hot topic these days, but I'll use it for lack of a better term) characters are bad today? Think again boys and girls, Nicholai Hel was the god emperor of doing whatever the fuck he wanted perfectly and with no effort all the way back when your grandparents were watching Happy Days. If I had to use pre-existing individuals to even come close to describing just how insane Nicholai Hel is as a character, I'd have to say that he's a combination of John Wick, James Bond, The Buddha, Jesus Christ, and the Dos Equis guy, and even then Hel  would murder them all with a shower caddy and go have sex with all of their and your girlfriends. At once. Nicholai Hel is a master of naked/kill, a martial art consisting of using everyday objects as weapons that is impossible to defend against. Nicholai Hel is a Stage IV lovemaker, meaning that he is so impossibly good at sex that he can permanently ruin someone from ever achieving the same sexual experience again with anyone else, leaving them a complete wreck. Nicholai Hel has goddamn super powers, can sense people before they arrive from god knows how far, AND is a mystic of such power and skill that he pities everyone else on Earth for not knowing what ""true"" enlightenment feels like. Hell, he spelunks because mountain climbing is for pussies, is a grandmaster at the Japanese game of GO, oh and he happens to be the best assassin in the world who possess a freakishly youthful appearance in his 50's (and don't get me started on his concubine/definitely not a wife). People get pissed off once they realize the degree of bullshit they are being served up from their main character, but at the same time, they make the mistake of not realizing that you really shouldn't be taking Nicholai Hel all that seriously, hell Trevanian didn't, and that's where the true enjoyment of the book can come from.

Despite the aforementioned reasons that really put people off from the novel, *Shibumi* really is a delightfully wicked and absurd piece of satire, slow burn storytelling, and fiction in general. At points during the novel, you can almost hear the cackling as Trevanian dares you to take this stuff seriously, to buy into the surface level and leave disappointed. At other points, you can see his appreciation for many Japanese philosophies and customs, and his trademark love for the Basque land and people. This book almost made me want to go and head out to the Basque countryside just to see if all of the fawning and adoration over it is well deserved. However, not all of Trevanian's musings are for the book's benefit. His stance towards America and Americans in general has about the subtlety of an explosion. Rodney William Whittaker despised America during the 70's and 80's and pretty much exiled himself from the country in disgust. The author's disdain for America, materialism, and the encroachment of Western values upon foreign culture are constantly parroted by many of the main cast. And trust me, if you're inclined towards respectful depictions of women, race, and people of color, you should probably stay the hell away from this book, because a lot of the more dare I say... troublesome dialogue has not aged well since the 70's.

Ultimately, the true value of *Shibumi* is that it is truly whatever you want it to be. Airport book store spy thriller? Check. Hilarious piss take of an entire genre? Check. A pedantic, problematic, preachy slog? Hey, check there too. *Shibumi* exists on several literary planes, and it excels on all of them at once. While it may be one of the more polarizing works in its genre, *Shibumi* is well worth the shot if you're interested and an absolute masterclass in turning the audience's preconceived genre expectations on their head. 


**SIDE NOTE**: Although this is probably blasphemy for myself and others who really hate Hollywood adaptations of novels, I would be very interested in seeing what a true adaptation of *Shibumi* would look like in cinema or as a TV series. I know given the situation regarding the Clint Eastwood adaptation of *The Eiger Sanction* and the controversy around it (as well as Trevanian's refusal to license another one of his books) as well as today's general climate (a lot of shit in this book would sure as hell not fly today) that an adaptation of *Shibumi* will probably never happen. But as it happens, Trevanian's estate has shopped around this novel a bit in the last few years. I honestly think that Paul Thomas Anderson could do it justice, given his previous work adapting Thomas Pynchon's seemingly unadaptable *Inherent Vice* to the screen and his experience with displaying the 70's in Boogie Nights, but hey who knows right? Let me know if you think my pick is completely awful, and what your choice would be. 

**EVEN MORE USELESS SIDE NOTE**: My next deep dive, if you'll allow it, will most likely be about Hugh Laurie's 1996 novel *The Gun Seller*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gwjy69/shibumi_1979_the_art_of_subverting_expectations/,2020-06-04 15:45:50,2,13,books
