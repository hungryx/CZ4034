7iuemk,Dan Brown faces possible new plagiarism lawsuit over ‘The Da Vinci Code’,,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dan-brown-faces-possible-new-plagiarism-lawsuit-over-the-da-vinci-code-2017-10-18,2017-12-10 15:15:24,1380,14337,books
pnzopm,"Can someone explain to me the general criticism of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code""?","I've read the book multiple times and, while it doesn't stand out to me as anything exceptionally masterful or brilliant, overall it doesn't seem like a bad book.

However, it seems to be a running joke/theme in multiple pieces of media (The Good Place is one that comes to mind) that this book in particular is ""trashy literature"" and poorly written. The Da Vinci Code appears to often find itself the scapegoat for jokes involving ""insert popular but badly written book here"".

I'm not here to defend it with my dying breath, just super curious as to what its flaws are since they seem very obvious to everyone else. What makes this book so ""bad""?

EDIT: the general consensus seems to be that it's less that the book itself is flaming garbage and more that it's average/subpar but somehow managed to gain massive sales and popularity, hence the general disdain for it. I can agree with that sentiment and am thankful that I can rest easy knowing I'm not a god-awful critic, haha. Three different people have recommended Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, so I'll check that out when I have the time. Thank you all for your contributions :)

EDIT 2: I agree with most of these comments about how the book (and most of Dan Brown's work, according to you all) serves its purpose as a page-turner cash grab.

vu77dn,I am reading “The Da Vinci code” and...I actually like it!,"My father had been recommending “The Da Vinci code” for years. I never really cared about it, since I assumed that it wouldn't interest me, but yesterday I decided to start reading it. 

I was aware that what I was going to read is one of the most controversial books around there. I read some reviews about it and when I saw that many people strongly disliked it and found it bad, I was afraid that I would feel the same. Nevertheless, I started it and now that I am halfway through it, I must say that I don't find it bad and I actually like it. 

I admit that the writing is not that special. It's simple and descriptive. However, it doesn't make me feel bored or uninterested (quite the opposite) and I like the descriptions of the buildings or the events. I don't feel connected to the characters and I find them kinda dull at times, but they are not bad either.

On the other hand, the plot, the symbolisms, the riddles and the historical information really intrigues me. This book made me do some research about plenty of the information that it contains and I must admit that I appreciate Dan Brown's research on historical facts and information.

If you disliked this book, it's totally fine.

17gmukm,"Review-""The Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown: A potential Classic?","This was the first mystery/thriller book I've read, and I now have a very high bar for all other books in this category I will be reading in the future.   
  
The story, characters, writing style, and near constant suspense made for a very enjoyable read start to finish. Despite the length of the book, I was pleasantly surprised at how the book kept me hooked and excited throughout the entire story. I thought The characters were well done. Not all had a large amount of depth or backstory, but that wasn't really necessary for many of the characters. When it came to the story itself, and Brown's writing style, I was impressed at how he managed to pull together so many complicated elements and make it into a cohesive story. There really wasn't much that I felt disappointed by or annoyed at, but there were a few things.  
  
The ending wasn't amazing. It was far from a disaster or absolute betrayal of the reader, but it certainly isn't an ending to leave you astonished and in awe over. Towards the end of the novel, there were a few occasions where I didn't fully understand what was going on. There is a possibility that reader error was involved, but that doesn't explain the fact it happened more than once. While that wasn't a huge hindrance to my enjoyment of the book, it was somewhat of annoying bump in the road.   
  
When it comes to the controversy surrounding the book, I don't really want to get into that too much. I can understand apprehensiveness in reading this book for some, but I would encourage those who want to read it anyway to not let the baggage surrounding the book ruin the experience. If you really enjoy mystery/thriller books, this is a must read. If you enjoy history, art, and symbolism, this will probably make for an entertaining read. This book isn't quite perfect, but it is a great book that I think deserves to be recognized as a classic someday. 

For those who have read it, what did you think? How do Dan Brown's other books compare to *The Da Vinci Code*? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17gmukm/reviewthe_da_vinci_code_by_dan_brown_a_potential/,2023-10-26 03:02:53,47,0,books
d04aki,"Why did ""The Da Vinci Code"" become so big?","Around 2003, there was one book before all other books: *The Da Vinci Code* by Dan Brown. It got incredibly popular, while more cultured critics generally disliked it for it's allegedly poor writing, simplistic and somewhat illogical plot and abuse of historic fact, or at least that's how I remember it. But why did it get so popular? I tried Google ([exibit 1](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/apr/20/themysteryofthedavincico), [exibit 2](http://www.religioustolerance.org/davinci6.htm), [exibit 3](https://www.articulatemarketing.com/blog/why-is-the-da-vinci-code-so-popular)) but everything I find basically says the same thing:

* ""It's a thriller!""
* ""It's a page turner!""
* ""It has lots of cliffhangers!""

Call me a cynic, but there must have been other suspense thriller around? *The Da Vince Code* wasn't the first book full of cliffhangers. Now, with the clarity of hindsight, we can maybe approach this issue again. Personally, I don't think books exist in a vacuum: something about the Zeitgeist in 2003 must have influenced the success (otherwise we would still have *Da Vinci* clones around, and we don't). 

Did 9-11 create a longing for thriller and conspiracy, but it had to be delivered as historical to be politically correct? That's my best guess, what's yours?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d04aki/why_did_the_da_vinci_code_become_so_big/,2019-09-05 17:57:23,174,79,books
11utk3c,Happy 20th Anniversary of The Da Vinci Code Pub Date!!,"I was only 4 years old back when it came out, so I don’t remember the hype and controversy about the book and movie. So please feel free to share stories about what you remember from that wild time.

I picked up this book and read it for the first time a month ago. I was immediately sucked into this fun and fast paced quest. Although I don’t think the book is written exceptionally well, wow it is interesting and such a good time. 

As conspiracy theories are so commonplace in society today, it must have been a real treat to see one so completely fleshed out 20 years ago. The past month has led me to do so much more research about the Priory of Sion, the Church, and of course, the holy grail. I think it is so successful because it gets at the one thing that will always make us tick: not knowing a secret. 

Finally, I watched the movie last week. It was pretty funny how terrible the movie was (and how much it deviated from the best part of the book: the plot itself). Wow, what a mess. 

Anyways, these are just some jumbled thoughts about a now 20 year old awesome story. Please share your experiences and thoughts on the book below!

q00wst,Secret messages in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code,"I'm finally getting around to reading The Da Vinci Code and I am noticing some strange things in the text. For instance, on page 95 at the top it says ""The De Lancs Code"" instead of the usual title. Similarly, on page 138 it says ""Das Brilli"" instead of Dan Brown. On the same page, the word ""numbers"" in one of the sentences is in a different font. Lastly, on the corner of the first page of Chapter 33, in the top corner, it says ""SOS"".

Given the the context of the story I'm guessing Dan Brown included a secret code of his own.

hh32az,The Da Vinci Code," If I can draw an image with words, does the correlation = consensus?

I am going to draw something with words. Can you find what I’m drawing?

Consensus is necessary.

Thank you for your consideration,  
For many, this will be silly, as a means to describe common sense. Good, follow along on my journey and please humor me. 🙂  
Before we begin, we need to define the Holy Trinity and create the relationships across schools of though. The three laws that bind us and create structures. Without these three rules, we do not have the base for tangible objects.

That make us move. That forces the point. The three forces of nature that bind us.  
yes no maybe  
identity contradiction debate  
agree disagree consensus  
attract repulse mutual  
inertia F= ma reaction  
circle triangle square  
comply resist protect  
energy temperature entropy  
me you truth.

To draw the image we have to comprehend that if the the argument is made to dismiss the image as just an image, and not the universal rules which bind the individual components, you miss an argument. It is not just a series of interconnected circles. This is a dismissive and very basic understanding of the image. The hope is that by the end of this writing, a visual representation will be met for how a quantum state works, what the perfect structure in nature is and how we can find consensus on universal rules.

This structure and model cannot be argued with. It is the perfect structure in nature and you will help me prove this.  
A response of disbelief has already formed, let’s please try to continue.  
The hopes are that the manifestation of these words will spawn a new debate. A new idea for us all to have as one singular species. A unified means of reason and discussion. For the curious this will create a law of attraction. For the fearful, they will run, and dismiss. For the accepting, this will spawn a new idea to move forward.  
We – as a species – have found a structure in nature that is perfect. We once drew this structure to tell a story. It is a cipher, a code. To unlock the means for a peaceful, sustainable, imperfect society. It requires being humble, honest, and it also is the definition of good faith. Truth.

With this structure, we can begin to create a world bound by laws in nature, not man. (scary)

It requires setting aside pride and feelings of emotions while including them, at the same time.

It represents perfection, a goal, a means of common ground. It is something we may never achieve but attempting to will lead to a higher means of learning and understanding. It is something already being rejected. Something people disagree on world wide and is the core of what is debated. It creates an emotional response where we wouldn’t want one.

It breaks linear arguments of a beginning and end, it’s endless and is often a source of fear, rejection and avoidance, it creates anxiety, fear and is a force of nature we do not understand. It can drive us to sadness, depression and without its understanding, to death. 

It is the singular, universal rule, binding us all.

This argument is created to draw a structure which defines a singular visual representation of common sense. A balanced model in perpetual flux and motion that has no end and no beginning.

It is a much different conversation to draw this from a point of creation and walk out the pattern until it forms a structure than an argument which defines it as a series of interconnected circles.

To define this image as a rule, a fact, something you can’t argue with, you need to have this conversation first so that a consensus can be met, a common means of understanding. You have to explore other influences and not only have an input, but also an output. An interaction, an exchange of perspective. A common ground will need to be formed on rules, which is also why, not considering the each element or component of the structure as the whole, things become unstable and out of balance.

This is also a problem in debate and society where we either accept or reject ideas from cultures dissimilar to ours. This is another rabbit hole to go down in that we will begin to explore the psychological impacts of fear and the fight or flight reaction we have to our surroundings. The emotion behind something can often move mountains. Anger, fear, frustration are forces which drive our state of acceptance or rejection. It’s quite the powerful force.

An example to mind for the sake of discussion, would be if we were to use a positively charged emotion to enter a conversation to explain a concept with the consideration of the consensus, you will be more accepting of the input. Words find balance and meet more ears. If I go too far with optimism, it will feel forced, arrogant and domineering. In contrast, if someone were to address your personal intelligence in a negative way for not being able to comprehend everything explained here in it’s entirety, you would dismiss this. This is because you will assume you are being judged and the person you are talking to has encapsulated who you are into a single word. You have been dismissed and your input has been deemed less important to the conversation. And this is a lot of words to say, don’t call someone stupid in conversation because it’s dismissive. It creates a state where both sides reject information.

In other words, a path for conflict resolution is not to call someone stupid, and not to be over enthusiastic with your delivery. In plain English, wooks need to stop calling people geeks.

Or, Common Sense.

Now that the argument for understanding a common rule is made, or consensus, we can start to look at things in nature which have similarities and start correlating things beyond a single school of thought. Multiple faceted issues will begin to occur where languages and perspectives will all interpret and explain things differently. Everyone will have a different common ground for perspective, so personalizing this adds another vector and force to the equation.

In life, arguments have rules. Rules defined by us and rules bound by the laws of nature. This is a discussion that stems from a lot of schools of thought, and overlapping ideas which begin to create a shape, an object you can see and use as a tool to structure a sustainable paradigm, rather than one that is in flux and at odds with itself.

We begin drawing as a single point, idea, monad. This idea is then met with a nearby single point, or idea. They either attract or reject each other, creating a line until the energy is consumed or another monad is encountered changing it’s path in the only way it can, on an axis as this is the only point hit with an external force. A line goes nowhere without an external force to move it’s direction. Two points exist in a perpetual state until a third force is introduced. As a result, you start to form a circle, on a flat plane. In one dimension. This maintains until you complete your cycle and meet at the opposite side, giving your initial line a new definition of being a radius to a circle. The perpetual motion now moves along the radius, creating a force to move your initial source. This source now moves on an axis to meet a tangent on the inside of your circle. The tangent continues until one argument overcomes the other and one of the points moves off it’s tangent. This continues until a structure is formed. A seed, resembling a flower. It’s one of the oldest and misunderstood images in the world, one our minds haven’t fully developed the capability to comprehend as a whole species in its entirety it’s the source for discovery and destruction.

Some of you will get this instantly, post an image and you will immediately alienate people who think you are wrong. You aren’t wrong. You are now validated. But you also need to read everything here otherwise, you’ve dismissed the point. If you are able to understand instantly what I am talking about, congratulations. You’re illuminated. I ask that you continue the discussion and please hack this apart.

If anything here is incorrect, it’s because I will never claim to be the result. The person writing this is imperfect. In conclusion, I hope this all helps with your argument in a conversation going forward.  
That said, I have the deepest fear I just became an enemy of those who wish to maintain power.  
I’m sorry for what we are about to see.  
Please, don’t hate me. I am at your mercy.  
Someone discussed an apple falling from a tree which spawned from a seed creating a line. Let’s follow that idea. There are stories to be told we haven’t listened to.

3cq305,Mixed feelings about The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown [SPOILERS],"I just finished reading it, and as the post title says - I'm not sure how I feel about it.
I very much liked the writing, the pace of the story, the presentation and flow of the scenes. But I also had some issues with it, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to recommend it because of them.

The first thing is that there were multiple cases where I was able to guess the next ""answer to a clue"" about two pages in advance. Now, I'm not sure what to think of this. Does it mean the storytelling was so good that it led me to the right conclusion before I even read the next page? Or was it just too obvious?
I personally felt a bit cheated in these moments, since the characters are described as masters of their respective fields, and only they have succeeded where so many others have failed... well then how come I can guess the answer before they do? (""Forest for the trees"", maybe?)
I expected these scenes to be big WOW moments. I love it when a story takes such an unexpected turn that the floor drops from under me, yet at the same time that plot twist makes perfect since in retrospect. And this book had too little of these moments, for me at least.

The second thing I didn't like was the ending. The revelation that Teabing was the Teacher completely shattered his character for me. It was just too much of a stretch in my opinion, I just didn't buy it... it felt forced. I may be contradicting myself here (since I did say I wanted to be surprised) but this particular plot twist of ""it was him all along"" is so overused that I expected something more sophisticated and so I didn't see it coming.
Also - that part at the very end where Sophie meets her long lost family - felt too tacky and unrelated to the rest of the book.

I may be just ranting... and again - don't get me wrong - I did enjoy most of the book.
But I was expecting more of it... and got a little disappointed.

Despite keeping this book with me through numerous moves and all of life's rollercoaster, I only ever read the first chapter of it before. Well, until this week.

I was looking up the author right before I read it this month. I discovered that he passed away in October of this year. His viewing was actually on my birthday, which is ironic. But there are no reviews of his book anywhere online! Not Amazon. Not Goodreads. Nothing. I keep thinking he died thinking no one ever read it. So I'm going to write him a new review, just so his family can go there and see that his book did make a difference.

It's not exactly a literary masterpiece though. To be frank, the book itself is... hilariously bad. Clunky dialogue that just monologues for pages, facts about a career field I'm actually in that he did NOT research at all (saying that a psychologist can't be a therapist and therefore lied about their credentials because they're not a psychiatrist, like what?), writing the same thing in the narration that he just wrote in the dialogue. It's like The Room of books, Oh hi Mark! lol... mixed with some Da Vinci Code.

It's got a lot of heart though, stuffed in all 417 pages of it and it's a really fast read for all it's poor writing and a sweet message. And I'm just kind of upset with myself for not reading it sooner and not writing him a review. I almost feel like he wrote the thing just for me, since no one else seems to have read it. Reading it now is an odd experience, but despite its flaws, it's been a quick and strangely touching read. Just making me feel a little guilty, but nostalgic, but yeah... guilty...

190kmil,What's the worst book you've ever read? And why?,"I used to love reading romance novels. They were a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. Then life got in the way. I didn't have a lot of free time and reading wasn't something I prioritized. 
  
Well. When I was finally able to get back into reading, one of the firsts books I read was **Mila Gray**'s *Stay With Me*
  
Here's my review of it (I wasn't on Goodreads when I read it 😅)
  
> I read this in 2019. I can't remember the exact details of why I hated, just that I hated it. Poorly written and extremely cliché. As someone who was in the military, I was looking forward to reading a military centered novel. However I was extremely let down. I've never wanted to puke and simultaneously throw a book out of a window more. Absolutely would not recommend. And no, I didn't DNF it. I finished it in hopes that it would redeem itself but it never did. If I had it in me I would throw this book straight into the trash.
  
Imagine my surprise when I went on Goodreads and saw that it had a 4.2 star rating!! 😱😱😱

It wasn't until recently that I realized that this book ruined the entire romance genre for me. And, honestly, just romance  of any form in any book. 🙃

980pkl,"Finished reading the Da Vinci code, some gripes and questions I have...(spoilers obviously)(I don’t know which flair to add, haven’t posted here in a while)","First off, this book is legendary. I’ve been reading this book until 2 AM the past few days and I think this is the longest book I’ve read in the fastest time, about 3 or 4 days. What is really legendary about this book is that most of the research and stuff in this book is ACCURATE which blows my mind. 

Now the one most unnecessary thing this book added was the ending with Langdon and Sophie. Why did Dan just add a Romance thing at the end for no reason? There was not a single hint throughout the 600 pages that both had an romantic affection for each other, I hate it when books do that just to try to add that “cherry on top”. It doesn’t fit. The main reason I hate this so much was because Langdon clearly stated before he had some other girlfriend or something that he met like about a year ago in Rome I think it was. So did he ditch her? Was it just a one time thing? It’s so weird. If authors are going to try to implement romance in their book, then they should at least develop it through out the book. 

Well, that’s the only gripe I have really, but other than that the book is awesome. And the Epilogue was really really good too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/980pkl/finished_reading_the_da_vinci_code_some_gripes/,2018-08-17 09:01:05,5,0,books

A crystal-gazing, homeopathic self-help book ""The Secret"" scores 3.68.  

""The Da Vinci Code"" scores 3.85.

""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy..."" a critically acclaimed masterpiece rates 4.05 -- merely a fraction of a notch higher on the scale.

I also have very very vague memories from when I was younger about seeing a massive book in school.

m0ygve,"I've seen people say things like ""if you're constantly noticing the prose, that probably means it's bad,"" or ""why pay attention to the writing, just focus on the story,"" and I just COMPLETELY disagree...","A few reasons why I strongly disagree with these kinds of statements (I'm mostly referring to fiction): 

>1. Prose is literally (pun intended hehe) ***part of*** the story. The writing style an author uses is a direct influence on the story they are telling. It contributes to the atmosphere, the character voice, the emotions elicited, the tone, etc. Prose is as much a part of a story as art materials are to an art piece- they are not mutually exclusive. 

Hemingway's stories would not be even close to the same stories if written by a different author, nor Faulkner's, nor Tolkien's, nor Atwood's, nor Kerouac's, nor Austin's, or any thousand others. One of the main reasons these authors are renowned is not just the plot/character, but *the words they used to write them.*

The subject matter of DaVinci's paintings is not separable from his style. The subject matter of Picasso is not separable from his style. I believe the same can be said for many authors. No one would ever say about art: ""Why pay attention to the style, just focus on the content."" 

>2. Noticing prose while reading is not a bad thing, and it certainly does not mean a lack of immersion. It means you're paying attention to the words, to the language. Of course, it you hate the prose and you notice it, then you know the book has a style you don't like. I'm sure we've all tried reading a book with terrible prose and what happens? It turns you off of the story. It doesn't matter how great a plot is, how great a character idea- if the writing doesn't convey the ideas well, then the final product is not great. 

Some of my favorite reading moments are when I notice great prose, when the way an author chooses to say something is so powerful *because of* the language they used to say it, when I pause and re-read a paragraph multiple times over to soak in the writing.

You can tell when an author *really* cared about words and language and constructed their sentences and paragraphs with intention and artistry, and I think it's so wonderful to notice that and appreciate it and consider it part of the storytelling process itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m0ygve/ive_seen_people_say_things_like_if_youre/,2021-03-09 04:13:22,762,4835,books

146mn0g,What happens to authors in the near future when AI is even more powerful than today?,"Some time in the near future... You want something new to read.  You open up your AI Writer app and type in: ""Gory horror novel written in the blended styles of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle / Clive Barker. Male and female protagonists, Victorian London setting, body horror, parasites, criminals, prostitutes, slumming nobility. 100,000 words"" or whatever kind of specifications you want.  

A short time later, you have a complete novel tailor made to your input that reads almost exactly as if written by the author of your choice. 

You can do this with art already.  I can ask for a picture of Mickey Mouse masturbating, done in the style of Leonardo da Vinci and get something that is pretty near accurate to what da Vinci would have painted if he lived in the Disney era and had the inclination to waste his time in such a fashion.

I am sure that AI will be able to produce high-quality fiction very soon, if not already.

5cpcd3,I've read more in the last 6 months than I have done in the last 10 years!,"Got a job in the leather business, and it involves driving halfway up the country (England) delivering leather to customers.

It's a 500 mile round trip every week, and I started listening to podcasts, and have started listening to audiobooks too. So far I've read (listened to):

- All the Harry Potters
- All the Hitchhikers Guides
- Brave new world
- Animal Farm
- 1984
- Fahrenheit 451
- All the Stieg Larsson books
- A whole bunch of other crime thrillers
- Gone Girl
- Girl on the Train
- David Mitchell's Autobiography
- Da Vinci Code
- Currently halfway through Stephen King's IT

Some I've enjoyed more than others, but I find it makes my drive so much more enjoyable, and I am really enjoying just the feel of digesting these books - I know I'm not technically ""reading"" them, but I personally don't think that matters.

Anyways, I'll be following this sub now for my next book recommendations :)

EDIT: Mod said I needed more depth so I've pasted my reply to someone down below about my favourites so far:

Okay so out of the classics, I'd say Fahrenheit 451, but the three dystopias were all pretty close. I dunno, just love the ideas of them. But what I liked about F 451 was its simplicity, and they way Bradbury focused on one guy - you got the message without really knowing that much about the dystopian world they lived in.

I loved Hitchhikers Guide, purely because it was lighthearted sci-fi and I enjoyed hearing Martin Freeman narrate them.

Gone girl is my favourite modern thriller so far. Though the Stieg Larson trilogy is a really close second.

**Now**: Midnight's Children: Salman Rushdie at his best, one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time. *A must read.*

**Next**: The Lost Symbol: Dan Brown's next offering, my copy just arrived yesterday, can't wait!

EDIT: Should probably re-evaluate my ""can't wait"" to ""optimistically anticipating"", I hated Da Vinci Code and all my ""optimism"" for this one is engendered by how much I loved Angels and Demons. I wish they never made movies on either though (Harrison Ford had to be Langdon dammit, it would have completed the trifecta of awesomeness, Solo+Indie+Langdon!)

3cco9k,"I am Carey Nachenberg, author of the new techno-thriller novel The Florentine Deception! AMA!","Hi everyone,

Since most of you probably haven’t heard of me, my name is [Carey Nachenberg](http://careynachenberg.com) and I’m one of the original inventors of Norton Security (and currently one of five chief-engineers at Symantec Corporation). I’m also the author of a geeky new techno-thriller called [The Florentine Deception](http://florentinedeception.com), which is why I’m doing this AMA.  

Here’s the premise behind The Florentine Deception: Computer security geek Alex Fife stumbles upon a clue to a lost diamond while cleaning up an old computer for charity.  Instantly hooked by the prospect of an adventure (and totally bored with his life), Alex embarks on a hunt for the lost treasure. But what starts out as an innocuous pursuit quickly devolves into a nightmare as Alex discovers the true technological nature of the Florentine, and of the adversaries who will do anything to control it. It’s like Da Vinci Code meets CSI: Cyber.

While The Florentine Deception is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, it’s also the basis of a charity campaign I’m driving to help underserved students and veterans. I’ve pledged to donate all of my proceeds from sales of TFD to [five charities]( http://florentinedeception.weebly.com/charities.html), and so far, I’ve donated $4,500US to these charities. But I’d like to donate a lot more, and also have more people read my story.

If you’d like to know more about me, cyber-security, The Florentine Deception, or my charities, feel free to ask me - I’ll be answering questions from 6pm-8pm PDT (9pm-11pm EDT).

Alright everyone - it looks like that's it! I hope you enjoyed my AMA.

vz2ltw,The best page turner I've read....,"Dark Matter by Blake Crouch.

It's been almost 10 years since I read The Da Vinci Code. That was my favourite during that time. I completed it in 2 days ( that was and is a big thing for me). I was so invested in that book that it was all I could think about.

The Dan Brown books made me a reader, a sucker for thriller novels and movies. It was like no other book, then again I did not read that many books during that time.

Years passed, kept on reading and searching thriller novels and movies. Watched all major psychological thriller movies ( watched Memento innumerable times ). Slowly it became only movies and TV, started reading less and less. In no time the reading stopped.

Then Rebecca happened. The Daphne du Maurier novel hit me so hard, it had that aura that I hadn't felt in any other book. It quickly became one of my favorites. And it did one other thing, it got me back to reading.

This was when I started reading fantasy and Sci-fi. Lord of the Rings movies had a big hand in this. Filled my shelf with Fantasy and Sci-fi books. Robin Hobb, NK Jemisin, Patrick Rothfuss and Stephen King were my constant Google searches. Life would have been so fun if it carried on like that.

But life means responsibilities. Completed college, started working, started having ambitions and goals. But somehow my little hobby of reading got lost again. I remember, many years ago I dreamt of owning a library, where many would come, young and old to pick up their favourite.

2 days back, I couldn't imagine myself reading again. Months had passed since my last read. I don't even remember the name of the book. It was then that I found Dark Matter. Such a wonderful book made me realise that it was okay if we stop our favorite things for a while. It will always come back to us. I am sure, although it is hard to read like how I used to, but reading will always be my favourite hobby.

My dear fellow book lovers, I do not express my thoughts so easily, nor I write much, but I am so happy right now after finishing Dark Matter.

Reading is so much fun!

No spoilers ahead, but fairly specific criticism: The Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women, and that pretty much sums it up; every male character is paternally sexist at best and a sexual sociopath at worst. Except of course for the hero (a thinly veiled author self-insertion), who drops every pair of eligible panties in the book in short order.

I love books which evoke a sense of place or expose a facet of a society I'm not familiar with; this just felt like it was trivializing real societal issues by burying them in hundreds of pages of exposition (drawn-out fruitless sub? plot on financial fraud) or utterly sensationalizing them (violence against women).

yoxj7d,"""The Far Arena"" by Richard Ben Sapir","Sometimes when I'm getting into a book, I get the impression that the author inspired another writer I was familiar with. Whatever similarities in subject matter or language, I feel sure that I know one fed the imagination of the other.

With that said, I think Dan Brown (DaVinci Code) owes his entire writing career to Richard Ben Sapir. After getting through The Far Arena, I know for sure that RBS walked so that Dan Brown could jog, and Tom Hanks could cash massive royalty checks. Sometimes life and literature don't seem fair. 

The first three quarters of the book were great. A quick reading of the dust jacket tells all, and the author gets straight down to business. There are 4 characters. 2 of them are good. One of them is ridiculous and implausible, and the last is sort of poorly defined and needlessly offensive. 

What I thought was good about the book, and why I felt the desire to make a post about it, was that it absolutely delivers the goods eventually. 

Whatever genre readers might put this book in, you get plenty of patient character development and definition that leads to many satisfying developments. One review I read described these interactions as ""priceless"", and I feel that is accurate. 

I didn't like the ending. The main character becomes very eloquent, and goes on grandstanding monologues. This is where I think the author gets self-indulgent. He makes the mistake of thinking the audience would identify with his sentiment over highly specific subject matter. It's ridiculous. The end is a joke, and some of the action scenes are so ridiculous and graphic that I get a sort of embarrassed feeling for having read them. 

For all that it's still high quality fiction with good dialogue and pacing. It's like if Michael Crichton was a huge fan of the movie ""Encino Man"", and he wanted to re-write ""Quo Vadis""...",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yoxj7d/the_far_arena_by_richard_ben_sapir/,2022-11-07 19:29:06,2,2,books

1. First four volumes of Harry Potter

2. Hobbit and Lord of the Rings

3. the Catcher in the Rye

4. Catch 22

5. Hitchhikerk's Guide to Galaxy 

6.  Sherlock Holmes canon 

7. Anna Karenina 

8. Foundation Series

9. For Whom the Bell Tolls

10. Cryptonomicon 

Continuing the list, there are also books that I liked immensely (and they are on my all time fav. list)   but I couldn't go through them second time despite trying it more than once. Some of those are

1. The Da Vinci Code

nart98,Most popular non-YA fiction book in the last few decades?,"TLDR: What is the most popular #1 non-YA fiction book in the last 20ish years, whose popularity is not based on a flim/TV adaptation, #2 same question but with regards to crime fiction specifically

&#x200B;

I was recently thinking about how much more popular films are relative to literature and how much more possible it is for a film to become part of popular culture on the level that that happened with Inception, Joker, the new Blade Runner or even less famous films.

Seems to me the only books that achieve anything like that level of popularity and cultural presence is YA and maybe Harry Potter exclusively. The second biggest YA franchise I can think of is Hunger Games, but no one really talks about those books/films any more.

That got me wondering about two questions:

\#1 in the last 10-20 years, what is the non-YA book (fiction) that has achieved the greatest level of popularity and presence in popular culture (regardless of genre)

I stress popular culture, rather than among the literati or culture vultures more broadly.

\#2 what piece of crime fiction specifically has achieved the greatest level of pop culture presence in the last 10-20 years?

EDIT: I should say, I mean here books that achieved such a level of popularity on their own, without being adapted into a film, but including books which, once they DID achieve that level of popularity on their own, were adapted into a film. So, in other words, they had to have gotten that popular before they were adapted into a film, not BECAUSE they were made into a popular film.

EDIT #2: My answers

On question #1, my guess would be Fifty Shades of Grey, but to me that kind of feels like a specialty case. I was thinking more along the lines of something that fits in the traditional literary genres (crime, thriller, fantasy, literary fiction etc.). And with that modifier, I would say maybe The Da Vinci Code?

Someone suggested Game of Thrones, but I think GOT only became known to the wider public as a result of the adaptation.

On question #2, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo may be the answer here, although I don't know how much its popularity was generated by the initial Swedish film, which, I THINK, was a bit of a hit (I may be wrong there).

132sgj8,"Anyone else severely disappointed with ""who cooked the last dinner""?","I started reading the book and it seems the author just seems to pull 'facts' out of her butt that are easily falsifiable on Google (eg the claim that only humans mate in missionary position because women changed their morphology. Google shows many species, including bonobos some of our closer relatives doing the same.) or just obviously stupid statements like ""the first women learned to convert primate heat into menstruation"". I guarantee you if women could choose,by learning, to be fertile once every couple of years or once a month, huge amounts would be switching back to the former. 


I feel like I can not trust anything in this book... Particularly also because a lot of the text is how ""early women surely must have"" (so just stuff she's making up as she goes) and assumptions such as babies in the stone ages having the same mental development path as babies today.

She also likes to contradict herself, claiming women did it all on their own because everybody worked and nobody stayed back at the hearth to support with child rearing and then 10 pages later going on an elogy about how there's proof a man with no feet survived multiple years, clearly showing that there was a sense of community and support in the family back then. Why doesn't it occur to her that the guy (and others like him) might've watched the kids?

weaa3g,How much derivativeness is too much? Reading the Empire of the Vampire [Partial Spoilers],"I have been reading Empire of the Vampire.  I'm only about 2/3 through so I'd like to avoid spoilers in the replies if possible.  But this book has made me ask myself at what point it is no longer an homage and becomes too derivative.  

I had a friend in college that used to insist that there are only 7 stories, and that each work of fiction we read is a combination and modification of these 7 basic stories (and no, I don't remember the breakdown of the seven).  

I understand that being truly original is very difficult.  And that utilizing things that you found compelling from other books is fair, especially if you make it your own.  

Let me start with the structure of the book.  I won't tag these as spoilers because they are really just the story structure and become clear within the first page or two of the text.  

It is essentially ""Interview With a Vampire"", except the vampire hunter is telling his story to a vampire under duress.  

Second, the story centers on the ""silver saints"" who are superhuman monster hunters who roam the countryside defeating fey horrors and undead monsters using their silvered swords and a variety of traps and bombs they concoct using chemistry.  They are basically witchers, but with a different take on the source of their powers.  I know this is probably the loosest connection as the monster hunter trope is far larger than just witchers.  

Then we get the story, and the start of the spoilers.  There is a twist DIRECTLY taken from another major work.  

>!In the book, there is a character named Dior who is the last descendant of their Jesus analogue.  Dior has descended from a secret, heretical bloodline because it turns out that the redeemer actually sired children which the church denied as heresy.  This will all feel VERY familiar if you've read The DaVinci Code by noted wordsmith Dan Brown.!<

I was already struggling with this a little.  Their religion is not christianity exactly, but it is HEAVILY coded as christianity.  And the twist is adopted basically verbatim.  

Then I was reading last night.  I got up to a scene with the group's priest, Father Rafa.  >!There is a scene where he uses his holy faith to stand down an ancient and powerful vampire, holding out his holy symbol, which shines out brilliantly against the darkness. !<

I scoffed in disbelief when >!the vampire challenges him to put down his holy symbol, which he is using as a crutch for his faith.  He refuses to trust in his faith alone, relying on the symbol itself, and the symbol slowly fades.  The main character notes his belief that if the priest had relied on his faith alone and tossed away his holy symbol as a crutch he would have prevailed.  This is shot for shot the culmination of Stephen King's Salem's Lot, which was also mentioned in the Dark Tower.!<

At this point I wonder how much of the book is taken from other places and other books I haven't read.  

If you haven't read these other works, of course, it seems clever and new and brilliant.

I'll be honest, when I read the Salem's Lot scene I had to put the book down for a minute.  It just seemed really brazen.  

I'm NOT normally the type to get annoyed about supposed plagiarism of ideas.   For example, even some  supposedly egregious examples never bothered me.  Eragon, which is supposedly just a rehashing of Star Wars didn't bother me.  Sword of Truth didn't feel like a theft of WoT to me (although in retrospect SoT bothers me for a whole host of other reasons).  

I suppose my conclusion is that it becomes a problem if reading something immediately calls to mind another work, specifically the culmination of a book. It is one thing to say Lan is an Aragorn type.  But if there was an army of the dead that owed a duty of allegiance to a long lost line of kings that wind up saving the day and fulfilling their oath betrayed in life, that would be immediately problematic form me, even if it was dressed up a little.  

I think there is a huge difference between adopting elements of a story and taking the twist or culmination of a story.  And I think that doing so multiple times in a book is noticeable and frustrating.

fjtu5t,"Are you so flabbergasted you never heard of half the ""Bestselling Books of all time""?","I was just looking at Wikipedia's list of ""Bestselling books of all Time"" on Wikipedia. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books

I am truly beyond speechless. With the exception of The Lord of the Rings (and its prequel the Hobbit), Gone With the Wind, famous works of classic American and British literature such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and A Tale of Two Cities, recent mega bestsellers such as The Da Vinci Code and Twilight, and many books with more famous movie adaptations such as Jaws and To Kill a Mocking Bird, less than half of the books I listed I NEVER HEARD OFF BEFORE.

And this includes at least 75% of the things originally published in English on the list. Not once have I ever knew of the existence of The Eagle Has Landed or Kane and Abel before I glanced the list.

And I am by today's standards a well-read person (esp. when you consider I am neither an intellectual nor well-educated and I actually HATE READING). I have on my Goodreads account over 100 Books in my Read List, including classics such as Gone With the Wind and the Red Badge of Courage. I even read that long doorstopper The Lord of the Rings (now my favorite book of all time <3).

But to realize I don't even know most of the Bestselling works of all time in English was alreadya shock to me. Nevermind all the foreign works. It just truly shocked me beyond words that the bestselling French book of all time is a children's book called Little Prince and its not any of Dumas' classics or Victor Hugo's works or any other French novel that has gained fame to a limited extent in English circles such as Larteguay's Les Centurions. A CHILDREN'S STORY! And France is so famed and appreciated all over the world for its sophisticated classics...........

Even what left me further more speechless was the fact this French children's book is listed as the 3RD BESTSELLING BOOK OF ALL TIME after A Tale of Two Cities and The Lord of the Rings!

The only foreign-language work of literature on the list I have heard of are War and Peace and Don Quixote. All other listed foreign works to my shock are not books that are frequently stated by Americans as classic masterpieces of literature or with an even more famous American movie adaptation such as The Count of Monte Cristo or Doctor Zhivago or Les Miserables and so forth.

Is anyone here who reads more the general populace shocked as I am that we never heard of even half of the listed English-language bestsellers of all time on Wikipedia's list?

This is just Wikipedia's own list. Nevermind lists by organizations devoted to literature, by popular news magazines and newspapers such as The New York Times, or by professional scholars of literature (which have even more works I could never have hoped of discovering without further research inspired by Wikipedia).............",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjtu5t/are_you_so_flabbergasted_you_never_heard_of_half/,2020-03-16 22:30:51,24,0,books

16qp7fm,"If you could go back to the beginning of your career and give yourself one book to read, which one do you think would make the biggest difference?","For me, it would be “4 Steps to the Epiphany”, by Steve Blank. 

I’ve been doing startups for over a decade. Before that, consulting, education, and then more startups. It took a long time, but I feel like I had to learn many of the lessons from that book before reading it, and then upon reading it, it gave context and a framework for everything I had learned.

b6lr13,Books/series where you prefer a sequel to the original,"I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure that **in general** people tend to think the first books in series are the best, just like with movies (this is definitely the consensus on, say Dune or Jurassic Park). That said, what are some books where you prefer the sequel or a subsequent book to the original. What makes the difference for you? Do you think the quality of writing improved, or is it just some story element?

It's a fairly unpopular opinion, but *All the Pretty Horses* is my least favorite of Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy. The prose is fantastic in it to be sure, but it largely comes down to the fact that I never connected much with John Grady Cole, the protagonist of *AtPH*. With *The Crossing*, I think the first section, up through Billy's first return from Mexico, is as good as fiction gets, plus I like Billy Parham much more than JGC. That's even allowing for the fact that at least one of the ""wandering prophet"" encounters in *The Crossing* is an absolutely tedious time-sink that has no equivalent in *AtPH*. With *Cities of the Plain*, I think it once again benefits for me from having JGC split the spotlight with Billy (though we definitely get more JGC), and I liked the book's portrayal of the last aspects of the cowboy way of life being rubbed out by modernity more than I did in *AtPH*. I think giving them a base of operations for it, and other characters to interact with, was largely responsible for that.

&#x200B;

Looking at graphic novels, I love both of the initial two *League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* volumes, but it's really no contest - it's all about Vol. 2 for me. It's got the ""assembling the group"" aspect out of the way and so gets to really dig into the characters and get weird. The incorporation of a Victorian *War of the Worlds* angle, as well as the way it works in *The Island of Dr. Moreau*, works better than you'd ever imagine it could...and good lord, Mr. Hyde becomes an all-time great in it - he's uncomfortably hilarious, brutal & scary as Hell, and just dripping with pathos. Vol. 1 is a great stand-alone, but ever since I read Vol. 2 I've had a hard time thinking of it as anything more than a brilliant piece of set-up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b6lr13/booksseries_where_you_prefer_a_sequel_to_the/,2019-03-28 17:34:15,44,11,books
ao695q,Breaking down renowned literary maestro Dan Brown - the greatest one trick pony in writing?,"Beloved author Dan Brown has achieved a level of stupendous, globe spanning success through the bewildering commercial triumph of his genre busting novels beloved by millions worldwide. His stupdenifying levels of commercial success has befuddled critics of fine literature worldwide, as they contort themselves in absurd ways to explain how a man with such pedestrian command of prose can enshrine himself - at least in the eyes of the common man, alongside true literary greats.

Ok, let me snap out of it. I can't really nail down Dan Brown's prose. But I have read all of his books, so let me try to explain how an author that critics nearly universally dislike has been able to sell such a mega crap load of books and achieve such rediculous levels of success.

I personally consider Dan Brown to be a one trick pony. He's not a one hit wonder, as he has been able to make the best sellers list over and over again. But on the other hand, Dan Brown has never been able to really write in a variety of different genres or styles.

Let's start by examining his prose. Writing instructors worldwide denounce his mixed usage of literary devices. Dan likes to pile on the metaphors, mixing in smilies, as he crushes them together in sentences that span half a paragraph. Brown also likes to open sentences with adjectives, and he doesn't particularly believe in economy of language, preferring to repeat phrases like ""Navy Admiral"" (critics will ask, is there any other kind of admiral?). If there is one thing that one cannot criticize Brown for though, is his mastery of vocabulary, as he routinely pulls out adjectives common enough to be understood by the typical reader, but used just infrequently enough to seem exotic.

Although his prose is commonly criticized, one can hardly doubt the effectiveness of his writing. What it does achieve however, is immersion. Dan Brown's writing is probably what most people would imagine an erudite symbology professor's to be like. Hardly surprising of course, considering that Langdon is commonly accused of being a Mary Sue.

To an inexperienced reader who does not regularly enjoy works of literary fiction, Brown's peculiar and much mocked writing style might even seem smart. Although it isn't necessarily well written, it may seem well written. Combined with the subject matter of his novels, the reader is likely to think that they are enjoying sophisticated pieces of literature.

When you open his book, the first thing you will see is an instance that all the locations, pieces of art, and organizations are real. However, Brown seems to be allergic to fact checking, as his novels are riddled with mistakes from the major (the organization at the heart of the Da Vinci code is a hoax) to the minor but jarring (referring to the Rio grande as a notable old world river). Brown takes the same attitude towards factual accuracy as screenwriters who write movies ""based on a true story"". But it is undeniable that he plies the facts to create a quality thriller.

Either way though, Brown references a greatest hits list of classical artists and writers. Now if you examine his references closely, he uses a very Jepordy like approach - never focus on topics too obscure for the average audience member. You want that A-ha moment, like ""ahh, Raphael! I've heard of him!"".

Becuase of his references and prose, I have to slightly ashamedly admit that for years, I thought of Dan Brown as a sophisticated writer of high literature, when I was a kid, I'd name drop him in a misguided attempt to assert my non-existant intellectual superiority over my peers and to impress adults. 

The reason why I consider Brown to be a one trick pony is because once you distill down the structure and style of his stories, it seems like Brown only follows one general template.

The villains in Dan Brown novels always slavishly follows some sort of seemingly esoteric symbolism in their villainy (aside: why is Bond villain a thing but not Langdon villain?) There is almost always an M Night Shyamalan style twist three quarters of the way though. And finally near the climax Langdon always achieves certain physical feats that are highly unlikely for a 50ish professor, but is often transparently foreshadowing. 

None of his successful books have deviated significantly from this one template. The only thing he really changes is the secret organization he uses in the novel and the list of Renaissance artists he references. 

This is why as a writer, I relegate Dan Brown to the one trick pony category. Unlike say, Tom Clancy, Dan Brown has never been able to display much range in his works. 

This is not to say that I am desparaging him. He might be a one trick pony, but damnit is Dan Brown a master of the one trick. If you really immerse yourself, you do have a hard time putting his books down.

irza4y,The thing that I hated about the fantasy genre is now the thing I loved the most,"I started reading books 4 years ago, I was 16 back then. The book that made me a reader was The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. I enjoyed it a lot, thus I read all of his books and read other thriller novels. I stayed in the genre for a while and decided to explore  another one.

I was in a bookstore trying to pick another book. I stumbled upon J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit'. I thought back then fantasy will be the next genre I will dive in to. I managed to finish it and continued to the whole 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. What can I say, I did NOT enjoy it. How did I manage to finish all of them despite not enjoying them? It's the hope that I will truly love it since lots of people enjoy it. ""It was just 4 books, I can manage"", I told myself. I read the last word of the 'Return of the King', I did not have the love that I thought I was going to give the books.

So why did I hate it? It is simple, it is all about the world building, the culture, legends and the myths. The books referenced them all through out the series. It was very hard to appreciate since you need to do a lot of reading to the indexes of the books. Since I was just beginning the habit of reading books, I did not have the energy to do that. It was literally about a whole another world with its' own history. That felt a drag for me.

After finishing them, I told myself I'm not gonna pick another High Fantasy books in a long time.  Although I read some with some fantasy elements in them like Percy Jackson but they did not have a huge world building like LOTR.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 years. I visited a bookstore and saw 'A Game of Thrones' by George R.R. Martin in a shelf. I picked it but put it down back because I remembered all my experience with LOTR. Few weeks after that, I was going home from school, and while I was in the jeepney (this is a public vehicle commonly used in the Philippines for commuting) there was something in my head that told me 'You got to buy that A Game of Thrones Book'. And the next thing I knew I was checking it out in the cashier. I went home and... stacked it together with all my 'To Be Read' books (I know I'm not the only one who had this experience). But it did not take long before I read it, after I finished my current read I picked up AGOT. And boy, I loved it! I love how the book was written. It followed different characters and you know that even how separated these characters are, everything is intertwined.

Unfortunately, I could not really give it a fast read because I'm in college and I only have little time for leisure. But  tried my best to read it. I enjoyed it a lot and bought the rest of the series one by one. There is a lot of world building going on the series but I ignored it. Remember that was the thing I hated about LOTR. I was so in love with the plot lines, characters and mystery. The time came when I reached ASOS (3rd book) and by the time I finished it, I could really say, I was never been happier in my life. The 4th and 5th books were a bit of a drag because they were all buildup. Aftermath of the the first 3 books. But I still loved them.

I finished book 5. Hungry for more. But unfortunately, I think it will take a little more time. So to kind of satisfy my hunger, I joined different social media groups pertaining  to ASOIAF. I went there thinking I can catch up with them. But boy I was wrong. Every single threads are full of things that were not explicitly told in the books. The posts and comments are full of things about the legends and the myths of the series. Therefore, to catch up with them, I finally read through the history of Westeros. AND I WAS SO ASTONISHED! As I read more of the series's backstory I keep loving it more. Maybe my love for it is bigger than the gap of the publication date of the 5th and 6th book. I had more appreciation to ""minor"" characters while I learned their background. Even now, in my spare time, I still visit forums and read more about the lore.

Nowadays, ASOIAF series really gave me a fantasy hangover, thus i picked a finished fantasy series, and I'm currently in the second book of  Robert Jordan's  'A Wheel of Time'. I'm also loving it! but now as I progressed through the story, i check the glossary to learn about strange things being mentioned in the book.

I guess I really missed the point of the High Fantasy genre.

That is all!

P.S.

To all people waiting for ASOIAF #6, let's be strong and keep on waiting!  
To all people, have a nice life and let's survive this world !

I was suggested by a friend to read the book, “The picture of Dorian Gray”, it seems like an old classic and I’m unsure which one I’m looking for. 
I see many covers for the book ranging from
just text and a vintage portrait of a man, da vinci style, to portrait of a man wearing a normal suit as if the book was published this year.

I’m looking for the original publication of the book with no alterations, assuming it is the best publication of it, I don’t want to feel the book has been altered from a person of this age, I want the authentic writing and feel to it.

Am I doing this right? Anyway, I’d be more than happy to take more suggestions for books! So far I’ve been suggested to read “Three Comrades” but that’s about it.

I’m more interested in novel in older eras, I’m not particularly interested in harry potter-ish books and books that emphasizes too much on the romance and drama.

1pskwi,"Why twerking, cat videos and self-publication will save the world","I am an Australian journalist and author. Since my novel ‘Impossible the Next’ is self-published, it is hard to get mainstream publications to review it. I respect their policies, but as somebody who was against twerking before he was for it, against youtube cat videos until he'd seen them - I just reckon the world would be better if we all gave new things a chance.

To not read self-published work is unambitious. A lot of the best things in the world are self-published. On the intellectual end of the spectrum, Martin Luther's statement kicking the Protestant Reformation off was self-publishing. On the trashy end, anyone who twerks like nobody is watching is also self-publishing.

Publishers are supposed to be a good guide to what is worth reading. I just don't think they do a good job - that's why we're all on Reddit, we'd rather read stuff other people wrote, unfiltered, and decide for ourselves.

Publishers are too time poor to judge the merit of works submitted. Publishers had it hard enough when they were only competing with movies. Now they also have to contend with Youtube cat videos – a fluffy but formidable opponent when it comes to winning hearts and minds. Their revenues have suffered. Many have gone under. The result is that many good books are published, but many are not. 

Another reason that publishers aren’t a very good guarantee of quality is that literary and intellectual merit cannot be determined by how many people pay money for something. The 'Da Vinci Code' was fun, but it wasn't the best book ever written. Books that contain no boy wizards, BDSM or sexy vampires have a pretty tough time of it. Sometimes you just have to take a chance and read something even if only because the person who wrote it thinks its interesting.

Of course there’s a lot of crap out there. The thing is, though, that very poor writing tends to immediately identify itself. Devoting small amounts of time to check something out is worth it, because you can always reject it quickly if needs be. If it is not immediately obvious that something is bad writing, perhaps it isn’t. That’s one of the little joys about life – discovering you are wrong, discovering there is more to someone or something than meets the eye. Don’t judge a book by its cover, you might say.

Around the world publishers are collapsing, attention spans are shortening, user generated content (however bad) captures more of peoples’ attention. But amongst all the dreadful self-published dross you find something well written and intellectually exciting. That's the beauty of Reddit. You draw it to peoples’ attention causing them to read, feel and experience something they otherwise wouldn’t.

Boundaries and rules save time and effort, but they stop you experiencing the new and different. That's why I twerked, that's why I lolled at lolcats, that's why I self-published.

57cgri,Just finished The Bestseller Code,"
I just finished reading *The Bestseller Code* by Jodie Archer and Matthew L. Jockers. It's a short, interesting book, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic of ""distant reading"" or the large-scale analysis of books (although I have a stronger recommendation for [Jockers' *Macroanalysis*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/an-impossible-number-of-books)). I might recommend it (a little less strongly) to anyone who is interested in what makes a bestseller---that's purportedly what it's about and its discussion is enlightening, but I'm not sure that is a really useful topic. Certainly, it's conflictiferous.

What they've done here is to take 5000 self- and traditionally published books, including 500 ""bestsellers"" from the New York Times lists, run them through text mining algorithms to get 2800 ""features"", and then use machine learning techniques to build a model which can predict whether a book will be a bestseller and (more importantly) indicate which features matter and how much. The features in question are characteristics of each book, from how often the author uses ""the"" and ""a"" to analyzing the dependencies between words in each sentence to identify what characters do.

The four most important groups of features they describe are topics, plot, style, and characters; none of this is especially surprising.

For example, in the chapter on topics, they write that bestsellers typically have 30% or so of the space in the book dedicated to one or two major topics, while non-bestsellers have more topics each occupying less space. The more likely topics for bestsellers are universal and realistic, and the best, most common, topic is human closeness and connections.

The chapter on plot is related to Jockers' work that appeared in the blogosphere a couple of years ago, on graphing sentiment analysis through the text. The key to bestsellers here is the presence of a strong rhythm of moments of conflict and resolution---the canonical work is *The Da Vinci Code*.

In terms of style, they identify two basic categories: the traditional literary style, and a style used primarily by writers with backgrounds in journalism and advertising: colloquial language, short sentences, and snappy prose.

Character, once again, is not a surprise. Characters should be active, they should have agency, they *need* and *want* things rather than *wishing* for things. Oh, and they *say* statements and *ask* questions instead of muttering or declaiming or whatever else can be found in the local thesaurus.

Archer and Jockers spend a fair amount of words on *Fifty Shades of Grey*, which their model predicted as a bestseller. One thing they point out is that sex, according to their analysis, is a relatively small part of the novel, and human connections a large part. Further, they point out, it has a very strong rhythmic beat in their plot analysis. Finally, they write,

> *Fifty Shades of Grey*, more than many other books, is one of those that really demands we ask and be honest about the different reasons people read fiction...The rave reviews of *Fifty Shades* made a case for serious consideration of the emotional and visceral responses to literature. The readers kept repeating that the novel emotionally triggered them, viscerally triggered them, physically triggered them. They insisted that the pleasure of reading is not necessarily just about providing pleasure to the mind, but to the heart, the emotions, the body, and---for those who believe in these things---the soul. 

They then drag in Maria Susanna Cummins' 1855 bestseller, *The Lamplighter*, which was disliked by Nathaniel Hawthorne (and which in turn perplexed him) and parodied in *Ulysses*. Emotional responses by readers, particularly to the rhythm of conflicts and resolutions are important to bestsellerosity.

The other books they spend major time with are the ""Girls"": *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,* *Gone Girl,* and *Girl on a Train*. They note that these three books do the right things: they have active characters and heavily involve the topic of human connections. They also have similar, bleak plots, which means something.

Now, the bad part. There are three questions I want to learn more about: First, what are the bestsellers that the model didn't predict, and why are they bestsellers? Second, what are the non-bestsellers that the model predicted should be? Finally, what is with James Patterson? He doesn't write many (most? all?) of the books with his name on them, which doesn't seem to matter in the analysis they present. Why not? There are, scattered around *The Bestseller Code,* partial discussions of these questions, but no real details.

orexln,"""The Sultan of Monte Cristo"" (by Holy Ghost Writer) 2013. Alleged sequel to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" [SPOILERS]","This is the funniest Monte Cristo-related thing ever! When viewed as a parody/satire, it works! The author ""Holy Ghost Writer"" has created a sequel, and it's pretty loopy and a fun read...at least the first half is. The Count and his new wife, Haydee are headed to Albania, when they somehow get sidetracked in capturing a notorious pirate, Medusalocks (""Captain Dread"" already taken by the ""Monkey Island"" video game?) and Haydee admits to being a secret Muslim all along (What? As if he never noticed, especially during Ramadan?) The Count immediately converts to Islam, as he had a convenient shipboard imam with them (? For Ali, right?).

In the meantime, Mercedes discovers a long-lost letter from Dantes' father, revealing his secret origins. In true DaVinci-Code fashion, >!the letter says that Edmond Dantes is a descendant of Mary Magdelene and the Merovingian dynasty(!)!<. Mercedes, her love for Edmond reawoken, stops her all-day praying and weeping and gets her mojo back. She grows hemp, and sees a huge business opportunity in hemp-based lotions, soap, milk and cheese. (That's funny- where did all this entrepreneurial spirit come from? She had NONE in the original book!) She visits the Morrels (in Paris) to start a business partnership with them. And to relay a message to the Count (Please see me! Important letter from your Dad!).

The Count, after reconciling the Bible and the Koran, decides to return to Paris to forgive Villefort. Villefort is staying at the new ""Monte Cristo Insane Asylum at Auteuil"". The Count (in a new disguise) gives Villefort medication to heal his mind, and recommends the excellent biography, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"" (lol) that will explain everything. Oh, and Madame Danglars will be around soon to help. He also informs Villefort that Valentine is alive, and he will arrange a meeting with her.

Countess G throws a huge ball, and the Count and Mercedes attend. Now that he's a Muslim, the Count can have more than one wife, so he asks Mercedes to marry him, with Haydee's pre-approval. She agrees, on the condition that she gets an exclusive monopoly on hemp in Albania because, after all, she needs financial security, right?

The book switches gears and heads off to somewhere in Arabia, where a spunky Bedouin girl named Raymee informs her father Abram that she refuses a marriage to the Caliph of Mecca... a marriage contract assisted by an ugly merchant named... Danglars.

When Danglars and the Caliph's advisor Dr. Omar arrive at the family's oasis, Raymee's outspokenness and surprisingly modern views embarrass the men. Abram accepts gifts from Danglars, including, you guessed it... a copy of the famous book, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"". She scampers off, hides and listens in while the men discuss the terms of marriage contract- she's being engaged against her will! Abram agrees to a reverse-dowry... somehow the Caliph is supposed to *pay him*!!!

A servant announces that Sultan Sinbad of Albania (the Count) is spotted heading for Mecca, and they be passing by. Sultan Sinbad stops at the oasis and enjoys Abram's hospitality. He's also quite taken with Raymee. The next morning, Abram, Raymee, her cousin Mumad accompany Sultan Sinbad and his caravan to Mecca, with a stop at Shechem (as the Count's inner voice told him to do).

The caravan is attacked by bandits, and with a combination of bluffing and a poison dart, the bandit leader is killed and the bandits run off. >!Abram throws a big celebration feast and Raymee seduces Sultan Sinbad later at night. Her true intent is revealed... she wants to conceive a son who'll become the ruler of Arabia, being that the Caliph has only daughters!!<

>!The rest of the trip to Mecca goes without a hitch. Raymee tricks Mumad into agreeing to make an unknown sacrifice for her. The entourage (with Raymee) performs ""Hamlet"" for the Caliph. The Caliph is totally captivated, and Raymee negotiates her own bride price on her own terms, which he agrees to. With the deal concluded, she announces that Mumad will become her personal eunuch... the operation to be performed right there- onstage(!!!) Dr. Omar whispers to the Caliph, doubting her virginity, and for that, Dr. Omar is condemned to the same fate- Raymee's second personal eunuch.!<

>!Sultan Sinbad is shocked by the proceedings. During the marriage feast, he asks her about it and she explains that she had learned lessons from reading his biography... she would not let Mumad become her ""Fernand"". She's become cold and calculating and wants power through fear to control the people under her. !<Sultan Sinbad warns her of the lesson that he had personally learned- that revenge will backfire on her someday.

The End.

Now obviously, a lot of things are unresolved. what about Haydee and Mercedes? What about the hemp partnership with the Morrels? What about Villefort? Does he regain his senses and embrace Valentine again? Will any of them help save Benedetto? How's the hemp biz in Albania doing? This is not the last of the Monte Cristo books by ""Holy Ghost Writer""... there's more for sale at you-know-where's Kindle store... ""One must make a living"", as Bertuccio says.

I enjoyed the first half WAY more than the second. I was doubled-over laughing during Part 1. The tone completely changed in Part 2. ""Where is this leading... how does the Count come into this?"" I wondered. He does come in and he is played for a dupe. >!But, I guess the son that he had conceived with Raymee will go on the become a powerful ruler- a scion of 2 major houses- the house of the Magdelene/Merovingians and the House of Ishmael.!<

I'll give this a generous 3 stars for the first half, the laughs and the sheer entertainment value. The second half gets an eye-roll.

And, BTW, who is that ugly old man on the cover? Surely it's not the Count, who should be in his early 40s? Is it a statue of a Saint in Paris? Is that Abram, the father of Raymee? Or is it a random piece of clip-art to fill the need to have cover art of any kind?

sdg608,What makes a good story? My take on A Swim in a Pond in the Rain by George Saunders.,"I have found this book by a complete accident on Twitter and *it is beautiful*. So I wrote a summary that might also help you deciding if this book is worth your time!

Saunders, a professor of creative writing, definitely practices what he preaches and invites us to the backstage. I invite you to think about one of your hobbies. Got it? 

Now imagine a world class expert showing you all the little tricks that are hard to see. Imagine a master revealing the tricks of the trade and allowing you to disagree. Imagine a passionate teacher that gives you everything. How does it feel?

These seven short stories and a commentary will improve your understanding of storytelling; not only will you read books, articles, blog posts or watch the movies differently, but you will also start to think about your own writing in a different way.

Revision, precision and years of f\*cking hard work. This is what it takes. Ok, let me calm down. What else do we need?

### 1. Good story = escalation + pattern + causality

My interpretation in a nutshell: *A good story has well developed patterns, an intelligent causality and is always escalating.*

If you’d set out to visualise this, you take Freytag’s pyramid as a base, ok, and then you show everyone you are no good in drawing by adding patterns and causality.

#### ""Always be escalating.""

Besides reading Russian classics we also learned about escalation in primary school in Slovenia. Nothing new, is it? We all know it from page turners like Da Vinci Code and all the Netflix binge material. 

>That's all a story is, really: a continual system of escalation. A swath of prose earns its place in the story to the extent that it contributes to our sense that the story is (still) escalating.

The difference is in what way the escalation hits us; on the surface, or does it move us deeply? Similar to, hmm, wine: one hits different to another. 

#### ""Every story is a pattern story.""

A story is a conversation between the writer and the reader. Should the writer annoy the reader, well, she will stop reading. 

Good stories establish a pattern and *""we expect it to recur. When it does recur, slightly altered, we take pleasure in this and infer meaning from the alteration.""*

Remember the last time you expected something to happen, and it in fact happened, but was slightly different than expected? I bet you felt good! In that movie, remember, you anticipated XYZ, so smart of you, it happened, but differently. Maybe you said ‘wow,’ touched his hand, gasped loudly or even cried? You kept it for yourself, because you are more of an introvert? Also fine! Bottom line: it made you feel. 

Good, we now have patterns and escalation, and to win a Booker Prize (or at least your reader’s heart) you will need something amazing: causality. 

#### Causality is what makes a masterpiece

You enter a room full of dominos, set in a long line. You push the first one, they collapse one after another, smooth as f. 

“Beautiful as long as it lasted!” 

You look ahead. There is another door; dominos again. (What will happen in this room? I know you know!) You push the first one and soon after the chain stops. Again and again. 

“There must have been a retard at work here,” you think before you see another door… ok, enough.

Obviously *""the problem is not in making things happen but in making one thing seem to cause the next.""* This is harder than dominos and requires a lot of hard work and probably talent?

>Causality is to the writer what melody is to the songwriter: a superpower that the audience feels as the crux of the matter; the thing the audience actually shows up for; the hardest thing to do; that which distinguishes the competent practitioner from the extraordinary one.

### 2. A good story is a black box with perfect interior and an Answer

A story puts you in a big black box with a door. You will leave a good one changed, because what happens in there is *“thrilling and non-trivial.”* Everything in this box, each object, everything you take in your hands makes sense and is there for a reason. Every time you enter you discover and see things anew.

If I paraphrase Cornfeld (ibid.); in a good movie you will notice that every scene does two things: 

1. it is entertaining in its own way and
2. it advances the story in a non-trivial way.

Writer is like an architect and interior designer; he/she first sets the structure, and then designs the interior. For “The Darling” Chekhov defines the black box: 

>Once upon a time there was a woman who became whatever she loved.

He then looks inside and becomes an interior designer:

>Really? How about we test that supposition? Hmm. How to do that? Oh, I know: kill off her first love and present her with a second.

Reader will ask a question (what will happen with her second love?) and the story will answer. The structure (elements in the black box) will be specific and meaningful. Some stories will be revised a thousand times or the master will make it happen immediately, but only because he built hundreds of black boxes in decades (“Aljosha the pot” by Tolstoy).

### 3. Accept your voice and make it louder and louder

Saunders explains how he aspired to write like Hemingway, but after some time accepted that at most, he can only become a hemingwayish side-kick. He accepted he is George and hoped for the best:

>This is a big moment for any artist (this moment of combined triumph and disappointment), when we have to decide whether to accept a work of art that we have to admit we weren't in control of as we made it and of which we're not entirely sure we approve. It is less, less than we wanted it to be, and yet it's more, too–it's small and a bit pathetic, judged against the work of the great masters, but there it is, all ours. 

Let’s have a look. Say you need to rewrite this opening to a story:

>The sun fell into Ann's window with a force that, lying in bed, she keenly felt on her wrist as she went to answer the phone. It was so early. Who could be calling so early? Outside there was a truck or bus going by.

How would you open? Saunders goes:

>Jesus. Who could be calling so early?

This is his voice and I find it beautiful. Short and it makes me want to see the next sentence. But, please, it is not *the right way*, it is the right way for Saunders’ voice. Finding your voice is hard. You need to listen carefully and encourage it to grow louder and louder.

### My personal experience / How did it change me?

This was a powerful; I already re-read a couple of the stories. I am not gonna lie, I did not like all of them first time. What helped me appreciate them more was when Saunders took me backstage, “Look there, do you see? This is why and this is how.” Sound structure and beautiful design. 

As instructed I went and compared two stories from Tolstoy to see what 39 years of working on your craft does. And, my God, *it does.*

For my own writing:

* using the word “shit” is fine, because it’s a part of my voice,
* commitment to revise sentences, paragraphs and storyline is a virtue, not a problem,
* each sentence should help the reader to read on; read your writing (can also be a simple e-mail!) like a reader would.

### Closing remarks

My favourite book of 2021, **a strong 5/5**. A delightful, but also a humbling experience; it makes you appreciate how hard is it to build a good black box. And these guys had no computers! I learned a lot; mostly as a reader, but also as a blogger, writer of emails and a curious human. 

Saunders teaches us a lot; I am grateful that I randomly found this book and got the chance to better understand the art of a good story. I hope I will be able to tell a good one.

wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‘best’ or ‘most influential’ books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn’t take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a “score” of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader’s Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another “point” and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the “best” books of all time, but rather the “most influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively “better” than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn’t be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

So yes, I'll be reading the new Dan Brown novel, and I bet I'm going to enjoy it. Is it literature? Hell no! Does it have any quality? Not besides keeping me entertained for a couple of days...

The last book I read was about a year or two ago and I've recently started reading a lot of graphic novels and it kinda reminded me how i enjoyed reading from time to time. Are there any other books you would reccomend that could get me hooked on books again? 

I quite liked the anthony Horowitz books as a kid and I like sci fi books as well but I think I want to try something with more mature feel to it.

pf8wtc,The Similarities between the Novels by Dan Brown,"I have completed reading all the books by Dan Brown. After the completion, it came to my mind that they are strikingly similar, even the non-Langdon ones. So let's discuss about the striking similarities (keep in mind that there are exceptions) ...

* Death - Someone dies; probably someone important/famous ( Ensei Tankado, Wailee Ming & Norah Mangor, Leonardo Vetra,  Jacques Saunière,  Bertrand Zobrist, Edmond Kirsch)
* The main character is called and is asked to go somewhere.
* The lady or the man (in the standalones) - is smart, confident, beautiful, bold and brave. (Sienna Brooks was the only 'the lady' who wasn't exactly with the good guys)
* The agency - The agency is used by the antagonist to do the bad works ( Delta force, 'Illuminati' Opus Dei, The Consortium, 'The Palmarian Church')
* Codes, Art, Riddles, 'History', 'Facts', Religion & Technology
* The story narration is mostly done in two places/paths . The ending involves the joining of these paths. (Idk if guys r understanding what I meant, Eng isn't my 1st lang)
* The one person whom you can blindly trust, that is .. until you realise that he/she is the antagonist. ( Commander Trevor Strathmore,  William Pickering, Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sir Leigh Teabing, Sienna Brooks, Winston, the only exception maybe Mal'akh)
* The story has what I call 'Hey, we  are/were  related/in a relationship' moment in the end. ( Ensei Tankado-Tokugen Numataka , Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Sophie Neveu-Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair & Brother, Peter Solomon-Mal'akh, Bertrand Zobrist-Sienna Brooks, The King of Spain-  Bishop Antonio Valdespino )
* The intimate scene in the end. (It doesn't occur in the last three books)
* The character shows hatred to his/her parent. (Rachel Sexton-Senator Sexton, Pope-Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, Peter Solomon-Mal'akh). This is one of the less prominent similarities.

From all this I have created a general summary-

The main character (A) is called and informed of a problem/situation . He/she gets help from someone of the other gender (B) . There are some riddles referring to arcane art or literature. The antagonist uses an agency to carry out the deeds. A gets help from a trusted person (X). There is a lot of riddle solving. A realises that X is the bad guy. X gets caught. A spends some quality time with B. It is revealed that one of prominent character is related to another prominent character.

I would love to hear your opinions on my observations. Personally I find that the books have been becoming worse since 'The Lost Symbol', and have generally lost their originality.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pf8wtc/the_similarities_between_the_novels_by_dan_brown/,2021-08-31 16:06:19,122,189,books
