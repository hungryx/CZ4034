lbbwp7,"I loved to movie too, but after reading the book wished they could have made The Martian into a TV series. That would have gave them the time to really delve into all the book parts they had to abandon for time (like the whole dust storm solar panel trouble).",bmedenwald,2021-02-03 03:03:21
lbbwp7,"I agree. One of the best books ever, and I wasnt thrilled with Matt Damon as Watney. Although, they did change the movie up a bit from the book so I ended up being okay with Damon’s performance. I loved The Martian so much, but Artemis was a huge let down, in my opinion. Everything that worked in The Martian didn’t work in Artemis. It was so disappointing, but I hope you like it more than I did!",3_Eyed_Ravenclaw,2021-02-03 01:25:27
lbbwp7,"This has been said a lot but Artemis was such a terrible read I just had to reinforce the point. As a straight man in his 40s, the main character of Artemis was absolutely horrendous. Between the totally unnecessary double entendres and sexual innuendos and the uncalled for sexualizing of the main character, if I didn't know better I would have thought that the books were written by different authors.  
Also, The Martian's ""shtick"" of real time log entries and the main characters use of science to solve problems just fell flat in Artemis.",geekgeek77,2021-02-03 03:34:51
lbbwp7,"I KNOW right? I've read the book almost 4-5 times by now. It has become my comfort book whenever I'm in the mood for some good sci fi.

I need more books like these. Specifically the one thing I loved about the Martian was that there were no bad guys. Watney didn't have to fire a single bullet. There are no space battles or stupid conflict.

That's the version of future space travel I like. Where the ""villain"" is Space itself, and you don't need a bad guy to make the story interesting.

My other favorites are Rendezvous with Rama, 2001 series(except the ending where the guy became a subconscious or something), Contact, and finally the Expanse series for its scientific accuracy(though I still not a big fan of the repetitive space battles)",vpsj,2021-02-03 04:50:52
lbbwp7,"The Martian is probably the funniest thing I've ever read. Laughed my ass off while reading the whole thing.

I will say, however. I love Matt Damon as Watney. I watched the movie before I read the book, and I couldn't picture anyone else in the main role.",Limp-Munkee69,2021-02-03 08:05:47
lbbwp7,"The Martian is one of the few stories where I consider the movie superior to the book. In the book Mark Watney is barely even a character, he delivers some blithe commentary and a few human touches in between all the math problems, barely more than ""wow this super sucks, let's do more science"". In the movie you really get the sense of this guy working his butt off while being marooned in a way no other human has.",provocatrixless,2021-02-03 03:04:54
lbbwp7,"I'd say there's a core difference between the Martian and Crichton's work. The Martian is ultimately a message that technology is good and can be trusted but just about all of Crichton's books have the message that technology is bad and cannot be trusted, and will betray you, kill you, eat you. whatever.",hobokenbob,2021-02-03 03:49:51
lbbwp7,">I’m going to read Artemis next.

Don't do it. 

I loved The Martian. Artemis is terrible. It's garbage. 

It felt like his publisher forced him to write a second book and he reluctantly did it to get paid. You could tell The Martian was written with love and enthusiasm, no such positive feeling were found here. I don't think Weir has ever met a woman IRL and he wrote a book with one as the main character. I firmly hated her by chapter 2 but we powered on because it was our only audiobook on a multi-day road trip. We paused the book every hour or so to rant about how much we hated it. I was trying to get my girlfriend into sci-fi and this book almost single handedly ended that quest. The plot holes, the terrible dialogue, the sexism, the writing, the everything and nothing. Nothing was good. I was so disappointed.",Bubbleybubble,2021-02-03 03:51:12
lbbwp7,"I also loved *The Martian!*

I did not care for *Artemis*, because I did not like the main character. (One of my friends had the same reaction.)

Also, the filmed adaptation of *The Martian* is one of the rare instances when I like the movie even better than the book (Damon has exhibited a decent range beyond action films.).

lbbwp7,"My favourite bit about The Martian is its use of narrative techniques, with the use of 1st and 3rd person (and sort of 2nd person or omnipresent narration I suppose) to give distinct identities to the different locations.

The first section of the book being first person diary entries is fun, but then suddenly you are in third person and it feels so different, and you realise what’s going on on earth.

Late in the book the descriptive sections on the build process for the HAB add quite a bit of tension as it cuts between Mars and the build leading you to wonder what’s going to happen.

It’s such a fun example of how the shift in perspective can effect a story",Airules,2021-02-03 09:03:54

lbbwp7,"I actually finished reading the book while on the tram into town to watch it in the cinema, so I went pretty much straight from one to the other.  


My feeling was that Matt Damon was perfectly cast, he captured the businesslike problem-solving attitude, sense of humour and general feeling of Mark Watney exactly as I pictured him.  


They maybe could have extended the end, but I think if they'd padded it out much more it'd have lost the punchiness.  


  
I did like Artemis a lot, though I haven't felt any urge to re-read it.  
It's a very different beast to The Martian though, don't go in expecting anything like it.  


It's more of a young-adult novel, no bad thing, but it definitely didn't feel as mature or thoughtful as The Martian.  
I read it shortly after watching the movie Moon, and that coloured a lot of my mental imagery of the description of mining vehicles and such, I do recommend the combination.  


It also put me in mind of a bunch of 1970s Sci-Fi I used to read such as E.E Doc Smith's Family D'Alembert series.",Ruadhan2300,2021-02-03 10:32:03

lbbwp7,"I might get some people angry with this one but here I go.

I struggled for some time to find intriguing sci-fi after reading The Martian. It all felt drab to me for some reason. I couldn't point my finger at what my issue was, until I read a random review for the book. It was as scientifically accurate as a novel for laymen could be, and the closer your scientific background is to what is discussed in the novel, the better it gets.

What rekindled interest for sci-fi in me was **drumrolls**

The Expanse. Yup. Some people hate it for mostly unrelated reasons, but I absolutely love the technicalities of space travel even when there is ""future technology"" mixed in. 

That's how I understood that for me to enjoy sci-fi it must be at least physically coherent, thank you The Martian for ruining ""warp speed"" for me forever.",AvoidingCape,2021-02-03 15:43:02

lbbwp7,"I just heard about a new book by Andy Weir that will be out in May, *Project Hail Mary*.

Here is the description of it from amazon:

A lone astronaut must save the earth from disaster in this incredible new science-based thriller from the #1 *New York Times* bestselling author of *The Martian*.

Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.

Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.

All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone. 

Or does he?

An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could deliver, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian—while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.",klangley56,2021-02-04 19:28:49
lbbwp7,"Signing on to this. I struggle with audio books pretty mightily (embarrassing, I know) but I flew through The Martian AB. The fact that much of the story is Watney's audiologs helped me settle into it, I think.",ClownQuestionBrosef,2021-02-03 03:06:25

I didn't like Artemis that much. I liked the ideas in it, but the characters were just bad. Andy Weir himself also said that The Martian was better. So I'm not sure if I'll buy Hail Mary day one... The summary sounds like The Martian but in space. The premise sounds quite boring, but I think Andy can turn it in to something. 

It's difficult to overcome The Martian. And Artemis could be a better movie than the book.",inseend1,2021-02-03 11:51:30
lbbwp7,"It was not as good as the Martian.  But I felt he was stretching his writers wings.  Female protagonist can be really hard to do for a techno-nerd, but he pulled it off reasonably well.  The whodunnit nature of the book is a little less engrossing than the pure man versus nature of The Martian too.

Overall I agree, but I still think Artemis is worth reading.  Especially if you want to know what a real moon base might look like.",SyntheticAperture,2021-02-03 15:23:02
lbbwp7,The thing with Artemis is that it’s a completely different genre. Sure it’s in space but that’s where the similarities end. The audio book is better because of Rosario Dawson IMO. But it’s a fine story. Not great. Not terrible. But not a follow up to the Martian that we all were hoping for. But I was entertained.,byhi,2021-02-03 12:35:42
lbbwp7,"I quit reading The Martian only a few chapters in.  The writing is bad (dialogue especially), it's extremely repetitive,  the humor is cringeworthy, the characterization is extremely weak, thematically paper thin, and any kind of philosophical content was surface level at best.  The constant references to Three's Company or w/e was extremely annoying.  

The movie managed to be decent despite the low quality source material.",shorticusprime,2021-02-03 15:06:51

In an interview with Andy Weir published in the back of my copy of The Martian he said that Mark Watney was written, as a character, to be himself. A loose quotation (haven’t got the book in front of me) is that Weir just had him say whatever he would in that situation, jokes and all. 

That being said it’s very easy to see Weir treating his protagonist in Artemis the same way, but with a pair of breasts tacked on, resulting in an obsession with his new-found sex and sexuality.",redotrobot,2021-02-03 05:25:38

In the Martian Mark does some... unsafe... things but he does them out of necessity- burning certain rocket fuels will produce water and he needs water to live, nuclear fuel radiates energy as heat and he needs to warm the cabin so as not to die of exposure. These are well understood concepts and Watney fully comprehends and understands the mechanisms at play and the inherent risks- and they do backfire on him in time.

In Crichton's books the science/tech disasters come from people messing with things they DON'T fully understand, like breeding extinct apex predators or programming nanomachines with predatory algorithms and the conflict arises from that lack of understanding.",Mister_One_Shoe,2021-02-03 06:53:38

The online version also had an extra chapter in it which you can find online somewhere. It lines up a little bit with the last scene in the film, with Watney being back on Earth.

It was also the online version that got NASA a little worried that somebody might have been consulting Weir without authorisation.

With artemis you're expected to belive that this young woman is somehow so brilliant that she figure out most problems without asking for help.

One of the main character traits is that she does treks outside of the bubble atmosphere, so she's constantly putting on and taking off EVA suits, and every time (? idk I wasn't counting but it felt like every time) she would say something about looking sexy or not looking sexy getting dressed. It was exhausting. I've never felt such whiplash reading an author because I loved The Martian and hated Artemis. 

Also, I don't think most people get annoyed about this like I do, but I hated the libertarian slant too. There were a lot of weird musings about how laws are bad, and the moon is good because it's easy to smuggle, and there's no age of consent. Gross.",AthensBashens,2021-02-03 18:07:59

As for Damon, I've had the hots for him since Goodwill Hunting so I wanted to marry Watney when I saw the movie.

As for Artemis, I enjoyed it. Not at the level of The Martian though. People are complaining about the main character. I am a 50 yo woman. I found her to be relatable.

The technical bits, where The Martian excelled, felt tacked on and unnecessary, and that was a huge letdown because I need about four or five more The Martians as soon as possible. The characters were meh. But the action and problem solving were very creative, and the setting felt real. The bits about the economy of a lunar colony were also interesting. Kudos to Andy Weir for stretching his range as a writer, but i am certain he should capitalize on what works for now.

We loved that book so much, and it was a great bit of family bonding before my mother became ill and eventually passed in the following year.

It's set in the near future/present and chronicles the What If of something crashing into and destroying the moon. Like The Martian, this is a survival story. The first third is all about how we come together to get off planet as fast as possible to save our civilization. 

People often praise The Martian and The Expanse for their dedication to hard science. They succeed by making the science accessible without too much dumbing down and over explanation and without going so deep that they get lost -- not an easy feat with astrodynamics.

IMO so far, Seveneves does this brilliantly. Because of its near future setting, it recognizes that our current understanding of space is our best understanding of space and operates completely within known physics.

Anyway, check it out.",borednerds,2020-01-09 15:50:26

iy56yf,"I’m a third year astrophysics student, and I find math and science books to be ridiculously boring to read through. It’s usually just facts and figures thrown at you, with no real narrative (even if it’s non-fiction, I need a narrative to focus).

The Martian is a great science book that way, where there’s stakes and a plot, but also some real science. Another great science-y fiction book is “Solaris”, a scientific examination of an impossible planet. One of my favourite reads.",Nyarlathotep8,2020-09-23 15:08:10

I also really liked gallow humor and I'm one of those guy, when watching a movie, will try to correct small details like ""actually the empty vacuum of space feels hot, not cold"". So that book was really made for me.

I didn't liked the movie that much because I felt like the science parts were glossed over and the humor had to be toned down in order to reach a wider public.

What I did like but seem to be the only one is ""Artemis"" which is the other book written by Andy Weir. The consensus is that it is a bad book with horrible characterization and cringe humor. I found the humor fine and once again, the science is spot on.",inckalt,2020-09-23 08:28:29

The Martian was the other way around, it was about his struggle for survival against the odds in possibly the harshest environment imaginable, the scientific underpinnings being part of that struggle.

Though I'd almost argue against going into the novel expecting the possibility of character death. The Martian is an adventure novel whose highlights are on the science and logistics of surviving on Mars. Was that ever a possibility that Watney would die?

But science fiction should really be a story that makes you think about science & technology in a way you hadn't considered before, especially as it relates to people & society.  So Star Wars isn't really science fiction in that sense because the futuristic stuff is just the backdrop- it's not saying anything about the technology as it relates to the people.  On the other hand, Singing In the Rain is an excellent piece of science fiction- the entire film revolves around the introduction of sound into filmmaking and how that impacts the characters.  The OP said: 'The first thing I did once I finished the book was look up the plausibility behind the science of The Martian, such as ""can you grow potatoes on Mars?"" or ""can we get people to Mars?""'

I always try to keep my mouth shut when *The Martian* pops up, as I appear to be in an extreme minority here, but it might just be the worst piece of writing I have ever read all the way through. Fortunately, I have blotted much of it from my memory, but I seem to recall jokes popping up every few sentences or so, much like the scientific dilemmas in the book: set-up, snappy punchline, set-up, snappy punchline. Often the punchline consisted of something like: ""Yeah, right!"" Very weird.

I'm still a bit puzzled as to how the book did so well. The consensus seems to be: ""Well, okay, the writing is clunky, and okay, the jokes are dumb, but the science is on point!"" In other words, judging the book for the quality of its writing and the author's sense of humor is a stylistic critique and nothing more. But I guess my point is: style matters.

I'm aware that I'm an outlier here, but my (very subjective) opinion is that *The Martian* read too much like a technical manual to be a very good novel, and too much like a novel (or a longform LiveJournal entry from 2003) to be a satisfying scientific read.",,2020-09-23 18:18:19

As readers we 'know' that the protagonist is eventually going to succeed in almost all cases, so a large part of a book's quality is derived from how good the author is at convincing us in the moment that the stakes are high and he could fail.

The stakes in the Martian are astronomical (heh), but everything that the protagonist has a *direct* hand in goes so well for him so quickly that the tension is mostly lost.

Lower body mass and physical strength might impact the engineering solutions available to her. If the story had been more interested in exploring Watney's mental health, there'd be some interesting contrasts between how a female and male Watney would handle that. But I digress).

What Weir was trying to do with Artemis wasn't to just replicate the engineering-only focus of The Martian; he was trying to include more interpersonal relationships, more interiority in the character's psyche, and more politics.  All of those additional dimensions mean that, yes, the main character's personality and perspective does make a difference. Most importantly, by making his main character a rebellious lapsed muslim deadbeat young woman, he was trying to make a character not just different from himself, but also unusual for the genre.

Plus, being a woman, I found a lot of cringey issues with how the (male) author wrote the character. Sure, it's great that he tried something different, but it was also a little...hollow, I guess. I would call the main character a Mary-Sue if the author was a woman.

He is good at world building in a realistic manner, and writing compelling sci-fi, but no good at character. The most standout part of Artemis is her attempt to sabotage the robot mining equipment, because it is explained in detail what and why she does. But he personal relationships are boring and don’t bring in emotional investment because she doesn’t behave like those things impact her. All of her personal info provided go to serve the science plot, not her as a character. Even the reveal of the conspiracy is exposition, not a natural conversation. Artemis is a book about a cool moon colony with Jazz thrown in so we can experience the different cool parts of the colony. Her character serves the setting, not the setting serving her character.

I just don't mind that they're totally different! (I did already convey that, right?) I mean, I'm happy reading two books back-to-back by different authors, so why should it bother me if they're stapled together?

I do think they feel connected, but I guess we have different standards of ""connected *enough*"". I liked that the reader's driving question of, ""Do they survive? What happens?"" is answered with, ""Oh, you wanna know what fucking happens? Buckle up!""

> It would be like if 2/3rd the way through the Martian he finds an alien colony and they help Watney get home with their advanced technology.

I think the difference there is that it would ruin the whole ""trying to survive off of his wits"" plot, while in *Seveneves*, that was resolved before the timeskip.

Also, ""suddenly aliens!"" wouldn't follow logically in an in-universe sense, which *Seveneves*'s second part does, even if it arguably does not follow logically in a narrative sense. The book's about survival, but it's also about building a society, and then you get to see the society fully-formed. (Also, in a narrative sense, it does tie up some plot threads!)

Maybe it would be more like skipping forward to a 60-year-old Watney, now a NASA bigwig, just... living his life. And I could imagine that being a good coda, if it were well done!

Its really best if you know as little as possible going in, in my opinion.",-Tunafish,2021-06-20 00:56:06
o3jrvy,"Anytime I had to take a flight somewhere (back when we still did that), I would buy 4-5 cheap $2 Kindle Direct Publish books. Three of them would be trash and after a couple minutes would never be read again. One I might get half way through before saying ""uuugggh"" and giving up. And maybe, if I got lucky, 1 would be worth reading entirely and I'd discover some new an upcoming author.

It was using this method that I bought ""The Martian"" for $2.

o3jrvy,"I remember my first time reading The Martian. I came home from my regular bookshop crawl, unpacked the haul, and noticed there was a small booklet. I checked the blurb at the back and it was a sample - the first chapter of some random book I'd never heard of. Usually these go straight in the bin, but the blurb sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.

The next morning, on my way to work, I immediately stopped at the bookshop (actually had to wait about 20 minutes until it opened), bought a copy, and by the time I came home that afternoon, I was already almost done with the book. Brilliant.",,2021-06-19 22:06:22

One of the only books I've read (I.e. Listened to twice in the past.... 15+ years).
Very fun.
Very funny.
I'm nowhere near a scientist so I enjoyed hearing the issues and how he went about solving them.

o3jrvy,"I also loved the Martian and I hate all things sci-fi. Andy Weir did an amazing job of explaining the science and math behind things and keeping it within the realm of believability despite the premise of a guy stranded on a planet by himself. 

The reason I had to respond was (and I knew this would happen) the amount of people telling you to read Project Hail Mary. If you thought the Martian was a little far-fetched you will hate Project Hail Mary like I did. The main character is alone in space and meets an actual alien. And that's only the tip of the iceberg for how far-fetched things get. Also, Andy Weir apparently only knows how to write one shtick as the main character is nearly identical to Mark Watney

o3jrvy,"I’m a mechanical engineer by training but now I do project and crisis management. The Martian is in my top 10 books and the film is a great faithful adaptation. 

One of the things commonly taught in engineering disciplines is failure analysis - forensic review of failed equipment or failed procedures and the events which can result in obviously, a failure. When I was in undergrad, taking FA, the Sioux City md-80 failure analysis came out and we poured over it to learn how things went wrong.  I’ve subsequently used the Challenger disaster report, the Mars Climate Observer  failure and the Gimli Glider all as examples of FA in a discussion with high school students. 

What Weir has Watney doing is in-the-thick-of-it failure analysis and Weir makes it approachable, and gives it great heart. Engineers (or at least I) aspire to be able to have a brain and attitude like Watney. I always recommend the book highly.

o3jrvy,"I'm a (very) scientifically inclined nerd too, I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains, and I also enjoyed a bit the myriad of problems the astronaut had to solve; that's what kept me from throwing the book away... But it felt as bad as a sitcom: same people, same-ish location, same themes, with only cosmetic differences, and nil character growth. What's the point in having problem after problem after problem after problem if you're going to react to them in the same manner, and come out of them the same person? You can have a few of them, well described and solved, and move your characters through them instead.

>Previously in The Martian Astronaut: ""I solved a problem, I scienced it out lololo1 yayay!!! With my super power of science because I'm a scientists, a botanist!! A Pirate Botanist on Marsss!1!1!!!""  
>  
>And in today's chapter: ""Oh, look, another problem! Let's science it out for the sake of science and pirate's glory in space! You just watch me I'm awesome!""

You could argue character development isn't always necessary, but in this particular case it was, because: can you really picture an astronaut in Watney's situation reacting like that? And not being in an increasing state of despair as time goes by? Falling into severe depression? Hallucinating because he's about to die because ""next problem yay!""

That's what was infuriating. This character NEEDED to change. Preposterously, he didn't.

Barely at young-adult level.

o3jrvy,"To be fair, The Martian is a very different kind of book. It's not about character development or world building or romance. Andy Weir nails one specific archetype: man-vs-nature problem-solving with hard-science in an optimistic sci-fi. There are very few things in his book that are scientifically inaccurate, which is why it makes it a joy to read -- watching a character figure out problems ""in real time"" in the physics of our world, with great witty and dry humor.

If that doesn't sound interesting to you, that's totally fine. No book is universally loved. But I think this book appeals to a wide genre of readers that don't necessarily also love the books you listed above.",heyyyjuude,2021-06-20 04:56:59

If I wanted nitty gritty psychological realism, of course I'd go read another book. But light-hearted narration does not make the Martian ""improper"" Mars.

Edit: sure, it's at a level that appeals to many young adults. But many many adults clearly loved it as well. I don't think accessibility to younger readers makes a bad book. It's a less complex book in traditional senses, certainly, but that doesn't mean it's inherently bad. You didn't like it, which is totally fine, so it wasn't your kind of story.

3m34oc,"Mr. Weir, 

I don’t know that you’ll see this but I wanted to take a shot. I want to thank you for writing The Martian. In doing so, you’ve unknowingly done me a great kindness. My mom is an avid reader (like 300 books a year avid) but she’s not really a fan of science fiction. I can’t actually ever remember her reading a straight science fiction novel in my whole life. But she read your book. 

Now the last year has been tough on my mom. Her dad, my grandpa, had a lot of health problems and she had been trying to take care of him full time while also keeping up with her full-time job and all of the work-a-day errands and chores she’s got to keep up with. She had very little help (I’m on the other side of the country). She’s been under a tremendous amount of stress. A few months ago my grandpa’s health took a turn for the worse and he was admitted to the hospital. My mom was practically living there when she wasn’t at work. She carries her kindle with her everywhere and to pass the time she read. I don’t really know how she got turned on to The Martian but however she found it, she did. While my grandpas condition deteriorated my mom sat there watching her last remaining family member (apart from us kids) die. And during all this, she read your book. 

Later, on the way to the cemetery in fact, she related to me a moment during those last days in the hospital. Apparently there was some time there near the end where my grandpa was doing really poorly but despite this she would catch herself laughing at Watney’s antics. She told me that she felt incredibly irreverent -- she knew she shouldn’t have been laughing at a time like that, but she thought your book was hilarious. That’s the great kindness you’ve done for me and my family. 

I know that this was one of the darkest periods of my mother’s already hard life. And through some happy coincidence, the lucky twist of fate that somehow brought your book to her, you were able to reach through those pages (are they pages on a kindle?) and bring a little levity, joy, or welcome distraction to a heartbroken woman. There’s no way I can ever repay you for this and you’ll never really know how much it means to me that someone could alleviate some of her pain, however briefly. So, thank you Mr. Weir.
 
From the bottom of my heart I wish you all the best.

3m34oc,"First of all, great book obviously. You don't get Ridley Scott far unless you have substantially good source material. Now on to my question:


You have said that *Zhek* will be a ""more traditional"" sci-fi novel in its themes. Does this also mean it will be more traditional in its format? One of the things that stood out to me about *The Martian* was the way the pacing translated from a serial format to a novel when you first compiled it for the Amazon release. How much of that  style will carry into your other work that's made for print from the start?",Archangel_117,2015-09-23 17:00:15
3m34oc,"Hi Mr. Weir!

IMO one of the reasons why *The Martian* has done so well because it was accessible to readers who don't traditionally like science fiction. I was wondering if you were intentionally trying to write a book that transcended the science fiction genre, or if it just kind of happened that way? Were you at all surprised by the book's success?

Thank you for taking the time to answer so many questions today! I really enjoyed *The Martian* and look forward to reading other books that you release in the future!",,2015-09-23 17:58:23

My question is: what is your favorite programming language?  How has your previous experience as a programmer helped with *The Martian*?",nicholas818,2015-09-23 17:01:47
3m34oc,"If the Martian does well in theaters, is there any chance 'someone' will push for a sequel. Would you allow a sequel to be created and if so what direction would you go in?

Obviously stranding Mark Watney alone on Mars (or any planet) again would never work, but potentially you could strand him on a ship with other crew members on a mission to say Jupiter and end up with a unique but familiar story. ",phire,2015-09-23 17:48:28

3m34oc,"I loved the book and can't wait for the movie! I bought several copies just to be able to lend it out to more people, believe it or not!

Whenever I start introducing your book to people, I tell them the full story of how it grew and grew into its smash success. The Martian seemed like more of a side project of your space and writing passions, and not so much a goal of becoming a financially successful, blockbuster author. Now that you're a big name, will you continue to write and just let what may come, come? Or do you have plans aimed more at another hopeful best seller novel now that your name is out there?

That's my main question that I've had ready for so long but if you feel like spending extra time my back up is: Are you worried about a ""sophomore slump""? 

Thanks so much for taking the time to do this!",CinnamonSwisher,2015-09-23 17:06:45
3m34oc,"Are you aware of, or have read the Japanese manga ""宇宙兄弟"" (Uchuu Kyoudai: Space Brothers) by Chuuya Koyama  and PLANETES by Makoto Yukimura?

I find both of these stories fascinating reads. If you have read these stories, I wanted to learn what you think of them. 

Space brothers is an intimate look at one man's journey to becoming an astronaut. The story gives a hint of the tremendous number of passionate intelligent people that allow a space program to send a tiny fraction of itself into space. The respect it shows to the organization (with its flaws) serves to elevate the qualities that make an astronaut truly extraordinary.  

PLANETES is a rather implausible in comparison, but tells the story of humanity expanding its reach to permanent settlements on the moon - and expanding out to Mars. Spaceflight is just beginning to become a commodity, and yet there is yearning for more. A manned mission to Jupiter is being planned, which causes great social and personal stress. Why do we explore? We've reached mars, isn't that good enough? Why do we spend so many resources on exploration when there is strife and conflict on earth?

If you haven't had an opportunity, I'd highly suggest them! I felt a similar sense of love and care in these works, as I did with the Martian. This belief that space is huge, vast, and unforgiving. It is the ultimate challenge we have faced so far - and unendingly inhospitable. And yet, this hope and belief that we are capable of growing to meet the challenge - and find ourselves better for it.

3m34oc,"Hi Andy Wier,
I am leading a student/teacher book talk soon about The Martian. What do you think you would like teens to know most about your writing process or style?  Also, 2 other questions..
1.  Can a storm of that magnitude really happen on Mars?
2.  How do you think the absence of blues/greens could effect astronauts traveling in space?",lebersole,2015-09-23 17:22:22
3m34oc,"Andy, I love you & The Martian. I read it the week I got married and then went to Kennedy Space Center on my honeymoon as a direct result of reading your book. I can't wait to read Zhek and I apologize for how many questions I'm about to ask, but I spend a lot of time thinking about the world of The Martian. 

1. Did Mark ever consider scavenging Ares I or II sites for communications parts & supplies? Or were they too far away? (Farther than Pathfinder and Ares IV sites?)
2. What do you think the review board for the Ares III mission would say? Have you read the [Apollo 13 report](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_13_review_board.txt)? What do you think the major Ares III report would conclude? Specifically the mutiny of the Hermes crew and the failure of the resupply launch?
3. How much would private contractors contribute to an Ares mission? With 14 pre-supply missions, 4 supply runs to prep the Hermes, and getting the crew to the Hermes, would there be a fair amount of collaboration?
4. How do you see the crew getting to and from the Hermes?
5. How long would the crew have been in orbit aboard the Hermes before they left for Mars on 7/7/35?
6. There is a 164 Sol time-jump at one point (Sol 212 - Sol 376) where Mark has lost communications with earth again and is making rover mods. Have you ever thought about writing a short story like the missing mission logs for that time or something? What was he doing, what about the crew of the Hermes? Surely something interesting must have happened in those 5 and a half months.
7. What do you think some of the health implications of Mark and the crew's prolonged mission were? Did they broke the world record for time spent in space? Would they have permanent bone damage? What about vision problems and elevated radiation exposure? Will they all get cancer later in life?
8. Will any of the crew ever go to space again or will they be grounded for health/political reasons?
9. What's next for Mark when he gets home? I feel like with all that experience he'd have to work for NASA designing missions or planning for contingencies or training future astronauts? Or would be write books and travel the world giving interviews? A little of both?
10. Did Mark sing happy birthday with Curiosity on it's birthday? Would NASA have programmed Curiosity to sing happy birthday for Mark too? (I know they weren't near each other, but still.)
11. Could the Hermes have survived micro meteorites and solar flares?
12. Is 2mm/s^2 the Hermes maximum acceleration? What would happen if there was some damage and they were no longer able to maintain that acceleration? Could your computer model handle variable accelerations?
13. Would the loss in mass of the argon make a difference over the life of the mission (2 yrs 5 mos) or the added mass of the resupply or Mark? Enough to impact orbital dynamics at all?
14. Is the ISS still around in 2035 you think?
15. I know you said you don't want to do a sequel because you felt like any more problems with the mission would be unbelievable. But I always felt like you set it up so well for the return journey. There are a lot of things that have already been established as issues, could you not address those and maybe just one or two new, cascading, issues? Like the hot bunks, obviously there is something wrong with the cooling system, that could lead to other problems. There is also the VAL breech, which has the potential to cause a lot of other problems later, right? 
16. Did you ever anticipate random strangers on the internet spending this much time thinking about your book? (I got a reddit account just so I could talk to other people about The Martian.)

And now for some questions that are not specifically The Martian related.

* 17. I read something over a year ago from you that said you were doing a lot of research for your next book, which was supposed to be another hard science book. Later you said your pitch about a Moon Base was shot down, so you moved on to Zhek. I know Zhek will probably be a series, so there's not a lot of hope, but do you think you'd get to write the Moon Base hard scifi someday? And would you be willing to speak a little about what your idea was? I am desperate for more hard science fiction and I think it's a shame about the Moon Base idea, I thought it sounded really interesting (and you did all that research!).
* 18. How is Zhek going? I know you missed the initial deadline due to all the publicity you're doing for The Martian and it's pushed up release date, but how are you doing now? Will the delay cause the estimated publish date to be pushed back at all?
* 19. How does it feel to have your own [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_(writer)) page?
* 20. Say hi to your cats, [Jojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKi1yK5Bojw) and Demi, for me.

Sorry for the million and one questions. I've been saving them up for a while and I keep missing your other AMAs so when I heard about this, I wanted to be prepared. 

I love the way NASA has been promoting the book and movie. I like to think that in 2037 there will be a special Mark Watney day at NASA. I hope they are able to ride the coattails of the your and the movie's success to get more funding and actually make it to Mars. I just think it's so amazing that something one nerd did might actually have an impact on the future of manned space flight. You are a gift 

And now for the obligatory personal anecdote about how much your book has touched my life. I was a really big science nerd when I was younger but then in college I sort of burnt myself out and switched from a BS to a BA and have regretted it ever since. My current profession has nothing to do with my innate love of science, and since your book has rekindled that passion in me I've been considering a career change. Thank you, you don't even know how much my life has been changed by your writing. 

Thanks for doing this AMA. You're the best.",rosweldrmr,2015-09-23 17:00:12

3m34oc,"Here's a summary of all the questions and answers so far:

Question | Answer
--|--
 When a book is made to a movie, the screen adaptations ending up having changes. Were you asked about/aware of the changes made from your book to its movie and how did you feel about them? | Drew Goddard did the adaptation and he talked to me a lot during that process. So I got to watch the screenplay unfold over time. And in this case it stuck very close to the book, so I'm happy. :)
If you had to pick just one member of the crew to be stuck on Mars with, who would it be? If Watney is your first choice, who would be your second?| Well, Watney, obviously. He's ideal for the task. However it it can't be Watney, I'd pick Johanssen, because she could probably fix the radio and get us back in contact with NASA. Communication is the key.
How much did your research on the details of life on Mars influence the plot, or vice versa? Was there any tidbit of research you were really disappointed in because it kept you from following a plot thought?|Actually, quite the opposite. My research created interesting plot points. Like when I researched potatoes and found out how much water he'd need in the soil. Then I realized he'd have to make water. And that let to one of the coolest plots in the book.
You have said that Zhek will be a ""more traditional"" sci-fi novel in its themes. Does this also mean it will be more traditional in its format? One of the things that stood out to me about The Martian was the way the pacing translated from a serial format to a novel when you first compiled it for the Amazon release. How much of that style will carry into your other work that's made for print from the start?|Pacing is my main concern while writing. I don't know how it'll work out with Zhek yet, but it's something that's always on my mind.
Did Mark ever consider scavenging Ares I or II sites for communications parts & supplies? Or were they too far away? (Farther than Pathfinder and Ares IV sites?)|They were too far away.
What do you think the review board for the Ares III mission would say? Have you read the Apollo 13 report? What do you think the major Ares III report would conclude? Specifically the mutiny of the Hermes crew and the failure of the resupply launch?|They would say the procedures related to sandstorm evac were insufficient and they'd lower the weather abort requirements for future Ares missions
How much would private contractors contribute to an Ares mission? With 14 pre-supply missions, 4 supply runs to prep the Hermes, and getting the crew to the Hermes, would there be a fair amount of collaboration?| In the book, it's all NASA/JPL with no mention of commercial spaceflight. In reality, a Mars mission would rely HEAVILY on commercial freight to LEO.
How do you see the crew getting to and from the Hermes?|Orion capsules
How long would the crew have been in orbit aboard the Hermes before they left for Mars on 7/7/35?|Just a few days
There is a 164 Sol time-jump at one point (Sol 212 - Sol 376) where Mark has lost communications with earth again and is making rover mods. Have you ever thought about writing a short story like the missing mission logs for that time or something? What was he doing, what about the crew of the Hermes? Surely something interesting must have happened in those 5 and a half months.|Thought about it; decided against it.
What do you think some of the health implications of Mark and the crew's prolonged mission were? Did they broke the world record for time spent in space? Would they have permanent bone damage? What about vision problems and elevated radiation exposure? Will they all get cancer later in life?| No radiation problems. In the book they have a (non-existant in the real world) material that lines all their pressure vessels and blocks radiation. They wouldn't have vision problems because they spend very little time in zero-g. Hermes has centrifugal gravity.
Will any of the crew ever go to space again or will they be grounded for health/political reasons?| Because NASA's official stance is that they decided to send the crew back, they can't punish the crew for their mutiny.
What's next for Mark when he gets home? I feel like with all that experience he'd have to work for NASA designing missions or planning for contingencies or training future astronauts? Or would be write books and travel the world giving interviews? A little of both?|Working for NASA, as many former astronauts do.
. Did Mark sing happy birthday with Curiosity on it's birthday? Would NASA have programmed Curiosity to sing happy birthday for Mark too? (I know they weren't near each other, but still.)| Mark's mission is in 2035. By then Curiosity will (probably) be dead.
Could the Hermes have survived micro meteorites and solar flares?|Yes to both.
Is 2mm/s^2 the Hermes maximum acceleration? What would happen if there was some damage and they were no longer able to maintain that acceleration? Could your computer model handle variable accelerations?| Yes they could handle it. Ion propulsion gives great abort options.
Would the loss in mass of the argon make a difference over the life of the mission (2 yrs 5 mos) or the added mass of the resupply or Mark? Enough to impact orbital dynamics at all?|Yes it would. I approximated it out, but it would matter. Though not nearly so much as chemical propellant.
Is the ISS still around in 2037 you think?|No, it's successor will be in operation.
 I know you said you don't want to do a sequel because you felt like any more problems with the mission would be unbelievable. But I always felt like you set it up so well for the return journey. There are a lot of things that have already been established as issues, could you not address those and maybe just one or two new, cascading, issues? Like the hot bunks, obviously there is something wrong with the cooling system, that could lead to other problems. There is also the VAL breech, which has the potential to cause a lot of other problems later, right?|It would feel derivative and less interesting than The Martian.
Did you ever anticipate random strangers on the internet spending this much time thinking about your book|No, I had no idea it would become this popular.
How does it feel to have our own Wikipedia page?| Feels pretty good. :)
Donald Glover was cast to play Rich Purnell, what do you think of this selection?|I was thrilled with Donald's selection. I'm a fan of his and I think he nailed the role. Also, though I never said it in the book, I always imagined Rich as being black (though in my mind he was older, like in his 50s). Still I think it's cool that they cast a black actor to play the role. Just a happy coincidence.
What music would've been on Mark's playlist while he was stranded?|I never defined the music Watney actually likes.
If you could get anyone on earth to read your book who hasn't yet, who would it be? Also, what was the most difficult part for you in writing the Martian?|My friend Wade. Lazy f**k.
 I noticed halfway through that the type of humor (along with an increase of jokes) changed a lot. If you recognize this, is there some reason you could think of which would explain this?|I probably just drifted in writing style along the way. It took three years to write.
I just finished Hugh Howey's Beacon 23 shorts. Any recent releases you'd recommend?|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline.
In the book, you mention that Mark is the lowest ranked crew member of the Ares 3 Mission and the Lewis is the highest. Did you rank the rest of the crew too? If so, care to share the hierarchy?|Lewis Martinez Vogel Beck Johanssen Watney
What inspired you to write *The Martian*?|I was imagining how a manned mission to Mars might work. As I came up with more and more possible problems that could happen, I realized there was probably a story in it. So I created an unfortunate protagonist and subjected him to all of them. :)
I'm curious to know if there were any specific films or other novels that really aided in increasing your motivation to write the The Martian.|Apollo 13 and MacGyver. :)
My question is: what is your favorite programming language? How has your previous experience as a programmer helped with The Martian?|c++ I was able to write software to simulate orbital paths thanks to my programming.
My sister said to tell you she loves you and my friend wants to know what you think of Beck/Watney (as a couple)|Beck and Watney are both straight. But if you're talking about a shipping fanfic, where you can change stuff like that, then I think Martinez/Watney is a better couple. They're already best friends; they'd be compatible as a relationship.
What's your favorite planet from all science fiction? | Skaro. Really interesting history there. :)
Are you worried about a ""sophomore slump""?|Yes, very worried. There's just no way my next book will be as popular as ""The Martian"". So I'm really nervous about how well it'll be received.
 I was wondering if you had a preference as to whether fans shipped your characters? Also, I saw somewhere that you once wrote Doctor Who fanfiction, care to share?|I love fanfics. I've written several in my day. I consider it a great compliment when people write fanfics of my work. My DW fanfiction can be found [here](http://www.galactanet.com/writing.html). I wrote it before the 2005 reboot, so it's from before Gallefrey was destroyed.
 What's your favorite part of The Martian?|The launch failure of Iris. I feel like that scene really came together well.
How much disco did you listen to today?|I haven't listened to any disco today.
Just on a daily basis, what are your writing habits?|I usually deal with email and other non-writing related work until lunch. Then I settle in and try to write after that. I have a word count I'm shooting for every day, and a list of things I'm ""not allowed"" to do until I finish that word count. So until I get the words done there's no TV, no YouTube, no Reddit, etc.

3m34oc,"Hi Andy! Just wanted to say that your book honestly rekindled an interest in reading for me. I used to read a lot in my teens and early twenties, but with work, single parenthood etc, I have been reading probably less than a book a year since I turned 25, which is embarrassing.

I think I saw The Martian on a list of upcoming movies earlier this year, and picked up the book. I sped through it in about 2 (very late) nights, it is absolutely incredible. Since then I've read about a dozen new books, and my Amazon wish list is filled with other books that I hope to read soon. I'm currently plowing through some Peter F. Hamilton (book 2 of The Night's Dawn which is overly verbose, but still fun).

I don't really have any super exciting or well thought out questions, but here's a scattershot:

1. What are you reading these days?
2. Didn't realise you were a programmer at Blizzard, I worked there for a year and I'm currently at Naughty Dog. Are you playing any interesting games?

I am now reading your book ('The Martian') and I totally love it, especially Mark Watney's humour (Potatoes, Disco and duct tape) (.Y.). I'm also pumped for the motion picture and I'm definitely going to see it. How did you get on the idea for this story, what inspired you? Are you going to write more books (maybe a sequel to 'the Martian', that Mark is going on a journey to Kepler-452b)? And the last question: what do you think about the movie (It's cool to know the writer's opinion when I'm going to see it)?

 My question is on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate the movie? 

Congratulations on the success.",,2015-09-23 17:59:27
3m34oc,"Thank you so much for this AMA and for giving us The Martian. I had quit reading for many years. Last year I finally bought a Kindle and decided to try and get back into reading. I had heard about The Martian so I decided to finally buy my first science fiction ebook before the movie comes out. After a decade or so I shall be able to say ""Meh, the book was better"" (jk I am going to love the shit out of that movie). Question:

Did Mark Watney have nightmares with lots of floating sentient potatoes dancing to disco music after coming back to Earth?",dhatereki,2015-09-23 18:10:57
3m34oc,"I came across your writing years ago, when I read The Egg and I thought it was the most beautiful story I had ever read and I immediately set out to read all your work.  I had always planned to read the Martian after I finished Bonnie MacKenzie.  After a few years of waiting, and getting the emails about the Martian being updated I got frustrated and unsubscribed from your email newsletter thinking that it will be better to forget about it for a while and then when I happen upon it later it will perhaps finally be finished. I stopped thinking about the Mermaid and the Martian, but I always remembered the egg.  It's something that I've always felt struck that chord in my heart and just never stopped resonating. 

I was in the theatre when I remembered that you had more stories than just the egg.  When a trailer for the Martian played and at the end your name flashed across the screen. I almost screamed when I saw it. I thought I really must get to reading that story,  it's so amazing that he's gained such credibility and of course the Mermaid will have been finished by now as well. Still waiting for it, and I still can't bring myself to read the Martian.  

I hope one day you will finish it, so I can read both stories in their entirety. ",marsartlove,2015-09-23 18:18:03
3m34oc,"Greetings, Mr Weir!

Thank you for writing The Martian and reinvigorating the spirit of hope in modern science fiction! Far too many dystopian and post-apocalyptic sci-fi novels had made the genre almost drab. I have to say, it is the most unputdownable book I've ever read!

Coming to the question, did you have access to NASA information or something while writing the book, or did you get all the details from information in the public domain? The amount research you've put in is incredible.

By the way, did you know that Elon Musk had this idea of sending plants in a capsule to Mars way back in 2002 and stream back the video to Earth to generate interest in spaceflight, which led to SpaceX?

I know this is mostly focused on ""The Martian"" but I wanted to stop by and tell you how much I loved your short story, ""The Egg.""

That story really caught my interest and helped me look at everything with a different perspective. 

Anyways, I really look forward to reading ""The Martian"" (I've got it on my shelf at home, in queue), and I'm sure the movie will be fantastic!",IHasCandyGetIn,2015-09-23 18:22:22

That, The Last Question by Asimov and A Perfect Day for Bananafish by JD Salinger are pretty much what I would recommend to anyone who asks what my favorite short stories are. I'm in the middle of The Martian and got to say that I love it so far.  
  
My question is: how much effort went into the science and the math behind the book? I ask only because the research and the level of detail that went into it is very impressive. How accurate is it to how NASA works today? Thanks and keep up the good work!",mostly_harmless1,2015-09-23 18:24:01
3m34oc,"I read a lot. Found and bought ""The Martian"" on a whim. Couldn't get enough of it.

Now. About Matt Damon. I think he's a great actor and a great guy. But he never would have been my first choice to play the protagonist. Too brooding. And too soon after ""Interstellar."" 

So my question is: with all due respect to Mr. Damon (let's say he didn't take the role), is there a runner-up actor who you would have envisioned to play the lead part?

3m34oc,"Hey Andy, thanks for putting so much careful detail in *The Martian.* 

I want to ask about the state of publishing these days. From what I understand you did a bit of a hybrid: first self-published via your website then Kindle, and parlayed E-Reader success into a more traditional print edition publishing agreement. I'm sure it was more complicated, but does that sound about right?

So is the trend of self-publications going ""viral"" a sustainable, wholesale alternative to traditional publishing houses or just a niche occurrence? It seems like the pressure Amazon puts on publishing houses would suggest that they at least view publishers simply as an antiquated middle man. 

Do you have a preference on how readers purchase your books? Any ways to help support smaller publishers?",demusdesign,2015-09-23 19:17:24

1. They were too far away.
2. They would say the procedures related to sandstorm evac were insufficient and they'd lower the weather abort requirements for future Ares missions
3. In the book, it's all NASA/JPL with no mention of commercial spaceflight. In reality, a Mars mission would rely HEAVILY on commercial freight to LEO.
4. Orion capsules
5. Just a few days
6. Thought about it; decided against it.
7. No radiation problems. In the book they have a (non-existant in the real world) material that lines all their pressure vessels and blocks radiation. They wouldn't have vision problems because they spend very little time in zero-g. Hermes has centrifugal gravity.
8. Because NASA's official stance is that they decided to send the crew back, they can't punish the crew for their mutiny.
9. Working for NASA, as many former astronauts do.
10. Mark's mission is in 2035. By then Curiosity will (probably) be dead.
11. Yes to both.
12. Yes they could handle it. Ion propulsion gives great abort options.
13. Yes it would. I approximated it out, but it would matter. Though not nearly so much as chemical propellant.
14. No, it's successor will be in operation.
15. It would feel derivative and less interesting than The Martian.
16. No, I had no idea it would become this popular.
17. The publisher loved the Moon Base idea's setting. They just didn't like the story. Some day I'll have a shower epiphany and have an idea for a better story and then I'll be ready to write it.

Questions | Answers
---|---
I understand you got corrective feedback from your mailing list but while constructing each chapter did you use any speciality forums (physics, chemistry, space) to postulate possible problems for Mark or was it all in your head.|Now I just contact experts directly. It's awesome. :)
In your prior life you were a programmer. Did you participate in StackOverflow and if so what was your rank?|I never answered a question on StackOverflow. But I used it all the time. heh.
Was there any reason why you took out the epilogue where Mark was back on Earth?|I just didn't like it. Having an 8-month time jump just for one more scene felt lame. Also the epilogue itself wasn't very good in my opinion.
What is your favorite science fiction book?|That changes from day-to-day. In general it's ""I, Robot"". But I really liked ""Tunnel in the Sky"", too.
Why are you afraid of flying? It is the safest mode of transportation.|Irrational fear. It's not based on logic or reason.
Do you like potatoes?| I do!
Did you ever feel cruel putting Watney through so much?|Nah. He's a self-insertion character, so I was really just being cruel to myself
What was the initial reaction to getting your book made into a movie? How in depth was your research for the scientific aspects of the book? Like did you do weird ecology experiments to then write about?|I was shocked that they were interested. I did a lot of math and research for the book, but no ""experiments"".
How come Aquaman can control whales?|Aquaman has powerful telepathic abilities. He's learned how to use them to control sea-life, but they can actually work on anything with a brain. He's used them on people, even. He has more experience with things in the ocean, but his powers are definitely not limited to sea life.
Do you think private launch or government launch is the future of space exploration?|Driving the cost to LEO is the future of space exploration. This will increase demand and cause a space boom. Governments will be the major customer for a long time.
Would the hab canvas really have protected Watney from solar radiation? What about all the time he spent EVA or in the rover?|Not at all. The book has a completely fictional material that blocks radiation. No such thin, flexible, light radiation shielding exists in the real world.
If you had the chance to talk to the first Marswalkers before they left Earth, what would you say to them?|""Good luck!""
What problem gave you the hardest time when it came to making a solution for it?|Dealing with heat and heat management. How to turn off the heater in the rover to give him more range. I ultimately solved it by saying they had an RTG.
How do you feel about the casting for the movie? What is it like having actual faces being placed on characters you created?|The cast is AMAZING. Can you believe they got all those big names in a single film?
What if in a few hundred years, when there are cities on Mars, people still call the group of craters the Watney Triangle? What else on future Mars would you like to be named after yourself?|It'd be great if something on Mars got named after something in my book. That'd be awesome!
Please, please, please write an epilogue to The Martian (just publish it online like you did with the book in the beginning)! :) I think it ended too abruptly and I wanted to read some aftermath reactions on earth.|No, sorry. When a book ends, it ends. The rest is up to the reader.
There was only one line that kind of threw me a little, one where you suggested the safety of the early Soviet rockets as vastly inferior to their American counterparts. I was under the impression that the soviets had the advantage in the space race having had the first man in space already and would have likely won the race to the moon had the Americans not skipped some extra safety testing. -I am not 100% sure where I had this in my head I think it was the BBC documentary the planets (1999) can you elaborate on this topic a little more?|I get asked this a lot. The Soviet space agency took unreasonable risks and their ships were incredibly dangerous. The modern Russian space agency makes the most reliable spacecraft of all time (The Soyuz). The Soviets won every aspect of the Space Race up until the moon landing, and they should be proud of that. But one of the reasons they won was because they were willing to take much larger risks with human life. Risk is part of progress, so there's no right or wrong answer there. But Watney is accurate to say those ships were dangerous and, by modern standards, reckless.
Any information about your next book? How is it shaping up? |I'm working on it now. It's called ""Zhek"" and it should be out in 2016. It's a more traditional sci-fi novel, with aliens and faster-than-light travel. But done my own way. I came up with a core set of bullshit physics that enables FTL, and made sure it's not in conflict with real physics. Then everything is either based on that or on real physics.
Are the botany aspects of the book scientifically accurate? Could I take an old bag of potatoes, mix it with a small amount of Earth soil, Martian dirt, human feces, and water and be able to grow something edible?|Yes... almost. After writing the book, I learned that Martian soil has perchlorates, which would be a problem. However, they can be removed with a water rinse. So you'd have to do that step, too. But other than that, yes, it would work.
Favorite snacks during writing?|Diet Coke
Should I read your book or see the movie first ?|Depends on how fast you can read. If you can finish it before you watch the movie, go for it. But if you're halfway through the book when you watch the movie, I think it'll reduce the enjoyment of both.
How involved were you with the filmmaking process? Did you help with the script / set design, etc.? Loved the book!|Mostly my job was to cash the check. :) Though they did consult me while they were writing the screenplay and they had a few technical questions for me while they were filming.
How did you feel seeing the book translated into the big screen, and did Matt Damon capture the 'feel' of Watney to you?|He absolutely NAILED the character. He is exactly how I imagined Watney
If Matt Damon is off the table and the studio asks you instead, who do you choose as the star of the movie?|Chris Pratt would do a pretty good job, I think.
Are you nervous when your work is under the scrutiny of professionals? How much time was spent writing compared to researching?|I spent about half my time researching. I'm not worried about my work coming under the eye of experts. It's a work of fiction, and it's going to have inaccuracies. That's just how it is. But getting a thumbs up from those experts and hearing them say ""It's more accurate than anything else in the field"" is a good feeling
What job would you like to do for Nasa? After all of your research what do you think an ideal job for you at Nasa would be?|I think maybe the PLUTO flight controller station. It's a Mission Control position, and it handles the onboard computers on the station.
I really admire the effort you put into your book to make it scientifically accurate. Did the same effort go into the movie?|Yes, they kept the accuracy in the film. I was really happy about that. They didn't update it to new tech or anything. It follows the book very closely.
If you could go on a mission to Mars that meant you'd be a true pioneer for humanity, but would also have to leave the comforts of home forever, would you do it?|No. I have no interest in going to space myself. I write about brave people, I'm not one of them.
Are you planning on doing more space books or even a continuation of the martian universe?|Yes, definitely more space stuff. No plans for a Martian sequel though.",RandomNerdGeek,2015-09-23 18:48:37

Question | Answer
---|---
1. Did Mark ever consider scavenging Ares I or II sites for communications parts &amp; supplies? Or were they too far away? (Farther than Pathfinder and Ares IV sites?) | 1. They were too far away.
2. What do you think the review board for the Ares III mission would say? Have you read the Apollo 13 report[1] ? What do you think the major Ares III report would conclude? Specifically the mutiny of the Hermes crew and the failure of the resupply launch? | 2. They would say the procedures related to sandstorm evac were insufficient and they'd lower the weather abort requirements for future Ares missions
3. How much would private contractors contribute to an Ares mission? With 14 pre-supply missions, 4 supply runs to prep the Hermes, and getting the crew to the Hermes, would there be a fair amount of collaboration? | 3. In the book, it's all NASA/JPL with no mention of commercial spaceflight. In reality, a Mars mission would rely HEAVILY on commercial freight to LEO.
4. How do you see the crew getting to and from the Hermes? | 4. Orion capsules
5. How long would the crew have been in orbit aboard the Hermes before they left for Mars on 7/7/35? | 5. Just a few days
6. There is a 164 Sol time-jump at one point (Sol 212 - Sol 376) where Mark has lost communications with earth again and is making rover mods. Have you ever thought about writing a short story like the missing mission logs for that time or something? What was he doing, what about the crew of the Hermes? Surely something interesting must have happened in those 5 and a half months. | 6. Thought about it; decided against it.
7. What do you think some of the health implications of Mark and the crew's prolonged mission were? Did they broke the world record for time spent in space? Would they have permanent bone damage? What about vision problems and elevated radiation exposure? Will they all get cancer later in life? | 7. No radiation problems. In the book they have a (non-existant in the real world) material that lines all their pressure vessels and blocks radiation. They wouldn't have vision problems because they spend very little time in zero-g. Hermes has centrifugal gravity.
8. Will any of the crew ever go to space again or will they be grounded for health/political reasons? | 8. Because NASA's official stance is that they decided to send the crew back, they can't punish the crew for their mutiny.
9. What's next for Mark when he gets home? I feel like with all that experience he'd have to work for NASA designing missions or planning for contingencies or training future astronauts? Or would be write books and travel the world giving interviews? A little of both? | 9. Working for NASA, as many former astronauts do.
10. Did Mark sing happy birthday with Curiosity on it's birthday? Would NASA have programmed Curiosity to sing happy birthday for Mark too? (I know they weren't near each other, but still.) | 10. Mark's mission is in 2035. By then Curiosity will (probably) be dead.
11. Could the Hermes have survived micro meteorites and solar flares? | 11. Yes to both.
12. Is 2mm/s2 the Hermes maximum acceleration? What would happen if there was some damage and they were no longer able to maintain that acceleration? Could your computer model handle variable accelerations? | 12. Yes they could handle it. Ion propulsion gives great abort options.
13. Would the loss in mass of the argon make a difference over the life of the mission (2 yrs 5 mos) or the added mass of the resupply or Mark? Enough to impact orbital dynamics at all? | 13. Yes it would. I approximated it out, but it would matter. Though not nearly so much as chemical propellant.
14. Is the ISS still around in 2035 you think? | 14. No, it's successor will be in operation.
15. I know you said you don't want to do a sequel because you felt like any more problems with the mission would be unbelievable. But I always felt like you set it up so well for the return journey. There are a lot of things that have already been established as issues, could you not address those and maybe just one or two new, cascading, issues? Like the hot bunks, obviously there is something wrong with the cooling system, that could lead to other problems. There is also the VAL breech, which has the potential to cause a lot of other problems later, right? | 15. It would feel derivative and less interesting than The Martian.
16. Did you ever anticipate random strangers on the internet spending this much time thinking about your book? (I got a reddit account just so I could talk to other people about The Martian.) | 16. No, I had no idea it would become this popular.
17. I read something over a year ago from you that said you were doing a lot of research for your next book, which was supposed to be another hard science book. Later you said your pitch about a Moon Base was shot down, so you moved on to Zhek. I know Zhek will probably be a series, so there's not a lot of hope, but do you think you'd get to write the Moon Base hard scifi someday? And would you be willing to speak a little about what your idea was? I am desperate for more hard science fiction and I think it's a shame about the Moon Base idea, I thought it sounded really interesting (and you did all that research!). | 17. The publisher loved the Moon Base idea's setting. They just didn't like the story. Some day I'll have a shower epiphany and have an idea for a better story and then I'll be ready to write it.
18. How is Zhek going? I know you missed the initial deadline due to all the publicity you're doing for The Martian and it's pushed up release date, but how are you doing now? Will the delay cause the estimated publish date to be pushed back at all? | 18. Zhek's going well, though it's been a challenge. It's a much more complex story and I'm having trouble with pacing.
19. How does it feel to have our own Wikipedia page? | 19. Feels pretty good. :)
20. Say hi to your cats, Jojo and Demi, for me. | 20. Will do.

>> 7\. What do you think some of the health implications of Mark and the crew's prolonged mission were? Did they broke the world record for time spent in space? Would they have permanent bone damage? What about vision problems and elevated radiation exposure? Will they all get cancer later in life?

>7\. No radiation problems. In the book they have a (non-existant in the real world) material that lines all their pressure vessels and blocks radiation. They wouldn't have vision problems because they spend very little time in zero-g. Hermes has centrifugal gravity.

>> 8\. Will any of the crew ever go to space again or will they be grounded for health/political reasons?

>8\. Because NASA's official stance is that they decided to send the crew back, they can't punish the crew for their mutiny.

>> 9\. What's next for Mark when he gets home? I feel like with all that experience he'd have to work for NASA designing missions or planning for contingencies or training future astronauts? Or would be write books and travel the world giving interviews? A little of both?

>9\. Working for NASA, as many former astronauts do.

>> 10\. Did Mark sing happy birthday with Curiosity on it's birthday? Would NASA have programmed Curiosity to sing happy birthday for Mark too? (I know they weren't near each other, but still.)

>10\. Mark's mission is in 2035. By then Curiosity will (probably) be dead.

>> 11\. Could the Hermes have survived micro meteorites and solar flares?

>11\. Yes to both.

>> 12\. Is 2mm/s2 the Hermes maximum acceleration? What would happen if there was some damage and they were no longer able to maintain that acceleration? Could your computer model handle variable accelerations?

>12\. Yes they could handle it. Ion propulsion gives great abort options.

>> 13\. Would the loss in mass of the argon make a difference over the life of the mission (2 yrs 5 mos) or the added mass of the resupply or Mark? Enough to impact orbital dynamics at all?

>13\. Yes it would. I approximated it out, but it would matter. Though not nearly so much as chemical propellant.

>> 14\. Is the ISS still around in 2037 you think?

>14\. No, it's successor will be in operation.

>> 15\. I know you said you don't want to do a sequel because you felt like any more problems with the mission would be unbelievable. But I always felt like you set it up so well for the return journey. There are a lot of things that have already been established as issues, could you not address those and maybe just one or two new, cascading, issues? Like the hot bunks, obviously there is something wrong with the cooling system, that could lead to other problems. There is also the VAL breech, which has the potential to cause a lot of other problems later, right?

>15\. It would feel derivative and less interesting than The Martian.

>> 16\. Did you ever anticipate random strangers on the internet spending this much time thinking about your book? (I got a reddit account just so I could talk to other people about The Martian.)

>16\. No, I had no idea it would become this popular.

>>1. I read something over a year ago from you that said you were doing a lot of research for your next book, which was supposed to be another hard science book. Later you said your pitch about a Moon Base was shot down, so you moved on to Zhek. I know Zhek will probably be a series, so there's not a lot of hope, but do you think you'd get to write the Moon Base hard scifi someday? And would you be willing to speak a little about what your idea was? I am desperate for more hard science fiction and I think it's a shame about the Moon Base idea, I thought it sounded really interesting (and you did all that research!).

>1. The publisher loved the Moon Base idea's setting. They just didn't like the story. Some day I'll have a shower epiphany and have an idea for a better story and then I'll be ready to write it.

>> 2\. How is Zhek going? I know you missed the initial deadline due to all the publicity you're doing for The Martian and it's pushed up release date, but how are you doing now? Will the delay cause the estimated publish date to be pushed back at all?

>2\. Zhek's going well, though it's been a challenge. It's a much more complex story and I'm having trouble with pacing.

>>3\. How does it feel to have our own Wikipedia) page?

>3\. Feels pretty good. :)

>>4\. Say hi to your cats, Jojo  and Demi, for me.

>4\. Will do.",tobiasvl,2015-09-23 17:51:37

Very similar in tone and problem solving. Personally I didn't enjoy it nearly as much.

In Artemis, we get just as much science and explanation, but from a character who is just a welder's daughter living on a moon colony.

I’ve got a few minutes before I run out of air and I’ll be damned if I spend them playing Mars’ little game. I’m so god damned sick of it I could puke. All I have to do is sit here.

What drew me in from that original reddit discussion was the talk about how he goes about solving problems in a cool and methodical way when you're staring down death and one wrong mistake can end everything. 

That reminded me of the first book I ever treasured as a kid: Hatchet. I think the Martian is very succinctly described as ""Hatchet on Mars"". 

Thanks to childhood trauma, I process rapid crisis events this way, and identify super strongly with these characters and how they think about solving a life or death situation. Emotion goes right out the fucking window and it's like you took a bottle of Adderall. You are just hyper focused on the next step. The next step. The next step. Survive. Survive. Survive.

>Martian soil is toxic, due to relatively high concentrations of perchlorate compounds containing chlorine. Elemental chlorine was first discovered during localised investigations by Mars rover Sojourner, and has been confirmed by Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. The Mars Odyssey orbiter has also **detected perchlorates across the surface of the planet.**

The NASA Phoenix lander first detected chlorine-based compounds such as calcium perchlorate.**  The levels detected in the Martian soil are around 0.5%, which is a level considered toxic to humans. These compounds are also toxic to plants.** A 2013 terrestrial study found that a similar level of concentration to that found on Mars (0.5 g per liter) caused:

>a significant decline in the chlorophyll content in plant leaves

>reduction in the oxidizing power of plant roots

>reduction in the size of the plant both above and below ground

>an accumulation of concentrated perchlorates in the leaves


>The report noted that one of the types of plant studied seemed resistant to the perchlorates and could be used to help remove the toxins in its environment, **although the plants themselves would end up containing a high concentration of perchlorates as a result.**",Mirrirr,2019-04-21 15:41:55

The Martian checks all of those same boxes. I'm sure the typical engineer finds it real exciting to read about one of their own being stranded on Mars and all his clever engineering solutions to problems. 

The problem with the book comes from weak prose, a poor (or deliberate lack) of understanding of character development, and overall the narrow focus on this book. It knows it's audience (the typical STEM major/Redditor/engineer) and goes for that. ",Johnny_Welfare,2015-01-22 21:30:38
2tap4s,"I don't think you're off base. I've read all three of the books you mentioned, and it's definitely fair to put Ready Player One and The Martian in the same category. Personally, I enjoyed them because they were both easy, fun reads and for whatever reason the flaws of both books did not annoy me even though the same flaws in other books often drive me nutty! The Martian is probably better on all technical fronts, however, so it's going to annoy you less than RP1. I'd say if you already have a strong interest in space, read The Martian, but if you don't, it's fine. 

Also, Ancillary Justice (and the sequel) is amazing! Great choice as an alternative two either book. *Especially* if you're looking for something with great characters and a lot of heavy stuff to think about.",RobbStark,2015-01-22 20:41:43
2tap4s,"They are quite different, but thinking about it the comparison to Ready Player One might be actually be a good one. I feel like they are at a similar level, or targeted at a similar audience, or *something*, but can't quite put my finger on what it is. For what it's worth, I liked Ready Player One, but didn't think it was really anything special. The Martian certainly doesn't have any more depth, and in a sense just replaces nostalgic video game references with sort of NASA-junky simple physics and chemistry-based problem solving. Both are a fun read, but you aren't going to come out with any kind of deeper understanding or broadened worldview.",JMGurgeh,2015-01-22 20:31:43

2tap4s,"As one of those book snobs, I'll offer my two cents.

First, it's not so much that I ""can't comprehend"" an engineer would talk and act like Mark Watney; it's that I don't believe the book ever went beyond this shallow characterization or probed past his juvenile antics to show any emotional depth or nuance, given the life or death situation he was in. There was nothing to him beyond the dumb humor and the methodical thinking about survival, yet I can't imagine how even a nerdy engineer, but particularly one capable of being selected as an astronaut, would be quite so flat, would remain so emotionally unaffected by the isolation, would be so unreflective.

But that builds to something bigger: Most lovers of literature--us so-called book snobs--usually want something more than just surface-level entertainment and nuggets of passing knowledge in our reading. We're typically looking for something that grapples with big questions about life, something that makes a statement about the human condition, something that rattles or rallies us, something that makes us feel and think (about more than technicalities) hours/days/weeks/years later, something that is art and not just entertainment.

To me, The Martian did little more than entertain (and even that was dully executed). It had no higher purpose for me. I finished reading and thought, ""Well, I have nothing substantial to take away from that. Mark Watney was a knowledgeable but otherwise dipshit astronaut who managed to live for a time on Mars and crack stupid jokes. It hasn't affected me. I can't do anything with it."" AND ""I doubt Andy Weir was really aspiring to anything other than an entertaining novel, which is fine, I guess...but I want books that offer more than that...and it's a shame because the premise of this book is such that there could've been something really rich and literary here."" ",,2015-01-22 23:13:08
2tap4s,"That's not why ""book snobs"" bash The Martian, and it sounds like you're choosing to forget all the stupid snappy one-liners sprinkled throughout the book.",hngbls,2015-01-22 22:45:41
2tap4s,"> Watney was the Bella Swan of The Martian. Teenage girls put themselves in Bella. Engineers put themselves in Watney. Same principle.

I don't think I've seen this book summed up more perfectly than in those few words so far, haha, kudos!",dejafous,2015-01-22 23:29:16
2tap4s,"Wouldn't the books that are typically considered of better quality be books that specifically target a different audience, i.e. the typical liberal arts major?

The Martian obviously isn't great in every aspect, but the things that it concentrates on are areas I find most literary writers ignore.  I haven't seen any prose writers that are tackling near-future technology and space exploration.",pipboy_warrior,2015-01-22 22:28:52

2tap4s,"> First, it's not so much that I ""can't comprehend"" an engineer would talk and act like Mark Watney; 

If anything the portrayal is too easy to believe, too banal. So many people are like this it's not especially entertaining. They're in real life, all across literature, and even within the book itself. 

The rare glimpses we get into Weir's other characters all fall into two very flat archetypes. Comic heroes who alternate their witty one-liners with stoicism/competence, and a couple foils who are just their humorless clones reminding them not to joke around all the time. 

I believe Weir said he didn't know anything about human psychology and purposely avoided it. The class clown bit is to lampshade the utter lack of psychological impact on his characters. Entertaining sure but not at all literary or insightful. 

Good news is anyone who defends the themes or characters in The Martian can probably be introduced to a lot of scifi they'd find better in that regard. ",NotJustinTrottier,2015-01-23 14:10:43
2tap4s,"Why is it insulting? I think it's very clear that he wrote exactly the book that he wanted, and a lot of people obviously really wanted that too. Not every book needs to strive to be an immortal piece of art, filled with characters that struggle with the human condition. When I get burned out reading Cormac and Pynchon and [insert critically acclaimed author here], I read stuff like *The Martian*, and I'd be pissed if there weren't any books like that!

I don't want Guardians of the Galaxy to include angsty moments delving into the emotional trauma of the genocide Thanos is perpetuating, just so it could pick up an Oscar. I want one-liners and high-fives and cheesy soundtracks! 

That being said, I do agree with you that it suffers for not including character depth and real emotion, but I think Weir did that knowingly (as he states) because he was going for a particular mood and narrative that  he executed well.",,2015-01-22 22:09:04

The book was very highly recommended by people I trust and thus I was very excited to read. Unfortunately reading the very first internal monologue of the protagonist triggered the ""I have a bad feeling about this"". I was sincerely hoping this is just authors oversight.

I’d say you’ll prefer The Martian is you like “could potentially happen” sci-Fi. Whereas Project Hail Mary is more “out there” on the believability scale. Still great fun and the science seems thought through (it’s more that the concepts are a bit implausible). So if you want a bit of a wilder ride go for Project Hail Mary.

I do agree though that it was basically Mark Watney 2.0. - but that was also kinda what I was wanting so I’ll give it a pass. The challenge will be to see if Weir can write a good sci-Fi without the same snarky, genius protagonist if he writes another book.",Ciaobellabee,2021-05-24 18:24:27

They could even make the story better by making him confuse who he is. All mission docs refers to DuBois, making him think he is DuBois.

I'm okay  with the science being less ""realistic"" compared to The Martian. I would consider this book in the category of scientific First Contact, like Rendezvous with Rama or Contact. Some liberties were made especially with the alien technology (Xenonite) and culture. But the book still provides some interesting discussions, such as the alien physiology and evolution.

I may be biased as I'm a huge fan of stories where we explore the possibilities of alien evolution and cultural development (like Children of Time and Rama series).

On the protagonist being Mark Watney 2.0. I would say the reason I picked up this book is because I'm expecting Mark Watney-like MC. That's basically Andy Weir's selling point by now. Could it be better, of course. Is it a bad thing, I don't think so.",rendyanthony,2021-05-25 04:38:50

The Martian: A+. Sure, it's not great literature commenting on the meaning of life, but it is a gripping story with plenty of humor and one of the best examples of modern hard sci-fi. 

Artemis: C. The flaws here are obvious, and the characters are very unbelievable. Still, if you like Weir's tone and can ignore the flaws, it can be a pleasant experience for a niche audience. Don't expect The Martian, though.

Project Hail Mary: B+. A step towards The Martian in quality, but not quite there. Definitely got a bit predictable at times, and the protagonist is a little unbelievable >!Okay, so a failed academic biologist burns out by publishing a truly wacky fringe science theory now becomes the savior of the human race? Oh and he's also kept his calculus and physics skills up, because we know how extraordinarily useful those are in both biology and middle school!!< Weir's goals were also completely transparent to me. You can hear him thinking >!How do I tell a plausible story about first contact? Oh I know, let's invent a crisis that requires interstellar travel but also enables it on a reasonable timeline!< and >!How do I add more emotion and character flaws to this story? Oh, I know let's have Grace make a stupid mistake resulting in a catastrophe that mortally endangers Rocky. Great, now that that that's done, back to the plot.!< Still the plot is unique and the story is thought provoking. Love how he >!invents mundane distinctions between the Eridians that make both races appreciate each other's natural talents!<.

The more I read, the more I wanted to know about everything in the story. >!Difficult choices made late in the story are the true heart of the book (and I believe the basis of the book's title) yet still believable in context of what occurs. The protagonist has 'six pack abs' because the ship computer ensured his muscles were stimulated throughout the many years trip to tau ceti.

But then again, I thoroughly enjoyed Artemis, which seems to be an unpopular opinion here. So maybe I just can't recognize good sci-fi.

Here's a good description of it from [The Guardian's review of Artemis:](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/15/artemis-andy-weir-review-the-martian)

>As in The Martian, Weir’s is a prose entirely without aesthetic ambition, flat and cheerful and a bit sweary. Nabokov it ain’t. Take the novel’s opening paragraph: “I bounded over the gray, dusty terrain toward the huge dome of Conrad Bubble. Its airlock ringed with red lights stood distressingly far away.”  
>  
>A creative writing teacher might look at that, count the six adjectives/adverbs in its line-and-a-half and suggest cutting a few of them. But then again, said creative writing teacher certainly won’t have sold 5m copies of their debut novel, or they wouldn’t be supplementing their income teaching creative writing. If Weir wants to describe an explosion by saying: “the harvester exploded like … exploded”, then no one is going to stop him. Discovering a sentence as awkward as “life’s a pain in the ass when you have a cop constantly on your ass” in their first draft, another writer would wince and reach for the revising pencil.

The only difference is one is set in space.

The Martian, on the other hand, is a fictional narrative that relies on science that is actively being developed as we speak. The international space station is already researching and experimenting with growing plants in extraterrestrial environments. Hardware currently exists for the Orion spacecraft that will take the first men and women towards Mars. It's all within our grasp if we can just cut the red tape.

Time dilation, space travel, first contact are all expressed in highly technical detail in books like The Forever War, Expanse, Foundation, Old Mans War and even some indie space writers. 

In the Martian there was a certain despair that persisted throughout. Desperation with a small chance of survival. It added weighting to decisions made even if they failed. 

The critical issues faced in this book were so rapidly overcome, that there was little time to feel the gravitas of one issue before the next arised. It felt like it was written as a technical sequence of events to be resolved. 

The lack of comms with Earth I think also hurt this book for me.   Furthermore the ""AI"" angle that he woke up to became almost irrrelevant after a certain point. If a  narrow AI (medical) was available, they could have done far more for the ship wih another nav based narrow AI. Instead he was left reading physical interfaces trying to work things out.

I get that perspective, but boy do I disagree with the sentiment.  We need more hard science, less pseudoscience. And not just write books about scientists because the non-science side of their lives is interesting.

There's a serious problem with the lack of representation of science in entertainment because most writers don't have the background to write about science. Nor do they take the time to research the science like they would the other aspects of the subjects they're writing about.

""Since they collaborated on the audiobook, both of their careers took a great turn. 

For Weir, ""The Martian"" ended up a Hollywood hit, with Matt Damon starring as Watney, and Weir also penned another hit space novel, called ""Artemis"" (Crown Publishing, 2017). Meanwhile, Bray expanded his sci-fi audio readings and is now the narrator of 250 books. With the rising success of both the site and the book, the audiobook company Audible looked to obtain the original audiobook of ""The Martian.""

""So, Audible came in and said, 'We'll give you a pile of money for the [audiobook] rights.' I've personally always been a fan of huge piles of money,"" Weir said. But Audible was unable to come to an agreement with Podium to purchase the audiobook, and when the company asked Bray to rerecord the work, it couldn't meet his new budget, Weir explained.""",desrtrnnr,2022-10-18 19:59:57

So: no style (badly written), offers little or no emotional insight into the character, but it tries to be scientific (well, this is the part that the author mostly excels). Sci-Fi is **literature** or it should strive to be, since it's a genre of it. Where's the literature in this? I don't know.

4r5fed,"On the other hand, I personally think it is a GREAT example of how to turn a full book into a single movie without screwing it up, and should be studied by aspiring screenplay writers.

A truly literal ""port"" of the book to the screen would result in something like a 12 to 20 hours mini-series, with uneven pacing and narrative due to the different medium.  You would have breaks in action to launch into mini 'how-to' discussions, etc.   The loss of detail is inevitable.

Drew Goddard's screenplay had to work with the limitations of packing everything roughly into 2.5 hours max, keeping the pacing up, and making the narrative devices seem natural (ex: opening scene gives you names of every crew member).  It took a lot of careful reduction and tightening to keep spirit and theme of the book and shape of the story arc intact, while making it accessible and engaging for a wide(er) audience.  There were things the movie medium could show better/differently than a book that they did take advantage of[Spoilers about the Martian Movie](#s ""like showing Mark's change in diet or physical deterioration without calling them out, or sitting outside looking at Mars after the supply rocket failed."" ) 

It's one of the only times I can think of where a movie adaptation came out without a major departure from the book in tone or overall plot (we can debate the Iron Man scene, but they did get the numbers mostly right).

But it’s badly written,  even cringey in some places. The parts on earth, and especially dialogue with female characters… You don’t have to write badly to have global appeal, don’t need to have characters state their job titles and relationship to the people they are speaking with constantly…  

But I can easily overlook that. It was his first book, and released online it had little input from editors?  And he can join the long list of male authors that are shit at writing female characters, reducing them to cliches.

When it comes to Weir’s skill as a writer, he is severely lacking.  I also question the breadth of his imagination, as PHM was essentially The Martian 2.0.

I'm a 34 year old former military former social worker turned electrical engineering student and mom. I read your book during a semester I took off to co-op at one of the country's largest R&D facilities and felt completely unequipped for the level of genius there and had the whole impostor syndrome thing going on. 

I listened to your book on audio when I couldn't read it and I read it every chance I could. I loved it from the first page. I used to get lost in books all the time when I was a kid. I needed to then. But as I've gotten older it's much harder to find books that completely take me away. The Martian did immediately. More than once it lifted me from my self-doubt to a complete and total enthusiasm and love for engineering. Every page affirmed my decision to become an electrical engineer. 

It is to date one of my all time favorite books. Stephen King said something in one of the Dark Tower series books about how people should have the courage to do what they're put here on earth to do. So I just wanted to thank you for having that courage. I look forward to my time with Artemis as soon as this semester is finished.

Edit: Forgot to mention how thoroughly I enjoyed the lack of overly emotional interpersonal drama in The Martian. You chose the harder route of entertaining us with pure problem solving. It was refreshing!",runningSalmon,2017-12-04 19:43:48

One of the things that I loved most about Artemis was that you put a lot of thought into the *economics* of why people are on the moon and why certain companies would have interests there (can't say much more without spoilers, of course).

So, for the Artemis movie, do you see the screenwriters massaging the Jazz-Svoboda interactions into a real relationship or allowing it to bloom more within the story?
To expound, the Jazz-Svoboda relationship in the book was interesting because it really helped humanize Jazz. You did a wonderful job of creating chemistry and tension between the two of them without it becoming sloppy or overcooked.

In the book, when Mark Watney makes the journey from the hab to Ares 4, do you think the radiation exposure would be lethal?

Coming to the movie, did you like the ending, with Mark making an incision in his suit to use it as a thruster to get to Hermes? As an Aerospace engineering student, this seemed a tad unrealistic for an otherwise wonderful (and accurate) movie.

When Artemis came up in my suggested readings, I read the free sample because the biok wasn't available for another day.

Wow. What. Fun. 
Funny, thrilling, funny, entertaining, funny and chock full of cool science.
Did I mention funny?
Now that the joyride is over, I immediately negan reading The Martian.
Wow. What. Fun.

You deserve your success and as I continue to immerse myself into this book, I am ragerly awaiting your next idea.

If anyone else hasn't read it here, it's worth a read even if you've seen the movie. And the movie is good! A bit more ridiculous, but still very fun.


People are mentioning Weir's other recent novel, Artemis. It has the same writing style as The Martian, so it feels familiar. I liked it ok, but I also understand why it gets mixed reviews. It's very fun and you have to be open to the fact that it's a bit of a mystery/crime novel set on the moon, but it gets a bit more ridiculous at times. That being said, Weir does a brilliant job of creating an entire world that somehow feels completely alien to us while still being familiar. That's not easy to do, so he deserves credit, even if the story falls a little flat at times.

>“I’m pretty much fucked.”

The book helped me to break out of what I assume was the early stage of a serious depression. ""I’m pretty much fucked."" was not only the opening of the book but pretty much my own starting position and state of mind. I started reading The Martian mostly to see where the book would be going from that point on and was hooked,  I finished it in a really short amount of time and afterwards I listened to the audiobook a couple of times more. Something about Watney not just sitting there and waiting for some miraculous help but facing his situation head on really helped me getting my shit together during that time. I probably wouldn’t be the person I am today if it wasn’t for The Martian, which is kinda strange because I’ve read tons of stuff about depression, meditation and general life advices but nothing of it resonated with me. I guess sometimes it’s not just the message but the way it is presented that helps you and The Martian really clicked for me. I lost 90lbs, started doing sport again, I socialized again and I got myself a new not so dead-end-job.

b4fhmc,"This is weird!

I was never a reader. I won't get into it but a sudden stream of motivation changed my life about a year or so back. I changed a lot of habits: health, fitness and education. And I wanted to start reading.

Eating properly, doing exercise and reading where three of the habits I wanted to make part of my life permanently, those were top priority. Turns out good eating habits and going to the gym take a lot of effort, specially if you go from eating whatever you want all day and sitting on the couch to calorie counting and gym three days a week. So I told myself I would start reading when those two where just routine and not a drag anymore.

I eat consciously almost all the time, I give myself treats and all, I just try to keep it below a calorie threshold. The gym? Never skip unless completely necessary. Education is going pretty good too by the way.

Now was the time to start reading so I bought a kindle and downloaded ""The Martian"". The kindle was to tell myself ""Hey it's not going to get easier than this, also you already invested a bunch of money, might as well make it all worth it!"". I picked ""The Martian"" because I had watched the movie, I thought it was a pretty cool concept and I watched it a couple of years back so I didn't remember the story details. Turns out is a great book, fucking gripping and all, I have been reading it since thursday (it's saturday when I'm writing this) and the kindle says I'm 65% through so that's a good sign in my book.

Talking of books, I use reddit every day so I checked r/books today to see what's up, since I'm a reader now and all ;) and this is the first post I see. It's a sign!

The scientific elements are interesting and engaging but the imagery, character development etc just isn’t there. It’s good that the thing is called the Martian because the main character simply isn’t human. He’s the authors idea of an edgy, mechanical and endlessly, obnoxiously sarcastic super-geek whose most humanizing line is something along the lines of ‘i guess im fucked, now!’ The whole thing reads like what it is, fan fiction by a geek written for the internet.

The conversations between the shy boy and the main character are so unbelievable. The dialogue wouldn’t even fit in a YA novel. It was written like the author had never actually had a conversation with a female before so he just had to make his best guess at what it looked like. The main character’s ‘sexy’ talk was so abrupt and lacking meaning of any kind that all it does is jolt the reader out of the story and make them ask ‘why is she talking about this at all?’ Her sex talk contributed zero to the story, it didn’t do anything to develop her character other than to make her seem like a normal girl who weirdly inserted sexual stories into her every day conversation. The plot is so cookie cutter that you can see the ending coming a mile away. The mechanics are so cut and dry simple and you’re spoon fed throughout the entire book.

The way the dialogue was written was so unbelievable, no one talks like that. And the weird nerd gatekeeping lines about how Star Wars was his fave movies (except the prequels OBVIOUSLY) we're so cringey. 
Artemis was even worse, though the setting was interesting.

> Her sex talk contributed zero to the story, it didn’t do anything to develop her character other than to make her seem like a normal girl who weirdly inserted sexual stories into her every day conversation. 

Some women are like that, especially if it's more of a train-of-thought and not something actually said.  I know some guys are like that, as well.  Andy claimed to get significant advice about how to write from a female's point of view and had it reviewed a number of times. In my opinion, it did help develop the character -- it helped portray her as a normal person just going through daily life doing, well, whatever, and you get an unfiltered look at that.  IMO, contributed to make her look more rough-around-the-edges, which was crucial to her character arc.

2tyz6p,"Hi, Andy! I'll begin by saying that I just started your book this week, and it's totally absorbing. I was up way too late last night reading it. :D So I'm a fan. And I think it's going to make a great movie, so I'm excited about that.

**BUT**. Neither of those reasons are truly why I'm here. I'm *here* because when I saw your name on the AMA schedule I recognized it from many moons ago, back in my misspent youth, in which I read a truly irresponsible number of webcomics, one of which was *Casey & Andy*! I thought it was smart, and weird, and funny, and it got deliciously epic there after a while, and I missed it when it ended. I followed along with *Cheshire Crossing* as well, and thought it was a really awesome premise. And so I mainly wanted to drop by here say that seeing an old webcomicker make good warms the cockles of my cynical heart. :D

But seeing as how this is a question thread, I thought I'd ask: what do you think about the differences between the two mediums? Are there things you find easier in one than the other? Do you prefer writing fiction, or do you miss your comic-slingin' days? And in your plans for the future, are there any pictures involved, or do you plan to focus solely on your fiction?

Thanks for your time, and congratulations on all your success! I'm super proud of you, and *The Martian* is currently making me remember everything I liked about your work back in aught-seven. :) All the best!",Kneef,2015-01-28 17:45:14

> I've never been published. Tried, but it's hard to break in to, and writing's my hobby, so I don't put as much time in to it as a pro would.

Congratulations on making it to the big leagues! I can't imagine what it must feel like to watch a book you wrote get made into a Ridley Scott film.

For anyone who hasn't read The Egg, [I highly recommend it.](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) It's brief but poignant. One of my favorite short stories.

2tyz6p,"While the fact that Mark's stuck with mostly 70s stuff for entertainment makes for a hilarious running theme of the book, it seemed a bit unlikely to me that given the time period and how much storage has already advanced, that they wouldn't have just loads of stuff archived for everybody (in case they're not in the mood for what they consciously decided to bring), and that Mark himself would have pretty much all his favorite types of thing instead of (apparently, IIRC) just a little bit of music.  I guess that's not a question, so I'll questionify it: Was this an area you juggled the balance of 'realism vs story-entertainment-potential', or do you think there's a specific reason why they wouldn't take much in the way of digital media with them?

Still, loved the book.  I've heard you're going for a 'softer' more space opera story next and I look forward to checking it out, but I hope you'll bring some of the same level of thought and sticking to realism (perhaps given one completely imaginary development), either in that book or to another down the line.  

BTW, if the movie poster for the Martian doesn't have a guy on Mars in an EVA suit doing Travolta's ""Staying Alive"" dance pose, the marketers have done a  great disservice to marketting everywhere.  Or maybe I'm just an idiot for thinking that's a good idea.  ",starpilotsix,2015-01-28 17:04:46

Anyway, the questions I have for you are: 

* Do you have any concepts images for what the Mars Rover should look like? Since one doesn't currently exist, the best mental image I have is the rover from the NASA-published game Moonbase Alpha which looks like [this](http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/39000/ss_0a2737c1e130a51b3d415d55a7a80bb1d8b74fff.1920x1080.jpg) and [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__TLJIIetdPk/TEW4AGKPH2I/AAAAAAAAIA0/O7lopeJ5myA/s1600/MoonBaseAlphaGame%202010-07-19%2022-19-01-15.jpg). How close or far off is it?

* Is the MAV fuel generator that makes Hydrazine a real thing (or at least based on real chemistry)?

* When can we expect a Teaser or Trailer for the movie? I'm so looking forward to it now.

* Will your next work also be space related like another space mission or are you looking into writing about new things?

Thanks so much for doing this AMA. I bought and read your book on Amazon a little after it first came out, matter of fact, my review is on there still ;) Love your style, love The Martian, thank you so much for sharing it with the world!

I truly believe that your story will captivate damn near anyone who reads it, especially Sci-Fi fans.

2tyz6p,"Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA! I read The Martian while I was home for New Years and loved it. 

I'm excited for the movie, but I think one of my favorite parts will be lost in the transition of media - the use of narration. The occasions where Watney's story was told in third person as opposed to first person were extremely interesting to me from a storytelling perspective. Usually they came from the biggest, scariest moments. Each time the narration changed to that style, I could feel my stomach clench.

The Martian ranks up there at the top of my favorite books.


I have depression, so hearing someone narrate Mark Watney's final entry about not giving up really gave me a bit of motivation to keep doing things when it felt kind of pointless to keep going.


Did you base his character off of anyone you know?

2tyz6p,"Thanks for this AMA and the best book I've ever read! 

I assume at some point during writing you saw the Martian as a movie.  If so, how did you imagine the scenes where technical concepts are explained?  

Personally, I imagined some cool special effects showing the detail of what happened, and Mogan Freeman 
narrating what's going on.  For instance, when a bolt breaks a super close up showing the crack form and then the frame zipping along as it propagates like a canyon below the camera!

2tyz6p,"Great book! It is all too rare these days to find a good book I could sit down with and stay interested in (Ready Player One was the last), but yours stood out to me. I'm very glad I picked it up. Excellent story worthy of a movie!

First question: Will there be a sequel involving their journey home to Earth? If not, I was secretly hoping to see the girl that discovered Mark was alive, Mindy Park, would eventually end up with Mark in the end once he touched down on Earth. I admit I was disappointed to not hear about Mark touching down on Earth in the end of the book, but figured it was to open the way to continuing the story. Mark and Mindy, 70s/80s sitcom reference?

Second question: I'm a hobbyist board game designer and a big fan of board gaming in general. Have you ever considered approaching someone about a board game interpretation of 'The Martian'? Perhaps a co-operative game where one player is Mark and the others are the crew, or mission control? I'm not saying me, just in general. One of the first things I thought of given my hobby is how this would make a great asymmetrical co-op game.",,2015-01-28 19:40:04

I'm a (casually) aspiring writer myself, and one thing I've been writing actually has a very similar writing style to The Martian in that it's intended to be like a first person blog from the apocalypse and is quite laid back and humorous too. I read that you started off The Martian as a web blog and then once it became more popular you published it and then got a deal; could you please tell me if that route is something you'd suggest to an aspiring author?

The technical problems and action scenes are very engaging but the characters fall kinda flat. It wasn't such a problem in The Martian because the singular focus on Mark gave him time to develop and allowed Weir's own sarcastic, quipy voice just become Marks voice, but in Artemis every character sounds like that so they don't feel distinct. Also, I feel like I now know more than I would like about Weir's ideal sexual partner. The story structure was also kinda week. The big problem of the last few chapters feels like it was contrived just as an excuse to give the protagonist a chance to demonstrate her arc. The ending felt sort of unearned.

I honestly think a Martian sequel would have been easier for him to pull off because it wouldn’t have required him to grow as a writer.

It wasn’t what some of his fans wanted, but ultimately, his decision to challenge himself and his readers will lead to a long and successful career for him.

It's pretty hard not to compare it to the Martian when he wrote Jazz almost exactly like him, but a girl^tm

I mean to be honest the plot, pacing, and world building were decent, but the character writing was just absolutely shallow.

I wouldn't even call the story that much different from the Martian in terms of the overarching themes. They both are heavily reliant on the ""ingenuity savior"" trope where both Watney and Jazz use their (in the case of Jazz, overly fantastic) scientific knowledge to operate/solve all problems they face.

Watney, quite simply, has no ability to write women from an introspective sense (he writes women well when he doesn't have to create their thoughts. ""I had to admit, I looked sexy"", is next level cringe IMO.).

She actually reminded me quite a bit of punk, ""one-of-the-guys"" girls I've known. But, I've read a lot of criticism about how Weir wrote a female lead, so I can see how it can seem ridiculous. 

I also agree about the parallels between Jazz and Mark - I also noticed that _once again_, Weir has an im-brilliant-but-fuck-you-society lead, but with edge and angst turned up.

I still enjoyed the book. Contrary to the other comments here, I actually _loved_ the world-building in the first half, and the story wore on me. It never had the same kind urgency as The Martian.

A movie has to be done in 2 hours and is typically seen as flawed if it doesn't steadily build towards the climax of the story, the rescue. A gradual, steady build followed by a long slow section before the end just doesn't work in the movie format.

I wish the Harry Potter movies could have included all of the book details and side stories that were dropped to really make it feel like a full year in the way that the book does, but that's just not possible in a movie. Same deal for The Martian.",chocoboat,2018-06-29 09:24:09

Also in The Martian, readers on both Amazon and Goodreads have criticized the prose in that a lot of the sentence structures are simply repeated, especially the ~ing sentence, which Andy Weir is known for using multiple times in a row, sometimes even having a full paragraph of the same structure. (Example: Pulling off her gloves, she walked into the kitchen. Taking off her hat, she turned to face him.)

3oh70o,"Did you ever have a conversation about The Martian where you just said ""So Andy, how about you cut the science textbook stuff and just publish this as a short story in a sci-fi magazine, maybe get into an anthology?""",automator3000,2015-10-12 20:21:57
3oh70o,"Did you like The Martian? IMHO is a bit too ""cold"" and it does not let the reader feel empathy with the protagonist! what do you think about this book?",Mebimeka,2015-10-12 20:39:43
3oh70o,"Holy shit, The Martian had an editor? It is literally the same thing, 26 different times: a problem is introduced, and then something the reader was previously unaware of is introduced to solve the problem. That book could have been a 100 pages long and it would have had exactly the same literary impact.

I guess my question is, literarily speaking, what is the substantive difference between Mark Watney using a lever to un-flip his flipped Rover and Mark Watney using an iridium catalyst to turn hydrazine into H2 and N2? Exactly, there is no difference. He uses a middle-school level scientific principle to solve a crisis that isn't a crisis. If the Martian had had an editor at all I would have expected a lot more red pen through sections of the same scenario playing out over, and over, and over again. 

edit: AND ALSO!!! Holy shit, I can't believe I missed this the first time. How the hell did no one have the heart to tell Ernest Cline he had accidentally written Ender's Game again, even though he actually references it in Armada? Are authors literally nothing but brand names now? Is that why that book sold? I seriously don't get it. ",logos__,2015-10-12 21:10:24
3oh70o,"> The Martian and Ready Player One haven't really been advertised as Young Adult literature. Is there a reason for that? 

We never dared to dream they would cross over to YA audiences so well when we published them! 

> Do you take into account the audience when editing to appeal to a certain group, or do you generalize it so that it appeals to everyone?

Neither. I mostly just try to make it the book I would most want to read. The fact that both The Martian and RPO have found such big YA audiences maybe says something about my maturity level that I don't want to examine too closely. ",julian_pavia,2015-10-12 22:02:16
3oh70o,"> what kind of information used to be in the original RPO that you found to be quite enticing but irrelevant to the story that you had to cut? 

I honestly can't think of any specific examples any more! Sorry, it's been a while. I'm sure there were some, but in my memory, any cuts were mostly about trying to get those opening chapters flowing as quick as possible. Plus maaybe a time or two that he headed off to explain a reference at length :) But in general, Ernie is very story-focused and very respectful of narrative structure. 

> In all books, what was something that the authors are adamant in keeping in the story?

Authors love to ""show their work."" They want to get all their research, or their world-building, onto the page. Understandably, because it's often stuff they've spent hundreds of hours on. One of the remarkable things about The Martian is how much restraint Andy showed in that respect! How much of that stuff ultimately stays and how much goes is a bit of a balancing act, and a matter of taste. 

> edited a book that did not ultimately get published. 

This is pretty rare. When you see it, it's generally with non-fiction that's being written by people who are not primarily writers. Celebrities, stuff like that. ",julian_pavia,2015-10-12 19:06:59
3oh70o,"The Martian is the only book I've picked up quite that way. But another of my authors, Peter Clines (his most recent book is The Fold) I also first came across in the Kindle store, when he was being published by Permuted Press. 

And back before ebooks were a real thing, I worked with Scott Sigler, who had self-published successfully. 

Oh, and I'm currently working with Blake Crouch (author of the Wayward Pines trilogy) who self-published for a bit before being published by Amazon! 

And I've reached out to a handful of self-pubbed and small-press writers over the years, hooked a couple of them up with agents, so forth.

Given the backlash against his second book and trying to write a different character/do new things creatively - and how similar his third book is to his first - there's probably a good chance Weir will just be writing the same book over and over from now on.

177pzyu,"Sounds like you prefer science fantasy over science fiction if we’re being technical. Science fantasy takes ideas of science and does whatever it wants with it, regardless of implications to real science and generally doesn’t take the approach of explaining it’s tech. Science fiction generally is a fictional book with scientific parameters that are plausible in the real world of science. At least that’s always been my understanding of it. The Martian (and Project Hail Mary) both go to extensive lengths to explain how their “science” works. The Martian being more plausible than PHM but still there’s a need by the author to explain the why. The Martian is definitely still sci-fi as while it’s all technically plausible it doesn’t exist yet and hasn’t been proven to be factual, so thus it’s fictional. 

Science fantasy gets thrown in with sci-fi for organizational purposes but yeah based off of what you read I recommend the Red Rising series. First 3 are amazing books, didn’t like the start to the 2nd trilogy so I haven’t read 5 or 6 but heard good things about them still",jjand302,2023-10-14 14:49:40

177pzyu,"As a scientist I find the technical descriptions in the Martian or Project Hail Mary entertaining. I like thinking about the details of the challenges that humans face when we venture into space.

That said, if you don’t like reading about these technical details, I think that’s totally fine. There are certain topics that I think we all have an obligation to read about because we have to make choices about how our government responds to them. For example: race, class, justice, sociology, and economics. The greatest works of literature focus on these topics and illustrate valuable lessons about them.

The Martian and Hail Mary don’t fall into that category, or at least many of their chapters don’t fall into that category. They dedicate large sections to detailed discussions of physics and biochemistry. I think the world would be a better place if more people had a basic understanding of these topics but I think Andy Weir’s works delve into them at a deeper level than is necessary for most people; space colonization just isn’t impotent to most of us. If that topic doesn’t interest you, that’s totally fine. I don’t think you should beat yourself up over that.

Seveneves, particularly the second half, gets into highly speculative science concerning genetics and physics, but it's one of the things that makes Stephenson so good at what he does.

I don’t know if Foundation has a name in style other than classic, but I consider it more traditional or ideas based sci fi — something in the world changes and how do people react or how does it change our world.

I think that Andy Weir's approach to sci fi is to explain a lot of what is going on in real scientific terms, as opposed to sci fi that just tosses around a bunch of made up technical jargon that doesn't mean anything. I think for those that like him, that attempt at being more realistic and grounded in actual science is part of the appeal. If you don't like it, you don't like it. 

His characters not being realistic and how he writes women is a common criticism.

Personally, I think Project Hail Mary was way more enjoyable than the Martian. You could try that one instead if you're interested, but I think it's going to have the same problems for you that The Martian has.",DrRansom7469,2024-01-30 16:43:26
1aes1zj,"I completely agree with you, I couldn't finish it. Way too repetitive and dry and technical. I wouldn't let it deter you from sci-fi, The Martian is like science fiction in its most literal sense. There's so much stuff out there that's a lot more imaginative and interesting. It's a genre of 'what ifs'. Phillip K Dick, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke, Larry Niven, Harlan Ellison, just read around until you find something you like.",syzygys_,2024-01-30 19:40:23

I can totally understand that someone not coming from that background would find the book to be a whole lot less interesting.  And there’s nothing wrong with that.  I’d find a book about the intricacies of finance, or politics, or academia, to be pretty boring.",Sirwired,2024-01-31 00:05:07

1aes1zj,"I find it funny that it’s so popular on this sub. 

I remember being excited to read The Martian because the plot sounded so good — the emotional stakes of being stuck on a planet by yourself with no clear way home! I was picturing an epic tale of despair and human resilience. But it was a giant disappointment in that regard. There are no emotional stakes that I recall. And yeah, the female characters were terribly written. 

I think it’s a book engineers and scientists can appreciate for the engineering and science, but it doesn’t go much deeper than that. ",rhubarbara42,2024-01-30 16:29:29
1aes1zj,"This is very much not what most sci-fi is like. I personally really love hard sci fi, at least to a point. The problem I have with The Martian is it has bad narrative structure. Tension is introduced. Tension gets resolved. Rinse and repeat. If you want something which actually works the whole story building to a conclusion you have to look elsewhere. Neal Stephenson can be very very good (though he isn't always). William Gibson is a genius, and maybe my favorite writer living today, though a lot of people complain that his endings are kinda abrupt. Andy Weir writes passably entertaining science fiction vignettes, but to me that's really all it is. A series of vignettes. Which makes it hard to really care over the course of an entire novel.

He's not terrible, mind you. Just not for me, and it seems like not for you. If you want to read a great book which is similarly serious science fiction but with a much better narrative structure (and frankly much better prose), I would recommend William Gibson's The Peripheral. Or if you're cool with being kinda confused for the first half of a (short) novel, Neuromancer is wonderful and it has two great sequels.",Noth1ngOfSubstance,2024-01-31 00:33:08
1aes1zj,"Different strokes for different boats. Some people enjoyed it, some might not.

For what it's worth, I'm a hard-SF buff myself, with an extensive library of near-future space travel books. And I also wasn't particularly impressed by the book. It doesn't help that I'd actually read at least two SF novels with a similar premise (human crew in the early 21st century is stranded on Mars and has to modify their gear to survive until rescue) before, so it didn't have much novelty for me. I think a lot of the book's appeal *was* in its novelty--a lot of people came to the hard SF genre without background in it and were impressed by those details. But if you already know how the Sabatier reaction, the Fischer-Tropsch process, the Haber process, etc. work and how they could be done on Mars, it loses some of its shine. *The Martian* is a rare case where I think the movie was better than the book, because Matt Damon's natural charisma helps elevate Watney past the fairly flat character he was on the page. 

The two novels I mentioned, which you might find more appealing, are ""First Landing,"" by Robert Zubrin, and ""The Martian Race,"" by Gregory Benford. The first is tinged a bit with Zubrin's...peculiar politics (he has a personal hatred of environmentalism, so they're the baddies whose sabotage causes the stranding), but it's not *too* intrusive. The second is more about what the crew finds on Mars.",ThatcherSimp1982,2024-01-30 16:31:37

Something just off the top of my head, *Rendezvous with Rama* by Arthur C. Clarke might be fun? It's about a group of astronauts sent out to recon a giant alien thing that comes into Earth's outer orbit. You know from the start that it's intelligent life. It's a fun read.


I definitely suggest suggestmeabook! I've gotten great recommendations from them a few times, and I follow because they get some unique questions that it's interesting to see. I read many new books from there all the time!

from Wikipedia:

As 1999 approached, the fictional future written into the first 
edition was in jeopardy, so the work was revised and a 1997 edition was 
published to advance all of the dates by 31 years (with the plot running
 from 2030 to 2057 instead of 1999 to 2026). 

The 1997 edition added ""November 2033: The Fire Balloons"" and ""May 2034: The Wilderness"", and omitted ""Way in the Middle of the Air"", a story considered less topical in 1997 than 1950.

The 1997 edition of Crónicas Marcianas included the same revisions as the U.S. 1997 edition.

In 2009, the Subterranean Press and PS Publishing published The Martian Chronicles: The Complete Edition that included the 1997 edition of the work and additional stories under the title ""The Other Martian Tales"".

No hate to geeky male scientists! Even the plotting of that book shows that he was approaching it as a scientist, not as a writer - a problem pops up, he tries X thing with details clinically listed, it fails in X way, he tries X other thing, it succeeds, a different problem pops up, rinse and repeat. Even though I enjoyed the book the writing itself definitely felt immature.",bishkebab,2021-11-16 19:44:23

There's just such a huge tonal disconnect between the character's dialog and the stakes of the book and it really sticks out like a sore thumb.

However, I thought the overall content and storytelling in the book was wonderful. And, I didn’t find it juvenile. As a Dad with young kids, I’ve had to dial back the language and sometimes youthful rhetoric just comes out even when the kids aren’t around. I think I actually appreciate that more now when I notice other people doing it. So the writing style appeals to a broader audience, and the content is very much fun for adults who are into space/ sci-fi. That’s just my opinion!

I personally found Watney to be annoying and awkward. I was so sick of his dumb cutesy one liners. The other characters felt flat and one dimensional, and the dialogue felt stilted.

Also, it seemed like almost every journal was some repetition of ""Craaaaaaap! Something terrible has happened! I am totally fucked! But wait! I have a extremely technical and complicated idea that will probably get me killed! I'm totally dead! Wish me luck! [next entry] Yay!! I'm not dead! Time for my 70s TV shows! lol disco sucks!"" and I got really bored with that really fast. That's basically how many exclamation points happen per journal entry, too. Something else that bothered me: If the main character is also the narrator, the writer needs to find a better way of increasing the tension besides saying ""I could die right now!"" No, you're not. I know you're not going to die. There's another 200 pages left and you're telling most of the story.

I was going into this book expecting it to be like, a harrowing Martian survival journal, and it's not that at all. I'm sure people will disagree on this point, that they liked the funny, quipped, light hearted take. But that's not what I wanted to read at all.

",thesugarskull,2015-06-28 14:55:30
3917vv,"I'll be talking a good bit about movie expectations in this post. I assure you that the movie talk is rooted in the book.

In Sci Fi movies there are several great stories. A friend listed off a top 5 list that he expected would conform to a majorities views. 2001 a Space Odyssey, Terminator 2, Alien(s?), Back to the Future, and Blade Runner. I can't really disagree with this list as these iconic movies are the ancestors of approaches to Sci Fi story telling. 

It was when I considered The Martian the book *against* these movies that it occurred to me. That The Martian movie could introduce a new approach to Sci Fi narrative. If the movie is able to successfully adapt the book then it would create it's own seat in movie story telling.

Now I should note that narrative in different mediums does not share the same lexicon of stories it can tell successfully. Some part of this is the nature of the narrative but a significant factor is a lack of proof. A single great entry can prove that things like it can work and more importantly show some insight into *how*. A great example being Discworld's (books) narrator/writers voice and how we can read a gentle segue into a scene. Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy (the movie adaptation) showed that a narrator in a movie comes off far more bluntly. My own conclusions are that different mediums *are* capable of telling the same stories but use fundamentally different toolsets.

So what is it that The Martian (book) does that's so interesting? So different then the iconic Sci Fi movies?  Is it the way the logs shape the narrative? How you develop an almost phone conversation where you are quickly informed of the general before being filled in to the details? Well it *would* cool if the movie is able to translate that and keep it interesting. No it isn't the logs. That's a surprisingly surface detail. No, it's the research.

Science Fiction in movies has been *very* willing to be Science Fantasy. To the point where in movie space it is very rare for there not to be glaring science holes. Often there is some fantastical and unreachable mystic quality that is part of the big lie. Look back on the list of 5 I presented above. Of the 4 the one that treats scientific accuracy the best is 2001 a Space Odyssey and that ends with a space baby.

More importantly none of those 5 attempt to *talk* science. Technobabble is readily used over research. A quick sentence to get the science over and then all the characters react to tell the audience how to feel. The narrative touches science as little as it can.

This is where The Martian (book) diverges so strongly. It *speaks* science but doesn't hang there. It does this by having the main character **summarize in plainspeak**. It translates the results so *the audience can follow along with the problem*. Instead of being totally reliant on the characters reaction to communicate the problem; a novel approach allows even the scientifically and mathematically disinclined can keep up.

To me this is the greatest part of The Martian. Something that is a result of the uniqueness of how Andy Weir wrote it. He did the research but isn't a scientist himself. He didn't just get it but had to break it down more simply for himself. He doesn't just assume we can't understand the numbers or that we would get it only from the numbers. He shows us the work and gives us a TLDR.

It is my high hope that the movie is able to find a way to integrate science fact into movie language. So that both mediums can add another tool into their toolboxes.

3917vv,"r/books: Where author's go to hear about what their book's cover should look like. 

I really enjoyed The Martian and I'm looking forward to being that dick who says ""The book was so much better..."" to everyone I know, repeatedly, when the movie comes out. 

I liked how Weir skirted the realm of deus ex machina to save Watney, but often used the same series of misfortunate events to put him in the shit to begin with.

The solid sci-fi base which I haven't seen in ages was great. Many authors simply set their story in space/have robots/futuristic dystopia, but don't go to great lengths to include the basis of good science in their fiction. Weir did this well.

My one critique would be more development of the rest of the crew. Though the emails Watney sends help the reader infer the camaraderie that was absent because of when the novel begins, I felt this could have occurred earlier in the book.

Best bit?
Weir/Watney uses the word *potato* like r/books uses *cover*",sparrowlasso,2015-07-06 03:58:45
3917vv,"The Martian was a pretty breezy read.  The technical focus of the writing as well as the exhaustively detailed accounts of Watney's problem solving process were meaty without leaving you feeling like you were reading a technical manual.  I thought the language was detailed enough to visualize the whole experience and there were a lot of passages where I could vividly imagine how uncomfortable the whole situation was for Watney. 

There were a few reasons I had trouble enjoying this book.  Weir avoided having to really develop Watney by putting him in crisis/problem-solving mode almost 24/7 with the other time being spent bantering with his mission control buddies or griping about too much disco/bad television.  The other members of the cast are either all well worn tropes who are really only tolerable in the long run because of their limited presence or harried mission control ops whose only roles are to help navigate the next apocalyptic misfortune.

I think The Martian is a well crafted story that is enjoyable if you approach it with expectations in check.  The geeks around my office are passing around my copy and they have unanimously praised it so Weir deserves credit for producing a very accessible and very engaging tale.",johnamoose413,2015-06-10 16:50:05

Can't wait to start reading some of Asimov's books, and I'm starting The Fold right now (Andy Weir's review of the book was on the back so I just had to read it). Has anyone finished the book already? Any other suggestions for great contemporary sci-fi novels similar to The Fold and The Martian?

As an engineer I love the scientific approach Watney takes to solve his numerous problems and the juvenile humor is engaging to the reader.

3917vv,"Wow, after reading The Martian I was linking a lot of stuff with Apollo 13 and wondering if anyone else noticed that as well. Like the power allotment problems.  Pretty cool. I'm on the path to becoming a mechanical engineer and this book is like porn for me.",,2015-08-11 03:26:07
3917vv,Thanks for that. I loved that scene in Apollo 13 and I will add The Martian to my reading list.  ,,2015-06-17 20:59:50
3917vv,"So it's not quite a traditional book, but I found *Lifeline* (interactive novel, on the App Store) similar to *The Martian* ... maybe a bit too similar (at first, anyway) (no spoilers) (kind of fun) (hope you don't mind waiting).",Aeiea,2015-06-18 14:44:51
3917vv,"First of all, I must say that somebody just copied your review of the book as a YouTube comment and he's running with it :) I'll reply here, knowing that it's reaching the original author... Haha!

I guess you're right. I had a similar thought, especially when Iris goes down. If he's rescued with Iris and I'm still on page 240 of 369, something else has to happen... but I've felt that with many books, even Jurassic Park and As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me. I used those 2 as examples coz one is scifi/fantasy/imaginative whereas the latter is a narrative log of real events, and this book is sort of a combination of both genres. You can always expect more story judging by the length of book remaining and life expectancy of the major characters. So, it's weird that you didn't like The Martian - coz there's nothing off the norm. 

Yeah, the way all the events were presented could've been better but I can't think of anything more efficient than the first-person's perspective in cases like this. It's more of an event log as it happens and is presented quite well. But he did skip over sols that had no events in them. It would've been quite boring to read ""Sol 123. Nothing interesting. Normal routine and tended to potato plants Sol 124. Same as yesterday. Sol 125. Same as before. Except, I think I slept a bit longer today."" LOL

>I was going into this book expecting it to be like, a harrowing Martian survival journal

I do think it is, especially if you're a NASA scientist who'll most likely have all the tools he mentioned. Manned missions already carried some of the stuff to the Moon (rover, rock drill, duct tape) and ISS has pretty much all the machinery (oxygen generators, vapor condensers & water recyclers) he talked about. Curiosity is already powered by a nuclear reactor (similar to the RTG) & the Dawn spacecraft is powered by an ion drive. So, if you were to have a disaster today, you *could* treat this book as a survival journal :)",boilerdam,2015-06-17 08:13:37
3917vv,"I read *The Martian* when it was a self-published title, before the New York Cartel picked it up. I'm curious as to how much philosophy you expected from a hard SF novel whose primary conflict is individual vs. nature, and is focused primarily on Mark Watney's struggle for survival. 

It's *Robinson Crusoe* on Mars. Too much philosophy would have bogged down the novel and ruined it, and too much philosophical meditation might have been out-of-character for somebody like Mark Watney.",,2015-07-15 15:43:45
3917vv,"The book is basically his dairy, it's not the author trying to be eloquent with his words (not one bit).

3917vv,"Absolutely agree.

I've never liked audio books.  They *bore* me, because they go so slow compared to a normal reading speed.  But I had a really long road trip the other week, by myself, so I decided to try one again.  I picked The Martian.

Holy crap, I loved it.  The reader was *amazing*, and really brought Watney to life in a way I didn't expect possible.  I absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed almost every single moment.

3917vv,"It has nothing to do with the prose being eloquent or not. The journal entries before the operation and after Charlie goes downhill are still well-written despite their lack of eloquence. Because they manage to be realistic while painting a nuanced portrait of the character even if the character itself is unaware or unable to articulate it. The Martian was written without regard for who the character really is and thus completely lacks the real conflict of the situation which is pressing on despite near certainty of death in complete and utter isolation. Instead we get ""Oh no I'm totally fucked. Wait lets science some shit. That did and didn't work. More science. Disco sucks. Horray I'm saved.""",,2015-07-30 19:43:28
3917vv,"> Because Mr. Weir has not done anything groundbreaking, he's just used science to fill in the pages here and there.

I've asked this before without a response but I'll try asking it again: What recent books have done what *The Martian* has done but better?  It was a fun read, and most readers seemed to legitimately like the science snippets that helped explain the various threats and resources that Watney was facing.

> I have to say, I enjoyed it as a quick page turner, something to be enjoyed while you're in a train or something. But people are trying to make it out to be something much grander than it really is- my issue.

azlnmc,The Martian Chronicles is probably one of the best-known and most-recommended science fiction “novels” in the Western sci-fi canon and has been considered so since it was published. How is it under appreciated? ,vondafkossum,2019-03-11 00:55:13
azlnmc,"It's the book that kicked-started my love for sci-fi, especially the Golden age of SF.

My uncle was taking a science-fiction class in high school and gave the book to me, along with an anthology edited by Isaac Asimov, and I was hooked.  At the time I was around 7 when I read it, but even though I've read a ton of Bradbury since then, *The Martian Chronicles* is still my favorite by him.

I even liked the cheesy 80s NBC mini-series, but I haven't seen it since I was a child so I doubt it holds up.",UltraFlyingTurtle,2019-03-11 00:17:33

I agree with you about Fahrenheit 451 and always wondered how the film got what it did from that story. BUT I loved The Martian Chronicles. I felt deeply for the Mars natives . Loved the picturesque narrative. Such a good book. ,bunso60,2019-03-11 15:24:20
azlnmc,I am not a Steinbeck fan and I loved the Martian Chronicles. I found it so engaging. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the Illustrated Man which was published a year or so afterwards. I feel like the writing was approachable and easy to get into. Yet I don't know if The Martian Chronicles is the baseline or the exception for Bradbury novels. I don't find some of his other novels as engaging as this collection. I feel that in many ways it stands the test of time. The stories provide social commentary with out being obtrusive in my opinion.  ,chucks_mom,2019-03-11 16:54:01
azlnmc,"Yeah, I'm trying to wrap my head around that headline. Ray Bradbury is widely hailed as one of the most important authors in the history of the genre, he's an author who has *transcended* the genre, and The Martian Chronicles is widely considered his magnum opus.

In recent years Fahrenheit 451 has become the better known book, but The Martian Chronicles remains a huge, *huge* landmark of the genre and one of the most praised novels of the 20th century, one that has repeatedly made lists of the best books of the century.

None of this is to knock OP.

As a huge Bradbury fan, I'm really glad they discovered this book and that they love it.

And I certainly agree with their thoughts. The book is remarkable and deserves all the praise it has gotten and then some.

Just saying it's *hardly* overlooked, is all. I wager that much like Lord of the Rings, this is one of those books that most bookstores will have by default, and for good reason: it's a beloved landmark work by any measure.",avoidgettingraped,2019-03-11 01:41:19
azlnmc,"I don’t agree on your assessment of 451 vs the chronicles.

The S.F. Hall of Fame nominated the fireman on its all time list when it was formed. It was the first adapted to a movie, and it was made into an unburnable book by the library of Congress.

On what are you basing the idea that the Martian chronicles had more notoriety? 

451 certainly has returned to the popular attention, both from the recent HBO adaptation, and the prescience of what media will become, but I don’t think there was ever a point where the chronicles approached its fame.

Something Wicked This Way Comes might also surpass the chronicles to be honest, as it’s been adapted twice and encapsulates Bradbury’s themes of imagination, nostalgia, childhood and the supernatural in a more distilled form than the “not quite a novel, not quite an anthology” that he was a master of.

",fistantellmore,2019-03-11 03:14:23

azlnmc,"I have read almost everything by Steinbeck. I don’t see why you would come to that conclusion in a post that is clearly not about John Steinbeck.

I stayed pretty plainly that East of Eden is indicative of the type of books that I typically read outside of sci-fi because the writing styles there and in The Martian Chronicles are very dissimilar.",SecretAgentIceBat,2019-03-11 16:19:51

The Martian Chronicles is very famous if you're a science fiction lover, but in the mainstream only a small percentage of people have ever heard of it--especially compared Fahrenheit 451 which is a household name at this point and assigned reading in many classes. So in that respect I agree with OP: Relative to Fahrenheit 451 The Martian Chronicles is very under-appreciated.
",eukel,2019-03-11 12:28:50
azlnmc,"Yeah, maybe my perspective here is just skewed. My love for sci-fi comes from my family, who were reading the golden era stuff as it was coming out, and I had never heard of this book until recently. I’m a grad student in science surrounded by people who love sci-fi and no one around me has read of it or heard of it, hence why I came here to talk about it.

I’m not upset at all but I am a little confused by the notion that it’s well known amongst everyone because that’s just not the case. I haven’t lived in a cave by any means and there are plenty of people, including myself until recently, who have no idea this book exists. I also meant it specifically in comparison to Fahrenheit, which I read while making my way through the Modern Library Top 100 where The Martian Chronicles does not appear.

I also searched before posting because I got shit for posting about East of Eden while reading that and before this the top post specifically about this book has under 200 upvotes, so even if it is renowned in some circles it didn’t appear to be discussed that often on here.",SecretAgentIceBat,2019-03-11 15:56:58

jkn3o9,"I read both books recently, and I have the exact opposite opinion.

I loved The Martian. It’s clever, thoughtful, and incredibly vivid. Each moment is well described and intricately crafted — often to a fault, in that if you don’t love the science you’re in for a slog. I do love the science, so it was great throughout for me. 

Though I see the parallels, I found Ready Player One to be almost the opposite. The main skill of the protagonist wasn’t science and technology, it was 80s pop culture. And rather than being constantly set with interesting problems that needed clever and realistic problem solving, the book name dropped obscurer and obscurer pop culture references which the protagonist was already an expert in. 

There were some cool moments where the RP1 protagonist solved a clever puzzle, but it was sullied by the “everyone in the world couldn’t solve this with unlimited resources and time” theme. There were 2 smart people in the whole world, the protagonist, and the guy who made the puzzles. 

Don’t get me wrong, RP1 was fun and easy to finish. But comparing it to the Martian is like comparing McDonalds to a quality steakhouse because they both serve beef.",andimus,2020-10-30 13:02:18

Artemis is a cheesy novel that feels like a writer trying to write a book.

When those specific areas are rendered in such fidelity and accuracy, they contrast wildly with the tropiness and cliches of the rest of the story. 

For The Martian, Watney's engineering exploits on Mars are really engaging, but any time the series involves institutions and their responses, it took me out of things. 

-NASA, the most open and transparent agency in the US government, is going to keep a secret that involves millions of dollars of resources under wraps for 2 years? Doesn't the NASA director go to tell Watney's parents their son is still alive? Or does he lie to them? I don't remember, but if it's the first, why would they agree to NASA's code of silence, and if it's the latter, wouldn't they demand an inquiry? That would involve FOIA requests and such?

-CNN is the only news outlet that seems to exist, like this is a mid-90s disaster movie, not one set in the 2020s. The NASA PR director only seems concerned with CNN's responses to events, not any other media nor the general public.

Artemis is actually his 5th book.

* His 3rd book is the one we all know and love as ""The Martian.""  
* Andy Weir then started working on a book called ""Zhek"" and got 75% of it written and then promptly abandoned it because the story was going no where.  
* He then wrote ""Artemis"" as a way of challenging his writing skills.  He wanted to have a protagonist that was an asshole but he went too far with the character.

My difference in opinion is that his publisher is attempting to capitalize on his name and his projects and blindly went to publish on this book. 
I need to reGoogle but I thought I’d seen chatter that PHM was in contention for movie rights based on the success of the book and The Martian box office. 

I’d be curious to know if Weir was even offered the opportunity to rewrite Artemis or if the pub house owned it outright as is. If they owned the work as is, and he was allowed to rewrite - it would have been extensively reworked making it a potentially “new” work which would have allowed him to renegotiate terms. 

I don’t think this book was published with his blessing or okay. I think he was forced into the publication. 
It’ll be interesting to see what his next move is.

A large part of me hopes he goes the Sanderson route of creating his own indie pub house, running a Kickstarter to fund whatever his next non contracted works are and giving the trad pub house the finger. 

Depending on his contract he may eventually regain rights to Artemis and he can rework it.

These are the exact reasons why I DNF’d Project Hail Mary. I read The Martian first and absolutely loved it, and then went to PHM immediately after (which was probably my mistake), because it was too much of the same thing, but not as exciting. A school teacher with some knowledge of science conveniently solves complex engineering problems one after another. It was fun at first but got old very quickly.

37fpgw,"I agree completely with this review. The Martian is bland and dull. I admit the IDEA and general story is somewhat interesting..but it's just not good writing. It's awkward amateurish writing. From page one the author awkwardly curse (look, I'm edgy! My character is edgy!) and then tries very awkwardly to sound casual (""I SUPPOSE I should fill you in.."" etc.) and to inform the reader what is going on.

Try reading even an old YA novel such as Hatchet by Gary Paulson to see how you can write an interesting survival / engineering novel well.

What I do find interesting is how the author is basically a shut-in who is too scared to get on a plane, despite his vast intelligence and understanding of math and engineering..his intellect can't overcome the irrational phobia of getting on a plane for even short distances.

The book can be viewed as his fantasy of escaping his phobia using his engineering prowess. The character, like the author, is stranded. The character, like the author, is very very good with maths. The fantasy involves his using his learnings to overcome the seemingly unsolvable problem..for the character it's getting off Mars and back home..for the author it's leaving his house and getting on a plane.

I think your main issue is with the protagonist, both the first person narrative and also the personality given to the character. Yes, I agree that at times the little reminders of what he did before do seem to be a bit obviously written to the reader. But I never found it to be too out of hand, possibly because I read it digitally, which I find hard to go back and review compared to a physical book, so I occasionally appreciated it. If I read the physical book, it might have been more annoying to me. 

As for the protagonist's character, I liked it. I thought the writing was that of someone who was forcing himself to keep positive. Like he promised himself to only write with an upbeat attitude what was happening in the journal, but occasionally you could see the desperation/boredom showing through underneath. They do say early in the book that he was chosen for the mission partly because of his positive attitude. Occasionally his writing did get silly, but imagine being completely alone for as long as he was - you'd get a little silly too.

""Not terrible not great. Weir clearly did his research and I'm sure if I were a rocket scientist I'd be very impressed, except that I'm not and I found his prose to be mediocre. I almost gave up on the book (I listened to the audiobook) but after about the first hour and a half it does get better because suddenly we get more characters back on earth. 


They've already cast Matt Damon in the movie and I honestly think it will make a better movie than book, so I'd advise just waiting and seeing the movie""



Overall my biggest complaint was how clunky and pedestrian the prose is.  Perhaps it is a stylistic choice, but if so it did not work for me.  To be fair first person narrative, while not impossible, is very difficult to write because you're so limited to a single person's perspective as we are in The Martian.


In all seriousness though the book almost reads like a movie script, fairly straightforward dialog and descriptions of scenery and things that in a movie you'd see. Most books even strictly realistic books I have a hard time imagining as films because I know that something will be lost in translation, somehow the atmosphere created by the authors words will escape being captured on film.

37fpgw,"Yeah, I agree. I mean, there's something to be said about ""window"" prose—it's not my bag, but many prefer it over the stained-glass variety. To each their own.

This might be an inherent problem to the ""lone survivor"" scenario, because guess what—they have to live to the end. And they can only get so hurt. They have to be able to manage. The nature of the narrative makes it hard to sign up for the sense of hopelessness the character feels (at least, to me).

It's a novel (yuck) idea, to be sure. I'm certainly on board with the celebration of science over stuntacular day-saving, and I can even get behind the hopeful, optimistic, down-right likable protagonist (although the ""flawless white male"" is not at all my thing), but at the end of the day it was an idea I can distill down to a page that went on for two or three hundred.

**The science/engineering fetishism.** I find the use of the word 'fetishism' to be an exaggeration. It's not as if the writer is just dumping random scientific facts to impress people in a 'Ready Player One'-esque way. As far as I'm aware, each scientific fact mentioned in the novel does play a direct role in Mark's survival. 

Regarding the ""airlock"" comment. Now, I am no Sci-fi aficionado, but among the books that I've read, there's a fair share of writers dropping jargon and letting readers rely on context to figure out what these terms mean. At this point I'm getting the feeling that it may be a necessity since Sci-fi deals with things that may not exist in our current world. Hence the only way for a writer to explain a keyword is to rely on vivid description. Point I'm trying to make is, I found that the author's description of what an airlock is (pressurizing, depressurizing etc.) to be pretty sufficient. Even if at this point I still have no idea what it looks like, I know it's purpose and have a rough idea of how it works.

At the end of the day, I feel that The Martian is the kind of book that, if one doesn't enjoy it, no amount of convincing is going to help.

I think it also does a better job of portraying how long the timeline actually is (although I've known quite a few people who disagree with this).

The movie, while less detailed, is amazingly panoramic and emotional. The score, the scenery, and Damon's physical and emotional transformation really take the character to levels that Wier really isn't capable of doing.

*Dune* is another great book-to-screen adaptation, but I think it is successful at this by distancing itself from the book. *The Martian* is a relatively rare work being short and straightforward enough to make an easy transition to script. *Dune* is obviously a much more complicated work, and historically it has been knowing what *not* to try to portray that has been the problem.

3n7gt6,"I didn't not enjoy the novel or the movie. A few questions for the crowd.

 Where are the personal items that Mark brought? Why did he not once listen to his music or watch his television shows?

When was Mars ever described? Outside of the map before the start of the novel.

Should fans of the novel and movie be called, ""potatoes"" because they grew in the shit of Weir and Watney.

In the movie it shows how emaciated Mark became, did you ever visualize that when reading the novel?

 I asked this to everybody who read the book. Why can't we let Watney die? The little blurb at the end about saving hitchhikers stuck in mountains doesn't do it for me. (I also may be a sociopath but that's for a later subreddit.) 

 Humor is a characteristic, but it does not make one a character. What other characteristics does Mark have?

 What's more unbelievable China calling NASA to help them or the entire world watching Mark being saved? (Times Square was filled to the brim, please.)

Do you think most people like the book simple because they finished it?

 Why did Watney want to come home? No wife or husband, not even a dog, why not give his life to the discovery of Mars and truly become The Martian?

3n7gt6,"Things I learned from the Martian:

Life is fragile, and to go out there you have to carry a copy of all things here (air, heat, food, Abba, etc.) along with you. Watney's problems would be ridiculous on Earth, so his story is one of insisting on humanity in a place which does not want it. Mars wants to kill Watney; Watney wants to keep both making jokes and living even if he's alone and Mars hates him. If he was more of a survival machine, he would shut up about disco. If he was less one, he would write an epitaph and die. Instead he's trapped between a survival machine and a social animal: he's human. Meanwhile on Earth the NASA people face their own challenges to preserving humanity re priorities (is it right to risk the crew to save Watney? is it right to make that decision for them? is it better to keep the crew ignorant of Watney's (likely temporary) survival?) and public pressures (how to present an unpresentable Watney to a public that wants a poster boy hero? how to milk the public support for maximum benefit? how to balance between honesty and expediency?).

Problems look different from different places --- Watney's problems are engineering, the crew's problems are trauma and risk, NASA's problems are priorities and PR. Watney's question is ""how do I do this?""; the crew's ""do I do this?"", and NASA's ""what do we do?"" Everybody's tasked with ""solve the Watney problem"", but to each of the three groups it's a different kind of a challenge. Watney does his part because he's an engineer, the crew do their part because they're human, and NASA does its actions, good and bad, because they're a superhuman (subhuman, inhuman, whatever) collective entity.

I read hadfield's guide to life on earth after reading the martian, I felt that a lot of the kind of calm and controlled thinking that he talks about as essential to being a real astronaut, were there in the martian.

Exactly. I got the exact same feeling from reading Carrying The Fire by Mike Collins (the guy who went to the moon with Aldren and Armstrong). The type of people they pick to actually go out in to space are not emotionally unstable messes who will start blubbering at the first sign of danger. They must have a natural talent as well as extensive training to stay calm in crisis situations.  They need to be able to separate their emotional state from the situation and examine what can and can't be done to survive. If you haven't read Carrying The Fire, but enjoyed The Martian, I highly recommend it.

3n8sv0,"The serialized and self-published versions of *The Martian* were way rougher than the wildly successful print release from Crown/Random House.  Weir's publishing story actually proves the relevance and necessity of editors and publishers, rather than their irrelevance.

Self-publishing can be a terrific tool for finding /connecting with audiences and experimenting with projects.

Most very successful self-publishers didn't just write one novel and hit it big. They've been writing for years, building a small, but loyal audience. That audience, such as the case with The Martian, can jump start you on Amazon lists. From there, a book can sell itself, but it's getting noticed that's the hardest.

Even then, there are many making fairly good money self-publishing just by building that audience over time. There is no window where you have to sell a ton of copies. E-books are always there and can take off years later.",strgbog,2015-10-02 18:12:06

I think the narrative story and plot were better than the Martian up until the end, but it had a completely unsatisfying end to me. I get how it was fun and cute but there were so many things I was looking forward to when he got back to earth. It felt like a Checkhov’s gun problem where it opened so many cool ideas it never closed. He was kidnapped and ended up being a coward instead of a hero but none of that was dealt with, the reproductions on earth must have been immeasurable but we see none of it, more problems like that made me dislike the ending a great deal, regardless I have positives to.

That said I loved the alien development— it’s great to get aliens who are genuinely strange and not just “almost humans”.

I liked the amnesia aspect as well and felt the reveal of Ryland’s cowardice was well-timed.

I wanted more ambiguity in the ending— I would have liked for Ryland to make the choice to help Rocky knowing that it could mean his death, and finally come to terms with that without the reader getting a cheesy happy ending.

In contrast there were some threads in PHM I felt didn't need to be in the story like the circumstances of his kidnapping that I thought didn't actually contribute much to anything in the end.

io1hsp,"*The Martian* was a fun book, an exciting story with a gratifying ending.  A lot of the technical discussion was very interesting.

In the end, though, I ended up giving it a “meh,” for several reasons:

1. Despite the book’s attempts to throw challenges and problems in the mix, in the end his survival still seemed so crazily implausible that it didn't feel real.  So, so, so, many times, survival hinged on many difficult and unforeseen problems being handled perfectly and quickly, by people who had no practice or preparation, and operating well outside their comfort zone.  A few times?  Sure—that's a staple of fiction and makes it exciting.... but a zillion times in a row, in a book that was trying for a hard-SF vibe...?
2. The characterization and dialogue was just awful and cringey, particularly the main character, but also many of the secondary characters and their interactions.  It was like a 12-year-old boy’s idea of how adults act....

Granted these are the sorts of flaws which are common to a lot of SF, but given how lauded *The Martian* was, I honestly expected better.",snogglethorpe,2020-09-07 15:22:45

I asked friends of mine who enjoyed The Martian (who were women) what they thought of Artemis. All panned it, saying they didn't find it believable. I said ""Imagine the protagonist is a man instead"" and you could see the light going on in their heads.

My guess is Weir writes his characters as projections of himself. In The Martian this works well, in Artemis not so much.

18mbs4d,"Yes, I was well aware of this book's place in counterculture history, and it's one of the reasons I picked it up.  However, at the time and place that I read it (long after the hippie movement, and knowing a bit about how it all turned out), the whole ""Think for yourself!  Eschew social conventions!"" messaging seemed superficial and even darkly ironic, with the characters simply discarding one set of social conventions for another, and opting to unquestioningly follow this Mars guy into his cult.  I read the story a long time ago, but from what I remember, he could just pop people he disliked out of existence, ""but don't worry, it's totally fine, reincarnation is real according to the Martian belief system!""  So, this one charismatic guy has appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner, and has a loyal and rather unquestioning following?  Isn't that textbook authoritarianism?  I would have probably actually loved the story if there had been any evidence that this irony was intentional and being written as dark comedy or a takedown of the hypocrisies of the hippie movement or something, but as far as I could tell, this guy was unironically being written as a hero which I just found kind of off-putting.

I think some people need to realize that character development can go hand-in-hand with what makes the action/set-pieces of a novel exciting. ""Excitement"" and ""character development"" aren't antipodal; in the best novels, they work together. Speaking for myself, I enjoyed the ""action"" of *The Martian* -- it will make for a good movie, no doubt -- but the lack of character development made it hard for me to find that action *exciting*, because I didn't care about the main character. At all. To contrast, I deeply cared about Ender, and thus the action in *Ender's Game* resonated with me, kept me turning the pages, so to speak. ",,2015-04-15 17:16:52

Watney had to be an relentless optimist to survive. If he gave in to the despair, he would have just died. 

RP1 was a little cutesy.  The worst of that was the love interest and best friend stuff. I don't fault it though, that's the book it was trying to be.  The ending was seriously anticlimactic, too.

However, keep in mind the author designed the story so that we aren't inside the main character's mind. Instead we are reading his official log entries. Watney is writing the log entries with the idea that NASA will eventually be reading them even if he dies on Mars. So even if he was feeling super depressed or lonely he wouldn't put too much of that in the log. If we were reading his personal diary than we could expect a lot more emotion from him.",parisjackson2,2015-04-15 19:30:17

The Martian's biggest downfall is that all of the other characters are terrible.  Really, really bad dialogue.  [When the Commander addresses the crew about two crew-members shacking up, cringe](#s).

It's possible to be strong, intelligent and to also experience fear, loss, self doubt. Without these additional facets characters are one-dimensional caricatures. 

By it's very nature the story of The Martian could have explored a strong character's relationship with mortality. Instead we get an emotional cripple who acts like a maintenance droid most of the time!

There are many problems with the book, but this isn't really one of them because... it wasn't written as a book.

The Martian was written in serial format, like the old radio serials of many decades ago, where each episode had a cliffhanger ending. As each episode was written, the author put it up on his webpage for the readers. It was ""live"", in that the readers had to wait a few weeks for each new episode.

It was only later, that a publisher approached Weir and asked him ""can we please publish this popular thing as a book?""

2vakuy,"I understand where you're coming from. It's fantastic and terrible from two perspectives:

Engineers/(anyone interested in engineering) love it because it's the ultimate story of overcoming hurdles by using engineering know-how. It's exciting, and somewhat believable, and the protagonist doesn't make any stupid decisions for the sake of plot, or drama. 
No engineering-type reading The Martian was disappointed that the book didn't deal with the potential psychological stresses of being marooned on another planet. That's not what someone reading The Martian is reading it for. There are plenty of other books out there that address that. 

Anyone who's read enough to count themselves as a valid literary critic hates it because it doesn't develop any of the characters terribly deeply, doesn't challenge assumptions or make strong social arguments, and at around 1/3 the way through, you pretty much figure out how it will end. I can imagine anyone looking for drama, plot-twists, and deep character development being really disappointed, with valid reason.

**light spoilers**

It reads like MacGyver + Apollo 13, neither of which are known for their deep/interesting character development, or thrilling nature. You know that the Apollo 13 crew survives, and you **know** Mac always has the right knowledge to survive whatever nature/Murdoc throws at him. Same goes for The Martian.

Plenty of recs, but my reading tastes also tend to be alllllll over the place.  I'm actually a bit newer to the newer approach terrestrial based science fiction like so you may actually be able to give me more inroads to the Weir style worldbuilding, since the Martian kind of hit me out of nowhere and actually made me feel like I did when I first read Jack London.  It is rare to find an author that is comfortable with a Man Vs Nature conflict without throwing in other antagonists, which to me shows a lack of faith in their writing.

I thought the concept of Dark Matter was quite cool and the third act split was the only reason I gave it two stars rather than one, but that was one where my abject hatred of the main character from about page six meant there was no hope for the book.

PHM is better for several reasons (these reasons include spoilers for both)

1. Weir has obviously improved his writing between the two books. The side characters in The Martian are flat and boring. Since they all call each other by last name, I wasn’t even sure who was meant to be male and who was female. Rocky aside, even Strauss is way more filled out and developed as a character. 

2. The ending of The Martian was incredibly predictable. I knew immediately that the crew that left him on Mars would be back to get him. And that’s exactly the way it ends. PHMs ending is original and if it’s a little far fetched it’s more entertaining and different than “he just goes home and everything is fine”. If Grace did make it home totally fine, it would really diminish the idea that he was supposed to be on a suicide mission 

3. The ending of the Martian is super abrupt. It’s one of those, flip to the last page books and be surprised the book is over type endings. They literally save him, bring him back in the ship, and then tell him to take a shower. That’s it??? No assimilation back to earth? No welcome home party? No reunion with his parents?

I know talking about underrepresentation of women writers is a surefire way to hit downvotes, but c'mon—you're the first person to mention a female author, and the only comment mentioning a female author that has upvotes in the double digits?

Especially nuts when we think about the huge number of humor books in the last decade that have been written by women. And I'm not talking about niche hits that never made it big: Bossypants sold more than 4 million copies—beating out The Martian and A Walk in the Woods—but she barely gets a middling mention in the discussion. And Jenny Lawson, Nora Ephron, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Silverman, Jane Bussman, Carrie Fisher, Kelly Oxford, Tig Notaro, Laurie Notaro, and Issa Rae (all of whose books have been on the bestseller list, and the first five spent some time at the #1 spot) aren't mentioned at all.

People like what they like, so I'm not at all saying, ""Why aren't other people finding these books funny?!?"" just because I did. But when huge numbers of people have bought these women's books, it's hard not to wonder why an entire subreddit would have a massive blind spot like that.

3on8xv,"I think it is very rare a studio plan to completely change the book from the start. They probably start thinking this book is great! Then they realize during script writing that 2/3th will need to be cut purely for time issues (About 180 pages equals a 2 hour movie) and realize some of the big scenes need to be changed dramatically for budget issues. After those first cuts they then see the story makes no sense so they go back and change things to the basic structure of the story. After those changes don't exactly work so they bring in a new writer to fix it who changes more things. etc... Before you know it a completely different story is written

I think there is a reason the best movies base on books tend to be very short books (i.e fight club, 12 years a slave, Silver linings playbook, the Martian). Less to cut so less needs to be changed.

They probably keep the title for the built in fan base but also for ego. No executive wants to admit the spend good money on book rights only end up with a script that is so different they never need to book rights to begin with.",Jon-Walker,2015-10-14 17:13:49

It was a nice read that I personally considered quite funny at times.

I also quite liked Watney as a character. Sure the book isn't challenging and the prose isn't on par with many of the 'greats', but is that really necessary with every book you read?

As for your suggestion that it is a book for non-readers, I would agree that it is a low-threshold book and certainly one that I would recommend to someone who is trying to get into reading but doesn't know where to start.

4olreg,"I completely understand where you are coming from. Judging by your post I'd say books mean more to you than just some breezy entertainment. That's the wonderful thing about it though, books can be anything for anyone.

I personally liked the Martian, I know it's not any kind of masterpiece (it'll probably be forgotten in 20 years) but the science is fascinating and the humor is genuinely funny. I'm no slouch neither. My bookshelves are filled with works by authors like Tolstoy, Camus and Joyce. I know when I'm reading something great versus good or just ok. 

To the point that you recognize that the characters are a bit flat and the poor dialogue id say good for you! You've probably been fortunate to have a good English teacher who taught you what ""great"" writing was. But with anything academic there can be a vein of elitism that goes with it (I'm guilty of it myself). Our culture unfortunately judges us on what we read so when we have a desire to be a ""smarter"" or ""better"" reader than the next guy that elitist attitude is very seductive. 

In my humble opinion there is really only one rule when it comes to reading: Don't discriminate. Read everything. All books offer some kind of value. Some can be devoured in one sitting while others need slow, deliberate contemplation. 

It's when I meet those people who read just one genre or type of book (and yes, ""great"" literature counts here as well) that I'm suspicious. Why would someone limit themselves to just one genre? Is it a lacking sense of curiosity, or fear of a challenge? Or is it perhaps from an elitist sense of superiority?

I have a STEM background and am a huge space nerd myself, and so I feel like this is one of those books written specifically for me.  I'm curious as to how well someone without that background will follow the nature of what gets thrown in the protagonist's path.

The Martian mostly avoided these issues, as Watney wasn't a particularly difficult character to write.

Yet, I loved the books and couldn't put it down near the end.

I say finish the book so you can form an honest opinion about the book in its entirety. I know the quality of ""The Martian"" didn't change for me but it may leave a better taste in your mouth. It's a short, easy read so why not just spend an extra 2-3 days to finish a book?",,2015-06-03 04:14:01

Well then you should be familiar with the concept of hard sci-fi - the  more popular middle of the road between a textbook and a novel. The Martian is on the popular side of it further still - it's all about what solution the author has to what problem and what potential obstacles the characters face.  Narrative sucks big time and it doesn't really change. The story is amazingly predictable - although in a cheerfully fun way. You want narrative on Mars only with introspection and poor geopolitics - try KS Robinson. Weir is very Bridget Jones-y.

2gaq1f,"I can totally see this as a great movie, though I suspect that Hollywood will make changes *even though the story really doesn't need to be!* FWIW, this is the review I wrote for *The Martian* (includes non-spoiler summary):


> Mark Watney is an American astronaut who is left for dead after a destructive sandstorm forces the evacuation of the third manned Mars mission, Ares III. Unfortunately, he wasn’t dead; and now he is confronted with the enormous challenges of figuring out how to survive in a hostile environment with the odds against his rescue. Relying on his ingenuity, sense of humor, salvage from the base camp, and the efforts of the world’s space bureaucracies, Watney needs to figure out out to sustain himself with air, water, food, clothing and shelter – in the face of miscalculations, equipment failure, and adverse weather. The enormous amount of exposition required to set up each challenge, however remarkable for its seeming veracity in regards to technical issues and resolutions, is often boring and tedious; but the payoff for the tenacious listener is being able to fully share in Watney’s triumphs and setbacks – his experience as if we were there with him.

> The narrative follows Watney’s point-of-view, some action on Earth, onboard the spaceship Ares III, and every once in a while from a point-of-view dispossessed of any personality (recounting an action in which there are no plausible witnesses.) The narrator, R.C. Bray performs the role of the Mark Watney extremely well, lending credible voice to a character in an incredible situation. Bray also does well with the different genders and ages, though he does a little less well in rendering the foreign accents demanded of him; but the characters come to life and  are well delineated. The story told clearly and with sensitivity to the characters’ personalities.

> On a personal note, I almost gave up on this audiobook halfway through; but I’m glad I didn’t. Despite things happening *in* the story, it wasn’t clear that the story was actually going anywhere; And I wasn’t sure that the constant grind of having science & technology explained to me was worth the one-liners and/or the end result of each challenge. But I ended up being emotionally vested in the fate of Mark Watney, and consider the hours spent listening to his story well spent.",,2014-09-13 22:31:19

>#Spoilers for The Martian.

**Penultimate chapter / Final chapter in the 'commercial' edition of the book:**

[The self-published edition contains as the penultimate chapter, the final chapter that appears in the new version. In other words, Mark is rescued, and the chapter ends with 'This is the happiest day of my life'](#s)

**Final chapter, as per the self-published edition:**

[Watney finished his two slices of pizza and a coke. He had another half-hour to kill before going back to Johnson Space Center. Leaving the pizzeria, he sat on a public bench just outside.](#s)

[Next week would be busy. He would be meeting the Ares-6 Engineer. He had read her file, but had never met her in person. He wouldn't get much time to relax after that. The following six weeks would be filled with constant training as he tried to impart as much knowledge as he could.](#s) 

[But that was something to worry about later. Right now, he took a deep breath of the fresh air and watched the people go by.](#s) 

[“Hey, I know you!” came a voice from behind. A young boy had strayed from his mother. “You're Mark Watney!” “Sweetie,” the boy's mom said, embarrassed. “Don't bother people like that.” “It's okay,” Watney shrugged.] (#s)

[“You went to Mars!” the boy said, his eyes wide with awe. “Sure did,” Watney said. “Almost didn't make it back.” “I know!” said the boy. “That was awesome!”] (#s)

[“Sweetie!” The mom scolded. “That's rude.” “So Mr. Watney,” the boy said, “If you could go to Mars again, like, if there was another mission, and they wanted you to go, would you go?”] (#s)

[Watney scowled at him. “You out of your fucking mind?” “Okay time to go,” the mom said, quickly herding the boy away. They receded into the crowded sidewalk. ](#s)

[Watney snorted in their direction. Then he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his face. It was a nice, boring afternoon.](#s)

ts7tch,"Bradbury reads as more of a study of collective society than the individuals that make it up. (My two cents.) Having read Fahrenheit 451 and The Martian Chronicles, the lasting impressions are the empty, burning smart home with not a living soul inside and the walls of home tvs as a feeding tube of stimuli surrounding the wife whose brain is slowly regressing to mush.

In general, I tend to be forgiving about sci-fi writers who have dated characterizations since a lot of them are using futuristic settings to make statements about contemporary social dynamics (Bradbury and Vonnegut come to mind in particular). The way I approached it, I read the empowering depictions of women from Heinlein as more a result of a thought experiment that produced accidental feminism than any kind of intentional messaging-- kind of the way ""Lysistrata"" is still funny to modern audiences, but for very different reasons it was funny to Ancient Greeks.

I had the same issue with Ernest Cline after I read *Armada* and Andy Weir after I read *Artemis*. I went into those with high hopes from the way they wrote female characters in *Ready Player One* and *The Martian*, but felt cheated when it became clear they weren't intelligent feminists, they were just imaginative neckbeards.",teachmetonight,2022-03-30 18:12:21

Theme, or the lack of thereof: life is mundane and not exciting. There is no such thing as heroes or villains, just people doing their jobs.

Weir wrote a slice of life for an adult audience and so the book displays adult life.

Watney is a bit sexist. You could say he is a bit of immature like middle schoolers. The novel have a bit of sexist undertone. But this a very insignificant part of the novel. Besides, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*  have tons more sexist undertone. ",sevgonlernassau,2015-09-26 20:17:30

Think of if I'm telling you a story about how I drove to your house. I could either tell you the short part: I got in a car, turned the ignition and drove on the freeway until I reached the nearest exit and turned off. 

Or I could focus down on some portion of the details - if I wanted you to get a sense of my dating-do and fearlessness, I'd describe every high speed pass and how as I pushed the car to higher and higher RPMs I could feel my jaw shake. Or maybe I'd talk about how I didn't have a map and used the position of the sun to help me find the way to get you thinking about my knowledge of navigation.

You were always behind Mark Watney and on his side as the sarcastic botanist tried to survive Mars, but Jazz is on the wrong side of the law, seems immature at times and it's just harder to root for her and get invested in her character.

13zy2f1,"I read both the Martian and Project Hail Mary, and they do have very different writing styles. And I think that’s on purpose to be honest with you. Andy Weir had to pretty much rewrite the book for the classroom edition (at least I assume he did, the language in the book isn’t really accepted in most schools).
But when you get your book on a schools reading list, you sell a ton of books. So yes, the writing sounds like it was written by a kid, because it was written for kids to read. 
That being said, most adults these days couldn’t read a real novel even if they tried. So I see how a lot of people like the book. I myself enjoyed it, but can see where you are coming from.",,2023-06-05 01:01:29
13zy2f1,"I just finished PHM.

- Mark Watney narrator is all he can write.  I swear it.

- I don't care for the thorough explanation of science in order to believe it, it's really hindered the book's pacing in my opinion.  There were many ""in short"" moments after a long explanation that I knew I could just bounce to once it became tedious to read (and honestly I am not some physics/bio/whatever-Gary-Sue-could-do major).

- Gary Sue.  Ryland Grace.  Mark Watney.  Oh boo hoo, Grace is a coward, that's the worst thing about him, but I'm sorry, who DOES want to knowingly go to die?  That's the only real thing written about him.  Otherwise, he knows a ridiculous amount of things that are downright unbelievable for someone of his caliber to know.

- Rocky is the BEST part of this book, and if he wrote the rest of the book the way he wrote Rocky, the book would have been out of this world.  I really only cared about Rocky and his people after a while.  ~~Watney~~ Grace became insufferable.

- Andy Weir admitted he writes books for the ""science"" and finds it difficult to write a plot and character story around it.  I don't think he's really understanding what it means to be an author.  In fact, why not co-author your story with someone who can write more than one narration character re-named?


This is not to say I didn't like the book, I did!  It took a very long time to get past Mark Watney/Matt Damon narrating Ryland Grace (I never stopped that comparison, I just stopped caring).  I became more invested in Rocky and the Eridians than really the astrophage or tauphage or any of the other parts of it.  If Ryland died I would have been sad for ROCKY.   All in all, decent enough book, overhyped to heck, in my opinion.

It is a short, quick read that packs a fun survival story with loads of (relatively) scientifically accurate facts into its narrative. Possibly as a scientist (with specialties in the space world) I enjoyed this more than most, but I found myself caring more for the well-being of Watney than I have for any individual character in a book for a long while.

2fuxn9,"A little late to this thread but I decided not to be mean and start a thread called ""The Martian, or /u/Gary_Stu in Space.""

It started off pretty slow for me. I was incredibly annoyed by the way Weir explained the same simple thing over and over again, sometimes even using the exact same phrases, but spewed pages of complicated technical details without even drawing a breath.

Once that settled down and he introduced the other characters down on earth, for a while, I was riveted. 

But every character was either one dimensional or zero dimensional. Watney had no interests, hobbies, hopes, dreams, friends, or family, or even any real desire for anything aside from survival. He spent an awful lot of time whining about the 1970s TV shows he had to watch but never once does he mention what he would enjoy watching.

In real life there's a reason why solitary confinement is often called cruel and unusual punishment. No matter how psychologically stable astronauts are supposed to be, a year and a half without any actual human contact will break you. So the fact that Watney's personality and mental state don't budge even a little either meant he was a stone-cold psychopath or a computer that only thought it was human.

I'm not a particularly visual person and I don't care for extended description, but this had such little description that I often got the impression that the story was taking place inside a blank white cube.

I really didn't like Pathfinder fake-out. That was a massive plot-hole. The fact that he was injured was a dropped plotline. Shaving was never mentioned and frankly, it's pretty important. A lot of gas/oxygen masks will not give a perfect seal on a man who isn't clean-shaven. More plot-hole. 

But aside from those details, the plot ran out of steam about 100 pages from the end. Since there was no problem that Watney couldn't solve relatively easily, I didn't care about the characters, and Weir isn't that good at writing scenes that are genuinely suspenseful, I had to force myself to finish the book. The ending had no emotional heft whatsoever and Weir knew it full well. That's why he tacked on those few ending paragraphs about the importance and significance of the story. (At least he didn't pull a Goldfinch and write 20 pages about it.)

But because I did enjoy part of it, I did laugh, and the line about not having a cross to ward off Martian vampires almost made it worth the price of admission, I give the book 3/5 stars instead of 2/5.

You're not missing anything. It has all the elements that your average Redditor likes. That is: Science, nerds, little to no interaction with women, and a Gary Stu main character.

“Silence of the Lambs” - both are great!

“Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” (what “Blade Runner” is based off of) - may get lambasted for this, but the short story was just too weird for me to follow. I love a good book that doesn’t feel the need to explain everything, but this one was too much for me.

“The Martian” - I loved the movie but the book is on a whole different level. SO GOOD.

A little different than what you asked but “A Disaster Artist” after watching “The Room” a million times - literally laugh out loud funny. I’m talking choking on laughter out in public.

“I Am Legend” - not to be super cliche, but the book was better.

“Gone Girl” - I couldn’t get into the book, I only got a few chapters in. The movie was pretty good!

6aty17,"I don't disagree with much of the criticism, and can see why people didn't like it. But I think part of the reason people who like The Martian really LOVE it is because there's not really much else like it.

Hard sci-fi tends to ask philosophical questions, or depict a bleak future. More optimistic sci-fi tends to be quite loose on the science in order to make the premise work. But The Martian had both an optimistic tone and uses hard science stuff to enhance that tone. The question behind the plot wasn't ""what are the consequences of relying on technology?"" It was ""how can we creatively use technology to solve problems?""

And I get that the second question isn't an interesting one for many people. But I don't know what else asks it. 

And, boy, does this book answer it. Everything Watney does, the stuff at NASA, and especially their co-operation with the Chinese space agency, the Ares crew stuff - it all focuses on that question. 

A lot of sci-fi I read steers away from being funny too. So seeing a sci-fi book unashamedly funny (though I accept that the humour is rather puerile) was great too. ",h2g2_researcher,2017-05-13 07:29:28

Well, the book is still a good comedy but if you remove all the NASA investigation and mission stuff, you also remove the big question/conflict of the book which is how the hell NASA is going to bring Watney back to Earth. It will become a comedic existential narrative much like The Life of Pi, except with highly scientific background information.

And if they were made into movies (which a good portion of them are!), I think this one could really catch that dead marriage thing that does so well in movies. I'm thinking of Revolutionary Road type vibe ... it's just so sad that everyone is trying to fulfill their own needs that they don't see what's going on around them! 

edit: I'm female by the way. And I think that's why I enjoyed this book over Kingkiller Chronicles and The Martian ... which are very plot oriented, to me, and don't focus on the emotional aspect like Flynn and Ng can.  ",nikiverse,2014-11-18 15:08:31
2mnnc3,"I'm currently reading it and I really like it. I think this book caters to females over, say, Kingkiller Chronicles and The Martian, which are good (Martian over KC for me) but very plot oriented. EINTY reminds me of Revolutionary Road a little bit bc the husband and wife in the book are trapped in their marriage. And I think Ng talks about the loveless marriage thing in a very emotional way where you FEEL it. And then, to top it off, the husband is asian and goes through some discrimination. He's trying to fit in. And he's very conforming and traditional. The wife wanted to be a doctor/nurse but had to put her dreams on hold to raise her family. 

I dont know, to me, it's a very good book. I'm over halfway through it! 

It's just so sad! And, on top of all this, there's the mystery of what happened to one of the kids. 

edit: And I have also read Station Eleven, which I found a little pretentious and I did not care at all for the characters. And I loved Gone Girl.

The audiobook is certainly no exception. I would see promotional ads for it often, no doubt due to the high concentration of audiobooks and science in my browsing history. 

The strengths of the audiobook performance over the page format probably come entirely from how comical all of the NASA staff chapters become. If the bloating of the pages from internet meme culture and nerd paraphernalia wasn't already entertaining enough, then listening to an actor impersonate an Indian American talk about the council of Elrond makes things extra enjoyable. Apart from that, I could probably take it or leave it, but seeing as I get a lot of my ""reading"" done at the moment with audiobooks, I'm satisfied with the product.",WodensBeard,2015-07-15 20:50:15

*Your next book will have a woman as the central character. Given that “gender wars” in science fields is still a contentious topic, why did you decide to go with a lady lead? What kinds of challenges does your protagonist face, and does her gender play any role in those challenges?*

>I don’t take part in any political debates. So I’m certainly not trying to make a point by having a female lead. She’s just a character I came up with that I thought was cool, so she’s the lead.

>The book is another scientifically accurate story. The main character is a low-level criminal in a city on the moon. Her challenges are a mix of technical/scientific problems, as well as juggling personal interactions—staying a step ahead of the local police, working with shady and dangerous people to do illegal things.

>She doesn’t encounter any distinctly “female” challenges. There’s no love plot. And the story takes place in a future society where there is practically no sexism.

The Martian and Project Hail Mary are better than most YA, and miles above Cline’s work.

Sometimes that's what makes a book good - not the technicalities of the grammar and sentence structure, but the sheer emotion they manage to evoke in us - RPO has a lot of nostalgia mixed with a future we can totally relate to. And The Martian, well, many of us are tired of angst and self-doubt and Mark both made us laugh and kept us cheering him on.

You didn't feel those emotions for whatever reason - those books just aren't for you. That's cool, we get it.

When it comes to books that are praised by people, it doesn't really matter.  Reading interests are 100% subjective, based on what the reader finds interesting.  I like a lot of silly science fiction but can't stand some of the classics.  Does that make me ignorant? A neanderthal? Socially inept and moronic? Possibly. 

Either that, or I'm a successful, highly intelligent individual with poor (good) taste in novels.  It matters very little; if you didn't like the book, that's fine.  Expressing your opinion about it is welcome.

You're gonna have to carry the fate of entire species on your shoulders and see unfold the destruction and birth of many worlds. You're gonna feel the scare of an imminent death or completely fall in love with someone you'll never be able to see.

2z2owd,"I'm 33 and until last year, I'd never read a book cover-to-cover. Even in college, I stopped buying textbooks and just winged it with notes taken in class (and did just fine; never came close to failing a class). There was just something about the physical act of reading a book that I did not enjoy at all.

I just came to the realization last year that I'd never read a book, and made the decision to change that. I already owned a Nexus 7 tablet, so I decided reading eBooks might be a good alternative to reading a physical book. It was a game-changer, and every book I've read has been in eBook form.

I had a few false starts, but the first book I read completely was **""Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"" by Cory Doctorow**. I'm not sure exactly why, but the premise intrigued me, and I couldn't stop until the end.

Since then, I've been completely addicted to sci-fi. Here's everything I've read just in the past year, and I would fully recommend every book on this list:

* Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom
* Old Man's War
* Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
* Dune
* Dune Messiah
* Foundation
* I, Robot
* Jurassic Park
* Nightfall and Other Stories
* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
* Song of Kali
* The Demon-Haunted World
* Ready Player One
* The Martian
* What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions

As you can see, I haven't really branched out beyond sci-fi too much just yet, but I'm sure that'll change at some point. I feel like I've discovered a completely new side of myself at 33.",meatee,2015-03-15 12:51:44

I still read them here and there but considering a comic costs 5 dollars and then 3 of those is $15 which will probably give me about 30-45 minutes of reading opposed to a book like The Martian that is also $15 but lasts me about 10 hours collectively it only makes sense to invest in actual books more ",Sheehan7,2015-03-15 17:02:27

Mars trilogy is the **exact opposite** of Weir's Martian - it's long, it's slow building, it's much less pop-technical, much less humorous, far more engaged with character development, far more involved in description of the planet and far more involved politically.

I can't see people who enjoyed the Martian - which was essentially the crossover between your standard 90 minute action movie and Bridget Jones' Diary - would be bothered to read Robinson!

If you love sci-fi and great stories then sure but it's definitely not for everyone.
 
>I'll also add that with the growing political significance of the relationship between environmental conservation and capitalism these books seem more relevant now than ever (written in the 90s). 

No they don't. The political side of the story is easily the worst element in the books - also in an objective sense as exposition of issues. Not only it is sloppy and built on Robinsons' ignorance of the issues and geopolitics but also it's deeply dishonest in portrayal of all sides of the debate. It's a naive fairytale for liberal college students that has nothing to do with serious discussion.  Highly not recommended as food for thought unlike you think that MSNBC or Fox News are decent journalism - because that's the level of political debate Robinson brings to the table, only just in really neat words.

> If you like long reads and realistic space exploration read the Mars Trilogy

Only Red Mars is realistic - and only to the point where you-know-what is developed. Then it's magic space communism. It's still fairly engaging to read but *Red Mars* stands out from the bunch by a mile simply because it is the most realistic.

Have you seen the cast? They're almost certainly expanding the roles of other character in the book, in order to facilitate a cast of this calibre:

>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/

A Mini Series brings to mind two different paths - the traditional 10 episode mini-series, or the feature length thee episode option.

With the former you need material for 7.5 hours television; formatted in such a way so as to allow a cliff-hanger at the end of each episode, and formatting within each episode so as to allow the 15 minutes of advertising breaks.

With the latter? Typically you're looking at three 90 minute episodes, advertising free. There's easily enough content within *The Martian* to allow for 4.5 hours of programming, particularly if you expand out some of the supporting characters.

A feature length mini series would probably be the best path; regardless they're making a movie.",BooksBiscuitsTea,2015-01-31 12:54:58

*The Martian*... themes that jump out for me are hope and perseverance. Mark Watney never gave up. The book made me feel happy when I finished it. 

*World War Z*... a great book. Shockingly great. It put me on a long path of reading every zombie book I could get my hands on. That being said, it is a dark book. There are some seriously disturbing things (church story, north Canada story...). By virtue of how the book was written, several short stories set in the same universe linked by the narrator, it is hard to pick one or two themes. Maybe that humanity is both wonderful and terrible.

2:  People get upset when we remove their ""meaningful contribution"".

For example a Left Hand of Darkness thread is a pretty good spot for some gender debate.

We make it a habit to lock threads where the political discussion starts to get out of hand and overwhelm the book discussion.  We used to remove them, but then a...certain subreddit...threw a huge and unbalancing temper tantrum about it.  So now we just lock them, so that the discussion is still on display, but people won't feel the need to shovel their increasingly off-topic opinions into it.

If you even thought Ender's Game was semi-ok or better, then you have to read that book because the movie wasn't even close.  Had to chop out too much to keep a reasonable movie time limit.  The ending is good but the fights to get there aren't captured at all in the movie and are in depth in the book.  If I only saw the movie I think I'd wonder what the heck he was crying about so much.

RPO strays from the book a ton so if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the book and find it at least as enjoyable.  The book has more depth in the various story lines that had to be chopped out (and rearranged or changed entirely), so reading it isn't just taking a long approach at the movie by far.  fwiw I enjoyed them both, haters be damned.

HHGTTG was terrible and if you liked it you're a terrible person (jk.. kinda).  The recent movie was not a great adaptation, let's put it that way.

10u6kov,"I 100% agree with you on the opening to The Martian, and I also LOVED Project Hail Mary. 

My most recent example of this was the opening to Fairy Tale by Stephen King. As soon as the narrator got through the opening paragraphs, I rubbed my mental hands in glee, and said, this is gonna be a fun ride! No one tells a story like Stephen King,  and this is some of his finest eork, imo. (I highly recommend the audio version of this book, the narrator is superb.)",deliciae13,2023-02-05 21:20:38

ruc238,"The Martian. Really enjoyed both, but I give the slight edge to the movie.",Beebus4Deebus,2022-01-03 00:17:20
ruc238,"Agreed. Which means it doesn’t fit in this case, since the book is still supposed to be “great”. I would say The Martian.",Beebus4Deebus,2022-01-03 00:17:03
ruc238,"Well said.  
The Martian was the first book I ever read that was totally online .... didn’t exist on paper.",henryroad88,2022-01-03 01:27:21
4207ca,"I really, really disliked it.  Hate's probably not too strong.  I don't mind shallow books.  The Martian was an example of a book that wasn't very deep, not very nuanced, but still thoroughly enjoyable.

I'm 43, so I was in my teen years during the 1980s, and I remember all of it.  The way the 80s were portrayed was not only overdone, it was whitewashed and romanticized.  It offended my sensibilities in same ways that only badly written, misleading historical fiction has done in the past.  To be clear, it's not historical fiction, but I really despise when facts are ignored or misrepresented.

I guess now that I'm thinking about it, I didn't like it in the same way that people didn't like Gone with the Wind.  ",babwawawa,2016-01-21 21:22:53
4207ca,Similar to the Martian. ,,2016-01-21 19:22:46
4207ca,"I'd guess because Reddit's demographic is overwhelmingly male, but yes, RPO, The Martian and so on are pretty much the equivalent of chick lit. ",Nyxisto,2016-01-21 22:07:36
4207ca,"I read them both back to back, I liked rpo a lot better. When the phrase ""pirate ninjas"" was used in The Martian I almost quit reading it all together... it completely ruined the illusion for me, I skipped a page or two to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  And the constant math problem breakdowns were exhausting.  ",NoiCantSpell,2016-01-21 21:34:04
4207ca,"I don't know about *The Martian*, that story was solid-enough sci-fi to be bumped out of the chick lit catagory.",,2016-01-21 23:54:50
4207ca,"Almost worse, it's such blatant wish fulfillment and reader manipulation! Agreed with all your prior points, by the way. RPO comes up a lot in connection to the other current fanboy darling, The Martian, but I would say that at least in The Martian the constant [problem, solution] cycles are depicted in a fairly realistic light - in RPO so many of those solutions were ""because plot."" Nobody in decades thought to check the freaking LEARNING PLANET for the solution to the first riddle that specifically/explicitly mentions learning? Sure, because plot! Main character needs an extra life to escape mortal peril? Sure, he has one, because plot!",,2016-01-22 21:21:09
4207ca,"Nope, Rc Bray with The Martian.",Mclarenf1905,2016-01-21 19:16:33
v79yha,"I share the same unpopular opinion. I enjoyed The Martian, but the main character in this one annoyed me a bit too much, and the story dragged. Sometimes I’ll read a book and think “well, at least this’ll make an entertaining movie,” but I doubt it in this case.",,2022-06-12 21:33:17
v79yha,"Agreed, zero issues with the dialogue in the audiobook. I’m more worried now that it’s a female robotic voice, rather than a male robotic voice because it changes the dynamic so much.

I think the main issue with the adaptation will be explaining the 100’s of mini science facts that provide logic to the story - I know they did it successfully in the Martian but I feel like there’s a lot more to the Hail Mary Project.",Olb_Bill,2022-10-13 10:36:20
6egslz,"Seems like this will be another entertaining (if not challenging) read, and I will certainly be picking it up come November. I loved the pacing and the science of The Martian. Say what you want about the style and choppiness, but Andy Weir keeps things moving from page to page. 

For whatever it's worth, I am intrigued by the idea of a white male author writing from the perspective of an impoverished Middle Eastern woman. ",AndyCircus,2017-05-31 19:52:35
6egslz,"I mean this with no disrespect to him (he's more famous/rich than I'll ever be) or his fans, but this seems to be written in the same style that made me drop The Martian. Fans of his, what do you think of this? Will you be buying it?",nothingcleverleft,2017-05-31 18:47:55
6egslz,The Martian has one of my favorite audiobook adaptations so I hope the same narrator returns for this book. ,Thesunsetreindeer,2017-05-31 23:23:36
6egslz,"I thought it was good, not great. But I'll pick it up anyway I guess cause I loved The Martian. 

Also, how come the pre order is available for Amazon US, UK and India (Like, I can imagine tons of other countries which would be their priority over India) only ? Is it showing India to me through IP detection ? ",Bhu124,2017-06-01 08:10:21
6egslz,"If you liked the Martian, you'll like this too.",LGBTreecko,2017-07-01 21:55:13
6egslz,"Whats wrong with the style in The Martian?

Edit: To answer your question, now that I've read it. Yeah I'd probably pick it up. I think rational thought and realistic space scenarios are enticing. His writing is a little fragmented, but I love his pace of revealing things, and some of the plot twists in Martian were great (like when he went for the radio). I'd be worried that this leans a bit much on the theme of the Martian, but I'll happily give him the benefit of the doubt. ",Lintheru,2017-05-31 19:30:05
6egslz,"I liked The Martian's style. It obviously wasn't a very beautiful writing style but it was entertaining and interesting. So yeah, I'll probably be picking this new one up. ",RomanovaRoulette,2017-05-31 23:36:23
6egslz,"I'm not going to read the preview because I don't want to wait 5-6 months with the first chapter in my head but I really enjoyed the style of the Martian, it's hard to effectively pull off diary style storytelling and he did it very well. He writes simply, doesn't really waste words and his non diary style segments were very easy to read, it's nice, simple, entertaining. I'll definitely buy Artemis",Coramoor_,2017-06-01 00:44:18
6egslz,"I'll definitely be buying it! I loved The Martian. It was a quick, easy read that, despite it's casual, pithy style, still managed to make me feel as if I were learning something complex about science, or how a trip to Mars would go.

I'm not a huge SF fan, mainly because I have trouble suspending my disbelief when they're about FTL travel or crazy aliens. The world needs more ""near-future"" SF books IMO. So, bravo to Andy Weir.",__Shake__,2017-05-31 19:25:55
6egslz,"For me, Weir's writing lacks ""texture."" I was fascinated by the background detail of the Martian, especially Weir's super cool Google talks where he talked about how he'd come up with the scenarios using actual orbital mechanics to drive the plot. But when I read the opening to Martian I got as far as when he patches his suit up after being stranded. It just felt ""off"".",,2017-06-03 20:26:51
6egslz,"His Watney was great, but his Annie just made her *so much better* than anything I'd imagine from reading the book.

I normally prefer reading over audiobooks, but for the Martian I'll make an exception.",Hypothesis_Null,2017-06-01 03:32:05
