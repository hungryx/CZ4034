lbbwp7,Just finished The Martian by Andy Weir,"I absolutely adored this book. I am a huge fan of Michael Crichton, and this gave me very similar vibes. The attention to scientific detail and humor is everything. I loved how much detail was provided when Mark Watney solved problems, and how he used a realistic tone to explain how he was feeling. The movie adaptation was entertaining, but I felt like Matt Damon was an odd pick for Watney. My only real criticism of the book as well as the movie, is that the end seems rushed. In both cases, a few more pages/running time would wrap things up nicely. Overall, I have to thank this sub for this recommendation, and I’m going to read Artemis next.

Edit: Wow, lots of love for this book! I appreciate all the feedback, especially the lively debate around Artemis. I’m not sure who I would pick to replace Matt Damon, but I’d say someone like Domhnall Gleeson. I loved his performance in Ex Machina. Also, I don’t really do audiobooks, but I appreciate the recommendations, and I’m sure others appreciate them as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lbbwp7/just_finished_the_martian_by_andy_weir/,2021-02-03 01:15:44,638,6351,books

iy56yf,The Martian is refreshing science fiction,"Just finished The Martian. Probably the most refreshing book I've read in awhile, especially for being sci-fi with an emphasis on astrophysics. I'm a bit ashamed to say this, but math and science can sometimes be a slog to read through. I never felt that way reading The Martian, though; atmosphere and oxygen levels, hydrolysis and rocket fuel, botany and farming, astrophysics, engineering were all so damn interesting in this book. 

The first thing I did once I finished the book was look up the plausibility behind the science of The Martian, such as ""can you grow potatoes on Mars?"" or ""can we get people to Mars?"". I especially love how macgyver everything felt, and how the solution to problems ranged from duct tape, adhesive, canvas, random junk. Almost makes you want to try going to Mars yourself. Very inspiring read.

o3jrvy,I had an absolute blast reading The Martian,"I had been thinking about reading The Martian ever since I watched the movie and finally I read it. And I have to say, this is the most fun I've had reading a book 'cause I'm into astronomy, NASA and all things space related.

Granted some of the scenarios in the book seem far-fetched like the reason the astronauts had non frozen potatoes on Mars with them. But hey, I had fun while reading it so it doesn't really matter to me.

The book made me laugh out loud multiple times. Andy Weir's wit is amazing. Also I've seen some people complain about how Mark just effortlessly solves any problem that comes up. But I don't think it's effortless 'cause we get to know what he did through logs so imo he won't put the entire process of thinking and whatnot in the log. He tells us precisely how he solved the problem and what difficulties he had to face along with compromises that had to be made.

What was your experience reading The Martian?

bfmsu3,The Martian by Andy Weir beautifully teaches problem solving skills.,"The Martian, as I believe, is an incredible tale of how a man with indomitable will trumps the natural forces of Mars to survive against all the odds. It hooked me up from its very beginning and I enjoyed it to the end.

When I think about it, I find that not only is it a tale, but also a guide, to face adversities and overcome them with whatever resources one may have at hand. From the beginning, it was clear to Mark Whatney (the protagonist) that he had an option to commit painless suicide by taking morphine pills he had with him. But he chose to put up a fight.

And he does not fight his situation in some vague manner. He does it very systematically; by analysing his options and the outcome. He puts his log to good use. Everytime he incurs a problem he writes about them. When there are too many of them (on many occasions he had too many problems to deal with) he takes them one by one rather than getting overwhelmed by all of them together.

When there's something to be worried about, from the future, he puts it to hold until he comes to that moment. He is very specific about his problems and equally specific about their solutions.

That's how I have been facing my own problems. I write them down in my diary. I try to take them one by one. 

Although it is a work of fiction but I believe that it still manages is to teach how to face problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bfmsu3/the_martian_by_andy_weir_beautifully_teaches/,2019-04-21 08:33:40,466,9773,books

nk2ghm,"If you liked The Martian, you should read Project Hail Mary","Andy Weir had a smash success with his first novel, The Martian. While it probably didn't have a lot of pure literary merit, it was unabashedly geeky, thrilling, fun and entirely deserving of all the accolades and the impact it made on the current sci-fi landscape.

His next novel, Artemis, magnified all the faults of the first while retaining none of the charm. Attempts to write a more complex plot left it a heavy, jumbled mess. The lack of real characters or character development in The Martian was excusable. In Artemis all attempts at it were forced and cringey. The science and long technical explanations went from seamlessly driving the narrative in The Martian to hampering it to the extent where you get actively frustrated by them. In short – nothing worked.

Project Hail Mary is, in a sense, a return to the author's roots. Like in The Martian, the protagonist is a genius and witty scientist caught alone in a bad situation who must use his knowledge to fix things. The stakes are a lot higher. Instead of Mars, this time he is on a spaceship far away from Earth. Instead of saving just himself this time all of humanity is on the line. Oh and he has amnesia, so isn't able to remember the ship, his mission or even his own name.

What follows is a saga of exploration, trial and error, mess ups, fixes, near deaths etc. as he inches closer to his goal. It's The Martian on steroids, and the author makes no excuses for it.

Some of the author's faults still stood this time around. I'm putting some of them in spoiler tags to be safe, but they aren't really spoilers so read them if you'd like.

* At 500 pages, it is a bit of a slog. There are a lot of repetitive parts and could have been easily edited down another 100 pages at least.
* I found it harder to excuse the juvenile writing this time around considering the author is on his *third* bestselling novel. There is so much wrong with pacing, narrative structure, characters, exposition etc. that ""yeah, science!"" won't magically fix.
* The science stuff – >!While the scientific explanations and overall plot in The Martian made some amount of sense, Project Hail Mary makes you take one too many massive leaps of logic. That isn't a deal breaker for a sci-fi book by any means, but the author's writing style emphasizes the ""science"" side while giving you a story which would fit better in The Expanse.!<
* The protagonist – >!For both better and worse, the protagonist is Mark Watney 2.0. He is a genius at every possible science, has all the knowledge of the world at the tip of his tongue, is witty, commanding when he needs to be, selfless, empathetic...Oh and he has six pack abs of course. While Mark Watney came off as charming, this one is just..dull.!<

With sci-fi tastes as varied as they are, it's hard to predict how the average reader will feel about Project Hail Mary. There are a lot of fun moments, some thrills and a lot of faults. So I will simply say that if you liked The Martian, you will probably like this one as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nk2ghm/if_you_liked_the_martian_you_should_read_project/,2021-05-24 16:50:03,429,3758,books
y6xi1b,"I love the story about how ""The Martian"" blew up much more than the book itself","I recently finished The Martian, and I was outlining for a review of the book when I started looking more into Andy Weir himself. The Martian was such a technical book full of hard science that I figured any interview with Weir would likely be interesting.

I went down the YouTube rabbit hole & stumbled across a Google talk he gave back in 2014 prior to the movie's release. The book was already a big hit at the time he gave the talk.

During Q&A, someone from the crowd asked Weir if he preferred physical or digital books. Weir's answer blew my mind. 

He said digital books had made his career. The Martian was originally released as a serial novel on his website (in the vein of Green Mile by Stephen King). He'd write and then release chapters periodically for free. 

His readers were enjoying the book, but at some point they started complaining about having to read the story scrolling through on their PCs. Doesn't sound fun to me either. They asked Weir to make an ePUB so they could read it on their Kindles.

Weir obliged the request, and people started downloading it off his site. And then people started complaining that they had no idea how to transfer a downloaded ePUB file to their Kindle. I understand that pain quite well - even as a pretty tech savvy guy, I had to Google how to do this myself. It's not super intuitive. 

At this point, the readers just asked him to put it on Amazon so they can download it directly to their Kindle. At the time, the minimum price for a book was $.99, so Weir put it up for sale there, while also keeping it on his site for free.

The Martian started moving up the charts, and then it broke through the top 10 sci-fi books on Amazon. And it started to blow up. A guy from Random House read it, liked it, and showed it to an agent and asked what he thought. The agent thought it was pretty dang good. That same agent then reached out to Weir, became his agent, and they turned around and sold the book to Random House! 

The Martian was then ""re-released"" through Random House in 2014. 

I love this story because it shows how much has changed in the publishing industry in the last 20ish years. I had no idea that The Martian was initially self-published. Weir also said he never promoted the book - no marketing, no forums, no comic cons. 

I know things are different in 2022 compared to back in 2011. There are a LOT more self-published authors now, and it is likely a lot more difficult to break through. 

But it still does happen all the time. I love the story. I love that it's easier than ever to get my hands on the work of artists.

And if you're wondering why I didn't LOVE the book. Frankly, too much hard science for me! I am such a layman when it comes to science and math. Literally avoided it as much as I could throughout my education. Bachelor of Arts guy here. So the pages and pages of hard science & MacGyvering his way out of every possible problem that someone stranded on Mars can encounter - it all felt a little dry for me.  

I'm not saying this book is bad at all. I rated it a 7/10. And I'm looking forward to Project Hail Mary (on my queue for next month's reads).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y6xi1b/i_love_the_story_about_how_the_martian_blew_up/,2022-10-18 05:07:10,363,4420,books

10hw1ll,"Just finished The Martian by Andy Wier, and I loved it more than I thought I would","To start, really liked the movie because it was different to every film I had watched so far. It was only last year where I found out it had a book.
 I got the e-book so I could just open it anywhere and read. 
I loved this book so much. I really love the vibe of Mark doing fairly routine and monotonous things and being occasionally reminded that this planet could kill him in an instant. I loved the parts where it shifted to a third-person perspective whenever something bad was about to go down.

I think I loved the characters most of all. I'm no expert on good character writing but I really liked Mark Watney's balance of sass and genuine kindness. I was afraid that I wouldn't like the Ares 3 crew as much  but I was wrong. I always knew that being an astronaut was nothing but dangerous but this book put into good perspective how even the slightest mistake could lead to absolute disaster and the passage of time.

Wrapping up now, I loved this book and I'm really excited to start Project Hail Mary.

“I’m pretty much fucked.”

Ever since then it’s been an amazing and hilarious journey. It reminds me of the first read through of Vonnegut novels. Full of wit and brilliance.

1aes1zj,Am I just too stupid to understand and enjoy The Martian?,"I am 20% through this book and so far each chapter is the same formula:

* I have a problem
* Luckily, my intelligence and \[science stuff\] and NASA being overprotective will help me
* But wait, I might have these two risks
* Luckily, I know about \[science stuff\]. You see chemical reactions, science, Earth. But Mars. However if I chemical reactions, science, it can Mars!!1!
* \*Performs task that either passes or fails\*
* Ok now I need to just maximize my \[science stuff\] so I can survive 4 years.
* Ugh, gotta listen to disco again!

Is that seriously it? Every chapter I have to read through Mark figuring out some problems using chemistry, geology, or something from his botany skills, and they always go over my head because I don't really care to know about any of these processes. I’m patiently waiting for him to begin his trip because I'm sure that's where the most interesting chapters lie, but this is just dragging on and on. Don't even get me started on the Earth chapters. Does Weir really think a woman is going to start stuttering and cry on demand after learning some fantastic news? Are his real-life conversations with people that dull and unanimated that that's how he perceives all interactions? Please reassure me it gets better.

191r4sq,Question about The Martian (spoilers),"Is it just me or does it seem very obvious that at one point during an earlier draft for the book Mark ate own his arm to survive?

As I was reading it I was almost positive they were going to reveal that he had done everything in the book missing one arm because he in fact ate it.

Here is why:

1) he outright suggested that as an option early in the book.

2) they alluded to it, or possibly rewrote the scene where he loses his arm, when he tears it open after the airlock explodes.

3) They all allude to it again at the end talking about slashing his hand open to fly like Iron Man.

10h3xyn,Is the reprinting of books with different contents effectively censorship. For example The Martian Chronicles,"So recently I read and loved The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury. It was probably one of my favorite science fiction books I've ever read and made me appreciate Bradbury in a whole new light. 

The copy I read was a very old copy from my local library. After I finished it I wanted to go back and write some notes so I picked up a copy of the hardcover. The first thing I noticed was all the dates were changed so that the story is now more futuristic. I don't know why they would feel the need to do that, but more egregious was the omission of a particular story ""Way In The Middle Of The Air"". It is a wonderful story Bradbury wrote seeing the treatment of pre civil rights era black people. It does contain language that is considered inappropriate today, but it is such a moving story against the ignorance and racism thrown towards them. 

Why would a story like this be omitted from a reprinting? Why even change the dates? Why cant a book just be written in its time and kept the way the author wanted it. Anyway long rant

 TLDR The Martian Chronicles reprinted changed the structure and removed contents from the original publication and I do not understand why.

EDIT: Found a forum post from 2003 with some more context into the date changes and removal of the chapter, ""I had always heard that the dates were changed, with Ray's approval, to set the book farther in the future. Since he wrote it over 50 years ago, in the original, we were already catching up with the dates. As to why that chapter was left out, I am sure it was because some person was offended and was trying to be oh so politically correct. I'm quite sure Ray would not approve. When I was teaching this novel, and keep in mind these were seventh graders, I was very careful when introducing this chapter. We had some of our best discussions of the whole novel about why authors use this kind of language, that the author doesn't necessarily share these feelings or use those words himself, that our reading of it doesn't imply we feel that way, why it's good to study such touchy topics, etc. The seventh graders totally got it. I really think it's the adults that get freaked out and forget the context or message.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10h3xyn/is_the_reprinting_of_books_with_different/,2023-01-20 18:13:37,89,541,books
qvdpmh,Andy Weir (who wrote The Martian) has a frustrating writing style.,"I’m reading Project Hail Mary because I love science and sci-fi, but it’s a struggle to continue. Weir’s writing style is juvenile and painfully unfunny.

Some examples from the first few pages:

“You…be quiet.”

“Okay. I think it’s time I took a long gosh-darned look at these screens!”

“And that next room is … um …?”

“Okay, that’s——well, terrifying. But regardless: What the heck do you want from me?”

“‘Oh come on!’ I said. ‘Who pooped in your Rice Krispies?’”

“After a lot of ‘crazy prisoner scribbling on a wall’ type stuff, I have my answer.”

“I squeeze the tube, and disgusting-looking brown sludge comes out.”

“Each has an assortment of disturbingly penetration-looking tools where hands should be.”

“Ooh! I felt a wiggle that time. My eyelids moved. I felt it.”

3917vv,The Martian by Andy Weir [MEGATHREAD],"[Following up on our last thread on The Road by Cormac McCarthy](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3678hg/the_road_by_cormac_mccarthy_megathread/), here's a thread dedicated to discussion of Andy Weir's The Martian.

Mr Weir a.k.a /u/sephalon has done [an AMA in this very subreddit in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2tyz6p/i_am_andy_weir_author_of_the_martian_soon_to_be_a/) where he has answered quite a few questions from eager redditors.

We thought it would be a good time to get this going since the [trailer for this movie just came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue4PCI0NamI).    

This thread is an ongoing experiment, we could link people talking about The Martian here so they can join in the conversation (a separate post is definitely allowed).

azlnmc,Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles doesn’t get the attention or recognition that it deserves.,"I’ll start this off with what very well may be a controversial opinion in this sub; I just wasn’t crazy about Fahrenheit 451. I think this was at least in part due to it being so misrepresented as being about censorship, which has been discussed here at length. I read Something Wicked this Way Comes in junior high and wasn’t crazy about that either, but I found it difficult to get into books that I read in class.

Given the authors that I read and re-read, it honestly frustrated me a little. WHY didn’t I like Ray Bradbury when everyone tells me I should? It felt incongruous, like something just wasn’t clicking in my own head.

It’s been a few years since I tried and I don’t even remember how it came up, but I ultimately stumbled upon The Martian Chronicles online. Because they also love sci-fi, my grandparents bought it for me for Christmas. The last book I finished was East of Eden so I was eager to read something shorter and lighter and equally as determined to like Ray Bradbury.

I’m not gonna lie to you, when it started off I was not impressed. The way that he describes the original martians is extremely... Bradbury. Their names are things like “Xxx” and “Zzz” and those types of devices tire for me very quickly.

I’m not the type to put a book down without having finished it so I persisted, and I’m glad that I did. The Martian Chronicles truly evolves throughout the book. What starts as a very quintessentially Bradbury, almost campy tale about aliens winds up taking a lot of turns that I did not expect. I’ve read more than my fair share of books about extraterrestrials and can honestly say the martians here are unlike anything I’ve read before. It was truly riveting.

Initially I was interested in the book because of a description that the original Mars colonizers died of The Loneliness (not a spoiler), and while I was at first disappointed to find that this actually plays a very minor role in the book over time I got more and more excited to see where the book would go.

As I mentioned, I’m a Steinbeck fan. Within sci-fi I love Philip K. Dick probably more than anyone else. I am all about flowery language that leaves me with good bite-sized quotes that, despite their size, capture a mood. The Martian Chronicles has none of that, and I absolutely loved it anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/azlnmc/ray_bradburys_the_martian_chronicles_doesnt_get/,2019-03-10 22:55:40,130,842,books
jkn3o9,The Martian is the first book at length that I've finished in years.,"Disclaimer: Gonna spoil a bit if you're planning to read it.

I feel so good after having read it, and I haven't felt so emotionally involved in a book since high school (Flowers for Algernon really tugged at the strings for me). Mark Watney is an incredible character. His persevering thought processes to get out of a rough spot, his sense of wise-ass humor that he just slips in every now and then (The messages to NASA had me roaring with laughter), the way his mind wanders for the sake of keeping himself preoccupied before space madness kicks in. Just fantastic, incredibly entertaining and engaging. That ending was incredible too, nothing could have torn me from the book in those last 30 pages. His commentary on the human race was sentimental gold after a journey like his.

My issue with books tends to be that my mind wanders at times, and I feel like I'm fighting a sense of being bored with the story or the pacing. The worst is when I know my eyes are glossing words and I have to go back and reread to make sure I follow. Mark Watney spends over a year on Mars, and I just kept wanting to know how he manages. I don't want to lose this pacing or sense of ""looking forward to reading"" that I've garnered from this book, so I'm going to be looking into more survival stories and science fiction. It's such an incredible feeling when you can understand and follow a scientific dialogue; This book made sure to keep that satisfaction pumping while reading.

Anyway, just wanted to share among a community of book readers. I haven't been so invested in reading for so long and now in my mid 20's, I'm hoping to finish at least two more books before the end of 2020. The Martian awoke a deep satisfaction from reading in me that I'm just looking to chase now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jkn3o9/the_martian_is_the_first_book_at_length_that_ive/,2020-10-30 01:05:36,99,531,books

I loved math in school, but I was terrible at science.

ucmava,"I just started reading The Martian during a bomb threat lockdown at our school, and it's so much better than I thought it would be!","I recently got The Martian from the library since I've heard a lot of good things about Andy Weir, but I hadn't been able to find the time to start reading it. I have AP exams next week, so most of my free time is spent studying or doing homework. But during lunch at school today, we had to go into lockdown because someone had called the police about a bomb threat. At the time, though, we had no idea what was going on. All I knew is that everyone was freaking out and no one knew what to do. All the students were saying there was a bomb and/or an active shooter in the school, but no one had any actual evidence. After being frantically stuffed into  a classroom with a bunch of other students, we were told to be quiet and stay out of sight. I had my backpack with me, so I considered using the time to study for my exams. Then I thought about it and realized that if I was gonna die, I didn't want my last moments on earth to be spent studying for a test. Also I was full of adrenaline and would've had no chance of actually being able to focus anyways. I then remembered that I had The Martian in my backpack and decided to start reading it in an attempt to calm my nerves. 

Backstory aside, it is so much better than I was expecting! I love that we jump straight into the action and don't spend a bunch of chapters leading up to the dramatic exit of Mark's team. Instead we get hooked right in and waste no time establishing the book's main plot. I also love how funny the book is! I thought Mark would be a stereotypical no-nonsense scientist completely devoid of emotion. Instead he's incredibly relatable and has a human response to being left alone on a foreign planet with very little chance of rescue. The fact that almost everything is based on real science is another reason why this book is so incredible. It makes it feel so much more believable and tense, knowing that Mark won't just be able to create some fantastical deus ex machina tech that will solve all his problems. It means that even though I pretty much know how the story will end, i'm still incredibly invested in seeing how we actually get there. I can't wait to keep reading!

14b46sk,"""The Martian"" - by Andy Weir","This book was highly recommended here so I decided to give it a go, and oof..  it's not so good.

It's just a constant sequence of ""uh oh here's a problem, oh here is a solution"" followed by ""uh oh, the solution caused another problem!"" ... ad infinitum.

Really not finding anything in the book particularly appealing.  It's like Andy Weir is trying really hard to appeal to juvenile high schoolers/undergrads with Mark Watney's incessant crude humor.  Also all characters speak at all times as if they are explaining information to a layman - which makes no sense considering they are experienced engineers & Department Heads at NASA..  It is abundantly clear that all explanations are dumbed down at all times for the benefit of the reader, which makes it make less sense when considering conversations are being had between extremely smart people..

I will finish the book because I am not a quitter but I just as easily could have not even started it and I wouldn't feel like I've missed anything.

zmcd5r,"I absolutely loved “The Martian”. I also absolutely loved “Project Hail Mary”.

The overly contrived angst and lackluster storytelling set in a world with no real allure despite being a freaking MOON BASE was boring at best and cringey at worst.

37fpgw,"*The Martian* was pretty terrible, I thought. A negative review.","I understand that, as they say, YMMV.  But *The Martian* made me confused and furious, so here's a negative review, starting with the YMMV-apt sorts of things and proceeding to what I believe are genuine aesthetic failures.

**It's not funny**.  I know, I know.  YMMV, *de gustibus* etc.  Still, I couldn't believe what Weir's idea of a funny protagonist was.  

**The prose is both dull and clunky**.  When approaching a book, I try to avoid reading the jacket copy, since I don't want it to color my experience of the narrative.  But after several pages of *The Martian*, I wondered, ""what the hell?—is this written by some engineer who's never read nice prose, and who has no ear for how people talk?""  And so I checked the back jacket flap, and bingo.  In addition, all the cussing sounds completely forced, like it's written by a guy who swore off cusses when he was eight but has seen a couple times on TV a cop show or an action movie, where characters sometimes cuss.

**Predictable cycle of problem/worry/solution/problem**.  What really galled me about this was how exaggerated the troughs and peaks were.  ""Well, that's it: I'm going to die.""  ""Hm, well maybe if I do this one thing ... "" ""Aha!  Smooth sailing from here.""  ""Oh no!  I'm going to die!""

**Un-self-conscious tiresome masculinity**.  Rainbows are gay!  ""Bro, tell her how you *feel*, man!""  Dude I'm so starved for sex, I wouldn't even say no to a GREEN ALIEN MARTIAN chick!  Like, a guy needs to get laid, amirite, fellow guys?  

**The nuts and bolts intrude into the vehicle of the narrative**.  So we're supposed to believe that we're getting Watney's log, as written or dictated during his time on Mars.  But how many times do we get, say, sentences of the form ""Remember, I did X back when Y happened,"" as a way of making sure we readers of the novel don't miss crucial background?  Someone keeping a log isn't writing a novel, and doesn't need to remind his readers constantly that such-and-such already happened.  Every time we're reminded in this way, it feels like Weir is reaching through the prose to make sure we readers—we stupid, goldfish-memory readers—are following along.

**The science/engineering fetishism**.  So first, I can't understand the significance of Weir's engineering authenticity.  As far as I'm concerned, nothing about the *story* is improved by all the back-of-the-envelope calculations, the physics, the astronomy, the stoichiometry.  It might as well be about decoupling the Heisenberg compensators to enhance the molecular patterns or whatever.  

But even granting that the science cred is somehow a merit of the book, *it fails on its own terms*.  All of the stuff at the beginning about creating arable soil on Mars is complete nonsense.  Earth soil isn't like a sourdough starter; you can't just mix it with gravel and get new soil.  ~~Poop isn't innocuous, even if it's your own.~~  [EDIT: I am told eating one's own poop is in fact safe.  /u/get_it_together1 links [this resource](http://gawker.com/5985723/can-you-eat-your-own-poop) in the comments.  I find this hard to believe, but I've been wrong before.]  Potatoes need multiple layerings of soil for a full yield.  ~~Calculating potato yields on Mars should take into account the lower solar energy which reaches Mars, relative to what reaches Earth, and Watney/Weir never does this.~~  [EDIT: I am told the potatoes were grown under artificial light, not sunlight.  I retract this particular complaint.]

Or let's take the new unit of measurement, the pirate-ninja.  Forget for the moment about whether it's funny—any engineer would know this is superfluous.  One kilowatt-hour is a measure of energy.  One sol is a measure of time (24 hrs 37 min).  The rate of energy used over time is power, and we already have units for that: watts.  One pirate-ninja = about 41 watts.

In short, if the scientific bona fides are supposed to be the draw here (and make up for the crummy prose and plot structure), they're not the bona fides we need.

**No sense of an audience**.  When I first began the book, I wondered, ""Who is this *for*?""  Weir takes for granted that we know how an airlock works, and the rudimentary physics involved, but then we need to be told that 'CO_2' is the abbreviation for carbon dioxide?  Or several times Watney says ""I'll spare you the math, but ...""—why weren't we spared the math all those other times?  Is this a book for people who like seeing the calculations or not?

**Cranky conclusion**—I give *The Martian* a D.  Probably this will be one of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book.  If you're considering",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/37fpgw/the_martian_was_pretty_terrible_i_thought_a/,2015-05-27 08:09:53,238,177,books

145h4y8,The Martian is just another Isekai,"Andy Weirs The Martian is nothing more than a cleverly disguised entry into the ever-popular isekai genre. Yes, you heard it right. We might miss Truck-Kun, but his distant cousin, the rude Sandstorm-Chan, still delivers.

In isekais, the protagonist is usually taken away to another world or universe where they must fend for themselves. In The Martian, Mark Watney finds himself stranded alone on... another planet. Suddenly, our brave astronaut is forced to navigate an environment that might as well be an alien world.

Also, let's not forget the isekai trope of having an overpowered main character who possesses unparalleled abilities or knowledge. While Mark Watney may not be endowed with magical powers or cheat codes, he is portrayed as someone with a vast knowledge, not only in botany and mechanical engineering, but also on other ""science""-stuff- He clearly possesses more expertise than your average astronaut could ever dream of. And of course, he almost never fails in his endeavors and if he does, it is never due to his own personal shortcomings, which appear to be non-existent, but rather due to external causes outside his control. Still, like your generic isekai, he perseveres, persists and perdures and emerges victorious with little to no trouble at all.

While our hero is not collecting his very own harem like in most isekai (unless you count potatoes), he does attract a wide array of female admirers who get weirdly sexual about him. Meanwhile, his male colleagues maintain a professional respect for his exploits. Can't have any homoeroticism in our male targeted escapism. But just like in other isekai stories, side characters serve as mere plot devices, with little to no character arc of their own and distinguishable features that go beyond their roles in relation to the protagonist. All secondary characters simply get sidelined for the sake of the protagonist's heroic exploits.

Mark Watney loves, loves, loves the grind. I believe he even mentions it himself at some point. I distinctly remember the time he watneyed all over his crops. It's almost as if he's trying to level up his survival skills like an isekai character grinding for experience points. Page after page, I awaited a status window to pop up, displaying all his newfound skills and abilities of Mars Simulator: Potato Edition. It doesn't happen (spoiler!), but I wouldn't have been surprised if it did.

It's time to acknowledge the truth! The Martian is not just a science fiction tale; it's a clever ploy to introduce unsuspecting Western readers to the gripping genre that is isekai. By masquerading as a serious space survival story, it slyly captures readers' attention and draws them into the world of homocidial truck drivers and overpowered protagonists.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/145h4y8/the_martian_is_just_another_isekai/,2023-06-09 21:18:38,19,0,books

116utew,Meandering Through The Martian Chronicles,"\- Well, I just wrapped up Ray Bradbury's first major work of science fiction, and I guess I'll have to find something to do with myself. As I understand it, this is the book that really launched Bradbury's popularity, and I can easily understand why. The Martian Chronicles certainly wasn't what I expected, in a good way. Instead of any sort of standard creation with stories linking one to the next to advance the overall plot, you are led to meander through different tales vaguely hinting at some overarching themes. It had slight I, Robot vibes, which was great as I loved that book too.

\-Ray Bradbury cites Jules Verne and H.G. Wells as writers he took a lot of inspiration from, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs and the John Carter of Mars series. Those influences are absolutely felt reading The Martian Chronicles, as bizarre, almost Twilight Zone-like events play out on wonderfully written Martian landscapes. This is a fun read full of exploration, nuanced characters, and two galactic races meeting and failing to coexist. 

\-As with most readers, I've read Fahrenheit 451 and always found Bradbury's insight into future technology well met. In The Martian Chronicles he writes of devices that resemble Amazon Alexa, iPhone watches, Ring and so on. All in 1950. Maybe it wasn't so far fetched to imagine these futuristic devices as Americans had seen the auto industry, the weapons industry, the aircraft and rocket industry all begin to boom. Still Bradbury deserves a ton of credit for being fairly accurate.

***“Ask me, then, if I believe in the spirit of the things as they were used, and I’ll say yes. They’re all here. All the things which had uses. All the mountains which had names. And we’ll never be able to use them without feeling uncomfortable. And somehow the mountains will never sound right to us; we’ll give them new names, but the old names are there, somewhere in time, and the mountains were shaped and seen under those names. The names we’ll give to the canals and mountains and cities will fall like so much water on the back of a mallard. No matter how we touch Mars, we’ll never touch it. And then we’ll get mad at it, and you know what we’ll do? We’ll rip it up, rip the skin off, and change it to fit ourselves.”*** 

\- In general, The Martian Chronicles follows a plot centered around humans finally developing the technology to make it to Mars, and how an expedition to Mars would likely go should the planet have ever proved habitable. Think of this as a cosmic version of the Christopher Columbus story. Humans arrive on Mars with semi-good intentions, and after several failed attempts to interact and coexist with Martians, they finally infest and overtake the Red Planet like earlier European settlers to the New World. Most of the Martian race even ends up dying out due to sickness and disease (chickenpox ironically) that humans once again inadvertently bring.  And, I have no doubt this would actually happen if we did truly find another habitable planet. We are a living plague.

\- There are tales here that could be an Episode of Rick & Morty, as with the Second Expedition being placed in a Martian lunatic asylum. There are also Chronicles here that are filled with original horror, as with one expedition which lands on Mars seemingly inhabited by the crew's dead relatives. Ray Bradbury shows a great mastery here in the range of tone he is able to write out. He can strike terror, he can be funny, and he can be powerful. It is all on display here in The Martian Chronicles.

 ***“Garrett,"" said Stendahl, ""do you know why I've done this to you? Because you burned Mr. Poe's books without really reading them. You took other people's advice that they needed burning. Otherwise you'd have realized what I was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago. Ignorance is fatal, Mr. Garrett.”*** 

\-Here too we have mentions of occurrences that any reader could see would one day influence Fahrenheit 451. Censorship is prevalent in the background, on the goings-on of Earth. Freedoms are being limited, and people are moving to Mars to escape the increasingly totalitarian governments of Earth practicing mass book burnings . There are accompanying tales that are pretty interesting in regards to this, such as ""Usher II"" which the above quote is from. ""Usher II"", without giving away the story, draws much from Edgar Allan Poe and Earth's censory of the great writers. This must have been one of Bradbury's fears that actually has yet to come true, as it is obviously referenced again quite heavily in his later classic.

***“Not until the good Lord is. Oh, don’t look so terribly shocked, please. The Lord is not serious. In fact, it is a little hard to know just what else He is except loving. And love has to do with humor, doesn’t it? For you cannot love someone unless you put up with him, can you? And you cannot put up with someone constantly unless you can laugh at him. Isn’t that true? And certainly we are ridiculous little animals wallowing in the fudge bowl, and God must love us all the more because we appeal to his humor.”***

***""There was Earth and there the coming war, and there hundreds of thousands of mothers or grandmothers or fathers or brothers or aunts or uncles or cousins. They stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of Earth, much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of Mars; it was a problem reversed. To all intents and purposes, Earth now was dead; they had been away from it for three or four years. Space was an anesthetic; seventy million miles of space numbed you, put memory to sleep, depopulated Earth, erased the past, and allowed these people here to go on with their work. But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other’s faces. At nine o’clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn. The people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out. They waited.""***

\-Conflict amongst man and Martian eventually turns to conflict amongst man and himself. An atomic war erupts between the totalitarian governments of Earth, and the citizens of Mars are left to contemplate staying, or returning to Earth to fight or aid their home countries. Being published in 1950, fresh off the meat grinder of World War II, this had to be a fear that routinely played in everyone's minds. Bradbury is working that fear here, as he did in later works as well with the Cold War looming. It's funny how the threat of atomic war doesn't hit as hard to today's readers (though maybe it should), yet in the 50's and 60's these themes likely wrought fear and dread over fresh memories of war. We really aren't that far removed from these times either, just that we exist in such a different, more comfortable generation that sees atomic war as a relic of the past. 

\-I had several comments on a few of the tales. I really wished one of the stories returned to the scene of the Third Expedition, because what the actual fuck. ""Way In The Middle Air"" was sobering in that it forces you to realize Jim Crow laws, segregation and slavery wasn't all that long ago. I consider Bradbury a more contemporary writer, so reading this tale initially felt out of place...like was this supposed to take place just after the Civil War? But then I remember Bradbury was writing in the 40's and 50's where the South was still an awful place to be black, and Civil Rights Movements had only just began, and there was still segregation and lynchings...and, we REALLY ARE NOT THAT FAR REMOVED FROM THOSE TIMES EITHER.

\-Ugly what human greed did to The Martian. Yuck.

\-Let me know your favorite tales from this book. I wholeheartedly enjoyed The Silent Towns (major LOL), The Off Season, The Martian, The Earth Men, and The Third Expedition either because these stories were hilarious or horrible. Let me know what you thought!

I just finished the Martian and the whole time it made me miss Project Hail Mary. I just started PHM again and instantly loved it again. I think I had nostalgia for the Martian the first time through PHM but now I'm realizing how much more I like PHM.

What is everyone's take on the two? Which do you like more?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tb13wg/project_hail_mary_the_martian/,2022-03-10 15:26:02,24,16,books
oiwx8w,Project Hail Mary was even better than The Martian.,"When I posted on this sub about having read The Martian and loved it, almost every commenter told me to read PHM. And I am grateful for that.

I didn't know much about this book going into it. I only knew that it had an intelligent alien in it. I don't know what I was expecting but it turned out to be even better.

The plot was an absolute banger. The premise about alien microbes threatening humanity's existence is something I have seen before but never like this. Also the fact that Eridians are less advanced (they hadn't worked out relativistic physics and whatnot) than humans was kinda new to me. So that was a pleasant surprise.

I loved the friendship dynamic between Ryland and Rocky. It was absolutely adorable. My only complaint is that the ending could've been done better. I realize this might be an unpopular opinion but I really wanted Ryland to go back to Earth. I'm not particularly mad about it to the point of hating it. But y'know just saying.

One more thing: I could not have been the only one to imagine the Interstellar docking sequence music when the Hail Mary was spinning out of control over Adrian, right? Right?

3zet0d,The Martian has single-handedly rekindled my love of reading.,"Hello, book readers of Reddit. I've never used this sub before, but I hope to use it more regularly because of my recent experience. Before around two weeks ago, I was very apathetic about reading. My English class in the previous school year had assigned books that I found unpleasant or just plain uninteresting. When I had to read those books in two week cycles, I was burned out on reading any sort of novel by the time the academic year ended. 
However, two weeks ago my (now different) English teacher gave my class a reading assignment to complete during winter break where we choose a novel ourselves, read it, and write a paper identifying a character from a psychoanalytic perspective. At first, I had no idea what book to choose because I immediately remembered my unpleasant reading experiences from the previous school year. Due to the fact that I didn't get to see the movie back in October, I chose to read The Martian by Andy Weir. Oh my god, I haven't read such a page turner in what feels like forever. The book was immediately interesting with its setting and awesome main character. Not to mention the memorable lines and different perspectives were expertly written. I was instantly hooked. I don't think I've ever read a book where I would be laughing out loud one minute and then have a face of horror the next. This book has made me love reading again, and I hope to read more great books in the very near future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3zet0d/the_martian_has_singlehandedly_rekindled_my_love/,2016-01-04 13:40:41,79,147,books
xcu2qy,I read The Martian in two days,"I guess there are spoilers for The Martian: The book. Please be advised.

I recently decided that I don't read many books lately. I seem to binge read, and then not read for long periods of time. My local library has ok Ebooks, etc., but I checked the local community college, and it was super easy to sign up and check stuff out there, as well. Anyway, I watched a Youtube show about SciFi books, and I searched for a couple at my now librarIES, but there were wait times for the ones I wanted. So, I decided to read ""The Martian"". I haven't seen more than 10 minutes of the movie. Not sure why, seems like something I'd like. So, sent it to my Kindle, started reading on Saturday. Got very far into it. Continued on Sunday. Finished early afternoon. 

I liked it. It was largely a journal written by a guy from times close to these, and most of it was good. I'm not sure what to think of the schoolyard/The Office jokes made by Watney. I guess I would do the same if I was in his place, but it took points off my final grade for some reason. 

All in all, it was a good and easy read. 99.9999999% of all people who have ever existed on Earth would not  have the knowledge and training that Watney needed to survive. That was fixed in my mind as I was reading. 

Also, would anyone realistically in any situation shoot a human into space with canvas as a covering? The author painstakingly described Watney disassembling his rover for other uses. He couldn't have used a piece of that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xcu2qy/i_read_the_martian_in_two_days/,2022-09-13 01:21:16,13,17,books

wnkg14,The Martian was worse than I expected,"Some spoilers for The Martian ahead, and spoiler-tagged discussion of Project Hail Mary. Nothing major. 

I thought I'd like The Martian more than I did. I loved Project Hail Mary; it had its flaws but it was fun and thoroughly engaging. The Martian has all the same flaws amped up to 11. Mark Watney is a 2D facsimile of a character with no personality to boast of beyond ""I'm resourceful and make witty one-liners"". The plot of the book is very repetitive: 

i have a plan -> something fucked up -> i fixed it 

Watney spends 687 days - 22 whole months - alone in Mars, with no one to talk to for a significant portion and... He barely changes. He doesn't become more jaded, less optimistic. He doesn't seem to have any sort of mental turbulence, doesn't show any psychological impact. It doesn't have to be a dark story, I love a good 'hope in the face of all odds' story, but he doesn't seem to be impacted by his situation at all. It's still 'haha quippy one liner hope I make it' all the way through. Nothing seemed to genuinely worry him, so it was hard to have any investment in his survival as a reader. 

Mindy from NASA gets more development, going from a shy, relatively junior worker to someone confident in her role. 

Even the science stuff was... Meh. It was well researched, but it got repetitive after a while.

Project Hail Mary improves on all these fronts though. >!The astrophage was a far more interesting mystery to me, Ryland Grace has some very real personality, Stratt seemed like an actual official in comparison to Venkat 'craaaap' Kapoor (I liked him mostly but that one line made me cringe), and Rocky my beloved has nothing wrong with him.!<

zsdwv7,"A tale of a red planet: ""The Martian Chronicles"" by Ray Bradbury.","Mars. The red planet. The fourth one from the sun. And the setting for many science fiction stores. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs and others have written stories about this planet. Among them is an author that I've talked about before, that is of course Ray Bradbury and the novel ""The Martian Chronicles"".

Well, a fix-up novel to be exact, a collection of short stories that may (or may not) be related to a specific story arc and sometimes these could also include short stories that were previously published. One such example was ""Mutant"" written by Henry Kuttner. And  Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles"" is another.

In many ways the book is very much like a documentation of a sort with the first human expeditions to Mars, the plight of the Martian people and the decline of their civilization, the colonization of Mars and of its eventual abandonment when nuclear war consumes Earth ecetera.

I initially read these stories in the ""Bradbury Stories"" collection. But reading them as presented in ""The Martian Chronicles"" certainly made them more satisfying to read!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zsdwv7/a_tale_of_a_red_planet_the_martian_chronicles_by/,2022-12-22 05:53:54,13,57,books
io1hsp,The Martian by Andy Weir,"The Martian Review.
TICKET TO MARS. AND A LOT OF LAUGHTER.

Released 2011

Rating by me: 8.5/10

Andy Weir, this guy has done a great job and has put together a book that is not only realistic to extreme lengths but is funny as hell. It has an apocalyptic vibe which for some reason is not scary at all (well, except sometimes).

The story revolves around Mark Watney, an Astronaut who is deserted on Mars. Yes, the planet. With nothing but an exceptional sense of humor, a mediocre understanding of botany (eh, Plant Science), and a bountiful of bad luck, he challenges the odds of his survival.

The science in this book is real, not that I am encouraging you to try working with Hydrazine (Highly Flammable, Mom will shout at you), but it makes you think you're smart and are capable of being a scientist. The story is quite gripping and funny even though the entire burden of keeping you stuck to the book is held by only one character.

The book has a lot of swear words, but I don't blame Mark, he is stuck on Mars so cut him some slack. It never goes down the drain like many books of a similar apocalyptical genre would do, where the protagonist loses the determination to fight off the negative element. While you read the story, you will feel as if you are there alongside Mark, and last I checked, everyone needs a getaway from their crazy lives. And Mars isn't all that bad, except for the poor oxygen and water supply.

Let this be it. Getaway to Mars. Aboard 'Hermes'.

Till Next Time. Goodbye You Lovely Readers.

I'm so excited to FINALLY be starting this one!! Anyone who knows me knows that I'm obsessed with space and NASA and will stay up until 3am to watch a rocket launch or ISS space walk. And I desperately miss my tv husband, Gordo Stevens, so this will be a welcome distraction

SYNOPSIS: Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ""human error"" are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit-he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o4071b/the_martian/,2021-06-20 07:39:04,3,8,books

“I	don't	know,”	 he	said. “And even if	I	did, I	couldn't	tell	them intime.”

And later in the same section the book states that it's 32 minutes until impact. And the average time it takes light to get there is 12.5 minutes one way. So the message would be received before impact.

It is very clear in one of his less notable books, “Artemis” where Weir wrote as a 18 year-old Saudi Arabian women.

tt22ph,"The Martian, book vs movie Mitch Henderson","I am unsure whether this is a right subreddit, so sorry if not. 

I cannot find anybody talking about this, and as I recently reread the book and re-watched the movie, it yet again struck me how different Mitch is in the book as opposed to the movie, anybody has some quote or article if this was a conscious decision, or if it just sort of happened?

What I mean mostly is how much more timid and unsure the Sean Bean's characterization and character's portrayal as opposed to Mitch in the book.

Mitch in the book is seen by many characters (and directly called out) as a d\*\*k, but again as admitted by many characters he is a d\*\*k with insane work ethics and an endless respect for the astronauts. As demonstrated by his anger towards administration's decision first not to tell them about Watney's survival and later about the Purnell's maneuver. Finally his dissatisfaction takes form in sending the information about Purnell's maneuver secretly to Hermes thus setting the rescue plan in motion. During both these scenes he expresses anger and calls everyone cowards and seemingly (by Annie's comment he almost committed physical violence onto Teddy, how angry he was. 

Now compare this to Sean Bean's Mitch. Sure he thinks cosmonaut's have a right to know, but he seems mostly disappointed about not being allowed to tell them, tired mostly, if angry then definitely not outwards angry. 

But sure, this could be a concession to make everyone look more professional. But one scene in the movie makes his change deeper. When the Purnell maneuver is on the way, Teddy confronts Mitch about it. In both versions Teddy confronts him, telling him he knows it was him who passed the course correction.

In the movie, he tells Mitch that he knows what he did and that he expects his resignation when the astronauts get home and Mitch accepts is, I would even say in an embarrassed manner.

In the book when confronted Mitch fires back asking for proof and when he hears admission there is none he blows him off with a comments that they probably have better things to do right know.

That is entirely different character. One respects authority to a point and then if he is convinced authority is wrong he makes his own decision he stands by. The other underhandly circumvents the authority and then submits to it when caught.

Finally when we are getting the ""After stories"" we see that everyone involved with Ares mission is excitedly watching the launch of the next mission except for Mitch, who is clearly all over this Space business and is playing golf now (assumed after resignation). Quite a stark difference to work obsessed book Mitch.

I kind of have to wonder, whether film wanted to (yup tinfoil hat time) enforce the respect the authority over the Book's if you believe you are doing the right thing go for it and f\*\*k those who disagree.

I also found the character ""Wit"" in Stormlight Archives to be that same sarcasm and humor, but he just wasn't in the books enough.  Loved almost every scene he was in.

What other character's have that same type of humor? What books had you laughing out loud because of wit or sarcasm?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/89lec6/finished_the_martian_and_loved_the_humor_and_wit/,2018-04-04 02:21:31,29,47,books
6wfzz7,"Finished The Martian, it's been long since I read a book this good","Based on a friend's recommendation, I bought the novel in a bookstore and had it sitting on a shelf while I learned for my exams. I finished those Friday and The Martian this Sunday night (technically Monday morning). I can't remember when I was captivated enough to sacrifice hours of my sleep to reading but it was worth every second of it. 

The premise is captivating simple: an astronaut, stranded on Mars is faced with the struggle for survival when he is abandoned on Mars. Revealing any more would take away from the story, so I'll refrain.

To me the most exciting thing was the man versus nature aspect of this novel, the struggle for survival being the purest form said conflict. There is no villain to defeat, treasure to be found or love to be expressed, just a man and his will to survive. The scientific accuracy enhances this experience even more and all in all creates a truly captivating hard science fiction novel. 

If you haven't read it and are even slightly intrigued, go out there and read it!

32ody9,"Ready Player One, The Martian - Poor character development","I've recently been on a Sci-Fi binge. I've been reading a number of recent books that come highly recommended. RP1 and The Martian being 2 that have received a lot of recent acclaim.

I enjoyed both books immensely, but I couldn't help notice that both really struggled in the area of character development.

If you've read either of these did you feel the same way?

In terms of character and story development Ready Player One felt like it was at the level of good fan fiction. There was never any real tension and the main character seemed to breeze from one success to another. It was a fun read, it's just that having received such high praise from across the web I really expected a very solid story. Instead I got a fun, but ultimately forgettable popcorn story.

The Martian has also received high praise from across the web. I am an armchair astronomer, so I really enjoyed the hard science aspects of the story. The character development on the other hand was dismal. I felt the author utterly squandered their opportunity to explore the protagonist's despair and loneliness. Instead what we got was a lot of semi-technical detail about habitat patching. I really enjoyed the technical aspects but it just felt like such a missed opportunity to explore the astronaut's inner turmoil (there didn't seem to be any!).

ygnlwi,Can we talk about the chapter 'Way in the Middle of the Air' from Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles?,"Let it be known that I have been thoroughly enjoying this book so far. 

I understand that this book was published in 1950, and I don't agree with the cancelling of old literature for the use of the 'N' word, but unlike works like To Kill A Mockingbird, I'm struggling to recognize the intention of this short story. The last line where Teece makes the point that he called him 'Sir' right until the end is poignant, but I feel like the overall message was a little too subtle.

Is this just my modern lens? Was Ray Bradbury actually conflicted over the idea of equality? Was he being subtle because it's likely that his audience would have found this radical for the time? Has this simply not aged well? Did I miss some subtext that makes the point less ambiguous?

av9fvx,I just read “The Sirens of Titan” by Kurt Vonnegut.,"Both of my parents were writers. As a rebellion, I often deliberately avoided books they would recommend. That turned out to be idiotic, because they have impeccable taste.

I just finished the book, not 5 minutes ago-

and I sobbed.

The language, the flow, the cadence, the characters. This book enveloped me within the first 3 pages. The journey of Malachi Constant, from shitty, rich playboy, to Martian slave, to disgraced Earth monster, to Titanic nomad, to salvation seeking earthling once again.

It’s all nothing.

I never believed I could be moved by something so nihilistic and bleak. But this shook me to the core. Life is random. Life is an accident.

Read this book. Please.


Edit: A lot if you were asking about some other recommendations from my parents. Here are some my favorites off the top of my head:

Winter’s Tale - Mark Helprin     
Rebecca - Daphne Du Maurier    
The Second Coming - Walker Percy    
Cry, the Beloved Country - Alan Paton    
Telegraph Avenue - Michael Chabon    
Lincoln In The Bardo - George Saunders    
100 Years of Solitude - Gabriel Garcia Marquez    
A Tale for the Time Being - Ruth Ozeki    
The Exorcist - William Peter Blatty    
Naked Lunch - William S. Bourroughs    
The Sellout - Paul Beatty    
The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Haruki Murakami

But with all of the 5 star reviews on Amazon, Goodreads, and buzz that the book gets here, this book sounded like the second coming of Christ. I was really excited to read it, but I don't quite understand all the high praise that this book has received. 

I did think it was legitimately funny - I enjoyed Watney's one-liners and generally snarky behavior. I also respect all of the science and engineering detail that clearly went into all of his problem solving, but I felt at certain times all of these details bogged the pace of the story down.

I thought the alternating chapters from NASA's point of view were more interesting, but even then I thought those got kind of bland.  I found the NASA characters to be relatively flat - like you could have swapped the names of all them and wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. Their voices and personalities weren't differentiated in my opinion.

Overall I'd give it two or three stars.  A decent book, mildly entertaining in parts, but I was never tense or nervous.  I dunno, maybe that was just me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3d97nx/finished_the_martiandidnt_engage_me_at_all/,2015-07-14 14:13:50,28,8,books

10xnrkg,Project Hail Mary... Great book but worth the hype?,"I literally just finished reading Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir and I genuinely enjoyed it. I devoured the last 5 chapters of the book but I'm not sure I personally agree with all the hype the book got. Well, I agree with most of the hype it got but I still think that The Martian is better even if just slightly. r/52book and I'm guessing this sub thinks highly of this book some even going as far as calling it the best book theyve read recently and I can see why for me it's only second to Firestarter by Stephen King from the books I read this year. 

My issues with the book are mostly with Grace he's too much of a jokester for this type of story. It felt like Andy Weir tried to recreate Mark Watney from the Martian and just made a sillier version of him. I noticed that a lot of my complaints are based on the fact that I really enjoyed The Martian and had I not read it I would probably have enjoyed this book more. Watney had to do everything on his own while Grace had >!Rocky, I can't believe how much I cared for this fucking spider and at one point I kind wish he had died when we thought he had it would have been more impactful to me but In the end I'm glad he didn't!< And don't get me started on how much respect I lost for Grace when. I found out how he got on the ship. It also changed the basis of the friendship with his fellow astronauts. He claims they were his friends and that he was closed to them but as you go through the story you realize that just wasn't true. 

Anyways I know I'm nitpicking this was easily a great read and I genuinely enjoyed the ending even though I really >!wanted to see Grace return to earth and see how things ended up there I would even be down for a sequel!< I rate it 4 Stars maybe 4.5 but I'm not sure yet I have to live with it a bit longer.

I wonder if that's because I can see it coming, like when you watch a film with subtitles, you know the punchline. 

Anyhow, sure this question has been asked many times, the one book or series of books that I find myself revisiting (something I don't do often) is the Adrian Mole series by Sue Townsend. 

Even though there are now 30 years old, they still have me in hysterics. No other book has got anywhere near making me laugh like this. 

Also I think they are probably more funny if you are from the UK, as a teenage boy growing up in 80s Britain is probably a very different person to that in the USA!

Edit: wow, didn't quite expect this response, amazing what great discussion books can lead to!

4cqpkb,HUGE plot hole in The Martian? *Warning: Spoilers,"**Spoiler Alert:**

So I'm reading The Martian by Andy Weir, and I love it. I die for it. I saw the movie when it came out and I was obsessed. I waited awhile to read the book so I could forget some of the details of the movie or else I know I would just focus in on the discrepancies.

But I have one HUGE problem with both the movie and the book. The astronauts had to leave Mars because there was a dust storm that was so intense, it was tipping the MAV to the point of no return (PONR). So they left Mars because the MAV was tipping over sideways assuming Mark was dead from the probe that broke off during the storm, right? 

Then later on in the book Mark is trying to get to the Ares 4 site in Schiaparelli crater. He encounters a dust storm and NASA can't warn him about since he fried the communication system on his rover. A huge part of why NASA was so worried that Mark wouldn't even understand he was in a dust storm until it was basically too late and his life support systems started tanking. But thankfully, Mark being the smart astronaut he is, figures it out after a few sols and modifies his path. He gets to the crater, goes to the MAV at Ares 4 site and voila, it's still standing. It endured through this horrific dust storm that only happens once every few months on Mars. The *same* sort of dust storm that made his astronaut-mates leave him on Mars, alone.

WHY are these two dust storms so differing in their intensity!? That's literally impossible. There is no atmosphere to contribute to such differing storm intensities like here on Earth. The first dust storm made them abort their mission early, the second dust storm Mark *literally* didn't know it was happening for a few sols, and even then, NASA said he would never know until his solar panels stopped working. The other MAV was still upright. Does anyone have a solution to this HUGE plot hole that I can't stop thinking about?! It's driving me nuts. I've been thinking about this since I saw the movie.

I kept waiting for the next bad turn of events for poor Mark.

ts7tch,"Reading some old sci-fi: Asimov, Bradbury, Heinlein, Orwell, etc. The sexism is astounding! A rant","(I posted earlier but used the word mysogeny. That was incorrect and reposted with the word sexism for accuracy.)

These geniuses could see the future and create amazing worlds, but still couldn't see equality of the sexs. Telling of the times:

Asimov's Foundation had only one woman character and it was a Queen shopping...

Bradbury has many short stories. Including the ""The Other Foot"" which couldn't be published at the time for it's criticism of segregation, very progressive for the time. Yet his women characters are housewives and note takers.

Orwell's Animal Farm had only one female animal. A horse that liked her mane brushed and her bows who ran away to the human farm. In 1984 Julia rebelled in a specifically surfacy way and was highly sexualized. Got some big neckbeard vibes when the protagonist first meets her.

Ringworld by Larry Niven again only had one woman character who again was young and sexualized. Her special ability was luck, not intelligence or bravery. She was basically an air head that was lucky. I couldn't get through the sequel because it devolved into a interspecies sex fantasy.

Heinlein I actually like a lot. I've only read Starship Troopers and the woman were BadAss! The had better reflexes or something so they were the captains of the big starships and garnered ridiculous respect. His characters are from South America to drive in the point of a unified human race. The movie white washed the book like crazy! Although I LOVE the movie for it's campiness. Would love a serious gritty remake.

In conclusion: reading older books has made me respect the very deep sexism that is pervasive in western culture. Don't be fooled, we have a long way to go! BUT we have come a long way. 

I highly recommend The Expanse as a sci-fi series. Bye bye sexism, racism, homophobia. Hello Earther, Martian, Belter racism.

A few comments in my earlier post assumed I'm a woman. Nope. Totally a dude. The reason I made this post is to illustrate how pervasive sexism was at the times these were written.

Edit: getting pretty frustrating seeing comments bashing me: ""they were written a long time ago, what do you expect!"" I literally started my body saying that...

Edit2: this post and it's comments are proof people only read titles and not the body of posts....

Edit3: people have correctly pointed out about other female animals in animal farm. Im not going to delete that part of the post, and dont know how to line through text, but keep that in mind. My bad, its been awhile and I listened to it vs read it which hurts my comprehension

Edit4: last edit. Once again, yes they were a product of there times. your comment is not original and proves you didn't read my full post. its literally the whole point of the post. These men wrote about Mars Colonies and Galactic Empires before Sputnik went up. YET couldn't see a future where men and woman were equal. That's how entrenched sexism was.

I want to have a definite ending to this book with proper aftermath of him reuniting with his family or deal with the interviews and politics regarding his isolation or something like that (assuming that happens and he doesn't die). Aftermath parts are some of the best parts of books where the protagonist finally reunites with family/civilization/goes back to their own time etc., for me at least. They provide some awesome closure over just ending with ""they walked away, tired from their journey, into the sunset""

I want to see some PTSD, some coping, some afteraffects and problems that occur past the end of the book, not a hawkward epilogue like in Mockingjay.

8b8s8r,"Reading The Martian again, thought of something plot breaking...","[Disclaimer] Sorry if this has been brought up before [End of Disclaimer]

In the Sol 63 Log Entry, Mark talks about how the Ares 4 MAV was sent to Mars 48 months (4 years) ahead of the planned (scrubbed) mission. With 11 months of travel time, that puts the Ares 4 MAV on Mars for 3 years, 1 month before the Ares 4 crew would ever arrive. Assuming that the timeframe was the same for the Ares 3 mission, that puts their MAV on Mars for the same amount of time.

Chapter 12 reveals what happened on Sol 6. The abort wind speed was 150 in the book (get to that in a minute). So with the danger of the MAV tipping at that point, wouldn't there be worry for the 3 years, 1 month that the MAV sits idle on Mars pre-mission?

Obviously taking dramatic effect into account, there needs to be a reason for the book to strand Mark on Mars, so this was a good way to do it. Referencing an article on NASA's website, They discuss the real life possibility of wind storms. ""The atmosphere on Mars is about 1 percent as dense as Earth’s atmosphere."" (Mersmann, 2017) meaning that the winds would not have the same effect as on earth. ""The winds in the strongest Martian storms top out at about 60 miles per hour"" (Mersmann, 2017)

Just thought this was all interesting to discuss. Like I said before, there obviously needed to be a plot device to get the crew off the planet but it just made me stop and think after thinking about the amount of time the MAV was on Mars and how no one was worried (supposedly) about it tipping while it waited for the crew.

tl;dr
MAV on mars for 3 years before mission, wouldn't there be cause for concern that it would tip before the crew got there?

g1zflm,"My new favorite pandemic apocalypse novel: After Everyone Died, by Sean Little. (It’s like The Martian mixed with Earth Abides.)","It’s a wonderful novel about survival, (honest, actual, non gimmicky survival) told from the perspective of an 18 year old. The book details his preparation and survival against the harsh Wisconsin winter. 

This book is seriously a breath of fresh air for me. I love apocalypse/post apocalypse, but often I find that the authors fall into the same patterns. That is, the drama points like fighting off other survivors or searching for a new home feel the same from book to book. They often also don’t *feel* like the world is really emptied of people because of forced confrontation/issues from the authors to increase drama. (I imagine this is the publishers pushing for more action to increase interest, but I’m not sure.)

The Martian and Earth Abides (by George R Stuart) are two of my favorite books, so the meeting to form this novel is an awesome experience for me. I may be a bit too bias in this post, and I don’t know if I’ve done a good job explaining myself or the book, but I’d like to hear what others who have read it think. 

Also this is my first post in r/books so I hope I didn’t break any rules. I just want to start a discussion about something I like. Sorry in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g1zflm/my_new_favorite_pandemic_apocalypse_novel_after/,2020-04-15 19:56:43,10,16,books
2fuxn9,Am I the only one who didn't really like The Martian (spoilers)?,"I was completely wowed by Andy Weir's short story, The Egg, so I was excited to read The Martian. It had a great premise and I really wanted to love it, but I found Watney too one-dimensional for me to really enjoy reading about him. Having been in what is essentially solitary confinement for an extended period of time, and with little to no chance of survival (at least, initially), I expected to witness the gradual unraveling of his psyche, or at least some wistful introspection. I understand that Watney is portrayed as a resilient guy who uses optimism as a coping method, but even so, I just found his demeanor to be incredible. His reaction to each life-threatening event seemed to be, ""Oh shit, almost died again 'cause of my dumbassery! Everything's cool now, though. Yay! (oYo) <--Boobs Lol!"" Of course that's an exaggeration, and I do get/appreciate Watney's sense of humor, but in this context it just felt forced and out of place. Overall, he just didn't seem human enough for me to become emotionally invested in him. The long passages of technical jargon didn't help.

I'm constantly seeing this book being hailed as one of the best sci fi novels in recent years, and I just don't get it. What gives? Did I miss something?

The protagonist, Mark Watney (to be played by Matt Damon in the movie) just cannot be beaten by his situation, despite the many MANY obstacles thrown at him throughout the story. His morale throughout his worst trials are truly a testament to keeping your shit together, even though it may be the worst ever thrown at you. I try to be a constant optimist, but this guy blew me away. I can only compare the story to an outer space, interplanetary version of Castaway. I think that if you read this, you can take away from it that : no matter how bad any situation may seem, there is always a solution nearby if you just sit and think it through. 

This to me embodies the general human spirit.

3eluhv,I am 37 pages into 'The Martian' and wondering if it gets any better,"Hi all.

A couple of days ago, a friend of mine bought me The Martian for my birthday. I've gone into it cold, knowing nothing about it except for what is said on the back cover. The concept of it all sounds great, and the reviews for it are very positive, but I have a problem with it.

The sense of humour. The guy doing these logs is in a life or death situation, and yet he is constantly making jokes. I get that this may be his way of dealing with things, but it seems to be almost Joss Whedon/AoU level - where he is joking about so much that it's hard to feel his danger when he doesn't seem to feel it.

One one of the pages I've just read, it begins by implying that something bad has just happened, but then follows by saying ""Over the past few days, I've been happily making water, and it's been going swimmingly (See what I did there? ""Swimmingly?"")""

I'm going to assume (hope) that this situation wears him down and eventually he really does start getting a bit more serious about his situation rather than making jokes every few paragraphs. Without posting spoilers: does it get any better?

The most tired and unoriginal convention in contemporary publishing is naming a book using the pattern:

THE \[SO-AND-SO'S\] WIFE.

Perhaps the most well-known is THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE. Or maybe THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE. Both of these were made into movies.

A few comments:

* Most, but not all, are fiction.
* Some are ""professions"", but others are ""identities"" (eg Liar, Widower) or something else (eg Tiger) but the format is the point here.
* I omitted books that have modifier that relates to the wife (eg The Earl's Inconvenient Wife), but kept those that modified the husband's profession (eg Nazi Officer; Time Traveler; Restaurant Critic).

I enjoyed it. I suppose that was expected, as everyone seems to love this book. I don't love it myself, but it was definitely entertaining and a nice break from the more serious stuff I have been reading. It's a brilliant first-effort from a clearly talented writer, and though it has problems it's definitely one of the better books I've read this year, perhaps my favourite of this challenge so far.

In an attempt to balance this out, I thought the book dragged on just a little between[Spoilers:](#s ""making contact with NASA and setting off to Ares 4""). I also found the Annie character *extremely* annoying, though I was perhaps supposed to. But this did little to detract from such an entertaining book. I'm glad it ended when it ended, and I probably won't reread this later in life, but for a quick, enjoyable novel it was really good, and one of very few books that have made me laugh out loud.

And even better, my copy didn't fall apart, was made properly, and didn't annoy me at all for once!

The long version: I'm still reading the book for the first time and I'm really enjoying it so far. In the beginning, I really liked how it was told almost entirely in the past in the form of Watney's mission logs. You aren't told events as they happen, you're only told what he had done in the past few hours at a time. 

That's why I found it a bit jarring when the book shifted to standard third person when they go back to Earth for the first time. It's not a bad thing, I just wasn't expecting it. 

This just got me thinking, would the book still work if it was told entirely in mission logs? I know that would add to the sense of isolation Watney feels as the audience would be in the same mindset as Watney. You'd have no idea if NASA knows he's alive, are they even looking for him, etc. 

I also thought that if this was done, would that make the book too dry? Having nothing but Watney's mission logs may become too boring if the book was nothing but that.

cnoouk,Yesterday I started reading The Martian Chronicles with my niece. So far it's one of the best reading experiences I've ever had.,"I don't mean reading The Martian Chronicles is one of the best reading experiences I've had (although that's a part of it -- I've read it before and it's one of my favorite books, my all-time favorite being Dandelion Wine). I mean, reading the same book as my niece, two feet away from her, and stopping and checking in with each other whenever we both have read a particularly great sentence or chapter. That, specifically, has been absolutely incredible.

Some back story: My niece is 12. Really bright, thoughtful, caring, and independent. Recently I had the opportunity to have a totally spontaneous conversation with her about the ""big questions"" in life, which started with me being curious and asking her if she believed in God. (I was helping her memorize a scout pledge that included something about being loyal to God and country.) The conversation made my day/week/month/year, and it struck me that I could start a two-person book club with her and it might be a lot of fun for both of us.

So I went to the library recently to browse around for some good books to introduce her to. I snapped my fingers when Bradbury came to mind, and fortunately the library had two copies of The Martian Chronicles available. I checked them out.

She got a head start on me, and when I asked her what she thought so far, she said, ""It's really cool. I liked the part where the one Martian says that Earth can't possibly support life because there's too much oxygen in its atmosphere."" I enthusiastically told her that that's my favorite thing about science fiction (and reading in general): how it can force your perspective to shift in some unexpected ways.

Yesterday, I finally finished a huge task that I'd been letting get in the way of me doing any reading at all this summer. And so I asked my niece if she wanted to read together for a bit. She said yes! We grabbed our copies of the book and sat outside on the back porch. My 7 year old nephew got curious and joined us with a few books of his own at first, and my niece helped him with his reading (she would make a great educator someday if she wants to be one!), which gave me a chance to catch up to her in our book.

It was only for a couple of hours, but those hours of reading were among the best I've ever had. Not only did I get to experience the joy of rediscovering an old favorite with some powerful moments, but I got to share that experience with this brilliant young woman in my life. We both gasped and laughed at parts, asked each other to ""let me know when you finish Page #__!"", and had some really great conversation about Bradbury's writing and about the ideas he was working with.

We both found the ""But you're not thirsty"" moment incredibly goosebump-inducing, for example. And after the chapter about the Martian psychiatrist believing the human expedition team to be delusions, to the point of killing all of them and then himself, we talked about how much that resonated today, with people entrenched so much in their current opinions and interpretations of ""facts"" that they seem completely incapable of accepting new evidence--and how using old assumptions to answer novel questions can be dangerous.

Anyway, this post has already gotten longer than I expected. I guess my big takeaway is: if you're having trouble finding the time to read again, try making a commitment to read a book with a young person in your life! It forced me to get away from my endless workload, and it's ended up being one of the best reading experiences of my life. Try it out!

unrvbg,I read Project Hail Mary after seeing on this sub once. Thanks for the suggestion,"It's 11:30. I have to be to work at eight and have a ton of meetings to attend and problems to fix. But I could not put this book down until it was done. The whole thing was great. The science was interesting, the problems were compelling, and even the character I liked the least wasn't a total downer for the whole experience. 

The last two chapters, though, really touched me. Grace made a choice I think we'd like to think we'd all make. He overcame his cowardice for the good of others. It's a hard thing to do sometimes, really putting others before yourself in life-altering ways. 

The dilemma the character faced in the end was the one he'd faced before, and had the decision made for him. Having him recieve a second chance and have the autonomy to make his own choice this time was a great display of character growth. Or maybe Stratt was right  >!and he was always going to do the right thing.!< Maybe that's open to interpretation.

38xodn,"Am I the only one that found ""Ready Player One"" and ""The Martian"" incredibly boring?","For real though why got those two books so popular? I've read both, and for me ""Ready Player One"" was just lazy written and to cover that up filled with obscure or less obscure '80 references and boyhood fantasies and basically just a slimmed down version of ""The Otherland"", it felt like watching ""I love the 80's"" on a VHS. It felt more like a book aimed specifically towards those people who are 30y or older and maybe that's why I didn't really had that feeling I was reading a good book.    
   
The same with ""The Martian"" it was incredible booooring to read for me, it read like someone tried to write a book but then just said ""Ok fuck it, I researched all that stuff, let's write a book about just all those facts instead and for the sake of god hopefully we can keep it to one character. Mhh how to do it best."" I felt no connection to the main character or any of the other characters ever, if any of them had died I would not have dropped one tear. Wait, did he die in the Martian? Damn I don't even remember because I think I never finished that book, I couldn't even remember if I had finished it or not so boringly dry it was. Seriously it was ""Oh shit a Problem! It's Impossible to solve!"" <-> ""Oh wait I can solve it by XYZ"" Oh and the author of course wrote the character to be overly sarcastic and edgy with flat jokes every now and then so reddit dry-humped him and reading the passages of him hating on the stuff his crewmates brought with them just read like a teenager hating on hiphop because he loves some obscure underground metal.
    
**TL;DR: Books felt like ""50 Shades of Grey"" aimed and written specifically for a group of people, and despite being incredible bland and boring got praised to hell and back to heaven.** Never felt any connection to the characters in either of the books, I feel like a guy not understanding the appeal of ""50 shades of grey"" so many people seem to have. It felt like a Twillight for nerds, with really poorly written story and characters and that they only got popular because of the subject matter. Basically the same as 50 Shades of Grey.

2z2owd,I just finished an entire book for the first time in almost 6 years.,"I am currently in college and I think the last time I finished a book cover to cover was in 7th or 8th grade maybe even before that. Reading never interested me. Maybe it was the bland books I read in 9 years of catholic school or maybe it was just me not realizing there are other books out there (probably the latter) but I finally realized it. 

Even in high school I would just look up the spark notes for books like ""The Scarlet Letter"" because they just didn't interest me. The closest I came to reading a full book was ""1984"" last year for my senior year english class but I had skipped the first 50 or so pages because I just figured it would be like every other book. 

For about a year I have been really trying to improve myself in many ways, knowledge being one of them. I tried reading comic books but those just didn't have the level of text I was looking for and I would often forget what I read shortly after reading an issue. Finally I decided I really should read books for not only knowledge and reading ability but also for enjoyment. I have met many people who love reading why can't I be one of those people?

So I went out and picked up ""The Martian"" because I'm a huge fan of science and space and Commander Hadfield recommended this books so I took his word for it. Welp as of about 5 minutes ago I finished it and that was probably the most enjoyment I have EVER gotten out of a form of media. It took me a while (about a month between school work and my job) to finish it but I did it! 

I finally realize that reading is fun, I just have to find stuff that interests me. I just bought ""The Things They Carried"" because we read an excerpt of it in my college composition class and I loved it and I also have to read ""Angels in America"" for that class which I will also finish 100% because I already enjoy that one as well. Only took me 13 grades to have a class that picks good reading material but that's all behind me. I also have a huge and ever growing list on GoodReads of books I want to read. 

I figured I would post this as a thank you to this community as I have been visiting here often and to Andy Weir for writing my new favorite book.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2z2owd/i_just_finished_an_entire_book_for_the_first_time/,2015-03-15 00:29:14,321,1809,books
3c2lt7,For readers of Weir's The Martian - The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson,"So, I missed the thread earlier about books to read, but based off of all the love for The Martian, I have to speak for the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson. Anyone who reads the Martian and is sucked into the romanticism of the larger ideas about space exploration behind it should spend some time well spent with the Mars Trilogy. In the course of three novels, Robinson explores the possibility of ""terraforming"" Mars into a habitable planet. Over the course of the three novels, not only does the reader get some well researched and thought out scientific speculation about the obstacles involved with colonizing Mars, but Robinson also creates a highly involved cast of human characters and political theory that make the idea of moving off earth a truly engrossing experience.  

These are highly regarded and well known Sci-Fi novels (Hugo and Nebula awards), but for people who might not be very familiar with Sci-Fi that enjoyed the Martian, these books are a great read with a similar focus albeit a much larger scope. I'll also add that with the growing political significance of the relationship between environmental conservation and capitalism these books seem more relevant now than ever (written in the 90s). 

This is my first time posting to r/books, so I'm sorry if this breaks rules on recommendations. I know it belonged in the thread I missed earlier.  


TL;DR. If you like long reads and realistic space exploration read the Mars Trilogy",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3c2lt7/for_readers_of_weirs_the_martian_the_mars_trilogy/,2015-07-04 04:27:39,5,14,books

ye6y9v,Andy Serkis reading 'The Hobbit' is one of my fav audio book experiences,"Just finished rereading 'The Hobbit,' this time as an audio book on Audible read by Andy Serkis. 

His performance was one of the best audio book readings I've ever heard. His voices and accents for the characters are fun, energetic and memorable. He sings all the songs, and adds growls and sounds to add to every exciting scene. 

And yes, he does the Gollum voice from the movies during the Riddles in the Dark chapter.

h9cyc7,What books are still worth reading after watching the movie?,"I'm asking this question because of a very specific book, ""Me, Earl and the Dying Girl"". I just got done watching the movie and as a 34 year old dude I love it! And as a huge book fan finding out that it's a book now I want to read it more than ever! But will reading the book add more? Enough so to justify reading a book I basically already know the whole story?

I know most would argue ""always read the book, books are better"" but there is a few exceptions. Though the number isn't great there is some movies that are good enough to skip the book. In my personal and humble opinion if you watch ""the Martian"", ""Gone Girl"" and ""Gerald's Game"" you don't lose anything by not reading the book.

c0djx9,"Are there any readers of The Martian who went on to discover and read Andy Weir's prior webcomics afterwards? If so, what did you think of them?","For those who aren't aware, Andy Weir made a self-insert webcomic for years called *Casey & Andy* about the fictional adventures of his real-life circle of friends. It had a newspaper strip format, wacky humor, and terrible art all emblematic of early webcomics, and for a long time Weir boasted of being the laziest artist in webcomics, even going so far as to post a detailed visual guide showing how he completely avoided ever having to grow as an artist through extensive use of editing software to cut corners. However, it was considered quite funny by many and was well loved for its cultural niche and time period.

During this time Weir actually wrote his first novel, *Theft of Pride*, which he only published on the internet as far as I can tell.

After Casey & Andy ended Weir went on to do a fantasy webcomic project titled *Cheshire Crossing* about the further adventures of Dorothy Gale, Wendy Darling, and Alice Liddel. It's basically X-men for Victorian children's fantasy and I personally consider it very well written, but unfortunately the art was still extremely mediocre and the comic didn't get very much attention. Afterwards Weir disappeared from the internet for a few years to 'work on some new projects', and didn't reappear until he released *The Martian*... and you all know what happened after that.

3skrrp,Things the mods could do to improve this board.,"There was a shitpost criticizing this board, so hopefully I can provide a more constructive version of it and throw in some of my own ideas.


The mods don't do enough to consolidate threads. When someone makes a new post about The Martian or The Count of Monte Cristo a mod should step in, say ""use the search feature"" and nuke the thread unless its some update or a particularly insightful post. If your post was ""I just finished the Martian, I love the funny, science!, anyone heard of it?"" Your thread deserves to be deleted.


The AMA bot is incredibly annoying. We don't need both it and the sidebar. I rarely see any bot downvoted more.


Kindle vs. Physical debates need to gtfo. Unless you're reading House of Leaves it doesn't matter. Add in audiobooks too. Use whatever format you like. Its the same text. Nobody cares. There's a new thread every day and nothing new is ever discussed. Every possible permutation of that conversation has already occurred.


We should try to keep social activism out of here or at least consolidate the threads. We had far too many posts about the black girl that said not to read anything by a white dude for a year. If we want to discuss social issues lets do it within the context of a book and not make this a political forum. For example a Left Hand of Darkness thread is a pretty good spot for some gender debate.


What is/isn't literature needs to go too. Can we stop trying to make a caste system for books? Anything can have literary merit regardless of genre so long as it has some actual depth and openness to interpretation.


Last but not least lets all stop downvoting thoughtful posts simply because they disagree. People that do this are the worst part of this site and have no right to complain about hiveminds and circlejerks.

cakl97,BOBIVERSE TRILOGY - the most fun I had reading science fiction in a long time.,"I just finished the last book today and I'm hoping that the author, Dennis E. Taylor continues the series. 

I loved the unique concept and I loved Bob and all his iterations. He is an AI with humanity and you totally relate with him. The author does not make him brilliant or writes a lot of spacey jargon. Bob is funny, makes human mistakes, he's empathetic, vulnerable, even with almost unlimited power. 

The best part about the series is that it's breezy. There are almost three or four parallel stories but the book is not long like other space operas. I finished the third in 2 days and would have done it in one sitting if not for some odd chores.

1ak5j7g,Bit disappointed in the Lies of Locke Lamora,"(Big spoilers) I still liked the book and would reccomend it just overall the setup didnt have the best payoff in my opinion. I know this book series is beloved by so many and I had been wanting to read more fantasy that's based around thieves. The world building was absolutely stellar and the first half of the novel I adored. I loved how grounded the novel felt like Locke is the best at what he does because he is the most clever person in the room. The introduction of magic halfway through the novel and some very odd scenes really took me out of it. It just seemed counterintuitive to set up a character who's whole stic is being able to rouse his way out of situations take a magic potion for his disguise. I think it's indicative of the whole second half, in lockes childhood parts we see how he uses his wits to operate. Then the second half of the novel  locke wins with a swordfight. I know the whole point is for him to be put into a situation where his wits cant save him fully, but I still think the solution to that did not have to be magic.

s3vsck,Best books with the worst covers,"Don’t lie. You judge a book by its cover. I do, too. 
However, my sister and I have started picking books with the ugliest covers because we found that the inside has been full of gems. These overlooked books with great stories DOOMED! because of their awful cover design. 


The Martian movie cover is probably the best example I can think of. It’s not my favorite book — it’s passable, but people love it and it offered something fun for hard sci-fi fans. BUT THAT COVER IS SO BAD. I love Matt Damon, too! He’s a handsome man! But WHY.

2fi80l,"[Discussion] [Spoilers] The Martian by Andy Weir, directed by Ridley Scott ... will it lose it's humorous edge?","I really liked the book. And I think it would do well adapted as a movie with its catastrophe after catastrophe tense plot. Ridley Scott directing this is a bit conflicting for me because I'm so used to Aliens, Promotheus. And those are just full of a dark, sinister, humorless world. And I thought Mark, the main character of The Martian, was pretty calm and optimistic about all the crap that happened to him.

I thought I'd get a better discussion here ... than in movies. I think Matt Damon is supposed to be Mark Watney. And there's talks of Jessica Chastain and Kristen Wiig (who, for the love of me, I cant figure out who'd she be cast as!) also starring. 


One last thing! i think the martian was also self-published? Which is awesome for self publishing. And I thought Scott was also affiliated with Hugh Howey's Silo series. So, yay for self-publishing.

145kpn9,The War of the Worlds,"I’m almost done with the book and I love it! There is one thing that really bothers me though. 

Is the reader supposed to believe the narrator when he says he hit the curate with the butt of the meat chopper? 
I really don’t buy it. I have a lot of reasons as to why, and I’m happy to share, I would just like to know what others think of that detail.


Lots of spoilers ahead



The narrator had spent the days leading up to “the incident” threatening and beating the curate. His descriptions of the man drip with disgust. On top of that, they’ve been trapped in the ruins of a house together for 6+ days, they have limited food, and the narrator is worried the curate will eat what they have.

When the narrator catches the curate eating more of the food, he spends “all day and all night” guarding the food, “weary but resolute” while the curate weeps and begs for food. This goes on for *two days*.

I’m trying to keep this short but I also have been thinking about this a lot, sorry.

Ultimately the curate realizes he has power over the narrator if he raises his voice, as the narrator doesn’t want the martians nearby to hear them. The curate runs towards the martians. The narrator grabs a nearby meat chopper and runs after him. “With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt” (133).


Basically, given the circumstances and a handful of lines from the book, I don’t believe that last part. I choose to give the narrator the benefit of the doubt on his descriptions of the curate (regardless of how harsh they may be) and on the events leading up to the blow, but I can’t get past this detail. 

I would be more than happy to elaborate on any of these points if asked and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this!

Edit because I wasn’t clear, my bad: I do believe that the narrator hit the curate, I just don’t think he actually used the butt of the meat chopper. I don’t normally mistrust the narrator of the books I read but in this case I got the very strong sense that he was trying to convince the reader (and maybe himself) that he only knocked the curate out as opposed to delivering the killing blow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/145kpn9/the_war_of_the_worlds/,2023-06-09 23:47:21,8,12,books
18evmgc,Why does fantasy have a stigma associated with prose attached to the genre?,"I see plenty of talk about prose when it comes to the fantasy genre. Some of the best fantasy writers have a very flowery, poetic like prose to their books. It's to a point where some very good authors are being called bad because their prose isn't done as well.

Why do other genre's not have this same stigma? When was the last time anyone talked about the prose of a mystery novel or thriller? I understand why prose makes a book better. It elevates the text, it shows how good a writer can be. It just doesn't seem to matter with most genres though from what I can tell.

10u6kov,What's the fastest you knew you were gonna really a book?,"Just started reading Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir and I'm 15 pages in an I know I'm gonna really enjoy this book. I was hesitant about my expectations only because recently I have a whole sub tell me I'd enjoy a book only for it to be my least favorite book probably ever but I was optimistic because I had already read The Martian also by Andy Weir and I loved it! I mean with an opening line like ""I'm pretty much fucked. That's my considered opinion. Fucked."" how could you not love  that book. 

This book doesn't start with a line like that but it's Funny, this was something I wasn't expecting for it to be this funny I've already laughed 3 times in the first 15 pages ""aaand they're dead"". It's smart, I'm a sucker for smart books and it has a bit of mystery I want to know what's never. I've never been so sure if like a book so fast as this one with only 15 pages.

ruc238,Great books - but the film was even better,"In 99.x% of all cases, the film adaptation of a book is not up to the quality of the book itself. However, I recently came across two cases where I liked the film  better than the book:  

1. The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco

2. Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon

In the first case, I found the expansive inner monologues of one of the main characters very tiring to read. In the film, these were omitted without any consequent loss of plot.  

In the second, I thought the cast - with the exception of Katie Holmes - and the chemistry, especially between the characters played by Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr. and Tobey Maguire was just delightful. The book, in my opinion, did not bring across the humor and levity shown in the film to the same degree.

v79yha,Project Hail Mary - how the flip will they handle the movie adaptation??? (Spoilers),"Mostly... How the f will they address Rocky, Rocky's language/sensory stuff, and Rocky's separate environmental living conditions?

Rocky is so core to the story...  But how does he translate to film?  Do they make him humanoid? (I hope not).  Perhaps they leave him in some interesting creature form, but scrap the environmental concerns. 

Weir is able to explain away a lot of elements that may be difficult to represent on film imo. 

Do we just get subtitles for Rocky, and assume Grace understands fluently? I feel like that is easier to swallow in print.  

Not rooting against the movie, which apparently casts baby goose Ryan Gosling... But I don't envy the folks trying to adapt this.

The cynic in me suspects they will gut it, keep a basic ""saving the earth"" story, and just advertise it as ""from the creature of The Martian"".

We'll see.
