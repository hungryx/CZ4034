186br1d,The Three Musketeers are assholes,"I've loved the Musketeers ever since I first saw the 1973 movie but haven't gotten around to reading the actual novel until now. I even managed to read The Man in the Iron Mask first, which should have tipped me off more about what to expect. But seeing how that book is described as a darker turn, I was still surprised about how the main characters act in the book.

Namely, they're a bunch of douchebags.

They get into duels (which is illegal) and then have to fight the guards (who are trying to arrest them for doing something illegal) and maim and kill people without any sort of consequences. At one point Athos gets goaded into telling a dude his true name before a duel, only to tell him that now he has to die and goes about killing him. Porthos is leeching off a married woman, Athos became a Musketeer after doing the French equivalent of an honor-killing and they all mistreat their servants. Athos beats his if he speaks to him and they all recommend that Dartagan does the same. They financially take advantage of anyone they can, cause havoc everywhere they go and kill a lot of people super casually.

That being said, I do love them for it.

My friend and I used to describe them in the movie as ""Varsity Stars who can get away with everything"" but I had chalked a lot of that up to being characters in a Richard Lester movie, not the original novel. It was fun to read about them holding wine cellars hostage, putting in no effort to avoid violence and not realizing that rent was something they had to pay until their landlord informed them. They're not great people, but they're great to read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/186br1d/the_three_musketeers_are_assholes/,2023-11-29 00:30:11,82,488,books
qf651e,The Three Musketeers is really great,"I'm about 200 pages in, and enjoying the straightforward, concise writing.

16x4ln8,The Three Musketeers - Sympathy for the Cardinal,"I'm rereading The Three Musketeers and have got to the part where they're breakfasting on the battlefield, and D'Artagnan is lamenting the enemies ranged against him - the man he picked a fight with over a joke at a tavern, the man he attacked and robbed on the way to London, the woman de tricked into sex by pretending to be someone else, and the powerful politician whose schemes he's interfered with, not out of any loyalty to the king, but because he's trying to get into the pants of his landlord's wife. 

These are all his enemies very much as the consequence of his own actions, and the other three musketeers don't seem to make significantly better decisions, frequently coming across as violent, lying, philanderers with gambling problems.

The Cardinal in contrast, seems less outrightly villainous than he's often portrayed, a shrewd but aging minister who's trying to steer France, which is in a precarious position with enemies on all sides, to a secure position, hampered by rival political factions, a fickle, childish king, and a queen who is both related to many of the enemies, and is having an affair with the prime minister of the country they're nearly at war with.

Maybe I'm just older and more cynical than when I first read it, but I remember the good and bad guys seemed much more clear cut then.

124mu9e,Question about the Three Musketeers and Lady de Winter...,"So I watched all kinds of movie adaptations and now I've read the books and I was a bit confused about the past of Athos and Lady de Winter.   


So she was marked as a thief, but as she was escaping, she fell in love with Athos and they were together for a while. During a time when the pair was riding in a forest, the girl fell off her horse, and Athos, to help her breath, cut her clothes. At that moment he realized that her lover was a thief, and he... ripped of her clothes and hanged her on a tree?   


I mean, why was he that cruel and why would he do that? At least he could confront her about her past, maybe take her to a trial, but literally stripping her and hang her? Was she even awake? Did she struggle? Because I doubt that it was a formal normal execution. After all these, and after somehow surviving this event, I'm not surprised that Lady de Winter turned out to be a partner of the bad guys. What do you think? How did you see this?

xcnket,Do you think that the three musketeers is underrated?,"Months ago i've read this book called ""*the three musketeers*"" by ""A*lexandre Dumas*"". What dragged me to read that book is a memory from my childhood where a cartoon made a parody of this book in one episode (maybe it was Tom and Jerry, i don't remember). at first i saw it had lots of pages, but i still read it anyways. and i gotta say it's really a masterpiece. I really loved the protagonists (D'artagnan,Porthos,Aramis,Athos) and the strong personality of D'artagnan, the fourth musketeer.Im not gonna talk too much about the end of the story because, obviously, i want other people to enjoy it. Alexandre Dumas, as some of their fan has said, is really good at writing and explaining scenarios and whatsoever.But the main problem that i wanna talk about is that i see that not many people talk about it as the same levels of most famous classics ever. I would be interested to read your opinion of this masterpiece. Any thoughts?

vqcnat,The three musketeers is better than The count of Monte cristo,"I read the three musketeers when i was like 17 and i became obsessed with it. I started with the bridged version and later got the unbridged version. i reread that book atleast like 10 times. 

im now 24 and i started another Alexander Dumas book The count of monte cristo after hearing so much about it. And..im so disappointed. I thought it would be about political intrigue like TTM. It was not bad but it didnt live up to my expectation. The revenge was so vanilla and predictable and not satisfactory. i only loved the first part before he got out of prison because afterwards it was boring and  unintruiging.

pppd0h,The three musketeers and the non-idealization of the characters,"&#x200B;

I love the three Musketeers and I liked that Alexandre Dumas avoided the idealization of the characters. In romanticism there was the pure and good heroe.

I liked that Dumas prevented us from having a pure hero and no moral defects. If you go to the History books, we'll see abuse and cruelty.e And Alexandre Dumas didn't run away from it to create idealized heroes.

In 1572 we had the massacre on The St. Bartholomew's Day, when the group of assassinations and the wave of Catholic mob violence directed against the Huguenots.

Musketeers lived in a violent society. Did they expect them to behave differently?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pppd0h/the_three_musketeers_and_the_nonidealization_of/,2021-09-17 00:13:43,15,111,books

o6nz5b,The D'Artagnan Romances/ The Three Musketeers,"If you're interested in Europe's early modern period (17th century)  an interesting series might be the D'artagnan romances, which begins with The Three Musketeers. It's fairly extensive with all the books (5) being around 600 pages, but the first two books individually feel complete, so you are able to stop if you don't want to read further; the last 3 books however are all related, but if you continue reading that far it means you like the books. They cover various genres including action, romance, drama, and comedy, but the comedy is very subtle/not excessive—still, they are funny books after you become accustomed to the humor.

&#x200B;

The Three Musketeers' beginning was somewhat boring (it takes a minute to get used to the humor/writing style), but after the first few chapters I enjoyed the book completely; the second book in the series, 20 years after, emulates the aspects I loved about the first book and the characters were more developed; I just finished the Vicomte de Bragelonne and have maintained the same sentiments, but now the storyline, naturally, is becoming much more developed through the addition of many new/aged characters. (keep in mind the series covers around 30ish years with each story covering around 1 year within that timespan)(also keep in mind that it is written, or translated rather, into 1800s english).

u1ivu8,(spoiler) Milady de winter - the real heroine in The Three Musketeers,"I always saw Milday as a good character in the three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. She is actually doing her job as a loyal agent of her country, while the musketeers are traitors. Her trial is a sham. Why? She goes on different missions serving her country, the most important being at the end: the assassination of the enemy commander Buckingham, because of her action her country wins the siege of La Rochelle and enemy reinforcements no longer arrive. Meanwhile the musketeers plot with the queen and that same Buckingham. That is aiding and abetting the enemy. In one scene in the books, a letter is found from the queen to the Spanish king asking him to invade France. The French queen is asking a foreign leader to invade France... If that's not treason, I don't know what is! Even by the standards of that period.

cjteyo,The Count of Monte Cristo Vs. The Three Musketeers,"I'm currently reading The Three Musketeers. I'm about 150 pages in, and while I like it, it's not quite what I expected. The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books I've ever read. It's definitely top 10, if not in the top 3 of favorite books. It's also probably been almost 10 years since I read it, so maybe I am just remembering with rose colored glasses. 

I feel like the Count of Monte Cristo is just a fun story about a dude who wants to ruin the lives of three other guys because they framed him and he spent like 15 years in prison being tortured. Not that you don't need any historical context to appreciate the novel, but almost all of the relevant details are in the novel. 

The Three Musketeers has been good, but I almost feel like I am reading two books: The Three Musketeers, and Wikipedia's History of France. And then I feel like all the names are just blending together. Where Edmond Dantes was immediately likable and I was routing for him the entire time, d'Artagnan seems kinda like a dick. Dantes was justified in seeking revenge, and d'Artagnan was basically like, ""you looked at my horse funny. I guess I need to murder you."" And I don't remember Dumas writing women so poorly in The Count of Monte Cristo. 

I'm not sure what I am even asking. I guess I'm just surprised at how different these two novels are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cjteyo/the_count_of_monte_cristo_vs_the_three_musketeers/,2019-07-30 15:34:14,22,18,books

Something that always stuck with me about the Three Musketeers series was the characters view of patriotism, mainly in how they conducted themselves as the kings men.  The King himself didn't seem to matter, and was often even ridiculed by his men, but they protected the seat of power, and the integrity of France with their lives.

I feel like if more people chose to think like that when electing their officials, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l6oj99/a_thought_about_the_three_musketeers/,2021-01-28 05:01:08,3,9,books

sp4ylb,Do you think Milady de Winter from The Three Musketeers is a Complete Monster?," 

So, for those of you who don\`t know there is a trope created by TV Tropes called Complete Monster (also known as Pure Evil). They are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. There are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:

1. The character has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he/she could still become a Complete Monster if he/she loses them. Even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.
2. The character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. We also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. This means that if a character has more resources (if for example he/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. If a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he/she is a lone serial killer), then he/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. If a character\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster. The character\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a Complete Monster:

\- The baseline standard - This is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. This means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is REALLY extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).

\- The standards of the work - This means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his/her actions are bad enough to make him/her stand out. This means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like My Little Pony needs to be compared to other villains from My Little Pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as Warhammer 40000, A Song of Ice and Fire and Berserk. Similarly, a villain who comes from a work with high heinous standard should  be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not to villains that come from My Little Pony.

\- The resource standard - This means that we should also take into consideration the villain\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as I already mentioned.

\- The system standard - This means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the Galactic Empire for example)

3) The character\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he/she has either no excuse for his/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. Even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his/her personality, it doesn\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\`t try to make you feel sorry for them. In short, this means that the audience is not supposed to feel ANY SYMPATHY for the character.

4) The character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. This means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed, made of evil or from a race or culture that can\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\`t qualify. However, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the Joker).

5) The character is portrayed seriously and is not a Comic Relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). Even if the character is funny he/she can still be a Complete Monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. If the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\`s shows), then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

6) The character must make AT LEAST ONE APPEARANCE in the story itself. Characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearance can\`t qualify. Aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen/off-page and are only vaguely described, then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

7) The audience is not supposed to feel bad for a Complete Monsterr when something bad happens to him/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the Complete Monster.

8) The character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than ""bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason"" type of plot. A horror film or book can still contain a Complete Monster but it needs to have some plot. For this reasons films like Human Centipede and Serbian Film don\`t contain Complete Monsters because they are viewed by TvTropes as plotless exploitation even though the villains are extremely repulsive.

9) A character must meet ALL of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a Complete Monster.

Milady is listed as a Complete Monster but I have seen some fans who think she is sympathetic to an extent (even though I don't really agree).

So, what do you think about this? Do you think that Milady is a Complete Monster or not? If not, why (preferbly give specific examples from the book)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sp4ylb/do_you_think_milady_de_winter_from_the_three/,2022-02-10 11:58:04,7,2,books

I definitely consider this to be one of my new favorite books. I'm planning on reading the sequels now and The Count of Monte Cristo because I've heard that is good as well. 

I am wondering, though, if the sequels hold up to the original. I plan on reading them regardless of what is said on here but I am curious to see what the general opinion of them is.

5zcsnp,"Reading The Three Musketeers, and need some inspiration!","Hi there everyone! So I'm currently working my way through Dumas' the Three Musketeers, translated by Lord Sudley. I'm on page 260, Chapter 20. At this point I find myself turning the pages readily enough, but there are so many points where I find myself reflecting on how the story really doesn't have much depth or interest to me. Things happen -- people fight, people die, people fall in love -- and we as readers are just taken to accept them. There seems to be no real effect; it's just the reciting of plot. In short, I find it to have a lack of depth. Do you think I'm missing something, or is this just the way this kind of adventure story works?

I have a natural aversion to not finishing a book, but I've got 500 pages to go, which is quite a commitment.

My favorite two characters were Abbe Faria and Edmond(or rather the count to monte cristo after the the time skip). Which is because of my tendency to like and respect polymaths. Also the suave demeanour of the Count and the wisdom and kindness of the Abbe are quite something. 

But by far the best parts were the revenge... Oh the revenge. That was quite something.

1. Fernand Mondego, or the Comte de Morcef. Fantastic, I loved the whole thing that happened to this dude, good for Haidee, good for Edmond. Little sad for Mercedes.

2. Baron Danglars, oh how I hated that guy. He got what he deserved, fantastic. FANTASTIC.

3. Monsieur de Villfort. Now this guys thing was quite tragic, I felt bad for him. And even more for Valentine and Monsieur Noirtier. In my opinion, this dude was the least guilty of the three although still guilty but got delt the worst hand out of the three, even if it wasn't by Monte Cristo but by Providence as the author always like to say.

This was such a fantastic read and my first french classic.

D'Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile, M. de Treville judged that he had not to deal with a fool ...""

I don't get what signals something clever to d'Artagnan here. Is it a pun about what orders are or the double meaning of 'executing' something? Is it a mild sarcasm about his devotion to the cardinal right after it became obvious that there is no great honor for the cardinal among the Musketeers?

Anyway, the Cardinal (who's a real historical person by the way) is portrayed to be the bad guy of the story while the Musketeers and D'Arthanian are the heroes of the story. 

The Musketeers are shown to be a bunch of thugs and scoundrels. They constantly go around provoking and killing the Cardinal's guards (who, as I understand, have the authority) and annoy him for some reason. 

The Cardinal however, is actually doing his job of serving the king by giving him advice and trying to expose the queen for cheating. 

Madame Bonacieux calls her husband an imbecile for working for the cardinal even though the latter was completely reasonable and generous in his actions towards him. 

In short, the Cardinal seems to be the least incompetent and selfish character in this novel and yet he's the bad guy.

First my honorable mentions: 

Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton (my pick for best non-fiction book)

Exercises in Style by Raymond Queneau

The Dream of the Red Chamber / The Story of the Stone by Cao Xueqin

A Chinese novel, often regarded as the greatest Chinese literary work. There have been numerous inadequate translations, but luckily the Penguin edition (David Hawkes/John Minford) is very good. 

This book is simply excellent. It focuses on a tragic love story along with a philosophical meditation. The one aspect that might put people off is the length, the book is 2500 pages.

12mn5q7,Favourite translation of The Count of Monte Cristo?,"Pevear and Volokhonsky did a remarkable job translating The Three Musketeers, but unfortunately have not translated The Count of Monte Cristo.

I have examined what I could find of excerpts that are available online and settled on the ""Standard Abridged Version,""  the one available in the Banes and Noble Leatherbound Classic Edition.  I actually own the Penguin Classics version by Robin Buss and prefer the former.  Buss modernizes the language too much to appeal to readers that used to reading more contemporary books.  The B & N version uses language that seems to be more true to the period.  

&#x200B;

HERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF B & N version: 

""Oh"", said Morrel, carried away by his friendship.  ""You do not know him and I do.  He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in all the world, and I will venture to say that there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service.  Oh, Monsieur. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him.""

Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied ""You are aware Monsier that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in his private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal.  Is it not true?""

&#x200B;

HERE IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE PENGUIN CLASSICS VERSION ""BUSS""

""My good sir,"" carried away by his friendship for the young man.  ""You do not know the person who is being accused; but I know him.  He is the mildest, most honest man you could imagine, I might almost say the man who knows his job best of any in the merchant marine.  Monsieur de Villlefort, I commend him to you most sincerely and with all my heart.""

Villlefort look contemptuously at Morrel and answered coldly: ""You know Monsieur, that one can be mild in one's private life, honest in one's business dealings, and skilled in one's work, yet at the same time, politically speaking, be guilty of great crimes. You do know that, I suppose Monsieur? 

&#x200B;

Now these are obviously very small samples, and I'm sure there are much better examples that illustrate the point I am trying to put forth. But yes, I much prefer the language of the anonymous standard abridged version.  Granted it may leave out small amounts of text, but I can live with that.  I was hoping that others who have read or looked at more than one version can weigh in as well. Maybe I'm weird, but when I read a translated novel, I will often have several translations by my side and then look at different ones if I find a part that is important or that I just like.

15egvqv,My thoughts on The Count of Monte Cristo,"Did I like this book? Absolutely, it is an incredible novel. Did I love it? No.

Maybe I started reading this with very high expectations because every single review that I read heralded this book as the best ever written and I was expecting something extraordinary, but I got something that was just good. There’s nothing wrong with that but I just don’t  feel that highly about this book.

I don’t like abridged editions. And I’m going say that a book like this doesn’t deserve to be abridged. But a good revision would have been a good idea. This book could have been 200 pages shorter and I think it wouldn’t have hurt the story in any way. I’m not saying Dumas should have gotten rid of any of the scenes, it’s just that some dialogue and some descriptions and some events could have been shorter. There is a lot of repetition going on and sometimes it is just annoying and it ads nothing to the story. I really, really liked the first and the last 200 pages of this. The middle 800… well, those could have been better.

Edmond Dantes was a great character. Really liked him and I was constantly rooting for him and wishing that he would get out of jail and get  back the life that he deserved. But then he turned into The Count. I have never disliked a protagonist more than this guy. A literal Mary Sue, this guy has no weaknesses ( and no Mercedes doesn’t count). He knows nearly everything, is a master fighter, very rich, very beautiful, can make stuff happen with just a snap of his fingers, is an agent of Providence, has The AlMiGhTy GoD behind him and is also the most pretentious character I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. This guy nearly single handedly made this book a chore to read. Only near the end when he starts showing some degree of emotion does he become kinda interesting. And also what was that with Haydee! One moment he thought of her as his daughter and then the next he was lusting after her. Guess Mercedes Benz had  had one too many rides for our dear old Count.

Concerning the villains, only Villefort was the one worth reading about. I personally would have loved a book about him and his family life. He had a life, passions, downfall and feelings; in short he is the only 3d villain in the story. Danglars and Fernand, while they have their reasons, considering Dumas didn’t spent as much time with them, appear to be a bit more cartoonish.

Albert for me is the best character in this novel and the only reason why I kept reading. Because, like Villefort, this guy also is more developed and feels more like a real person. I liked his hotheadedness, his strength and humility and his ability to apologise. He and his mother deserved better.

Anyway, these are my general thoughts about this book. Despite the fact that I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I would have liked, I’m quite excited about reading more Dumas, starting with The Three Musketeers.

59e6wc,When did Tolstoy's War and Peace get the reputation for being *the* long novel?,"I've heard all my life about how long War and Peace is, and what an accomplishment it is to get through it. Don't get me wrong--it's a hefty bit of binding. But it came out when doorstop-sized novels were not all that unusual. War and Peace was published in 1869, and Les Miserables, another huge novel, came out in 1862, just a few years earlier. Dumas made a career out of monumental works in the 1840s and 1850s, with works like the Count of Monte Cristo (1844), The Vicomte of Bragelonne (1850) and The Mohicans of Paris (1854), which appeared in 4, 4 and 6 volumes, respectively. Using the Project Gutenberg editions of these works, I got the following word counts: 



Books|Words
---|---
The Count of Monte Cristo| 465,389
Les Misérables| 512,887
The Vicomte of Bragelonne| 642,440
The Mohicans of Paris| 795,402

The French translation of War and Peace available on Project Gutenberg only has 467,310 words, which would make it comparable to the smallest of these works (Monte Cristo). And yet War and Peace has the reputation for the longest work! And that doesn't include more modern works Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. 

Has anyone run across a history of this phenomenon?

now the first thing I must say that I enjoyed the book, I loved the characters, the setting, the atmosphere but was let down by the climax. The book has a lot of these meta commentaries about the book itself and other authors in that genre. Like yeah, we do a bunch of cliches but we're self-aware of it, but it's still a cliche though. like the supposed villain explaining everything, he was doing behind the curtain towards the end and then blames the reader for connecting two apparently unrelated plots. 

Like the hole anjou, wine/dumas club storyline was just a Sherlock Holmes or Scooby-Doo level plot that was too anticlimactic in my opinion, and the whole devil mystery was just there to throw us off. There was nothing paranormal about it, it all can be explained rationally. like we thought because some characters from the three musketeers were making an appearance throughout the story so you start to believe that the devil stuff is real as well, but since we learn that it was all orchestrated by Dumas fan club to get a thrill. So is the whole satan thing, It basically some crazy guy that thought he can summon the devil but he fails, and plus we didn't get any foreshadowing for it throughout the story, except maybe that he was acting antagonistically towards the main character at the beginning of the book. 

I think it's GRRM who said it, ""If you answer a mystery, you answer it by adding more mystery in its place. "" (or something like that,) and there was none of that in this book. Yeah, we don't know for sure what exactly happened to the guy after he did his ritual, or where the girl with the green eyes come from, but it all doesn't really matter by the end. So overall I must say it was a bit of a letdown, but to end on a positive note I will say that the research that went to write this book was impressive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kgbijg/just_finish_the_club_dumas_by_arturo_perezreverte/,2020-12-19 17:03:32,14,11,books
28ik63,Books that drive you to research or inspire learning? Reading the Baroque Cycle.,"I really enjoy reading well researched historical books, fiction or non-fiction.  I am very fond of Stephenson's work, I've read Reamde, Anathem , and Cryptonomicon already.  My favorite parts of the Cryptonomicon were historical portions about World War II.  As I read I find things that seem unbelievable I look them up and find many are largely based on fact. 

Other books that had me Googling various topics of history, art, language, and math, include The Count of Monte, The Three Musketeers, Ron Chernow's Washington a Life and Alexander Hamilton.  I even found myself reading letters and journals written by soldiers in World War I after I finished the Guns of August. 

Right now the first book of the Baroque Cycle has me looking up something new every night.  Not to mention browsing for a good biography of Isaac Newton.

4br28b,"Just finished the Count of Monte Cristo, again. What an awesome book. [Spoilers]","This is in contention for my all-time favorite book, battling it out with Dune or LOTR for the top slot. This is probably the fourth time I've read it, and I feel like I enjoyed it all the more for reading through it again.

It's hard for me to describe how great of a story this is. The reader is pulled down this path with Edmund Dantes, and Dumas' writing makes me feel his pain and sorrow, his growing rage. When he becomes empowered to enact his revenge, I feel the same cold satisfaction as he begins to slowly subvert and destroy his betrayers. But at the same time, a slowly growing sense of horror begins to permeate underneath of the satisfaction.

As you watch him destroy Cadarousse with a single gift, as he watches coldly while the knowledge he passed on to Madame Villefort so many years ago begins to take root and claim the lives of her family. You especially see this when Maximilien comes to beg the Count for aid in rescuing Valentine from her poisoner, when he coldly admits that he is aware and couldn't care less what the Villeforts do as they tear themselves to pieces.

His cold admission to Maximilien really made it sink home with me that maybe Edmund was going TOO far. When Monsieur De Villefort coldly orders his wife to kill herself... when he sees the body of his son... I can't even describe it. I must have blotted that part of the book out in my memory, because it was frankly traumatic. I experienced the same trauma as Edmund, seeing his ""God-granted"" vengeance go so horribly wrong.

The ending is also amazing, as Edmund finally gets a chance to be happy. Perhaps he'll be able to forget and forgive himself for the terrible things that he did to his betrayers, but the most important thing is that he has an opportunity to do so. 

I think that the length of the book may keep some people from reading it, but I really think that it's necessary. I lived with these characters for hundreds of pages, so when ""misfortune"" struck them, I knew exactly what that means to them. I felt it on a visceral level. I still feel it.

I've seen people recommend Dumas' Three Musketeers as a decent followup to the Count of Monte Cristo, so I may give it a shot, now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4br28b/just_finished_the_count_of_monte_cristo_again/,2016-03-24 10:40:28,16,19,books
8n4yjy,"Just finished ""The Club Dumas"" *Some Spoilers*","Fictions about books are an intriguing subject for authors to approach and readers to reflect upon. I love books as most of us on the books subreddit do and I really enjoyed this book. Without giving away too many spoilers, the book is really well-written with an intriguing plot that gives the reader plenty of classic ""whodunnit"" mystery with a bit of a Gothic spin. Lucas Corso, the novel's gritty book detective and protagonist, is a classic gin-swilling, womanizing, bad-boy detective whose only regret in life is letting the one woman who could possibly love him get away. Cue ""Irene Adler"", the clever, sexy young woman who is both gal friday and femme fatale to the hapless Corso. She is indeed, referred to as ""Irene Adler"" throughout the novel as when Corso first meets her, she is reading a Sherlock Holmes novel. 

The danger of writing a book like this is that the references and allusions can feel shallow and ham-handed. I felt that ""The Club Dumas"" dances on this line a bit. Obviously, the book will appeal to fans of Alexandre Dumas. ""The Three Musketeers"" and its author are not merely alluded to but are central to Corso's investigations. The other references work more hand-in-hand with the diabolic side of the novel. I'm studying Gothic literature for my graduate degree and nearly came to tears of joy when I saw one of the main characters reading ""Melmoth the Wanderer"", but I was at first remiss to find a reason for this shout-out to such a classic of Irish Gothic Fiction. It is an Irish version of classic Faust tale with elements of the wandering jew mythos. Deals with the devil play a pivotal role throughout the novel, so it makes sense on a surface level as to why Arturo Pérez-Reverte would mention this novel. Also, the Gothic is concerned with binaries and the confusion of roles and tropes and if we are considering this when we see which character Arturo Pérez-Reverte chooses to put ""Melmoth"" in the hands of it makes sense. ""Irene Adler"" of ""The Club Dumas"" functions as both Watson and Adler to Corso's Holmes. It's a stretch though and unless you've read a lot of obscure Gothic Lit, it's hard to understand the allusion he's making. I am, also, confused by the 223B address, isn't Holmes's address 221B? If anyone who has read this book help me out with why Pérez-Reverte gives us 223B instead of 221B?

To me, the book works because Corso is aware that he is in a novel. The dynamic nature of the events and multiple coincidences drive Corso to the conclusion that he must be in some odd fiction and obediently concedes to the rules of the novel of which he is a part. I'll avoid some spoilers here, but let it be known, the delusion is (somewhat) broken by the end. If he is in fact in a novel, though, is it a delusion?

This is a book for book-lovers. People who don't just love to read but love books. Their form, history, and politics. Questions of authorship, quality, canon, manufacturing, and most importantly the power of books. Through his fiction Pérez-Reverte shows us, in more ways than one, how books shape our history and how we shape theirs.

1bsv0r,The Black Evolution,"*The Black Evolution*
*How Evolution could serve the darker races better than Christianity/Religion*
_Original writings: Gugu James Fuyana_

Evolution’s message has been hijacked by racists, casting it as purporting to the inferiority of the darker races. This is analogous to the devil using scripture to preach his message. Religion has been used to profess the equality of the races before god but has always been a tool for those what would oppress in god’s name. More damaging is the fact that, inherent in any religion are subtle representations that our evolved unconsciously influenced mental algorithms would deduce as pronouncing racial inequality. Through the Origin of the Species penned by Charles Robert Darwin in 1859 and in many other great works since, it has become sufficiently clear that all organisms were descendants of a single common unicellular ancestor. The not so subtle fundamental about evolution is that all human beings are multicellular biological organisms, animals, mammals, primate apes to be exact. ALL. Without any regard to skin color we are all animals that struggle to survive and reproduce. Through DNA we are all provided with statistically similar build-a-human-kit. We all are phenotypic projections for our genotype, carrying the replicative information that’s passed on to our offspring from one generation to the next. I argue that racism is a tool for reproductive success used to tip the scales in sexual selection. In fact anything that human beings, along with every other species, do that manifests itself as a widespread phenomenon or more specifically a common behavior trait has to have a reproductive benefit. The end game in all organisms is survival towards reproduction. Some have always said that everything we do, we do to the glory of god. I say that everything we do, we do to the maximization of our reproductive success. Racism is not the end in itself but is a procedural and statistical tool that humans incorporate in the everyday arsenal to further the propagation of their genes. 

So we are all equal under Evolution. So why has the message been hijacked by racists elements for so long. Chants of monkey, baboon, chimps and banana jokes. The subtle or at times overt implication has been that only the dark skinned peoples bear a relationship with lower primates. The truth is that all humans are not only descended from primates, we are primates. The fundamental Judeo-Christian view has been that god created man in his present form replete with all the racial differences. One has to wonder why god would create different races all in his “same image”. This specialness of the human species has been hijacked by racists into the specialness of some races and tribes. Evolution on the other hand says all human races evolved over millions of years from one common ancestor with all the primates- chimps, gorillas, monkeys and orangutans. Evolutionary biology has shown that the genetic differences in the races is <0.1%. The differences in the races has largely been due to the different environments that human races experienced after the great migration from Africa within the last 100000 years and this separation did result in genetic pooling of different phenotypes. 

This according to Jared Diamond in his book Guns, germs and steel resulted in some communities slowly developing farming earlier spurring their development into larger organized societies. The present apparently skewed development of the different continents is a geographical legacy and not an intelligence disparity legacy. Read this book. 
Accepting that we are all evolved creatures and products of natural and sexual selection has the following racial implications,
1)	We all unconsciously aim to survive to at least reproductive age and beyond for good measure or more specifically to increase our resultant offspring’s reproductive success. We consciously aim to live a long happy life. What ultimately drive organisms are the unconscious aims but they usually tie up nicely with conscious motivations. 
2)	On reaching this stage/age we all have evolved the ability to fulfill this reproductive duty: unless of course, you have mechanical issues). Every human being and really every organism without serious developmental issues has mating intelligence. This means that you have within your mental capacity the evolved ability to achieve the ultimate goal of your life. That goal as stated above is to survive and reproduce. Butterflies, cats, dogs, bats, crocodiles, cockroaches and humans all have this innate ability to grow and seek out mates. Your only impediment is death or competition from others in your species.
3)	We are all in competition with others to fulfill this reproductive duty. Most evolutionary psychologists teach that there is a separate inter sexual competition. I believe we are all in competition. 
4)	Our lives as complicated and long storied (work, school, baseball, football, business meetings, political campaigns, church…..) as they are just the lifecycle towards reproduction.
5)	 Anything we do is towards maximizing our reproductive success. This is unconscious in origin and does sometimes emerge to consciousness. The reason it is all unconscious is because you have to appreciate that an organisms that has so much vested in reproduction would give as much unconscious credence to reproductive psychological mechanisms as to the beating of the heart and the pump of the lungs.
6)	All five points above combine to say that in racial relations we will use racism to unconsciously further our reproductive success and denigrate/cooperate with other races in a bid to eliminate competition.
7)	Women do select for high value males so as to increase the survival and reproductive success of their offspring. So males will use racism to increase their apparent value. Females will use racism to denigrate the physical attractiveness of the other races. What racism does is to eliminate the competition and monopolize the mating pool.
8)	We are descendants of individuals whose success in mating was predicated on what Robert L Trivers once argued as the unconscious deception. Human beings have to stay ahead of the competition within our species and deception was very critical. If you could deceive the next person on your true motives and movements you reaped survival and reproductive benefits. Even more effective than this would be the ability to unconsciously deceive myself. That’s why the most effective racism is unconscious and subtle. Most racism has very reasonable objective explanations to shield its true nature. Most racism is not verbally communicated but is transmitted by body language, coughs, laughs, sneezes. There is a great deal of unconscious complicity in racism which is how in most situations workplace and high school cafeterias end segregated. One has to appreciate that we evolved from organisms that could not talk to communicate but used a variety of other communication means. These other communication means have settled to the back-burner after we evolved language but are still operating mostly unconsciously. It is easy for someone to toe the line in his verbal communication appearing to be using non-prejudicial language when the rest of his evolved communication is unconsciously communicating racial undertones. The proof of this is in the pudding. Another critical point about language is that it is not what it appears to be to almost all humans alive today. Language is a complicated coded system of communication. The words that you use rarely every serve one purpose in your daily here-and-now situation. Reading Dr Haskell book, Unconscious meaning in everyday language will open you up to the mysterious world of loaded language. Language is a deceptive tool. We say more that we could ever imagine in our daily talk. What appears innocent is rarely that. A cigar is never just a cigar Mr. Freud. This is why you will notice that when there is a majority white group of people with maybe one or two black person in a group these words will always be said; chocolate, dark, night, color, black, coffee, I can’t see, snickers, stickers, lazy, shit, bullshit, crap, back, running back, basketball, welfare, south, crave, right, nine, pickers, pick, help…… I know you might say hey these are common words, everybody uses them. True. Thin is I can predict that in any groping of people in room with majority white and some black individuals, you will hear the word shit a controlled 20 minute span. Take random groups of ten people place 10 whites only in a group and another homogenous black group of ten. Then make other random groups of mixed races. Interesting stuff will happen. What may seem as ordinary language will have unconscious meanings related to hear and now racial mix. Lets say you have 7 white and three blacks. One person in the group might just suddenly tell a Snow-white and the 7 dwarf’s story or a three musketeer’s story. The stories will use specific numbers to convey this message. Usually the natural group leaders are the ones that effectively transmit this message. This is all unconscious. This is critical from the standpoint that on the surface you might have a relatively happy racial mix but subtle messages are being transmitted. That’s why its important to realize that racism is not a thought or a free will choice but a deeply ingrained unconscious psychological mechanism. Its important to relieve the burden from the prejudiced race in this regard. Most people wonder how you can pretty much get along with other racial groups on the surface but still feel the need to bond with your own race. The unconscious gulf is hard to cross. What was once an effective evolved psychological mechanism that increased our survival chances is now predominantly one that we use to maximize our reproductive success.
9)	Most racism is critical to the success of the one that practices it. It is ingrained in our youth. We have no choice. We ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bsv0r/the_black_evolution/,2013-04-06 16:26:14,1,0,books
