186br1d,"The Richard Lester movies are remarkably true to the book. I love them both.

Alexandre Dumas was well aware of his heroes' flaws, just as Ian Fleming was well aware of James Bond's flaws, or Sergio Leone was well aware of The Man with No Name's flaws. The swashbuckling genre generated by *The Three Musketeers* was often far less cynical than the original. Lester restored the hilarious cynicism of the original book.

D'Artagnan has several love affairs and tricks Milady into sleeping with him while she thinks she's sleeping with her lover -- and despite the fact that Constance is supposed to be his girl. Richelieu is actually much smarter than the King and has France's welfare in mind. Ultimately, D'Artagnan ends up working for Richelieu and becomes good friends with Rochefort, who appeared to be the big baddie at the beginning of the tale.

It's all a big game, life is cheap, and what redeems our ""heroes"" is that they are brave, daring, clever, and just plain awesome and the people they kill are either non-entities or truly villainous -- even more villainous than our heroes.",wjbc,2023-11-29 00:56:59

qf651e,"I never could get much into the Count : great concept but it just drags on and on. Too many characters and it's not exactly the Wire which can give life to D-list character like Walon or Keynard in four-five sequences : most of them aren't much to remember.

The Three Musketeers on the other hand is high paced and pretty tight. It starts with the main cast. They all have distinctive personalities and they're bigger than Life. The opponents and even the sidekicks are quite colorful too. You smile, you laugh, you sigh reading about those characters. Not only that but if you read the sequels it's most interesting to watch them ageing : there is something bittersweet about this because the tone gradually changes over the course of three novels and the ""Vicomte"" is clearly a harder read but in retrospective the conclusion feels quite organic and it sort of make you ponder about human nature and life journey. Character is destiny as they say. Dumas manage to make something exciting, frequently funny, and yet not without a certain depth.

Stevenson spoke better of the exalting nature of reading D'Artagnan and his friends adventures, specifically the old d'Artagnan of Vicomte of Bragelonne: ""Here, and throughout, if I am to choose virtues for myself or my friends, let me choose the virtues of d'Artagnan. I do not say there is no character as well drawn in Shakespeare; I do say there is none that I love so wholly. """,jiquvox,2021-10-25 12:31:28
xcnket,Have you read {The Count of Monte Cristo}? It’s by the same author. I read this one first and absolutely loved it. Then I read {The Three Musketeers}. I was disappointed. I believe I didn’t like it that much because Monte Cristo was just that much better.,LadybugGal95,2022-09-13 01:39:06

I know most people prefer Count of Monte Cristo; I won't say that I agree with this, I just feel that I need to be in a certain mood to read it, whereas for the Three Musketeers, it is comfort food to me as it is easier to read, and sometimes you don't want to think too much, and just go with an action novel.

Milady de Winter is also a compelling villain to me. I don't relate to her, neither do I agree with what she does, but sometimes it is just so freeing to see a character willing to do what I would never want to do in real life.",HuorSpinks,2022-09-14 07:03:29

cfe90d,I absolutely LOVE The Three Musketeers. The thing that surprised me the most when I finally read it (being previously familiar with the film adaptations) is the moral dissonance. These guys were pretty much anti-heroes by today's standards.,aesir23,2019-07-20 10:22:31
cfe90d,"Dumas is vastly overvalued as a writer.  


He produced some swashbuckling adventure stories, but they are anything but well written. It's a bit like claiming Star Trek or Star Wars were great films. His stories go for the cheap flash-bang effect, they live on the adventurous content of the story instead of good writing.   


Dumas had a writing factory, where he employed hacks, who wrote for him. He'd come in and give a general outline of the story and let his underlings flesh it out. They were mostly published in installments in magazines.  


Espc. about the Three Musketeers: Cliche heaped upon cliche and then the earth shattering error of having D'Artagnan awarded his musketeership halfway through, only to have it forgotten by the beginning of the next chapter. Why? See above. Many writers, published in installments, no way to correct. Always in money trouble, he needed to publish immediately.  


Dumas is kind of readable ONCE. If you re-read him a few times as I have done, then the mistakes and failures become glaringly obvious.  


Well written books gain from re-reading. Shoddily written books tend to fall apart.",Alaishana,2019-07-20 00:23:33

21t4qs,"It's a very different book. *The Count of Monte Cristo* is basically 500 interweaving plotlines that are all based around Edmund's revenge. *The Three Musketeers* is a much shorter book, but also involves many different plotlines. The difference is that these rarely come together. It's more like a series of short stories involving the adventures of D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis with a single larger plot (that of Milady) that runs through some of them.

I did not enjoy the other three books as much as the storylines are much more about romance, there is little to no action and they are even less cohesive than the first.

21t4qs,"Hey, I actually just finished writing a book inspired by *The Count of Monte Cristo*!  Dumas' masterwork is, in my opinion, one of the finest literary works every created.

The problem with *The Three Musketeers*(only when directly compared to *The Count*) is that it tends to focus less on the building of tension. It's a less personal novel, more concerned with male camaraderie than personal satisfaction. So, though seemingly similar, *The Three Musketeers* is an entirely different sort of book.  To be honest, I've always found it strange how often the two are mentioned in the same breath(though understandable).

 While *The Three Musketeers* is about shared adventure and fellowship, *The Count of Monte Cristo* is deeply personal, focusing primarily on the titular Count.  For myself, the subtle building of tension in *The Count* is what makes the ending so satisfying.

The Dumas arc typically places a protagonist at a level of reasonable happiness in the beginning of the story before plunging them into the depths of sorrow and misery(typically this is a very lonely place).  Then, our hero claws his way out(with no small amount of romance and swashing of buckles) and arrives at a level of happiness slightly higher than before his fall.  A result of the difference between the lowest point and the highest point of happiness is that our hero seems incredibly happy at the end(and we, as readers, feel incredibly satisfied).

In essence, *The Count of Monte Cristo* is much more focused on this arc than *The The Three Musketeers*.  This is why it seems so much more satisfying.  The tension built during Edmond Dantès lonely imprisonment and mysterious return to society is released in small( relatively) climaxes that, while satisfying, do not end the readers singular preoccupation with the central protagonist. We are still very much interested in the fate of Edmond Dantès until the last page. The tension that I previously mentioned is contained in this.  It starts building during Edmond's fall, builds tighter and tighter through his imprisonment, and is finally released in his vengeance and confrontation with the antagonists.  Multiple protagonists merely dilute this.

HOWEVER, *The Three Musketeers* is still an amazing novel and absolutely deserves to be read.  While it lacks the focus of *The Count*, it makes up for it with the sense of camaraderie and fellowship the story imparts.

tl;dr *The Count of Monte Cristo* is practically in a different genre than *The Three Musketeers*, but both are very good.",CalParmainII,2014-03-31 15:59:38

21t4qs,"I was aiming more along the lines that other posts mentioned: whether or not the edition you read had been translated for a more young adult audience. If that were the case, then the three musketeers be closer in style. Mostly the lack of dark revenge and calculating schemes for 20 years. But if your edition was unabridged, then The Three Musketeers is a noticeable step in another direction. Where Edmond Dantes took center stage for most of The Count of Monte Cristo in his pursuit of complete and utter revenge, the story of the three musketeers covers 4 men in their pursuit of friendship, country and honor. Different overtones to say the least. You will still see, for the most part, Dumas' style in the writing, but to say that lives will utterly collapse like the Danglar's or Villefort is incorrect. Think high adventure and villainy when approaching The Three Musketeers. ",Mikecapp58,2014-03-31 20:14:53

Musketeers does get more serious as it goes on and everyone settles down (somewhat), but there will always be some craziness.

gaqb7b,"From Lawrence Ellsworth's 2018 translation:

A NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION: Why do another English translation of The Three Musketeers, especially when there are fine recent renditions by Richard Pevear and Will Hobson? Because it deserves it, and because most published editions of the novel that you’ll find in bookstores and libraries still use translations that were prepared in the 1840s or 1850s, respectable but creaky adaptations endlessly recycled and reprinted, versions that simply don’t properly convey the energy and tone of Dumas’s original work. Though to be fair, those Victorian-era translators knew their business, and delivered exactly what their readers were looking for: historical dramas at the time were expected to be told in the stiff, elevated diction of writers like Sir Walter Scott and James Fenimore Cooper, and the translators saw it as their job to render Dumas’s unconventionally active prose into the more passive style then prevailing. But in doing so these early translations lost much of Dumas’s distinctive voice and tone, that warmth and vibrancy that leaps off the page in the original French. And that’s a real disservice to today’s readers, denying them some of the key virtues of this really quite modern writer. In translating this, one of my favorite works of fiction, I felt my most important task was to identify Dumas’s genuine voice and bring it to current-day readers of English, so they can meet the man on his own terms and really appreciate what he has to offer.

By the standards of the mid-nineteenth century the novel took a rather frank approach to sexuality; those scenes, which were mostly or wholly elided from the Victorian translations, have been restored in this version. Not least important, I’ve also kept in all the jokes. Dumas was a very funny man, and I have no patience with translators who note that a gag “is a Gallicism that cannot be properly rendered into English.” Weak! Dumas wasn’t above stooping to make a terrible French pun, in which case I considered it my solemn obligation to provide some matching wordplay in English. Because literary translation is a noble calling, and sometimes your sacred duty to the reader requires you to make a terrible, terrible pun.

I see that you'd prefer more psychological depth and focus on different things, I just think The Three Musketeers was never meant to be anything more than a rollicking tale, poking fun at the government and courtiers. Also, it was written as a serial, so each chapter or so had to be its own little episode and there are definitely some bits that don't match up perfectly well in tone or timing and occasionally it's clear Dumas forgot small details along the way.

Overall though, it's just the story of four misfits who have managed to find a group that accepts them on their merits, overlooks their faults, and absolutely loves getting into trouble.",serralinda73,2017-03-14 21:50:12

10ysbam,"Pierre Niney in turn dons the costume of the Count of Monte-Cristo, “superhero” version

&#x200B;

“As millions of readers around the world, I was marked and transported by the great novel that is Monte-Cristo wrote Pierre Niney on his Twitter account. Reynaud Julien / APS-Medias / ABACA  
After The three MusketeersMatthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patellière tackle another masterpiece by Alexandre Dumas.  
  
the count of Monte Cristo , mythical figure of literature and cinema, will make a new appearance on the big screen. Adapted from Alexandre Dumas’ masterpiece, the film “will follow the point of view of Edmond Dantès, the first French superhero“, explain the two men, in a press release. After adapting The three Musketeers (in two episodes, scheduled for release in April and December), Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patellière tackle what they consider to be “one of the greatest stories ever told». As for the adventures of d’Artagnan, they will sign the adaptation and the screenplay. But also the realization – it was Martin Bourboulon who was in charge for the Musketeers. Everything is produced by Chapter 2 and Pathé.

The main role of this feature film made in France has been entrusted to Pierre Niney, “which will be a Monte-Cristo like you’ve never seen it before” directors hope. The 33-year-old actor will be the 17th to play Edmond de Dantès, after Gérard Depardieu, Jean Marais or Pierre-Richard. “As millions of readers around the world, I was marked and transported by the great novel that is Monte-Cristo he wrote on his Twitter account. We want to create a great film of adventures, characters but above all… revenge“.  
  
Shooting for the film, which is scheduled for release in October 2024, is due to begin in July in France and represents “a huge challenge” for production. But Dimitri Rassam and the Pathé company are happy to once again accompany Matthieu and Alexandre who have managed to find the balance to respect what makes the strength of this masterpiece while offering a modern and fully cinematographic vision“.

The rest of the cast has yet to be revealed. While waiting for photos and trailers, we will have to settle for a first promotional poster, published on Twitter by Pierre Niney.

Musketeers is style-wise also more geared towards kids and young adults. I've read all of his work and I personally thought the count had a significantly better story. The musketeers have always been humorous, romantic, unkillable and kind of hard to believe. The Count is very bleak, realistic and not very funny.",,2023-02-10 14:46:02

3n783j,"It's ironic because a mere cardinal is **not** supposed to be a higher authority in military matters than the king. In France during that time period, the king is supposed to be an absolute monarch (Louis XIV, the successor of the king who features in *The Three Musketeers*, is the one who coined the phrase ""*l'état, c'est moi* - that is, ""I **am** the state""), but here is a king whose strings are being pulled by the Grey Cardinal.

D'Artagnan at this time is a very young, very poor, very provincial kid in an era before the Internet made knowledge an easily-come-by commodity. He has exactly zero knowledge of any of this - but he immediately catches de Treville's meaning, and immediately catches the irony in it. That's pretty damned sophisticated political instinct right there.",AnnaLemma,2015-10-02 13:36:50
35ogir,"I don't think it was ""censorship."" Rather, I think that Victorian era English translators were too flustered by those parts, and they omitted, abridged, or glossed over them for the sake of ""decency.""

I couldn't tell you, because I've read neither *The Three Musketeers* nor *Les Trois Mousquetaires*. But, from the way Richard Pevear talks in the introduction to his translation, it would seem that the public domain version is heavily abridged.

Then again, you could argue that Richard Pevear is biased, and, therefore, unreliable, since it's in his interest to shit on previous translations to establish his own.

Then again, you could respond with a bias/personal interest does not mean someone's wrong.

Another crazy thing to think about (with regards to The Three Musketeers) is that Dumas wrote that book in 1844 and the novel is set in 1625-1628, so we are far closer in time to the year he wrote the book than he was to the time the story is set.

The Borja ritual is kind of the same thing, Corso leaves before we can see what happens, we just hear him scream. does that mean he succeeded and the devil appeared but since the last page was a forgery the devil punished him, or he screams because he failed. since he killed a bunch of people and destroyed his books and now comprehending what he has done. 

If you take what Balkan (the narrator) said. he basically telling us that we thought this whole plot was about the devil and Dumas selling his soul to him but actually, it was two different plots going on at the same time.   


So what do we learn from the first plot, that it was fake and we the reader made assumptions that Corso was kind of confronting book characters from the three The Three Musketeers, but since we found out it was all made up, then why do we assume that the whole devil thing is real? it all can be just Corso connecting himself to books he is investigating because the Club of Dumas messed with his head.

4emabi,"I agree - The Three Musketeers is an amazingly enjoyable book! It's the only book by Dumas that I've read though. I must seek out some others.

4emabi,"The Three Musketeers is fantastic! Its one of my favorites and I must have read that whole book at least three times in high school. I need to find my copy and read it again, thanks to your post.",shark_bone,2016-04-14 12:36:20
4emabi,"Came in to comment exactly this. I enjoyed the Three Musketeers just fine but it was a bit of a let down after the brilliance of the Count of Monte Cristo. OP, if Musketeers is your favorite television comedy, Monte Cristo will be your favorite television drama.",gayghost,2016-04-13 23:40:57
4emabi,"> the other d'Artagnan romances aren't the same caliber.

Agreed. The Three Musketeers and Count of Monte Cristo are some of my favorite books. However, there's a reason those are the most well-known Dumas works.",,2016-04-13 19:27:42
4emabi,Oh it's definitely still worth a read. I just think that The Count of Monte Cristo set my expectations too high. I probably would have enjoyed The Three Musketeers more if I had read it first. ,Immortal_Azrael,2016-04-15 01:57:53
4emabi,"A couple years ago I tried reading The Man in the Iron Mask. It felt weird. I've read The Three Musketeers multiple times, it's one of my favorite books, but I couldn't bring myself to even get a fourth of the way through Iron Mask. I assumed this was because I hadn't read anything before that besides the Three Musketeers. Thanks for letting me know before I wasted time on the other books lol",JEMessiah,2016-04-14 21:23:55
jcsfci,I recommend reading other works of Alexandre Dumas I'm making my way through them and I have made to the count of monte cristo now. The three musketeers is different but it's definitely an adventurous classic!,zaza_starovic,2020-10-17 11:39:14
jcsfci," I first read COMC in high school. It was required reading and we used a condensed version. Years later, I found a larger, unabridged version to read. I was amazed how much material there was and how it fleshed out the story and character development.

Since you enjoyed reading it, find an unabridged version of The Three Musketeers. It was the first part of the d'Artagnan Romances ( Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, Le Vicomte de Bragelonne , Louise de la Valliere , and The Man in the Iron Mask ) . For extra credit read La Reine Margot, The Last Cavalier, The Red Sphinx, The Corsican Brothers, and Le Chevalier de Maison-Rouge (The Knight of the Red House). All of Alexandre Dumas stories were part of the same universe. It was his way of telling people about French history in fiction form.",counterslave,2020-10-17 15:07:12
jcsfci,One of my favorites books! I also really enjoyed The Three Musketeers.,cryptic-fox,2020-10-17 17:54:30
jcsfci,I just finished the Three Musketeers for the first time two days ago. SO GOOD. I agree if you like The Count you will like this. It's got some fucking fantastic humor in it too. I cracked up out loud multiple times.,welliamwallace,2020-10-17 22:53:49
jcsfci,"I know right? It's more cheerful than the count so it's different. Iknow that these two books are held as the best works of Duma. You might enjoy ""twenty years after "" too now that you know the characters better! It's the first sequel and the one that is most similar to the three musketeers.",zaza_starovic,2020-10-18 10:16:51
jcsfci,"I'm sorry for you but the man in the iron mask book is one of my favourites and no film adaptation ever was able to portrait the three musketeers book the way it is written.
I've read the three musketeers and its sequels all as one big book without watching any movie so maybe that's why I like them.",zaza_starovic,2020-10-17 16:10:27
