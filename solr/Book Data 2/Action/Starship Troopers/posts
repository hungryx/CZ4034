18szjqh,Starship Troopers is a very weird book where nothing really happens,"I recently finished Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers, a book that I have constantly heard as being controversial (even the front cover refers to it as ""the controversial classic of military adventure""). Going into it, I was expecting some problematic philosophy, but I was not expecting for the entire book to be nothing more than a series of discussions about philosophy. 

I am sure there are many out there like me who are more familiar with the Paul Verhoeven film adaptation from the late 90's. That adaptation treats its source material as a satire, lampooning many pro-military sentiments in what is clearly a huge critique of fanaticism and military aggression while still showcasing fun action scenes. Before reading the book, I was expecting something similar, only with the main themes being presented as more earnest. What I did not expect was scene after scene of Heinlein's obvious stand-in characters explaining his philosophy. 

There is a Professor character, Professor Dubois (Michael Ironside's character in the movie), who Heinlein frames as the man who is always right. He advocates for things such as the importance of beating your children to prevent them from becoming delinquents (this dialogue about child-beating goes on for, like, five pages), the importance of violence, and how communism is evil but a society that only lets people vote after they sign up for the military is great and perfect and has no issues. 

Any deterrence to Heinlein's philosophy is swiftly avoided. Those who have seen the film will remember the funny, ""what good is it to have a knife in a nuke fight?"" scene in which a subordinate voices his doubt about all the rigorous training only to have his commander throw a knife at him. The book has something similar, virtually the same dialogue being spoken, only this time it ends with the commander questioning the subordinate's loyalty, the subordinate's moral concerns quickly being motioned away in just as blunt a manner as the film (the difference being the film is aware of the brutish undertones of the scene). I am okay with a book just enforcing an author's philosophy, when you think about it that is what every book is, but if a book is only going to be full of the same pro-military sentiments over and over, I would expect some challenge to those themes.

When I say the book consists of nothing but philosophy, I mean that. There are few, if any, supporting characters, and those we do get have little character. Compared to the action-packed movie, this book has little to offer. There is one action scene at the beginning when the soldiers raid a town and one near the end when the bugs appear. The bugs themselves are not even really mentioned until roughly 140 pages into this 300 page book. Up until then we just follow Johnne Rico in his military training where we learn about random protocols and training. The sci-fi elements feel so slight and pasted on to what otherwise could have just been a more real-world military book. There is this other race of aliens on the planet who are more humanoid, but we rarely hear of them. There is an offhanded mention that the humanoids >!betrayed the bugs to work for the humans!<, and I have no idea why such a potentially-interesting idea is glossed over in favor of more discussions of military ethic. 

It is difficult to overstate just how slight this book is. I feel like nothing happened. The main character was an empty slate and the only payoff for seeing the main character in military camp for 70% of the book is a dull action scene near the end. I know Heinlein is a famous author, so I presume he has some talent, but am I alone in being underwhelmed by this book? Even if I agreed with the philosophy, I do not think I would be able to overlook just how repetitive and boring it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18szjqh/starship_troopers_is_a_very_weird_book_where/,2023-12-28 17:35:37,562,874,books
168l0ma,"Robert A. Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"".","It's not a secret that Heinlein was a magnet for controversy when it came to some of his novels. And this night I've finished his most controversial work ""Starship Troopers"".

At first Johnnie Rico had never even intended to join the Mobile Infantry, let alone even be part of it.  But as fate would have it he is in the thick of it now, getting through a combat training regiment that is much tougher than anything he had ever imagined before.

He knows well that everyone in his own unit that they're one bad move away from ""buying the farm"" in the interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. For in the Infantry, everyone fights. If the training hasn't killed you then the Bugs are more than willing to finish the job.

Prior to writing this novel much of Heinlein's output in the 40s and 50s comprised of novels aimed at teenage boys. ""Starship Troopers"", published in 1959, was also a reaction. Heinlein was a military man and served in the Navy and when news came in 1958 that the Eisenhower administration announced that it was going to stop atmospheric nuclear tests you can very well imagine that it didn't very well with Heinlein.

""Starship Troopers"" was a reaction against this decision and also against what Heinlein believed to be the decline of the US. It has become the most debated and controversial science fiction novel as many accused of being fascistic in nature and promoting militarism. It still has to be brought to mind that Heinlein's views and ideas were all over the place, and despite the controversy surrounding ""Starship Troopers"" it was also influential as it popularized space marines and power armor.

For me it's a fun military/space adventure (I don't really care much for the ideas presented in it) even if the debate around it continues. And of course it was also made into a movie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/168l0ma/robert_a_heinleins_starship_troopers/,2023-09-03 02:23:44,162,106,books

7guuzi,"[Starship Troopers] “When you vote, you are exercising political authority, you’re using force. And force, my friends, is violence. The supreme authority from which all other authorities are derived.”","This passage (along with countless others), when I first read it, made me really ponder the legitimacy of the claim. Violence the “supreme authority?” 

Without narrowing the possible discussion, I would like to know not only what you think of the above passage, but of other passages in the book as well.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the upvotes and comments! I did not expect to have this much of a discussion when I first posted this. However, as a fan of the book (and the movie) it is awesome to see this thread light up. I cannot, however, take full, or even half, credit for the discussion this thread has created. I simply posted an idea from an author who is no longer with us. Whether you agree or disagree with passages in Robert Heinlein's book, Starship Troopers, I believe it is worthwhile to remember the human behind the book. He was a man who, like many of us, served in the military, went through a divorce, shifted from one area to another on the political spectrum, and so on. He was no super villain trying to shove his version of reality on others. He was a science-fiction author who, like many other authors, implanted his ideas into the stories of his books. If he were still alive, I believe he would be delighted to know that his ideas still spark a discussion to this day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7guuzi/starship_troopers_when_you_vote_you_are/,2017-12-01 13:10:40,1988,9852,books

9yrbkj,How is Starship Troopers pro Facist?,"To be a full citizen you need to have served in the military.  There are plenty of options and opportunities to quit or drop out of the military at anytime you just lose the right to earn full voting citizenship.

The book does not depict this system as positive more than it does negative.  The narrator's rich dad and his childhood friend's lower income dad are both against military services for their children.

I understand that military service to vote is not democratic. I would call it authoritarian. I don't see how it Facist over Socialist authoritarian. During peace time military objectors call it a job for people living off of the government.

Even if the Author believes the future would be more facist and the character accept the system it is not a full endorsement of facism.  Do authors need to create  a Distopian setting as extreme as Orwell to be anti authoritarian?

Did the author say facist things in the real world?

Are other books from the author  more fascist with a pattern?

What am I missing?

Edit 1: I did not mean to get a thread to go too political.  I'm not a strong fiction reader.  I was wondering why the book is considered pro facist. The people accept the authoritarian system but even the elite rich like the narrator's fathers is against his son participating. The military discourages many from joining.  If all the characters supported the authoritarian system 100% it would seem pro facist, characters mostly accepting a system seems more apathetic then pro facist.  A lot of American are apathetic to the bad parts of American big business and government but that doesn't make them facist even if the apathy allows for the rise of fascism.

Edit 2: My questions are not a passive aggressive support or militarism or a right wing agenda. I am very left leaning and was looking to hate read fascist propaganda. I just don't see this book as very pro facist as I view it as pro complacent of a non democratic system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9yrbkj/how_is_starship_troopers_pro_facist/,2018-11-20 11:23:23,62,2,books
mxhc2h,[Spoilers] Why Starship Troopers is just a piece of propaganda,"People often feel ""off"" about this book, but it is often poorly articulated why. The book is often called fascist, but this is not really correct. the book is militaristic propaganda, not fascist. People make the mistake because militarism is one aspect of fascism, but the reverse does not hold, not all militarism is fascistic. 

The book is extremely pro military propaganda and uses common propagandic tricks to muffle that fact. It ""tells"" the reader that civilians are respected and valuable, but it never SHOWS that. All character development in the book revolves around accepting how great it is to serve in the military. All the civilians are aimless and never do something worthy of respect until they have the epiphany of how serving in the military is the great cause in their life. This is a common propaganda tool where one goal is stated, but others are shown to gather the respect of the reader and convince him of this fact. 
There are also a couple of red herrings about people who can't serve on the front line that draw much of the discussion but are ultimately not really relevant for the main point of being extremely militaristic. Besides the propaganda there isn't really much to the book really. Like one reviewer at the time said  Heinlin has ""forgotten to insert a story"".

I will keep it short because I think that about sums up the major points and I would love to hear your opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mxhc2h/spoilers_why_starship_troopers_is_just_a_piece_of/,2021-04-24 10:31:52,48,3,books
ta32z1,Starship Troopers as blueprint for a better society and how it changed my life.,"Only ex military personnel are allowed to vote or hold government positions, and all moral instruction provided by public schools must be provided by a veteran.

To me this is the ideal system of government.

There are Citizens and Civilians. At the age of 18 all persons intellectually capable of legally swearing an oath are allowed (not required) to sign up for a minimum two year term of federal service. Only upon successful completion of this term of service are you allowed to vote or run in *any* election.

What's fascinating about the book is how prescient it was, despite being written in 1959.

The authors argument is that person's who valued the right to vote so much that they would be willing to die to secure it would treasure that right and use it responsibily.. and those who would be willing to risk death to ensure the safety of the community overall would use that right benevolently.

Someone will tell me “this is not nazism” , well in  “Mein Kampf” the book that Hitler wrote with help of Rudolf Hess at least portrays the citizenship to anyone who pass through military service and portrays too only one ideology as the right one and the persecuted of the ones who think different.

lit7hf,Starship Troopers - Mr. Dubois. Is he supposed to be sympathetic... to the point of being quite manipulative?,"There are sections of Starship Troopers which really caught my eye and spoke to me. They were mostly the philosophical parts, from the flashbacks to Dubois.

I'm 26 years old and a guy, so, I think these parts were most likely written with my demographic in mind. And they hit hard. But I'm conflicted about them. Because on the one hand, the book satires the military and its way of thinking, but and on the other hand, it glorifies it. It's very balanced, to the point where I'm wondering whether I should trust what Dubois has to say or not.

The sections that ''got'' me were-

When Dubois justifies paddling/spanking as a way to train dogs and teach children not to act ''immorally.'' (Obviously, this' extremely controversial today, but I can't help but empathise with the point, because it does feel as though our societies are going down an increasingly immoral path and I can't help but wonder if this *is* the lesser evil.)

When Dubois points out how ''XX-century'' (our generation) failed to create a society that could stand the test of time because we got too entitled, glorified our rights, and stopped performing our civic duties. Once we stopped performing our duties, we literally became lost. (I don't know about you, but this rings a lot of bells - maybe not for me personally, but I know a *lot* of people like this.

When Dubois illustrates how throughout history violence has been used to reset the status quo and refresh people's awareness of how important their rights are. e.g. A nation goes to war, suffers casualties, and eventually wins. Everyone gets an ego check and becomes humbled enough not to piss their rights away... or let politicians do for to them.

5tq0oo,My Appreciation of Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein,"Some minor spoilers lie ahead.

Also warning, I'm not finished with the book, I'm just getting out his ""boot camps"" arc I suppose. 

The reason why I appreciate it is this close to the beginning of the story is the MEPS, military entry processing station, and basic training kind of pegs the feelings new recruits and privates feel when joining the army. I am a military veteran of a combat arms/combat support job, Military Police AKA most hated MOS in the military. Going through the beginning phases up till you got your unit patch is pretty similar to what I thought during my basic training and entry processing. The thing I learned along the way is that in reality you are the drill sergeants family. You are not allowed to see it but once you spend so long a time with them they see their privates as their children and I think Heinleir pegs the mentality.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5tq0oo/my_appreciation_of_starship_troopers_by_robert/,2017-02-13 01:26:25,21,9,books
8o83fw,Other examples of the Starship Troopers novel/film dichotomy?,"I finally got around to reading Starship Toopers by Heinlein. I enjoyed it very much. 

As a teenager, I first saw the movie adaptation and of course loved it at the time -- not understanding the critique that Paul Verhoeven was making with the film (although, as an aside, I've read that Verhoeven admitted he never finished the book -- I wonder how much his movie was a critique on what he **thought** the book was about, versus what Heinlein actually wrote).

But it got me thinking -- the book and movie aren't just different, they're intentionally different because the subsequent creator disagreed with the fundamental approach of the original work. 

I wonder what are other examples of this dichotomy between novel and film adaptations?

I started reading this book as it was on a list of books to read as a commissioned officer in particular to leadership. Did I learn anything about leadership from this book. Yea I think I did. However, overall I would say I do not agree with his overall philosophy on what it means to serve and what the future holds for man kind. The book almost feels like an antithesis to Star Trek. From a doubling down on military and science for war not for peace. The ""science"" and ""math"" the author also points out, on the human condition, seems short sighted. 

The movie I feel actually captures the essence of the book and plays it right back at the author. I remember hearing that the author hated the movie and felt the director bastardized his work.

mwkt4,"Starship Troopers *spoilers* - Help, Going Crazy","I just finished reading Heinlein's Starship Troopers and apparently I have a different interpretation than everyone else on the planet (according to my google-fu.)  
It seems that most people took the book in a straightforward manner, for brevity's sake:  
Heinlein introduces us to the idea of 'buying your franchise' as a means to get a voter base who are invested in an ideal greater than themselves.  He introduces this ideology through the eyes of Johnny Rico, a young space marine.  
At first, I was interpreting the book in that light - and I thought it sucked.  Although the idea was interesting, the presentation was heavy handed, and I felt rife with contradictions.  However, toward the end of the book, I started reflecting on those things I found to be logical inconsistencies and the absurdity of some of the philosophy and they suddenly seemed very calculated to me.  As if Heinlein had intentionally left breadcrumbs to reveal a more interesting story.  
I think the book is actually a story told from the perspective of a brainwashed warrior done in the human hive.  
One thing that really clued me in was the death of Rico's mother.  Her death was first introduced in the middle of a chapter dedicated to the death of Rico's lieutenant.  Just think about how strange that is... there is a whole chapter about the impact of Rasczak's death on Johnny.  And in the middle of this chapter, he mentions the death of Mrs. Rico as an ""oh by the way.""  
From the perspective of a 20th century man, that really stands out as strange.  So at first, you might rationalize it by saying: ""Perhaps he wasn't close to his mother.""  However, the only thing Heinlein did tell you about Johnny's mother was that he WAS very close to her.  She wrote him a touching letter which almost made him leave boot camp.  
Her death was intentionally planted as a marker to clue the reader in to just how indoctrinated Rico had become.  
Once I caught onto that, I started re-examining all the strange little things that I dismissed at first and they just kept adding up to the same thing.  
For example, when Rico first enters boot camp, Heinlein makes an explicit effort to say that there was a method to the madness - a very carefully orchestrated system meant to 'create an MI.'  At first, I dismissed that as being roughly what our modern boot camp tries to do... but then at the end of the book, you learn that in the ST universe, the science of human psychology is incomprehensibly beyond what we understand today - to the point of it being supernatural.  I mean: They hypnotized entire units to fall asleep at the word of their commanding officers.  They psychologically melded human and dog.  They created psychic humans.  Just think of how thoroughly a civilization like that could orchestrate boot camp.  Maybe to the point where, someone would be more upset by the death of their commanding officer than they would be at the death of their mother.  
And then there's THE philosophical punchline of the whole book:
Serving in the military earns you a right to vote, BECAUSE it means you were willing to sacrifice your life for the state (and the many.)  And because you earned it, you will value it and try to do a good job.  
However, every single time a soldier is asked, 'why do you fight?'  Not a single one ever answers with the right answer.  Every single time, they answer 'wrong.'  You would think that the main character would at least have the epiphany to support the major ideological thesis of the book, but he doesn't.  Rico fights because MI is his new family.  His dad fights, because it makes him feel like a man.  How does that make them fit to vote?  It doesn't!  Heinlein is a great writer, could he really have made that mistake?  
One of the few times that Heinlein discusses 'what went wrong with the 20th century,' he says civilization fell because people did not spank their children enough.  Really?... That's absurd.  But it leads into a discussion about training a puppy.  And by extension a conversation which says the key to their modern society's success is that they have learned to 'train' or 'condition' people.  You're lead to believe that the training he is referring to is simply the lash... but that's absurd too.  You can't condition people simply with physical punishment.  The conditioning he's really talking about is mass brainwashing - which they can do because they've mastered human psychology.
When the father first meets Rico in the military, he discusses his decision to join MI... notice that Heinlein was sure to fit in the fact that his psycho-therapist helped him come to the decision?  
  
Also, we were only introduced to three classes of people in the ST social structure.  We saw civilians (worker drones, who refuse to fight), soldiers, and a member of the 'nobility' (the psychic guy who detected the bugs at the end of the book).  It just seems like a clear parallel to the bugs.  
  
I could go on and on with examples, I'm not even carefully picking strong cases - I'm simply listing them as they come to mind.  Add to this, his earlier book: Revolt in 2100 -- where Heinlein basically writes about how evil and subversive brainwashing will be in the future - and that we must guard against it.  Brainwashing was a political hot-button around the time these books were written.  
  
The only thing is: Heinlein never tips his hand.  If it is a book about a brainwashed soldier, I couldn't figure out: WHY.  Is it good, is it bad?  What are you trying to tell us, Robert?!

Has anyone else noticed these things in ST?  And if you're planning a re-read any time soon, keep your eyes peeled and please get back to me.  I'm going crazy wondering.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mwkt4/starship_troopers_spoilers_help_going_crazy/,2011-12-01 21:00:19,0,6,books
