1adh97r,Book Review: Fight Club,"One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The sense of detachment, of nothing being imprinted throughout the story, makes every effort to give meaning to life ephemeral. 

Everything we've possessed ends up possessing us, everything we've done will never count for anything, all the sacrifices of a lifetime end up being mundane routines, a monotonous imprisonment of habits. 

The greatest fear? Not having a name, being nobody, never counting for anything, never having done anything significant because only in death do we have a name, only in death will they remember that we existed. 

A beautiful book about the meaning of life and the struggle to keep living in a world that has never had meaning.

I'm in the middle of a reread(audiobook) of Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout the book, the Narrator mentions his father and relationship and how he would set up franchises every few years by creating new families in different places.  He mentions how Tyler and Marla are never in the same room together and how he passes messages between them.  He then talks about how this feels exactly like his parents when he was growing up.  As we know, the narrator and Tyler are the same person.  Is this the case with his father?

10z679g,Fight Club - Review and reflection,"I never watched the movie to this book so I had no expectations going into this except I was under the impression I would witness awesome action with explicit descriptions - I got none of that. 

What I got was a internal monologue heavy drama about the the MC‚Äôs spiraling life satisfaction and declining mental health. In full transparency, I would have to say 2/3 to 3/4 of the book was not my favorite and I was not able to invest myself in the setting, characters or goal. The last quarter of the book really did help tie it all together, along with providing a decently structured ending that could be considered satisfying but I felt it landed a little flat - to each their own though. 

I watched an excerpt from the author about the meaning behind the book - needing apprenticeship to take ownership of something, having the primal nature to play rough and define manhood in this ‚Äúdeclining era of the modern man‚Äù. I‚Äôm not quite sure that message is portrayed well but a short read so I can forgive it. I know i‚Äôm harping quite a bit but the witty humor helped me stay invested.

1aeoi3r,Why do people think fight club is a deconstruction of toxic masculinity when Palahniuk literally quotes Jordan Fucking Peterson in the first few moments of his JRE episode.,"The entire 'You missed the point crowd' somehow likes to interject their personal beliefs onto every story as much as the people they are criticising. Fight club, according to it's own author is very clearly about the effects of consumerism, the destruction of community, importance of a father figure/mentor, lack of purpose in men's lives and the danger of being enslaved by those who promise you freedom.

Tyler's character (at least subconsciously) is very inspired by ted kaczynski, who many people sympathize with at least to some degree. In much the same way the author clearly sympathizes with the struggles the narrator faces and tyler tries to solve, as evident in his interviews and especially in his JRE episode. Tyler is a revolutionary, and much like his real life counterparts (many of which redditor's idolize such as che guevara and castro lol) seeks to destroy the system but in his rage he harms innocents and likely would have tried to build a new one to take it's place. The narrator realising that he has simply become a slave to tyler now instead of the consumerist society he lived in tries to seek actual freedom and not fall into the trap of fanaticism. In the book he fails, which is to be expected with it's nietzschean themes echoing the idea the true freedom is not possible. In the movie the narrator still fails (I don't see people talking about this but project mayhem still goes through after tyler's death, it seems that most people have forgotten about this), he fails to bring freedom to the overarching society but he finds his own personal freedom by killing tyler and holding on to his relationship with Marla.

spyx2y,Fight Club,"So I watched the film about ten years ago and loved it. I think I've only seen it once, maybe twice but I'm honestly not sure. Saw the book in a shop at a bit of a bargain and thought, that would be good to read and it's only short so I'll give it a go!

I'm not even halfway through and I'm struggling. I normally would go through a book this length in two-three days. I don't know if it's because I've seen the film? Is it the way it's written? Is it because I already know the twist that's coming? I just honestly can't engage with it at all.

The only thing I will say is that when I'm reading it, I can very clearly picture the scene in the film, which I'm finding really weird, as I think I've only seen it once!

k3dvqh,"Fight Club, Chuck Palanhiuk","I read this book a few years ago on my early morning commutes, and decided to read it again. I read somewhere that re-reading books at different stages in your life is somewhat better than trying to read as many new books as possible. Different parts to the book you once overlooked suddenly become relevant in this respect. Anyway, just a fun little experiment I'm having with myself at the moment. **Fight club!** I absolutely adore this book. I know the film is a cult classic, but I honestly prefer the book in this case. Chuck has a way with words. I like that he doesn't use too many commas and just drags a sentence in as few words as possible (I struggle with unnecessarly commas as a writer so this stands out to me aha). The use of irony in this book is wonderful too. Characters are unusual, but thoroughly interesting. I recommend if you haven't read already

I recently joined a book at my high school and it was the first time at the club. All we did was just give suggestions on what to read for the club. It has to be short and it has to be what everyone agrees on. So, I mentioned ""Fight Club"". Let me remind you that the majority of the club consist of females while the males are shortened. The males do want to read because even though they never read the novel, the title sounds cool and they are very interested. But then the girls didn't agree because all they know of the book is that one quote ""First rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club."" They don't want to get into that. 

Now, for the people who have read Fight Club, I need your help in trying to convince the whole group (especially the girls) to read the book. Anything would help. Thank you. ~Tyler

I, for the first time in a VERY long time, am happy while I am reading. It's become a very relaxing hobby for me. With this book though, it's odd, because the things spoken about in it are more or less true, and that comforts me, somehow...? 

What I'm getting at here, is this book had my full attention for two nights(I'm a slow reader, what's it to ya?) and it allowed me to just use my imagination. It allowed me to relax.

6wyyt3,Finally read Fight Club and Fight Club 2,"I use to read constantly. Over the years life got busy and I had a lot less time for my favorite past time. Recently though I've been making time for it again, putting the phone down turning the TV off and doing my best to get my 2 girls into reading as well. 
I picked up Fight Club as I was a huge fan of the movie. Let me say I loved the first book, it was enthralling and sucked me in more than the movie ever had. It answered many of the questions about Tyler that I'd had. The movie was, in my opinion, a good adaptation of the book but the change of the ending was a mistake to me. 
Picked up and finished the sequel which Chuck did in graphic novel form. I have nothing against the format, love reading walking dead and have been hunting down the graphic novel versions of Wheel of Time and The Dark Tower, however I was not pleased or impressed with Fight Club 2. It felt unfinished and raw. To me it seemed like just a jumble of thoughts and ideas that Chuck had after finishing the novel. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed the parts where Chuck wrote himself and the publishers into the story and flat out says that he is not going to give the readers what they want just to placate them. The overlayed art is one of the things that bothered me, the rose petals and pills covering speech bubbles and text blocks took away from the story and left me trying to fill in what might have been said in those covered up areas. I wish, personally, that Chuck had developed the ideas further and written another full novel instead. The premise is fantastic and I'd like to see how Tyler makes his comeback and gains control over ""Sebastian"" again. 
I'm typically a fantasy/horror reader so this was a little different from my typical tastes but all in all I am glad I picked up and read at least the first one. It will now be in my top favorite books for all of time. In the past my most loved stories were The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, incredibly sad that he was not able to finish the story in his own way before his passing, as well as Stephen King's Dark Tower series. I've read both through multiple times and suggest them to anyone who is into the genre (just make sure you have no plans to read anything else for a good amount of time if you are taking on the epic that is Wheel of Time). As a child I grew up on King's horror books and was very impressed with his step into fantasy, Roland is one of my heroes.

No wonder the guy suffers from insomnia and the only cure he can find for it is pretending to be sick to get support from real sick people with cancer. 

Yes, the book is pretty crude and has a dark sense of humor. But unlike other works which use it to be edgy and different i think works well here because the narrator himself is sort of done with life. We tend to tolerate taboo subjects more when indifferent. 

Which is why Tyler Durden is a perfectly juxtaposed to our pathetic and weak Narrator. While also crude, Tyler takes life by the balls and doesn't' let go. The whole story he consumes the plot and even the narrators thoughts so much so the plot twist is a ""aha, of course"" moment.  

As to what the book means, well, thats for reader to always decide but I do get a bit miffed hearing it called sexist. I can see where that idea comes from; feminine man is bad, women are feminine, ergo women bad. But without context on what else the book says about masculinity your only seeing part of the picture. It'd be like tasting the frosting on a cake and deeming it bad based solely on frosting.  As Tyler would say, you need to take a big fat bite out of that cake, because he needs to make soap with it later.

otddez,"Curious about your thoughts on serious adversity in the world as it relates to its mention in Chuck Palahniuk's novel ""Fight Club"".","I should add, ""serious adversity in the world **in our current era**"".

""Fight Club"", first published in **1996**, deals heavily with the existential dread, frustration, or ennui which grows out of living in modern (or post-modern) society.

This oft-quoted line of the novel which sums this feeling up is:

>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression.""

So it mentions the lack ""in our generation"" of a great war or a great depression.

However since Fight Club's publication in 1996, there have been the less than ideal U.S. ventures in Afghanistan and Iraq, the decline of America's global prestige in the world order, the Great Recession, whose repercussions are still being felt, the increasing pressure of global climate change, this major global COVID-19 pandemic, of course, the precarious situation of global republicanism and democracy, and, the emergence of Cold War II, a new era of global geopolitical great power conflict. (And to top it all off, the aliens are probably silently watching us)

And so, it seems like we do have a lot of issues going on right now for our current generation, and as such, I'm wondering how this might affect your reading of that part of Fight Club today, would love to hear your thoughts and opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/otddez/curious_about_your_thoughts_on_serious_adversity/,2021-07-28 16:25:20,22,4,books

14k01a,Is Fight Club worth reading for somebody who has seen the film many times?,"Perhaps an odd question, but I ask because part of the fun of reading a book after I've seen the film version many times is that the book is a much deeper experience (*Lord of the Rings* and to a lesser extent *The Godfather* both spring to mind) and is its own unique experience. I just sampled the first 2 chapters on my Kindle, and I have to say it feels like the film is just playing in my head, without a lot of added depth. The film seems almost *too* faithful.

Either way it seems like it would be a quick read, but I'm just wondering if I'd be more satisfied spending my time reading something that's completely new to me.

Any thoughts?

> Edit: Also, because it could be an interesting discussion, do other people here tend to feel the same way I do about reading the book after seeing the film?

> Edit #2: I decided to purchase the Kindle version (it was less than $8) and I read it in 3 days. I noticed a surprising amount of differences (ranging from the different ending to the subtle additions which I thought helped to clarify the plot as well as solidify the themes and the ""moral"" of the story) between the book and film versions, and I felt satisfied that I read it.

67kzsb,Fight Club Chapter 8 Capitalization Question,"Okay, so I have become absolutely addicted to Fight Club It is filled with many purposeful nods by the author so many aspects of the book play a deeper role in the plot, often without the reader even realizing it.

In the beginning of chapter 8, there are many words that are entirely capitalized. I have easily spent 2 hours attempting to figure out if there is some deeper meaning to be read into, or if it is simply a stylistic choice so as to emphasize the words. Regardless, I was wondering if anyone could help me solve this mystery. 

The words are: FAX, HAIKU, FAX, ZEN, FACE, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, ZEN, BLOOD, NOTHING, ENLIGHTENED.

1j21xi,"Your favorite works of ""transgressive"" fiction? (Fight Club, Lolita, Naked Lunch and similar)","Quote from the Wikipedia article, for a definition:

> Transgressive fiction is a genre of literature that focuses on characters who feel confined by the norms and expectations of society and who break free of those confines in unusual and/or illicit ways. Because they are rebelling against the basic norms of society, protagonists of transgressional fiction may seem mentally ill, anti-social, or nihilistic. The genre deals extensively with taboo subject matters such as drugs, sex, violence, incest, pedophilia, and crime.

To get the discussion started I'd like to begin by recommending a book that is fairly unknown (compared to the examples given in the title of this post): The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger. ""John Dolan Vincent is a talented young forger with a proclivity for mathematics and drug addiction. In the face of his impending institutionalization, he continually reinvents himself to escape the legal and mental health authorities and to save himself from a life of incarceration. ...""

8dzxw9,I thought that Fight Club would be underwhelming because I was already familiar with the twist.(Discussion),"Hey y'all,

So I decided to pick up this book because Chuck Palahniuk is one of my favorite authors of all time. However, I didn't read Fight Club because I already seen the movie and thought to myself ""I already know the twist so this isn't going to surprise me when it comes"".

Oddly enough it doesn't ruin the experience. Mr. Palahniuk leaves enough hits and clues that make it interesting. You can see it coming but it's nice to see the bread crumbs y'know? Plus while I was reading, I couldn't help but read it in Edward Norton's monotone voice and when Tyler started talking, it was Brad Pitt.

The writing style is different to say, but it's unique. I like whole Mr. Palahniuk plays with time, he's not that best at description (which would change much latter down the road) but the world is immersive.

I guess my only gripe is the ending, without spoiling anything...the movie did do the ending better. But that's just me.

2ryhyf,A passage from Fight Club that I don't understand...maybe you can help me with it.,"Okay this is on page 42, and it's the part where his luggage gets held because of his vibrating shaver and he's talking about how 9 times out of ten it's a vibrating dildo:

*It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. Use the indefinite article.*

*A dildo.*

*Never your dildo.*

***Never, ever say the dildo accidentally turned itself on.***

***A dildo activated itself and created an emergency situation that required evacuating your baggage.***

The parts in bold are what I don't get. Why would they ""never, ever"" want to say that the dildo accidentally turned itself on, and instead say that it ""activated itself""? That seems like exactly the same thing. Why would it be embarrassing to the owner of the dildo that it accidentally turned itself on? How is that any less embarrassing or less private than saying it activated itself?

once all the men knew about fight club - they dropped the talk and cry club and joined fight club - because that's what they really needed. a place where they could go, and 'for 10 minutes, he was God'.

the implications of this stretch further the more i think about it...

zd9uk,"After reading ""The Communist Manifesto"", I have come to the conclusion that the book ""Fight Club"" is perhaps one of the most socialist books around. What do you guys think?","As I have said, I believe that the book/movie ""Fight Club"" was very socialist. 

Tyler exploited peoples (including himself) unhappiness with material items and the middle class in order to reform them. Karl Marx touched on this idea in his theory of ""Man's alienation"" where he describes removing two things that function naturally and placing something in between them (source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx's_theory_of_alienation). This can be anything really but in ""Fight Club"" it was possessions. Tyler seems to believe heavily in this, as it is referred to many, many times. 
Tyler uses the angry, over worked, little paid middle class to effect the system. He goes on to release everyone from their debts so that they may live a little more freely. This is my reasoning so far. Anyone agree/disagree?

364qig,The Judge: Blood Meridian analysis. (spoilers for Blood Meridian and Moby-Dick as well as potential spoilers for Watchmen and Fight Club),"Moby-Dick. Possibly the only the book able to be compared to Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy's 1985 anti-western masterpiece.
Both deal with the ideas of obsession, compulsion, and ultimately the purpose of man. This is where we get our first and biggest allusion between the two, the novels antagonist.

Judge Holden is a seven foot tall albino, Moby Dick is a (can't recall the exact size) sperm whale that is larger than other whales and also white. Both seem to represent compulsion. But whereas Moby Dick incites compulsion in Captain Ahab, the Judge is the physical embodiment of compulsion and acting upon ones own urgencies. In the end of Moby-Dick, the Whale destroys the Pequod, in the same way that Judge Holden causes the deconstruction of the Glanton gang.

Next up is the ending. What exactly is the fate of the Kid? Well, really, it doesn't matter. The point is that whatever assumption you made, is probably worse than what McCarthy could have written. For example, in my view it seems that the Judge sodomizes the Kid. It's representive of the degradation of ones spirit, during this time period, homoeroticism is the biggest challenge on one's masculinity. Others claim that the Judge kills him. The point here is that no matter what happened, it only proves the enter point of the novel: man is inherently evil.

This leads us into the themes of violence. The only thing that most people take away from Blood Meridian is that the violence is purposeless. It represents nothing more than man's desire to see blood and that ""war is God"". The Judge is representive of man's inherent evil and that only the most knowledgeable can shed the most blood. The Judge creates within the Glanton Gang enjoyment for pillaging. It's obvious that the members are already of a more sordid nature but it seems as though the Judge creates enjoyment within them and eventually himself.

Then comes the Kid. And the Kid isn't so easily swayed. McCarthy says ""he is oddly innocent behind the scars [sic]"" implying that the Kid represents everlasting good and the need for good to triumph over evil.

But guess what? That's bullshit. The Judge makes sure of that. The Judge is neither man nor beast. He a concept that exists through time. The Judge is basically what Thomas Hobbes theorized mankind to be. Fucked up.
The Judge doesn't qualify under any specific margin of classification other than to say he has very antagonistic qualities but this is not to say he is the antagonist. Much like Ozymandias from Alan Moore's Watchmen, evil actions do not necessarily equate to evilness in general. However, where Ozymandias uses violence to create a lie to hold together peace, McCarthy and the Judge use it as a raw truth. A slap in the face. The violence is neither dry nor exciting. It simply is. Where Tyler Durden claimed that self-destruction is key to enlightment, the Judge assesses that the purpose of man is to destroy themselves and the things around them in order grasp at enlightment.

Why exactly does it matter? Well, it doesn't. And that's whole point of Blood Meridian. It's nihilism at it's finest. Blood Meridian simply cannot be defined same as humanities longings for immortality cannot be justified save what we chose to impose. What is he the Judge of? He is the Judge of everything and in that becomes an idealistic Godlike figure. Whether he is Satan, God, or man is something I don't think anybody knows for sure.

So again, Moby Dick, that big ass whale. The own that drives Captain Ahab looney. Is he too an embodiment of man? Yes. And no. He is the physical personification of lust, desire, and longing, he creates within Ahab an animalistic urge to kill and eventual purposelessness and compulsion. Just like the Judge would later claim all men are born to do.

Is he right? Well, I'll let you be the Judge of that.

Tl;dr: The Judge embodies nihilism and man's urge to be remembered regardless of their pointless existance. The Judge is an idea that spans all of time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/364qig/the_judge_blood_meridian_analysis_spoilers_for/,2015-05-16 03:07:33,0,9,books

8y98t9,Just the best scene in the Odyssey...the fight with Irus.,"From A.T. Murray's translation: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D18

I have always loved this scene.  There is just so much about it that is entertaining.  Odysseus takes off his beggar clothes and is just ripped, which is some WWF level showmanship.  

Then he just rocks Irus in a scene straight out of Fight Club, and the taunt at the end is classic.  Great stuff.

Odysseus girded his rags about his loins and showed his thighs, comely and great, and his broad shoulders came to view, and his chest and mighty arms. And Athena [70] drew nigh and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people. Then all the wooers marvelled exceedingly, and thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor: ‚ÄúRight soon shall Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own bringing, such a thigh does yon old man show from beneath his rags.‚Äù [75] So they spoke, and the mind of Irus was miserably shaken; yet even so the serving men girded him, and led him out perforce all filled with dread, and his flesh trembled on his limbs. Then Antinous rated him and spoke, and addressed him: ‚ÄúBetter were it now, thou braggart, that thou wert not living, nor hadst ever been born, [80] if thou quailest and art so terribly afraid of this fellow‚Äîa man that is old and overcome by the woe that has come upon him. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. If this fellow conquers thee and proves the better man, I will fling thee into a black ship and send thee to the mainland [85] to King Echetus, the maimer of all men, who will cut off thy nose and ears with the pitiless bronze, and will draw forth thy vitals and give them raw to dogs to rend.‚Äù So he spoke, and thereat yet greater trembling seized the other's limbs, and they led him into the ring and both men put up their hands. [90] Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was divided in mind whether he should strike him so that life should leave him even there as he fell, or whether he should deal him a light blow and stretch him on the earth. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course, to deal him a light blow, that the Achaeans might not take note of him. [95] Then verily, when they had put up their hands, Irus let drive at the right shoulder, but Odysseus smote him on the neck beneath the ear and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet. But the lordly wooers [100] raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter. Then Odysseus seized him by the foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway until he came to the court and the gates of the portico. And he set him down and leaned him against the wall of the court, and thrust his staff into his hand and spoke, and addressed him with winged words: [105] ‚ÄúSit there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and do not thou be lord of strangers and beggars, miserable that thou art, lest haply thou meet with some worse thing to profit withal.‚Äù ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8y98t9/just_the_best_scene_in_the_odysseythe_fight_with/,2018-07-12 12:15:47,12,10,books
