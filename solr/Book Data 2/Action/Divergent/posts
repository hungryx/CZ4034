nllbpg,Divergent is one of the worst books I’ve ever read,"It sucks. The plot in the first book makes absolutely no sense. Why do humans only have one emotion now? Why does it matter if you have multiple emotions? How did the world get to the state it’s in? It feels like a hunger games x Harry Potter ripoff. The sorting of different “houses”, the “strong” female character who is doing illegal things, it is the worst. None of it makes any sense. Feel free to disagree and argue in the replies, I want to hear what other people think of this “book.” (This is referring to the first book in the series)

181mmgz,Divergent makes no sense,"Divergent is marketed as a Dystopia, but it seems to miss the fundamental part of dystopian literature, which is commentating on an aspect of society that could lead to it’s downfall. It’s supposed to be relevant to our current world to some extent. In The Handmaid’s Tale, misogyny/the dehumanization of women is talked about. In Hunger Games, it’s about our society’s love for violence and war/how easy it is to dehumanize people, which is relevant to today’s society. In 1984 it’s a lack of individual thought.  What exactly is Divergent’s overarching message? How did we get to this world in which people are divided into 4 groups based on one personality trait? 

Idk the series should’ve been marketed as maybe a fantasy or action novel but even then it misses the mark. It just seems very shallow. Like the characters are not well thought out at all, not even Tris and Tobias who are supposed to be since they’re divergent. The writing also isn’t great, it honestly just seems like the series was just a cash grab because YA dystopian literature was popular at the time",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/181mmgz/divergent_makes_no_sense/,2023-11-22 23:08:58,165,513,books
n4uiik,Finally got around to reading Divergent. It's not great.,"I was gifted the books from a family member who was cleaning out their bookshelf. Good lord, this book is not really good and I might just give up on the rest of the trilogy. 

The Faction system is really simplistic, and it doesn't work for me. I don't know what point this dystopia is trying to make. In 1984, communism is the root of the dystopia (EDIT: I know, wrong book. It's actually Animal Farm, and I fucked up). In Handmaid's Tale, it's misogyny. In Hunger Games, it's the glorification of violence and war and class warfare. But in Divergent, the enemy is .... what? Specialization? 

Plus the main character is kinda flat. (EDIT: Not because of her chest, pervs)

Your thoughts?

EDIT: Why are so many people saying ""It's YA, what do you expect?"" That argument makes no sense to me. There are plenty of classic childrens literature and YA titles that don't sacrifice quality for simplicity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n4uiik/finally_got_around_to_reading_divergent_its_not/,2021-05-04 17:45:22,208,700,books
18exitu,Divergent,"The Divergent Series is by far one of the best series for dystopian lovers. But I would love to hear feed back on which book was the best and why each person thought this!

For me, Four, the prequel, was the best book Veronica Roth wrote in the Divergent series. It's from the perspective of Tobias for those who have read the books but not the prequel and was Roth's original work for this series, though she ended up writing from a different perspective. It's my favorite partially because I just love Four, but also because of the 1000+ parallels between Tobias's life and the wisdom he imparts on Tris, as well as his story of growth! It's amazing!

fx7ysn,"I'm Veronica Roth, author of the Divergent series and various other science-fiction ＆ fantasy stories. My new book Chosen Ones is out now, AMA","I wrote the Divergent Series of dystopian YA books (Divergent, Insurgent, and Allegiant), which have sold ~42 million copies worldwide, and have been adapted into three major motion pictures starring Shailene Woodley. I am also the author of a space fantasy series (Carve the Mark, The Fates Divide), a collection of sci-fi short stories called The End and Other Beginnings, and assorted other short fiction, most recently a new piece called 'The Least of These' that you can find in Lightspeed Magazine. My new book, Chosen Ones, came out yesterday. It's my first book for adult readers, about a group of people who saved the world when they were younger from a ""dark lord"" figure known as the Dark One-- and now it's ten years later, they're the most famous people on Earth, and they're still dealing with the psychological impact of their adolescent trauma. Only it turns out their story isn't quite finished yet, as you might imagine. 
 
I cancelled a book tour because of the pandemic, but I'm doing a series of livestream events this week with other science fiction and fantasy authors, in cooperation with some independent bookstores who need our support during this tough time!

nc8wfc,"Books have target audiences too! If you read a YA book for teenagers and hate it it's not because the book is bad, it's because it's not meant for you (Eragon, Divergent, Artemis Fowl, etc.)","As a book lover I've lurked this sub for awhile now and people really should check what age group the book was written for before reading them or making posts about how bad they are. Eragon, Cirque De Freak, Artimis Fowl, Divergent, Twilight, the list goes on and on. These books are meant for Young Adults and Teenagers. It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.

They aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on. Books have demographics just as much as TV and movies. An adult doesn't go to see the Wiggles and expect to have a good time (although they are surprisingly enjoyable) or critique their children's Saturday cartoons or their teenager's cringe  werewolf romance drama show for being simplistic and predicable. It's great to them because it's for them. It's crap to you because you're never expected to watch it anyway. That's okay. There's really no need to tear those things apart in a reddit post.

Obviously there will be some adults who will still love YA books, shows, and movies. If that's you, please keep recommending them to people. It's not your fault if someone neglects to notice the YA or TV14 tag and ends up hating it.

Edit: I'm not saying ""you're not the target audience"" is an end all excuse so you can never say something is bad. Some books are indesputably bad. I believe that if you hold an opinion that contradicts what is widely accepted as true, then it's probably more about your personal preference than something being inherently bad. For instance, I hate Avengers movies and think they are full of crudely written dialogue and oversized casts where no character actually matters. Obviously the world disagrees with that opinion. I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.


Edit 2: The comments are pretty fun you should check them out. Admittedly most of them say I'm wrong and an idiot lol. But the others are filled with people saying a book is horrible and then others saying the same book is great. The only constant is that Divergent and Eragon seem to be hated by almost everyone, it's like a 9/1 ratio. Artemis Fowl is nearly 50/50 which is cool. Take a look and find other people opinions, there are some gems in there.

7p4khi,Divergent is so poorly written,"I have just read this triology and the writing is bad. I’m not saying this only because it is a teen book, I actually enjoyed Harry Potter and Hunger Games. The third book is the worst of them.
There are some plot holes and the characters are too awkward and overall don’t have a good development. The dialogues are ok at best and the story drags out too much.
In the third book sometimes I couldn’t even tell who was the narrator, Veronica Roth gave the same “voice” for both Tris and Four, that’s bad writing. And the fourth book is almost pointless.

I don't get it. Why does Sanderson hold a position above titles like these when other series' get severe criticism? These two were just examples; there are other series like this, as well.

hmy5xv,Anyone else HATE the divergent series?,"Honestly divergent is one of those rare books where I would say the movie was better.

I don’t know if it’s just me but I’m the books Tris is so reliant on four it’s annoying. I feel like I’m the movie they gave her a completely different personality and basically just kept the world they were in the same.

I’m mad I wasted my time reading those books, and I can’t believe how terrible they were written. 

Even the plot kind of sucks in my opinion. Liek the factions and stuff. I don’t see how it really says anything, and it doesn’t leave any impression. The hunger games on the other hand I thought had a lot to say about society and it was just and incredible series. For the record, the plot wasn’t the fatal flaw, and if it were written by someone better I’m sure it could’ve been a really impressive series.

This book was horrible. There's little positive I could say about it. It presents a completely unrealistic, and therefore uninteresting world. Every character is unidentifiable, and entirely 2 deminsional (even necessarily 2d based on the world created).
The whole time reading, I was just waiting for some sort of break through from the ridiculous society they live in or some explanation on how the world really works, or find out that the whole city is in some sort of dome. An M. Shamalan ending was the only thing that could have brought this book together, but it never came.

9cwgyk,Divergent plot hole and inconsistency,"I just reread Divergent and just started rereading Insurgent. I noticed two things that don't really make sense and perhaps y'all would like to discuss it and maybe even clarify it for me. 

FIY: I have not read Allegiant at all yet, so please no spoilers regarding that book. 

So... The first plot hole is a big one: 

[Spoiler and Divergent Plot Hole](#s ""The fear landscape is tailored to force Dauntless to face their own individual fears, so how come in Tris's landscape for her final evaluation she doesn't have to face being caught as a Divergent? Wouldn't that be a massive and important fear of hers? At this point she already knows that Divergents are being hunted, and she knows that Erudite are plotting a war. Shouldn't her fear landscape be an instant giveaway?"")

And then there is this simple inconsistency:

[Spoiler and Insurgent Inconsistency](#s ""In Divergent it is explained that Four's mother died in childbirth isn't it? But in Insurgent, on page 12, Tris speaks of Four when she says 'He lost his mother when he was young. I don't remember how she dies, just that we attended her funeral'. So... what's up with that?"") 

Sorry if the spoiler tags didn't work. I am new to reddit and using mobile. 

Anyone care to discuss these two things? 

EDIT: The spoiler tags lead to a blank page so I am explaining them here. SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON: 

1- The fear landscape is tailored to force Dauntless to face their own individual fears, so how come in Tris's landscape for her final evaluation she doesn't have to face being caught as a Divergent? Wouldn't that be a massive and important fear of hers? At this point she already knows that Divergents are being hunted, and she knows that Erudite are plotting a war. Shouldn't her fear landscape be an instant giveaway?

2262bc,"I Just Finished Divergent, and All I've Got to Say is Meh...","So after finally succuming to peer pressure and read Divergent, all I got from the experience was a resounding meh. It kept me excited with the plot, (till the end, where all of the s**t hits the fan) and I did enjoy it, but there was that voice in the back of my head saying how bad it all was. I mean, it's a YA dystopian future thriller with female protagonist that is different from everyone else. How original... 

Tris, our strong independent woman for this book, is basically Katniss from the Hunger Games plopped into a ruined Chicago. The love interest that the book shoves at us, Four/Tobias also has some ""interesting"" similarities to Gale, but his aren't quite as prominent as Tris. The rest of the characters are mostly solid, though some of the antagonists are only a few steps away from a saturday morning cartoon villain. *cough* Eric *cough*

Despite those flaws though, I was enjoying Divergent. It was well paced and the plot kept me guessing and engaged. That ending though... S**t hits the fan, and I don't really mean that in a good way. The bad guys take over far, far too easily and their evil plot just pops out of nowhere in the form of neck implants with mind control. I know that they had been planning this years, but I felt like we should have heard about this plan or at least the idea of the chips sooner than paragraphs before the evil plan begins.

Really though, Divergent isn't bad. I did enjoy the plot, till everything fell apart at the end. The characters weren't great, but they weren't bad. The setting was generic, but the idea of factions was somewhat interesting, and the villains were kind of awful. Overall, a massive meh. Maybe my friends had overhyped Divergent to me, but I don't see what makes this so good, or why it deserves a movie. I hope the movie will be better, (I'm getting dragged to that tomorrow) because I don't think I have another meh to spare after the book. :/

The only reason I'm asking for the perspective of someone who saw the movies first instead of reading the books is because I think if you read the books first you probably see the movies a lot differently.

Why after 2 7/8 books, after I got so attached to Tris and Four, after they survived countless attacks, after building their relationship... did Tris have to die? I hate this! I am definitely a happy ending type reader. I really enjoyed the Shadowhunter series... the Night Angel trilogy was bittersweet at the end but nothing like the heroine and main character dying so close to having a happy ending!!! 

I literally went on Google and found out that many shared my opinion. I wanted to finally watch the movies but now I don't want to!

1k44b2,I can't decide between Divergent and Legend.,"I'm almost done with the Hunger Games trilogy and stumbled upon a thread asking for recommendations similar to HG trilogy and both Divergent (Veronica Roth) and Legend (Marie Lu) came up. I looked up both books on Wikipedia and Divergent had a more informative page and Legend's was scarce on info so I'd love to know more about it, from redditors.

They both look right up my ally (dystopian setting, possible fierce heroin, action, etc) but I can't decide which series to tackle first.

I'd appreciate it if someone were to help me out here :)

I want to know which one has more action, what kind of action (magic, simple weapons (bow and arrows, swords), close physical combat etc), is it third person or first person (present tense or past tense?) and which has an all around better protagonist.

1p7zbd,Allegiant: Is anyone else hating it so far? (x-post /r/divergent),"I'm about 70 pages in so far and I am really disappointed in this book. The first two in the series seemed to focus mostly on the story and this unique world Veronica Roth has created, but Allegiant appears to be all about Tris and Four and their relationship. I can't stand it. The book is reading like 50 Shades of Gray for Teens. Every chapter I just cringe more and more as Roth goes on about how the characters long for each other's touch, breath, and so on. She is focusing on something completely common and mundane in a world where she can make anything happen. So far I'm incredibly disappointed and I don't know if I'll be able to even finish Allegiant.

tl;dr Allegiant is 90% 50 Shades of Gray featuring Tris and Four and 10% actual story.


As a side note, the first two books are listed as belonging to the science fiction genre and Allegiant is listed as romance. Disappointed. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p7zbd/allegiant_is_anyone_else_hating_it_so_far_xpost/,2013-10-25 21:46:28,13,0,books

6fz9xm,"Just finished Allegiant, the final book in the Divergent trilogy. My thoughts below... [Spoilers]","First off, I loved this trilogy.  Took me a minute to get into at first, cuz I had seen the first movie so all of the suspense in the first book was absent since I already knew what was going to happen.  But as I dived further and further into it, I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters.

&nbsp;

The big reveal at the end of Insurgent and it's explanation of the dystopian world around Chicago in the beginning of Allegiant was a bit of a stretch, but I found it fit very well with the overall narrative and theme of the series.  Especially given that in each book the main characters are fighting against some type of government control/indoctrination.

&nbsp;

[Major Spoiler!]

&nbsp;

[Spoiler](#s ""The death of Tris hit me hard.  Really, really hard.  Didn't see it coming, and the author handled it exceptionally well.  Glad she didn't volunteer at first, glad that she was able to fight off the death serum, and glad that it was a noble sacrifice that meant something.  The first two books were from her perspective.  They were her story.  And in spite of the temptation to make her a Mary Sue, I think that the author did a very good job in making her both a heroic figure and a deeply flawed one at the same time.  And the reconciliation with Tobias/Four right before she dies makes it hurt so much more.  They worked through their problems.  They healed their relationship and made it stronger.  They were finally able to bridge the gap between them and be together for the long haul.  And then she dies.  I cried.  I raged.  It was beautiful."")

3f1pi7,Veronica Roth's Divergent Series - Faction Playlist from Insurgent,"I've read the first two books of the Divergent Series, so please mark any spoilers from Allegiant! 

Veronica Roth constructed a playlist for each faction and the factionless which she listed at the back of the second book, Insurgent. Personally, I like it a lot, partly because a lot of it is music I already know/like but I also think most of it is really fitting! [I made up the playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOks2HArHf0&list=PLLeTzgkdNkcLZo2MMba4mj1DJXE5h41Y3) in the order listed below, for anyone who would like to listen through. 

The quoted text is Veronica's explanation with the playlist.


**Dauntless** 

* Glory and Gore - Lorde
* Hysteria - Muse
* Help I'm Alive - Metric

>Dauntless songs capture both the faction's bravado (and occasional cockiness!) as well as their commitment to taking chances, facing difficulty, and living without regret.

**Amity** 

* No Envy, No Fear - Joshua Radin
* One Voice - The Wailin' Jennys
* Charlie Boy - The Lumineers

>These songs approach the Amity lifestyle from a few different angles - their compassion for each other, for one; their love of group decision-making and harmony, for another; and finally, their strong belief in pacifism. 

**Abnegation** 

* Holocene - Bon Iver
* My Hero - Foo Fighters
* Goodbye, I - mewithoutYou

>Abnegation is the trickiest faction to create a playlist for, probably because they would consider recreational music-listening to be self-indulgent! But these songs assert the smallness of the self and praise ordinariness. 

**Candor** 

* Madder Red - Yeasayer
* Wake Up - Arcade Fire
* Two Points for Honesty - Guster

>The Candor embrace honesty even when it's abrasive - they love the hard truth rather than the easy lie. These songs present Candor self-awareness, revelations about life, and harsh but clear communication with others, in turn.

**Erudite** 

* Everything in Its Right Place - Radiohead
* Helplessness Blues - Fleet Foxes
* 2-1 - Imogen Heap

>There are many facets to the Erudite life: a love of order (as expressed in the first song); an understanding that the individual is both essential to a group's functioning yet not more important than the group (the second song); and a sense of wonder about all that is to be known about the universe, and how that wonder creates a thirst for knowledge (the third song, and parts of the second).

**Factionless** 

* Uprising - Muse
* I Want to Break Free - Queen
* Escape - Thirty Seconds to Mars

>The factionless come from diverse backgrounds, but one thing unifies them above all: rebellion. These are people who don't want to be controlled anymore, who want to be more than their label, and who desire freedom above all else. 

Have you read the Divergent Series? What do you think of the music she chose? Do you have any song suggestions for any of the factions or factionless? 

---------------
* I don't completely understand the song Goodbye, I. ""She couldn't help but sing!"" and ""Let's stand completely still"" seem to contradict themselves, with only the latter making sense with Abnegation. The title is fitting, of course, but I'm just not sure what the song means. Does anyone have an idea? 


* I'm confused by her choice of Madder Red for Candor. The lines 
""Never gave a thought to an honorable living; always had sense enough to lie. It's getting hard to keep pretending I'm worth your time"" are surely not what Candor is about. While the song does deal with how being dishonest drove two people apart, the ""I"" of the song clearly doesn't mind lying and I would be hard-pressed to believe that Candor would be okay with the song representing them. 

* I think [Secrets by Mary Lambert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqqV50zaAc) is also a fitting song for Candor. She expresses that hiding your secrets makes you into another person (dishonesty) but also the reveal of her secrets is much like Candor initiation. 

* While Uprising and Escape are definitely serious songs about rebellion, I think I Want To Break Free is much more light-hearted, which I think is nice. The factionless (in the first two books) appear to be pretty hostile and maybe kind of lost, but Tris even talks about her personal revelation that the factionless are still people and still a community. Giving them a more fun song, I think, helps represent that - that they are still trying to be happy.
