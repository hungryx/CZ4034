x3mbfp,"Dude, keep goong with Terry Pratchett's ""Death saga"". The next books are, in order, Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time. 

I like every Terry Pratchett book I have read so far but, gotta be honest, the later books tend to be better, and Mort was one of the earliest. The character Death is spectacular.",cynicalpeach,2022-09-02 00:33:28

One of my favorite quotes ever. 
Also the line about the future coming at Mort like a flamethrower in a tunnel, but I can't exactly remember it. Such a good book. I tried to read Hogfather but couldn't get into it as much but I'll try again. I will read them all.

8fi1qy,"> sooooo many people cant be wrong?

So many people can in fact be wrong on what is right for you. 

I love the Discworld series, and Mort in particular, but I don't think it is right for everyone. The target audience is adults, although some books (Tiffany Aching series) are aimed towards teens. 

The fact that you are not a fantasy reader is probably why you aren't enjoying the books. I've read a fair amount of fantasy and a large part of the reason I enjoy the Discworld series is because Pratchett makes a lot of jokes about Fantasy book tropes. Many of the characters are satirized versions of the quintessential heroes in Fantasy books. Some, if not most, of the jokes are hard to catch if you aren't familiar with the average Fantasy book. So I definitely think not being a Fantasy reading is working against you when reading this series.  

The books are also a certain kind of humor that isn't for everyone and it might not be for you. If you do want to try Pratchett again, I would recommend reading [Good Omens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12067.Good_Omens) which he wrote with Neil Gaiman. ",leowr,2018-04-28 06:07:19
8fi1qy,"Mort and most of the other early books are pretty weak. I'd start with Guards! Guards! or Witches Abroad. Or Reaper Man, but if you didn't get into Mort at all...",raevnos,2018-04-28 07:11:43
8fi1qy,"Mort in particular is a very teen focused book, I think, but it also suffers from his earlier books penchant for broad comedy which can be a little cringeworthy.

I do think his later books are better. They are a lot hotter on the psychology of the characters, even if he does occasionally airdrop in a cardboard cutout or two for drama. They become less pedantic in trying to tell you the rules of the world and let the characters occupy a bit more space. You don't even have to get that much later - Reaper Man is a very human and touching book.

Obviously you shouldn't bother if it's really not for you. I think Pratchett's virtues are often overstated, but if you do want to have another crack, my own personal recommendations would be:

*Wyrd Sisters* - Rather in the manner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it might be a bit offputting to jump into, say, one of the Watch/Vimes novels midway through when he'd hit his stride. I think this first Witches book is probably the best start to any of his long running sets of characters. The main characters are quite fully formed and appealing. The riffing on Macbeth provides a lot of good fun; TP is often at his best when he's riffing on something he knows well or has researched well. I like the Witches stories because they have an appealing vein of nastiness to them. Granny Weatherwax is maybe his greatest character.

*The Truth* - One of his later books, which means the writing is a little bit more controlled. Also later on he integrated his politics a bit more and I think that helped give the books a bit more heart. THe main reason I would recommend this is that it's a bit of a one-off, although plenty of regular characters make appearances. I think that makes it a good choice for dipping your toe in to the later stuff without having to get a degree in discworldology.

*Unseen Academicals* - Again, a bit of a one off. I think this one might be a risky pick, because I think he's less at home trying to describe working class culture, but I think it's a very valiant and quite sympathetic attempt to understand and describe something that he seems more naturally inclined to dislike.

*Men At Arms* - The second of the Vimes/Watch novels. I don't think I'd jump in later, but you could probably skip the first one, which is a bit more old school in its humour, and the characters a re a little more crudely drawn. This is more consistent with the characters as they are later in the series. It's probably the only Watch book that has an actual, honest to goodness murder mystery at its heart, although it is a long way from really working as a whodunit.

It's tricky though. Really, it's the characters that make the discworld, and although I think there are genuinely excellent books in the series, they are supported by a nostalgia for characters who are established over an umber of maybe not so great novels.

A little background on me in case it helps - I'm 29, I do have a lot of nostalgia for the discworld books as I've been reading them since I picked up Equal Rites when I was about 9. I'm a fantasy fan but not enough of one for the broad element of parody to do much for me. I admire LOTR more than I love it, and although I enjoyed Hitchhiker's as a teen, I've never enjoyed it as an adult because I find the humour and general sneering air of superiority of the narrator's voice to be very offputting.",thomasnash,2018-04-28 22:47:57
8fi1qy,"I think Mort is the best of them. If you don’t like this, you may as well leave Pratchett alone.

And there’s nothing wrong with either loving it or being bored by it. Humour is so personal, and Pratchett’s books are nothing without their humour.",SnoopyLupus,2018-04-28 22:09:36
8fi1qy,"I have not read Mort, honestly. But my favorite Discworld books tend to be from the mid 90s to the mid 2000s. You don't have to read them in order, as I didn't.",ibmiller,2018-04-29 01:32:25
8fi1qy,"Let them go. After *Mort*, Pratchett doesn't really go through any more radical development phases - the following books are slight improvements upon one another, never really changing the basic ingredients.

> Or is it also that others read these books earlier in age?

Bingo. I read them all in my late teens and loved all up until *Going Postal*. 10 years later, there's only a handful that feel like they've aged well.",,2018-04-28 12:26:37
8fi1qy,"Ok, who told you not to start with Color of Magic?  That's one of the best Discworld books. Mort was also great. Rincewind and Death are amazing characters, although Commander Vimes of the Watch is my personal favorite of the series. If you don't like Mort or Color of Magic, you won't like the rest of the series.",BobBobuliss,2018-04-28 07:05:02
8fi1qy,"I happen not at all to be a fantasy reader and I love Discworld- but mostly the ones where they stop being about fantasy tropes: the (later) Watch books, the Death books besides Mort, most of the mid-late standalones. They get into a sort of realism that just happens to be in another world, which is awesome.      
To the OP, I would recommend either going on to Soul Music (which continues on from Mort but has a totally different tone) or trying one of the more realism-based standalones, like Small Gods or The Truth (which is much later in the series but doesn't have very many spoilers). I'd say Reaper Man, which is technically probably the book between Mort and Soul Music, but it has one kind of weird subplot that I don't think is a good idea for people who aren't sure about Discworld yet.

8fi1qy,"You'll find a lot of people to disagree with you, especially on your very first point. Mort is where it starts to get good, but it's by no means the best book- to me, it's probably at the median. I mean, forget about Night Watch, Small Gods, Maskerade, and whatnot- I think all of the other Death-centric books, from Reaper Man to Thief of Time, are better than Mort (mostly because it's a fantastic subseries).

Considering that the hourglass was flipped, it is not unrealistic to assume that the life reverses for an individual going back to front!  

Anyways, my comment was more along the lines of what if that was the case.. where the time jump resulted in the story reversing from the end and meeting in the middle when the hourglass was flipped instead of an option for Mort to just write the chapters skipped over?  

Just a view. I loved the book as well! :))",goobuddy,2020-10-15 17:21:45
