x3mbfp,Mort is worth the hype.,"I finished Mort by Terry Pratchett yesterday and wow, that book is a straight up masterpiece. 

I had previously read Guards, Guards (which was stellar), The Color of Magic (alright), The Light Fantastic (pretty good), and Equal Rites (great). All those books were charming fun, and relatively light-hearted. I am a chronically anxious guy and these novels are like drinking a warm tea near a fire during a blizzard, and I love them for that.

There is a real difference with Mort though, and I guess it has to do with how I have been living recently. This has been the most difficult year mentally in my entire life, and a lot of it has been spurned on by the COVID pandemic and the current crisis around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Long story short, I have been confronting my mortality in a way I never thought I would be. I have been horrified of death and of dying this whole year. Thankfully I have the means and support to get therapy, but it has still been a daily struggle to fight the latent anxiety and fear I have felt this whole year.

With Mort, Pratchett created such a relatable, honest, and human personification of Death that has really comforted me. Death isn't the force trying to end your life, it just does when it is time. Death is something that waits for all of us and as cold and distant as Mort's Death can be, he is also kind. 

In Mort, Pratchett explores death in a way I don't think many authors do. Death isn't evil or good, it just is. Learning about Pratchett's outlook on death from this book has helped me understand and come to grips with it more in my own life.

This book is chock-full of quotable and hilarious moments that could carry it for comedy lovers. It also has its moments of real and tender emotion. 

Overall, this is a book I think everyone should read. I understand others may not connect exactly the way I have with the book and that's alright, there is an entire universe of discworld novels to choose from and connect with. I just think that Mort is a very special novel in a pantheon of special novels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x3mbfp/mort_is_worth_the_hype/,2022-09-01 23:45:04,122,1108,books
dqqke2,Mort by Terry Pratchett,"This is my first discworld book

My opinions on this book is very strange. 

The positives:

I loved the world, I loved Death, I loved the humor (which is a bit strange for me, because I'm not a huge fan of absurdist books I've read in the past)

My main problem was the plot. I couldn't really get into it. My main drive to keep reading was whenever Death was on the page I would laugh my ass off, but I never found the story to be very captivating. It was just kind of meh. I liked it up to the point where he saves the princess and then the plot just was a bit bland for my tastes. I liked just reading death's day to day, learning that he has a horse named Binky, all the stuff like that. I'm gonna keep reading discworld, my next is gonna be Guards! Guards! And I'm looking forward to that one. Maybe it'll be more in line with my tastes. I'm sure that it gets better since this is very early on in a 40 book series.

Overall, I liked, but didn't love Mort. It was charming, funny, whimsical, but with a lacking plot for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dqqke2/mort_by_terry_pratchett/,2019-11-02 21:13:12,7,10,books
6b0jxb,Any love for Mort(e)?,"Just curious. No one I know has read it, but I found Mort(e) by Robert Repino to be appropriate amounts of engrossing, heartbreaking, and weird. I bring this up because the second novel in the series, D'Arc, came out and I can't find any reviews or anyone talking about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6b0jxb/any_love_for_morte/,2017-05-13 22:19:33,9,6,books
8fi1qy,"I was underwhelmed by Mort, my first Discworld book. Should I continue on?","Hi! I have been seeing the high praise for the Discworld Series and finally thought I would give it a go. 

I started with color of magic despite many recommendations not to do so. I lasted around 10 percent before stopping. Not to worry,  i knew not to judge by that experience, and so picked up Mort. 

I just finished reading it today. I am.. underwhelmed. For me it was just an all right book, but i expected to be blown away by it. I must confess that i was kind of bored all the way till 50 percent (!!!), before i felt like it picked up. Before that i was just kind of forcing myself to continue it. 

I also felt that i was reading a novel meant for teens. What is the target audience for the books? Maybe its that factor as well? I'm in my 30s btw.

I dont have any desire right now to read another book of his. Just because i was not wowed. On the other hand, I'm thinking maybe i need to try another since sooooo many people cant be wrong? Or is it also that others read these books earlier in age? And now love it even despite being in their 30s 40s 50s because of that nostalgic feeling? 

So basically I'm here to ask for your advice on what to do next. Thank you!

Just a little background -i am not a fantasy genre reader. I disliked hitchiker's. I loved lord of the rings. I think those are the only fantasy books I've ever read.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8fi1qy/i_was_underwhelmed_by_mort_my_first_discworld/,2018-04-28 05:58:19,23,9,books
jbecyu,Terry Pratchett - Mort (Discworld Series). Anyone else thinks that the non-linearity could be expanded to meet half-way?,"So I was listening to the Mort audiobook (Can't recommend the book-narrator enough!) and I didn't realize that I reached the end of the book (obviously! otherwise this thing wouldn't have entered my mind!) and when the moment arises when death flips Mort's hourglass and suddenly the scene jumps to his marriage with Ysabell and this thought entered in my mind that this is just - AMAZING! The non-linearity at this point and suddenly it's like - Benjamin Button and the narrative would reverse to the middle point.. kinda like - 1-2-3-4-5\~10-9-8-7-6-5! Since the non-linearity is a tangent in the series; I really think this would've been an incredible arc!

Alas, my amazement was short-lived as it was kinda like - 1-2-3-4-5-10! :/ Still an incredible book!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jbecyu/terry_pratchett_mort_discworld_series_anyone_else/,2020-10-15 01:42:09,12,20,books
723isb,[Spoilers] I'm not sure how I feel about Mort (Discworld),"Just yesterday I've finished reading Mort, my fourth book in the series, and at the end I was a bit surprised that I've found a Discworld book that I didn't really enjoy a whole lot.

Where do I begin? The comedy was good and the book started rather well, Death is definitely one of the most fun characters and this book was very much centered around him. When I feel the book started going down hill was roughly in the second half when Mort got into trouble with his DUTY and it was clear that something had to be done about it. What was done was a whole lot of faffing about which didn't seem to do a whole lot since the ending eventually turned out to be literally deus ex machina. I know that endings in Discword always involve something unlikely happening but I feel that this was stretching it a bit.

I wasn't a huge fan of the big dramatic part when Death finally finds out, either. Sure, Mort fucked up big time, but I found it a bit character breaking for Death to go from being patient and rational to completely berserk ruthless. I've reread the page where he flips Mort's hourglass at least half a dozen times and I'm still not sure what made him stop going berserk.

Also I feel like the relationship between Ysabell and Mort was a little bit rushed near the end, but I might have not cared about that too much if rest of the ending was good.

Am I missing something or is this book really not the high point of the series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/723isb/spoilers_im_not_sure_how_i_feel_about_mort/,2017-09-24 06:10:21,5,7,books
5h97bk,Did Jack Mort drop a brick on Jake Chambers' head?,"In Stephen King's Dark Tower series, Jack Mort is known for dropping bricks on the heads of random people.
Jake Chambers, while investigating the rose, suddenly loses consciousness and wakes up to see a brick lying nearby covered in blood. 

*""helpless to stop himself, Jake reached forward. There was no curiosity or terror in this gesture; only a great, inarticulate need to protect the rose.*

*WHEN HE CAME BACK to himself, he was at first only aware that a great deal of time had passed and his head hurt like hell. What happened? Was I mugged? He rolled over and sat up. Another blast of pain went through his head. He raised a hand to his left temple, and his fingers came away sticky with blood. He looked down and saw a brick poking out of the weeds. Its rounded comer was too red. If it had been sharp, I’d probably be dead or in a coma""*

I always assumed that he lost consciousness from being too close to the rose and subsequently banged his head on the brick. But what if Jack Mort saw him from the nearby building and dropped a brick on his head? Perhaps only grazing him. We know that there was a building near enough to the rose that it might be possible.

*""He turned back and after a moment his eyes picked it out, although it was deep in the shadow of a neighbouring building now — a tiny pink shape in the dimness, vulnerable, beautiful, and alone.""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5h97bk/did_jack_mort_drop_a_brick_on_jake_chambers_head/,2016-12-08 20:11:51,6,0,books
2nx46e,[Spoiler] Jack Mort from the Dark Tower Series,"This might seem like a bit of a long shot but Jack Mort's character in the dark tower series has some similarities to Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. I say this because both characters have a major obsession with brand names and style. Of course both of them are serial killers if Patrick Bateman really did kill anyone. I do realize that Bateman isn't a reliable narrator. Does anyone have thoughts about this? 

P.S. I'm not saying that Bret Easton Ellis copied off of Stephen King in anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2nx46e/spoiler_jack_mort_from_the_dark_tower_series/,2014-12-01 06:45:31,0,0,books
2tu3en,Maurice Blanchot - Arret Du Mort (Death Sentence) - impressions,"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233353.Death_Sentence

**Spoilers?**
So, has anyone here read Blanchot's *Death Sentence*? 
I have read it some time ago and will propably return to it soon. For a book of this size I think it speaks volumes. It translates the topic of Blanchot's choosing so well it's haunting. Due to the brilliant construction and narrative it feels more like a look inside a destroyed human soul more than a philosophical novel about mortality, our memory and solitude. It feels like a last resort to purge the soul of the unspeakable through the catharic act of writing and it a way it succeeds but it never really does, does it? It's all just fog and shades, never a conclusion like trying to say some words you just cannot bear to say and instead saying ambigious sentences through a throat that is desperatly trying to sew itself shut. And in the end it doesn't really matter anyway, all of it.
It's also just as beautiful as it's haunting, the methaphores (and the one big methaphore that the book is) are absolutely beautiful as is the foggy atmosphere present throughout the book. It all feels like a dream that correlates with memories of a person still haunted and destroyed by the memories of the past. Like an impressionist painting through which the painter tries to speak about things he cannot bear to say.
**/Spoilers?**

I always wanted to hear thoughts of others on the subject of this book and I find it hard to do so as it's near absolutely inaccesible in my country. So, share your thoughs, I would very much like to hear them.
By the way I belive Lydia Davis did AMAZING translation on this one even though I have not read the original. It's so well put together it almost doesn't feel like a translation. I should propably try reading some of her own works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2tu3en/maurice_blanchot_arret_du_mort_death_sentence/,2015-01-27 12:52:38,0,2,books
