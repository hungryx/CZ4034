m192yz,"In 4th grade, one of our assignments was to write a letter to the author of our favorite book. Naturally, I chose ""The Phantom Tollbooth"", and wrote Norton Juster a letter. A few weeks later, I got a letter from Norton in the mail. It was a generic letter thanking fans for their interest in the book, but he added a sentence or two in his own handwriting to answer a couple of my specific questions, and added his signature. If I remember correctly, I was the only kid in the class to get a response. I was so proud! I still have the letter, and just came across it a few months ago going through some old stuff.

RIP Norton. You touched millions of kids' lives!",willverine,2021-03-09 18:23:01

m192yz,"""The Phantom Tollbooth"" showed me at 9-10 that reading could be fun. I'm 43 and if anyone asks for my favorite book I'll still say this. His contribution to children's literature cannot be overstated. He will be missed.

m192yz,"And the Phantom Tollbooth was illustrated by iconic cartoonist Jules Feiffer.  Wonderful stuff.

Juster was also responsible for another classic, *The Dot and the Line, a romance in lower mathematics,* a charming tale  about a dignified straight line who was hopelessly in love with a dot.  She alas, only had eyes for a wild, unkempt squiggle...

Do look for it.  It's wonderful.

m192yz,"An excerpt of *The Phantom Tollbooth* was part of the anthology textbook for my sixth grade class. I read a page or two of it and was in love with it. I asked my teacher when we'd read it and she said something to the sort of ""oh, we don't read such silly things here."" I remember sneaking pages of the book during her class to read the rest of it. I bought the book at a bookfair and hid it from her so that she wouldn't judge me.

Anyhow, that book was amazing. Totally changed my view on what books could be about. It wasn't about people or places *per se* but abstract concepts like infinity and what exactly does it mean to jump to conclusions.

I still think about that one scene where Milo and friends are tasked with moving sand grain by grain from one pile to another and moving water drop by drop from one area to another. They're comfortable doing so, but eventually they realize that, if they do the math, they'll be there practically forever. An apt metaphor for many things in life.",desantoos,2021-03-10 01:31:56

It's the sort of thing that is polarizing: you either appreciate it or you think it's ridiculous- like the music of Tom Waits or the KLF.

m192yz,"I had a severe problem learning how to read in elementary school. I am autistic  can't do any math whatsoever, and it started to look like I might never be able to read either, but I eventually did pick it up and by middle school I was reading books made for adults. But my all time favorite book I kept coming back to was one a teacher gave me during that difficult time, and it was The Phantom Tollbooth.

Even now, as a 31 year old woman, I still have that copy, but it's been falling apart for years. A few years ago, when my girlfriend and I were living in Texas, I dragged her to every had bookstore we could find to track down a not so ravaged copy, and thankfully we eventually managed to. I have read this book every year since I was introduced to it, and I would even go so far as to say that it likely had a huge hand and impact on making me into the artist and author I myself am today. The level of wordplay and the ingenuity of concepts was, and still is quite frankly, unrivaled, especially in children's literature.

So thanks Mr. Juster for giving us one fantastic, incredible piece of work that has  likely inspired countless millions. You made a very scared and somewhat mentally challenged little girl a happier person, which meant the world to me considering my adolescence was nothing short of a nightmare.

One of my good friends is a student from China at my university. He wanted to read a book to understand the American way of life and to improve his english. So I gave him ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" A couple of weeks later, I asked him if he liked it. He told me that it was too difficult for him to read, he didn't understand most of the words. 

So I gave him ""The Phantom Tollbooth,"" thinking it was a book written in simple english that wouldn't insult the intelligence of a Ph.D physics student. A couple of days later he was quoting from it.",Qrkchrm,2011-04-12 06:35:09
