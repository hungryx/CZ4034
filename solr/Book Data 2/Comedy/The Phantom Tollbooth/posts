1uslkg,I just finished The Phantom Tollbooth. That book is incredibly powerful. I'll admit that I teared up at the end.,"This passage hit me hard:

""It's time to go now,"" said Reason, ""for there is much to do."" And, as she 

spoke, Milo suddenly remembered his home. He wanted very much to go 

back, yet somehow he could not bear the thought of leaving.

""And so you must say good-by,"" said Rhyme, patting him gently on the 

cheek.

""To everyone?"" said Milo unhappily. He looked around slowly at all the 

friends he'd made, and he looked very hard so as not to forget any of 

them for even an instant. But mostly he looked at Tock and the Humbug, 

with whom he had shared so much – the perils, the dangers, the fears, 

and, best of all, the victory. Never had anyone had two more steadfast 

companions.

""Can't you both come with me?"" he asked, knowing the answer as he said 

it.

""I'm afraid not, old man,"" replied the bug. ""I'd like, to, but I've arranged 

a lecture tour which will keep me occupied for years.""

""And they do need a watchdog here,"" barked Tock sadly.

Milo embraced the bug who, in his most typical fashion, was heard to 

mumble gruffly, ""BAH,"" but whose damp eyes told quite a different story. 

Then the boy threw his arms around Tock's neck and, for just a moment, 

held on very tightly.

""Thank you for everything you've taught me,"" said Milo to everybody as a 

tear rolled down his cheek.

""And thank you for what you've taught us,"" said the king – and, as he 

clapped his hands, the little car was brought forward, polished like new.

Milo got in and, with one last look, started down the road, with everyone 

waving him on.

as43js,Phantom Toll Booth is better than Oh the Places you'll Go,"Seuss's 'Oh the Places You'll Go' seems to be that book adults keep buying each other to remind ourselves of that youthful admiration of adventure. But I argue The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster has much more to offer. Published in 1961 and marketed as a children's book about adventure, this story is *packed with fantastical views of the world that will make you reevaluate your own. Some of you may have read it as a child, some may have no idea what I am talking about. But everyone should (re)read this as an adult. It won't take long to read.

I will share the parts that jumped out at me as an adult. Please do the same if you have read it recently. And let me know if you agree?

Oh.. and definitely mention your favorite location he visits. Me... I have spent too much time in Duldroms I think. 

""So many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible""

""The most important reason for going from one place to another is to see what's in between""

""Perhaps someday you can have one city as easy to see as Illusions and as hard to forget as Reality,"" 

""Well, since you got here by not thinking, it seems reasonable to expect that, in order to get out, you must start thinking.""

*Edited to fix the misuse of pact for packed. 

**Adding this here in response to all the wonderful comments (added Feb 19th)** Excited to see so many fond memories of people's experience with The Phantom Tollbooth. Happy to hear many people will be revisiting it and even more will be enjoying it for the first time soon.
As for the comments about the two books being very different, this is true. However, too many people (adults) graduating from college or starting a new path in life are given OTPYG. If someone is going to give only one book at these events they will have to choose. My point is consider choosing The Phantom Tollbooth, because IMO it is better. If not, perhaps give both. Two books are always better than one :)
As for kids, read every book you can get your hands on to them. We love reading, we should share that every chance we get.

hg0kkx,Donated my copy of The Phantom Tollbooth to my 10yo neighbor and he loves it!,"I saw a post by u/confident_loser a couple of months ago on here asking if anyone remembered a book called The Phantom Tollbooth. That was one of my favorite books as a kid and I found my old copy from the 90’s and read it again for the first time in a while.

A few weeks later I’m having dinner at our neighbor’s house down the street and his 10 year old son is talking about how he loves to read. We get to comparing our favorite books and he says he’s never heard of The Phantom Tollbooth and seemed interested when I told him a little bit about it (without spoiling anything).

Fast forward to last weekend and I was putting the book back on my shelf and on impulse went and put it in my neighbor’s mailbox. Tonight the neighbors came to our house for dinner and the dad tells me that they’ve been reading it a couple of chapters each night at bedtime together.

I really got a kick out of not telling them it was from me because for Milo the Tollbooth just appeared one day as well.  I don’t know if the kid remembers me talking about that book but I’m happy he likes it and hope it brings him as much joy as it did me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hg0kkx/donated_my_copy_of_the_phantom_tollbooth_to_my/,2020-06-26 03:57:34,13,47,books

When I still see it there on the next day, I decided to adopt it. Thought that I can read it and put it back afterwards, but was unable to do so. Anyway, some of the quotes from the book: 

""If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won't have the time. For there's always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing"" -     Terrible Trivium, demon of the petty tasks 

""You'll find that the only thing you can do easily is be wrong and that's hardly worth the effort"" - The Mathemagician 

""It's very much like you trying to reach Infinity. You know that it's there, just not where -- but just because you can never reach it, doesn't mean that its not worth looking for"" - 0.58 child 

""You may not see it now, but whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, even in the tiniest way"" - Princess of Pure Reason 

And my personal favorite: 
 
Policeman - ""Where were you on the night of July 26th?"" 

Milo - ""What does that have to do with it? "" 

Policeman - ""It's my birthday that's what. Boys always forgot other people's birthday""

nvd3au,Has anyone here read The Neverending Story?,"I always enjoyed The Neverending Story book growing up. It was a bit difficult to finish at the time. The book is very long and detailed for a child. I also re-read it as a teenager. What a wonderful book! I can never find other people who read it though. I don't think I've ever discussed the book with anyone before. 

The neverending story movie was excellently done, but they kind of screwed up making it an epic trilogy. Therefore you get an insanely watered down version of 1/3rd of the plot. Most people don't even know there are sequels to  The Neverending Story movie. The sequels don't hold up to the first movie for whatever reason. Maybe budgets changed who knows. If you watch all the movies it's not like reading the book.

If you have read this book, did you enjoy it? What are your favorite parts? I love the monkeys at the typewriters who type randomly and over an infinite time create every idea possible. There's lots of surrealism that represent ideas like in another favorite book when I was young The Phantom Tollbooth. The Neverending Story reminds me of a longer, more detailed and better story arched version of The Phantom Tollbooth. I really need to read the book again because it's so detailed and so much happens.

Good ones..now I have to think about that.  The Life of Pi was really really good.  It had the same feel and drama.  Plus, I mean a classic, the original To Kill A Mockingbird was done so well.  I feel that if you only saw the movie.. you might get away with knowing about it enough.   The cartoon movie of A Phantom Tollbooth was spot on.  That is a classic that I watch annually.

gmhmk4,What's the funniest book you've ever read?,"I was just thinking about one of my most favorite books ""Hitching Rides with Buddha: Travels in Search of Japan"" by Will Ferguson, and it struck me how hilarious it was and why I had enjoyed it so much. 

Then I got to reflecting how few really, funny books I have (and I am a bibliophile - I have 6 ceiling-to-floor bookcases crammed with history, romance, mystery,  thrillers, biographies, self-help from cooking, home decor and ettiquette to how to do home wiring, but not a lot of truly *funny* books. The ones where you are stuffing your fist into your mouth to keep from laughing so hard so your hubby doesn't think you are loony. 

I mean, of course there is Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series - and Janet Evanovich's Sephanie Plum novels - but there has to be more than just that.  What's the funniest book you've ever read? I'd love to hear about someone else's take.

Edit: thank you to everyone for so many wonderful suggestions! I'm definitely saving this list to look at when I need a funny book because I'm feeling down!

rsbso5,What's the first book that really resonated with you in sparking your imagination?,"I have always loved sci-fiction, fantasy, and dystopian themes, especially in Young Adult.

 As a reader, the Harry Potter series really made me imagine because Rowling created a whole world that was different from this one. I think a lot of it also has to do with the fact that I experienced HP before there every was a movie. There was something exciting about awaiting the next release and attending the premiere for every book -- I didn't always remember everything fully so sometimes I would re-read the preceding books. 

While some people are put off by the length of HP, the length never bothered me because I found it so engaging and engrossing. Sure, you can analogize various themes and concepts to the real world but as a kid I  never saw it that way. From the name of the spells, the function of the spells, etc. I loved the little tidbits that Rowling thrown in as an Easter Eggs of sorts -- everything was just so elaborately crafted. 

Secondly, I can't discuss my love of reading without talking about  Lois Lowry's The Giver -- it led me to so many other authors like Neal Schuster and others. Some people think it is a retelling of A Clockwork Orange but I would argue that there is much more fantasy elements. 

I was never into poetry or verses but Ellen Hopkins really turned me onto this style as a reader -- the grittiness and raw realism she brought to her topics and themes were refreshing given how other forms of media tend to glamourize drug use. The way she spaces words on the page was also different and hypnotic from the standard left to right reading that I was used to.

6p9hyb,Sometimes you have to find the right book to get back into reading.,"I've been on a lapse on reading for a few years now as my time is consumed by other hobbies. I have hundreds of books that I've collected over my 21 years of life and many sit untouched. I read my first Stephen King novel this year and it kinda took me out of the mood of reading. Insomnia was the book. It was a great story, don't get me wrong. He did great work with it. But it just wasn't the right thing to push me on to the next story and I fell out of reading entirely for a few months.

I recently picked up Neuromancer. I'm a cyberpunk/Sci-fi nut and I love stuff like this. I saw somewhere online that this book is the foundation of the Cyberpunk genre, so of course I had to grab it. This is the thing that's pushing me back into reading. Once I'm done with this I'm going to finish the Skulduggery Pleasant series, and then read The Phantom Tollbooth and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I wish I had more time on my hands so I could spend more time reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6p9hyb/sometimes_you_have_to_find_the_right_book_to_get/,2017-07-24 16:29:15,12,15,books
10mubi7,Which childhood book/series taught you the most about life?,"For me, it was ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’. I remember seeing the movie before the book as a kid and figured I would get into the book series when I was around 11 years old. I was originally expecting the books to be just as campy as the movie but instead what I got was a bleak, stressful, and heartbreaking journey I could not have foresaw. 
With Jude Laws voice in my head, I at first was taken aback by the sheer cruelty and short-sightedness of almost all the adults throughout the books. It was honestly a stressful experience seeing the children suffer from the cruelty or stupidity of the adults and it’s only years later that I see that it’s not far from the truth.
The books taught me a number of things, some that I would apply later in my life, and they are:
- Good and evil are relative
- Bad people can get away with it
- The world is more complex a than we’ll ever know
- Never judge a book by its cover.

But one of the more interesting aspects that changed everything for me and really got me engaged into the story was the introduction of V.F.D. and how it would shape the course of the rest of the story. It was my first time learning of secret societies and how they have eyes and ears from the very top of the Senate to the lowest back alley. It was here that I realized that the children would never find peace and soon join the ranks of the very people they despised.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10mubi7/which_childhood_bookseries_taught_you_the_most/,2023-01-27 19:55:32,19,18,books

wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‘best’ or ‘most influential’ books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn’t take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a “score” of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader’s Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another “point” and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the “best” books of all time, but rather the “most influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively “better” than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn’t be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

ws4p1q,What is the best book aimed at children/middle schoolers that you’ve ever read?,"Mine is definitely “When You Reach Me” by Rebecca Stead. I loved it when i was 13 and i loved it even more when i read it again at 23. (If you don’t believe me that it’s a fantastic book PLEASE PLEASE read the reviews on Goodreads. They can say it better than me.) 

It’s amazing to me that middle grade books  can sometimes convey such powerful ideas and compelling stories in such a digestible manner and I’d love to hear of similar stories :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ws4p1q/what_is_the_best_book_aimed_at_childrenmiddle/,2022-08-19 04:38:21,86,27,books
