8gt5m8,In Defense of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,"This started off as a reply to someone who said he had read Hitchhikers Guide and didn’t really get it. I looked at the comments and there was a mixture of agreement and defense of the books.  But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. 

Now, I don’t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. 

So I’m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I’ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn’t capture. 

The first, and most simplistic view of it is that there’s just general silliness around. The people get into silly situations, react stupidly, and just experience random funny stuff. 

The second, still fairly easy to see bit is Adams just generally making fun of the sci-fi genre. He loves to poke fun at their tropes and describe them ridiculously. 

The final bit though is why I think this series is a true masterpiece. In a way, even though Earth gets demolished in the first few pages of the first book, the characters never really leave. All the aliens they encounter behave fundamentally like humans, with all of our foibles and oddities. 

The first time he does it, he really hammers you over the head with it to try to clue you on what he’s on about. A rude, officious, uncaring local government knocks down Arthur’s house - where he lives - in the name of efficiency. The government doesn’t care about the effect on Arthur’s life. What happens next? A bureaucratic alien race demolishes our entire planet, with all of its history, art, and uniqueness, to make way for a hyperspace bypass that literally doesn’t make any sense and isn’t needed anyway. 

In a lot of ways Arthur’s journey reminds me of The Little Prince, a fantastic book in which a childlike alien boy travels from meteor to meteor and meets various adults like a king, a drunkard, or a businessman. They all try to explain themselves to the little prince who asks questions with childlike naïveté that stump the adults. 

Adams is doing the same thing. The Vogons he used as a double whammy to attack both British government officials and awful, pretentious, artsy types. What’s worse than awful poetry at an open mic night and government officials? How about a government official that can literally force you to sit there and be tortured to death by it!

My absolute favorite bit in the entire series is in the second book which you haven’t read (yet, hopefully).  In the original version of the book he uses the word “fuck”. It was published in the UK as is, but the American publisher balked at printing that book with that word in it. 

Adams’s response? He wrote this entire additional scene in the book about how no matter how hardened and nasty any alien in the Galaxy was, nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever utter the word “Belgium.” Arthur is totally perplexed by this and keeps saying it trying to understand, continually upsetting everyone around him. The concept is introduced because someone won an award for using the word “Belgium” in a screenplay. The entire thing is a beautifully written takedown of American puritanical hypocrisy and the publishing industry’s relationship with artists. 

Adams uses Arthur’s adventures to muse on the strange existential nature of human existence. He skewers religion, atheists, government, morality, science, sexuality, sports, finance, progress, and mortality just off the top of my head. 

He is a true existential absurdist in the vein of Monty Python. The scenarios he concocts are so ridiculous, so bizarre, that you can’t help but laugh at everyone involved, even when he’s pointing his finger directly at you. 

Whether it’s a pair of planets that destroyed themselves in an ever escalating athletic shoe production race, their journey to see God’s final message to mankind, or the accidental discovery about the true origins of the human race, there is a message within a message in everything he writes. 

I encourage you to keep going and actually take the time to read between the lines. You won’t regret it. 

EDIT: This is the first post I've written on Reddit that blew up to this extent. I've been trying to reply to people as the posts replies roll in, but I'm literally hundreds behind and will try to catch up. I've learned a lot tonight, from both people who seemed to enjoy my post, people who felt that it was the most obvious thing in the world to write, and people who seem to bring to life one of the very first lines of the book, ""This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.""

In retrospect maybe I shouldn't have posted this on a Thursday.

I've also learned that I should spend more time in a subreddit before posting on it; apparently this book is quite popular here and a lot of people felt that I could have gone more out on a limb by suggesting that people on the internet like cats on occasion. This has led me to understand at least part of the reason why on subreddits I'm very active on I see the same shit recycle a lot... I'm gonna have a lot more sympathy for OPs who post popular opinions in the future.

At the request of multiple people, here was the thread I originally read that led me to write this response. https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/87j5pu/just_read_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_and/

a2ht93,Just read The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and I'm blown away.,"This might come up quite often since it's pretty popular, but I completely fell in love with a story universe amazingly well-built and richly populated. It's full of absurdity, sure, but it's a very lush absurdity that is internally consistent enough (with its acknowledged self-absurdity) to seem like a ""reasonable"" place for the stories. Douglas Adams is also a very, very clever wordsmith. He tickled and tortured the English language into some very strange similes and metaphors that were bracingly descriptive. Helped me escape from my day to day worries, accomplishing what I usually hope a book accomplishes for me.

61sgc1,"Finally Reading, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""","3 Chapters in and I am LOVING it. Finding a good book that makes you laugh out loud is a gem!



Some of my favorite quotes so far:



""Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Author Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protrudin from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous.""



""Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle in a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the color of the flying saucers didnt matter that much really. ""

dluzi0,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy appreciation (does contain some spoilers),"OK I know I know I am beyond late to the party on this one but I have to say something to someone. Unfortunately I don't really have any friends who read so Reddit is my only outlet. I was an avid reader when I was growing up but when I hit my early 20's life started getting busier and I just didn't have the time to read much. This past year I have taken up reading again with a passion. I've blown through Kitchen Confidential, Medium Raw, Count of Monte Cristo, Ender's Game, Ready Player One, all 7 Harry Potter's (which to be fair I had read before), all of Sherlock Holmes, most of Hercule Poirot, all 5 Robert Langdon books, On the Road, Perks of being a Wallflower and I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple more. But I just finished The Hitchhikers Guide the Galaxy and I have never laughed so hard when reading a book in my entire life. The dialogue and banter in the 9th chapter when Arthur and Ford are saved from certain death by the Heart of Gold using the infinite improbability drive might just be the funniest thing I have ever read. I was literally howling with laughter. I don't know why it took me so long to read this book as it has consistently been one of the most recommended books but dear god am I happy I finally did.

45v5o4,Do yourself a favor and reread The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.,"We're all familiar with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and some of us have read it enough times to practically recite it from memory. I, myself, have re-read it about once every 3-5 years since I was 13. It's one of those kinds of books that you get something new out of when you've reached a new stage in life, or have gained some new perspective. At some stages of my life, I sympathize with Arthur. At others, I sympathize with Marvin. Sometimes, I'm in Trillian's head. And at my best times, I'm with Zaphod.

This time, it's been about 10 years since my last read through and it still holds up. It's still just as funny, I still get something new out of it, and I'm secure in the belief that this book, that changed my life for the better at 13, was the best book I could have ever picked up.

d000rv,I didn't fully appreciate The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy when I first read it.,"I barely, if ever, read books before, yet I was subscribed to this sub for the longest time. After countless posts and comments about THGTG i decided, okay screw it why not, it seems right up my alley. I'll give it a shot. 

I breezed three of the books in a little over 2 weeks. I read almost every single night. And when I finished it, I thought 'well that was nice, good writing, but I don't see what the fuss is about' 

Fast forward a couple years later to now. I've read 70 books or so, not much by this sub's standard but it's a lot for me and it seems THGTG was the catalyst. And I find myself getting bored or annoyed or too lazy to read. It seems like a task to finish books sometimes, and even some of my favorite books that I've read, I felt something missing..

Well I went back and re-read THGTG and realized... WOW. WHAT A BOOK! It was absolutely amazing, and I just didn't realize because I had little to nothing to compare it with. On my second read I was so giddy reading it, laughing at the plot and being immersed by the phenomenal prose.

63i028,"Douglas Adams (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) on Americanisation and Digital Watches: a Fax to US editor, January 1992.","*I've been re-reading The Hitchhiker's series and came across the below in a copy of the book. Thought I'd share!*

**Fax from Douglas Adams to US editor Byron Preiss**

**Monday, January 13th, 1992, 5:26pm**

Dear Byron, 

Thanks for the script of the novel… I’ll respond as quickly and briefly as possible.

One general point. A thing I have had said to me over and over again whenever I’ve done public appearances and readings and so on in the States is this: Please don’t let anyone Americanise it! We like it the way it is!

There are some changes in the script that simply don’t make sense. Arthur Dent is English, the setting is England, and has been in every single manifestation of HHGG ever. The ‘Horse and Groom' pub that Arthur and Ford go to is an English pub, the ‘pounds’ they pay with are English (but make it twenty pounds rather than five – inflation). So why suddenly ‘Newark’ instead of ‘Rickmansworth’? And ‘Bloomingdales’ instead of ‘Marks & Spencer’? The fact that Rickmansworth is not within the continental United States doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist! American audiences do not need to feel disturbed by the notion that places do exist outside the US or that people might suddenly refer to them in works of fiction. You wouldn’t, presumably, replace Ursa Minor Beta with ‘Des Moines’. There is no Bloomingdales in England, and Bloomingdales is not a generic term for large department stores. If you feel that referring to ‘Marks & Spencer’ might seriously freak out Americans because they haven’t heard of it… we could either put warning stickers on the label (‘The text of this book contains references to places and institutions outside the continental United States and may cause offence to people who haven’t heard of them’) or you could, I suppose, put ‘Harrods’, which most people will have heard of. Or we could even take the appalling risk of just recklessly mentioning things that people won’t have heard of and see if they survive the experience. They probably will – when people are born they haven’t heard or anything or anywhere, but seem to get through the first years of their lives without ill-effects.

Another point is something I’m less concerned about, but which I thought I’d mention and then leave to your judgement. You’ve replaced the joke about digital watches with a reference to ‘cellular phones’ instead. Obviously, I understand that this is an attempt to update the joke, but there are two points to raise in defence of the original. One is that it’s a very, very well known line in Hitch Hiker, and one that is constantly quoted back at me on both sides of the Atlantic, but the other is that there is something inherently ridiculous about digital watches, and not about cellular phones. Now this is obviously a matter of opinion, but I think it’s worth explaining. Digital watches came along at a time that, in other areas, we were trying to find ways of translating purely numeric data into graphic form so that the information leapt easily to the eye. For instance, we noticed that pie charts and bar graphs often told us more about the relationships between things than tables of numbers did. So we worked hard to make our computers capable of translating numbers into graphic displays. At the same time, we each had the world’s most perfect pie chart machines strapped to our wrists, which we could read at a glance, and we suddenly got terribly excited at the idea of translating them *back* into numeric data, simply because we suddenly had the technology to do it… so digital watches were mere technological toys rather than significant improvements on anything that went before. I don’t happen to think that that’s true of cellular comms technology. So that’s why I think that digital watches (which people still do wear) are inherently ridiculous, whereas cell phones are steps along the way to more universal communications. They may seem clumsy and old-fashioned in twenty years time because they will have been replaced by far more sophisticated pieces of technology that can do the job better, but they will not, I think, seem inherently ridiculous.

[…]

One other thing. I’d rather have characters say ‘What do you mean?’ rather than ‘Whadd’ya mean?’ which I would never, ever write myself, even if you held me down on a table and threatened me with hot skewers.

Otherwise it looks pretty good […].

4mqard,Just read books 1-4 of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the first time ever. This is unequivocally the best book series I have ever read and I don't know what to do with my life now :(,"This is one of those series that I'd always heard about but somehow never got around to reading. Now that I have I'm wondering where it's been all my life, but also realizing that there's a lot of concepts and intelligent existential wit in it that I might not have caught onto if I had read it when I was younger. I haven't ever read anything that was simultaneously this witty, hilarious, intelligent, and original. In fact I haven't been able to put it down since I started the first book a week or two ago. It's honestly a bit difficult to put into words how brilliant this series is, in so many different ways - suffice it to say that if there was any piece of literature that captured my perspective and spirit, this is it.

I just finished the fourth book, which took all of Adam's charm and applied it to one of the most poignantly touching love stories I've ever read, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I've experienced everything I wanted life to offer me through the eyes of Arthur Dent, and now that I'm back in my own skin in my own vastly different and significantly more boring life I'm feeling a sense of loss. This is coming as a bit of a surprise since I wasn't expecting to find this kind of substance from these books. I had always imagined that they were just some silly, slap-stick humor type sci-fi books.

Besides ranting about the meaning these books have to me and my own sadness that the man who created them is no longer with us, I also wanted to create this post to ask you guys two things:

1) Should I read Mostly Harmless? The general consensus I've gotten is that it takes the beauty of the fourth book and takes it in a depressing direction, and I'd really much rather end this journey on the note it's on right now (as has been recommended to me more than a few times). But at the same time I want so badly to read more HHGttG. So I'm feeling a bit torn. Also, what about the 6th book that eion colfer wrote?

2) Are there any other books out there that come anywhere close to the psychedelic wit, hilarity, and spirit that this series has? I've heard dirk gently recommended more than a few times, and I'm about 1 or 2 chapters into it right now but it hasn't captivated me in the same way that HHGttG did. I'm going to continue on with it anyway though since Adams was behind it.

So long, Douglas Adams... and thanks for all the fish. :'(

Edit: Wow, wasn't expecting this to explode like this. I think it's gunna take me the next few years to get through my inbox lol. 

I've got enough recommendations in this thread to keep me reading for a couple lifetimes lol - but Pratchett, Gaiman, and Vonnegut are definitely the most common ones, so I'll definitely be digging into that content. And there's about as many people vehemently stating that I shouldn't read mostly harmless as there are saying that I should. Still a bit unsure about it but I'm thinking I'll give it a bit of time to let the beauty of the first four books fade into my memory and then come back and check it out.

vapf1v,I'm currently listening to Moby Dick and have decided it resembles nothing bso much as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in theme and tone.,"I was supposed to read Moby Dick in highschool and... didn't. I'm now on a quest to complete the books I skipped in school.

I was shocked by how funny Moby Dick is right from the start. I was prepared for a grim tale of obsession on the high seas but Melville has plenty of levity to keep the story funny. That's not to say it lacks depth, it's notoriously packed with metaphors and allusions and it is a grim tale of obsession, it also succeeds at being funny at the same time.

Hitchhikers Guide is much the same way. It is fundamentally a grim plot packed with metaphor but it's also extremely funny. Both books have a a obstensible ""guide"" like purpose with Moby Dick being something of a primer on the world of whale fishing. Both also prominenty feature a vengeful sperm whale.

Thoughts on this? I feel like I could write an essay on the similarities",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vapf1v/im_currently_listening_to_moby_dick_and_have/,2022-06-12 16:20:21,184,878,books
uxilk1,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has really stood the test of time - still just as hilarious as it was when it first came out 44 years ago. What surprised me though was the philosophy, I'd forgotten how deep these books are when you open them up!","Today is Towel Day (two weeks after the anniversary of Douglas Adams' death), so seemed like a good time to re-read HGTTG, and it was just as wonderful as I remembered!

The first book in particular, the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, is truly incredible! So much joke density and such a wildly detailed and zany plot. The chapters are only a few pages long, but every single one feels like it has something big happening in it, and every page has a joke (and it's almost always a good one). That makes it so hard to stop reading - you always want to know how their going to get out of their latest crazy situation.

The 4th book, *So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,* might be my favorite though. It's relentlessly hilarious, has a somewhat tighter central plot than some of the other books, absolutely nails its big philosophical moments (God's last message to his creation is one for the ages), and somehow also manages to be a very endearing, not at all too-sweet love story at the same time.

I think the thing that really sets these books apart and makes them timeless is the way Adams' raises big philosophical questions and answers them in a truly unique way. Instead of trying to dispense wisdom or tell you how to live your life, the books poke fun at the entire notion of universal answers to life's big questions. Instead, Adams suggests we could all do with taking life a little less seriously and finding our own answers to those big questions instead of looking for them from other people. '42' is the most famous example of this, but the books have so many other related jokes that are just as good.

Looking back, it feels like a ton of other creative work have been hugely inspired by HGTTG. Futurama, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Rick and Morty, and Everything Everywhere All At Once all came to mind right away - and I'm sure there are tons more too!

Rest in peace Douglas Adams, thanks for making something so wonderful in the time you had, and for inspiring so much amazing work that came after. So long, and thanks for all the fish. And [don't forget to bring a towel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day)!

12uo126,Just Finished the Five Part Trilogy of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"Wow what a read! I loved the imaginative-ness, creativity, wholesomeness and innocence of these stories. The little bits of humour had me cackling like a madman, I especially loved this really random quote from So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish:

' ""It was very odd"" she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side"" '

Not sure why but this quote in particular literally made me DIE I was laughing so hard.

All in all, I really felt like a child again reading these stories. They really fueled my imagination, and I had some really interesting dreams while reading this collection of books. I think that out of all of the books, I actually liked So Long and Thanks for All of the Fish, as well as Mostly Harmless the most. I particular loved the flying scene with Arthur and Fenchurch. Also I really liked the character of Normal in Mostly Harmless.

I plan to re-read this entire collection again at some point, as I rarely fully enjoy/absorb everything from a book on the first read. I have a visual memory and probably not the best memory, so I kind of read a book like watching a film and read at a fairly quick pace.

wxka5q,A rollercoaster of chaotic plot twists: Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams,"I went into a pretty bad reading block right in the middle of an amazing fantasy, which was really a problem for me since the story was very dense.

Someone suggested me to read ""Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"", saying that it was not a stressful story and for me it was a lifesaver. 

The way it's written makes the story fun and full of plot twists, the characters are amazingly designed and the whole idea is just ingenious.

In my opinion there is something beautiful in that little bit of nonsense and complete chaos that dominates some parts of the story. 

Honestly, I laugh so much while reading this, because sometimes something completely random happened and I didn't even have the time to wonder why that something even more unexpected popped out.

This book gave me a new perspective of life, that in the end it's just a complete mess of thing that happen and in most cases you cannot do anything about it. You have to go with the flow, without asking too much questions. 

For me, this book is an absolute masterpiece!

p3ysak,First Time Read-Through of A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"\- Finished Hitchhiker's Guide a day or two ago, book one at that, and have had a chance to mull it over. Obviously, I've seen it on tons of ""Best Books"" lists and had it recommended to me several times. I knew going in it was a bit slapstick and whimsical, and it was fantastically so. But, somehow, I detected something a bit deeper beneath the surface, particularly standing out is the curious characteristics of the main characters. Many display darkly funny tendencies, that really got me thinking about our own world, upbringing, and how our characteristics reflect out onto society.  Adams may not have meant it to go that deep, but it got me thinking.

Marvin, for instance, is an extremely intelligent, cybernetic robot, who suffers from deep depression about life and existence though not being biologically alive himself. Despite claiming to be infinitely more intelligent than his finite companions, they all express extreme disgust and annoyance over his presence. It displays an interesting instance relating to moments where we often feel, true or not, rejected by society even though we are worthy. I really felt that.  No matter how how high we climb towards our own accomplishments and endeavors, at times we feel we don't measure up. Marvin's character really hit me though he is such a pessimist. No one really seemed to care.

Zaphod Beeblebrox is another interesting case study. Always looking for the unknown. Biologically, I am trying to understand how he operates. Does his two heads work in jolly cooperation, or are they always operating independantly? He lives by the force that is fate, and does not seem to give any second thoughts to his actions, or plans. Or have any regrets. He lives in the moment, and doesn't dwell on his present circumstance for too long. I think he represents someone many of us would ideally like to be, but aren't selfish enough to evolve into.

Douglas Adams also does a wonderful job displaying the awkwardness of dialogue, especially between races. Slartibartfast, my guy. You are one weird dude. His time with Arthur Dent, I found curious. I do wonder what it would be like to interact with galactic beings, with neither of us able to communicate or relate to one another's lives. I am amazed Ford was able to do it with Earthlings. Yet, many of these other interactions are so damn awkward that it is indeed quite funny, yet also envokes curiousity in how these interactions would truly proceed if they ever were to occur. The dialogue here is really well done.

I thought of I, Robot as I read Hitchhiker's Guide. I am not a science fiction fanatic by any means, but when I read these books, there is a tangible culture to these stories that allows me to understand those who obsess over the space/android/alien genre. It is extremely fun to be immersed in these worlds. I recommed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to anyone looking for a fun, quick book and/or anyone attempting to be introduced into the sci-fi genre. This was a great read.

“You know,” said Arthur, “it’s at times like this, when I’m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.”

qax91k,Nothing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is funny at all (and the problem I have with British fiction),"I may be the only person who's said this publicly, but Hitchhiker's sucks. It's not that it couldn't be funny, taken out of context the adventure Arthur Dent goes on, it's gut-busting. It's absurdist and clever.

The problem is the book starts with the destruction of earth and the death of 5 billion people. Nothing is funny after that, and really nothing should. At first, years ago I thought Douglas Adams was some kind of high functioning Psychopath, incapable of feeling any warmth or pathos to his fellow man. 

But British storytelling seems to have this problem. I see it in the horrible Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy (and I have friends who groan when they hear Hardy and whisper their disgust of Tess of D'Ubervilles as though the memory punches them in the stomach) and then I look at other works like the Elite, Judge Dredd. enough Dr. Who episodes I saw at random to never want to touch the series again.

Modern British storytelling is cruel. It lacks any sort of pathos for the characters, and they don't act like real people. Arthur Dent I can give a pass too because his new circumstances are so surreal he can't process, but especially Judge Dredd, there's a whimsy around human suffering that makes me sick. And then to make the plot go forward, to make the plot happen at all, especially in Judge Dredd the people don't act like people. They're stupider, crasser, meaner, they become strawmen. The ""Bright Side of Life"" number at the end of Life of Brian comes to mind. It ruined the whole movie for me, but at least the ""whimsy"" came at the end of the work, and not the beginning. 

Now people have the audacity to say that these are works of satire and speculation and don't need to conform to realism, except that's not true when it comes to human characters, including background characters. It took me a LONG time to understand I hate British stories because it's very clear the authors do not like their characters and see them only as tools for their ends.

And if you want to see the difference in action, why do people weep for a loser antihero like Willy Lowman in Death of a Salesman? It's because Arthur Miller on some level LIKES Willy, and roots for him despite his inadequacies.

In short, while I have no desire to read French classics because they ALWAYS seem to give downer endings (absolute no no for me) at least they treat tragedy as a tragedy. French classics it seems bring sadness and judgment in how they treat the characters, but they are given dignity and humanness. British stories bring with them callousness and contempt and a sneer. 

I really want to take Doug Adams, were he alive and shake him by the shoulders. In what fucking world do you think you can have the human race slaughtered to all but last man and the Earth utterly destroyed, and have that be the opening of a COMEDY? What the fuck is wrong with you?!

I've spoken Caligula's line about how he wishes the world had but one throat so he could slit it, I tend to agree with Daniel Plainview's views of humanity. And British storytelling is shockingly misanthropic. I hate people when they are conceited jackasses, British storytellers seem to either hate or have no regard for humanity on principle. They leave me angry when I read them, because I cannot stand cruelty in any form, and these people are cruel gods to their characters. 

And honestly, I love Kipling (Kim) and Dickens (Tale of Two Cities) and Conan Doyle (Holmes). Sherlock Holmes is not my bag because of mysteries, but Doyle LIKES Sherlock, without sugarcoating what a dumpster fire he is as a human being. I find is scandalous British storytelling seems to take its notes from Hardy and not the guys above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qax91k/nothing_in_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_is/,2021-10-18 22:10:16,140,0,books

My qualms with this book were the British humor just didn’t really do much for me and the writing style was so spotty and all over the place. There were a couple of chapters near the end (chapter 18-23) that I enjoyed the most because I felt like the forced jokes were set aside to explain an important part of the plot.

r9li0c,Jokes on bass players in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"> Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City.

The line above is from So Long and Thanks for All the Fish. It's also the only literary joke that forced me to do a spit take. But the joke that got me was the sentence structure, not the sympathetic dig towards bass players. While reading the line I visualized it this way:

Gunfire. Oh, no! Oh, it's all right. It's just a bass guitar. Must be having some technical difficulties. Getting shot. *Spit take*.

So basically I thought that the gunfire was a onomatopoeia of the bass guitar only to learn within split second that the gunfire was a onomatopoeia of someone shooting a gun at the bassist.

I was wondering if anyone else read the joke like I did. Because, if I wrote it the way I read it, I would've used ellipses (but it was only a bass player . . . getting shot). Since Adams didn't do it this way, since he wrote a formal line, I'm kinda getting the vibe that I read more out of it than there was in it. How did you read it?

50ray8,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series is kind of depressing,"At first, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe seemed fun and exciting, exactly the type of light read I had been looking for. The first book was hilarious, so I quickly got the rest of the books in the series. However, at some point in the second or third book, I realized that something was bothering me. Almost sneakily, the story had taken a dark turn.

The Galaxy is possibly the loneliest place I've had the displeasure to read about. It's full of billions of sentient beings who couldn't care less about each other, which strikes a little too close to home for comfort. With the earth gone (for most of the time) and the main characters being separated and tossed around the Galaxy at random, it becomes apparent that even the main characters don't care about each other. If someone dies or disappears, not a single character will bat an eye. While this may be to keep the series lighthearted, the characters come off as insensitive and straight up cruel. They have no one to trust or rely on but themselves, and in my opinion, their Galaxy is a little too apathetic to be the setting of a comedy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/50ray8/the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_series_is/,2016-09-02 03:40:31,60,125,books

9h7b1p,Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy,"I recently purchased the trilogy of four edition (so missing the book that's not by Adams) and I am only at chapter 26 of the first book. I just felt like I had to take time aside to bring it into the (modern) public eye. It's funny, clever and there's not a boring page (thus far).

Definitely worth picking up if you're looking for something heavily entertaining. So easy to get into and much love to it.

x2gwpu,What is the funniest book you have read?,"I'd love to hear from you all about what books made you laugh. As for me, one of the funniest books I ever read would be Good Omens by Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett. I effing loved it. I’ve never read anything quite like it in terms of creativity, its cleverness, its perfect blend between fantasy and reality, the absolutely spot-on anecdotes about British life & just the humanity of it all. 

Another one would be Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. One of the few books that I can read over and over, and always laugh out loud throughout. 

Though not exactly a book I found superior foes of spiderman quite hilarious. Funny, action-packed, character Driven, beautifully drawn and well paced. What more could a comic fan want. I would love to know what are your favourites.

buk5yr,I’m legitimately not enjoying the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy series,"I’ve heard people tell me how the great the series was and I was disappointed by it.  The plot in most of the books is sporadic and has little to no payoff storywise. Anything that would seem like a neat concept is put on the back burner for whatever antics they’re caught up in.  The third book barely even seems to care about it’s galaxy ending threat. The books don’t have a normal plot structure making every ending feel dull or anticlimactic.  I chuckled at some of the jokes but most of them seemed nonsensical.  The books don’t even try to flesh out any of the characters.  They’re all given one trait and they run it to the ground. Ex Marvin’s depression or Arthur’s confusion/Odness. It surprises me because some sections have immaculate levels of detail regarding world building yet they don’t care about the important things like character development or fleshing out the main plot. Is It just me who feels this way because I really don’t get the hype.

Tl;dr: I don’t like the books. Bad plot and characters development

Edit: I do like the first book because that one doesn’t really suffer from my issues too much.

I actually finished reading this today ( Yes, I'm quite late ) and I found the book pretty entertaining. I liked the addition of Tricia McMillan, and found Douglas's take on parallel universes to be quite interesting!

We hardly got to know her, before she blew up along with everyone else! I found myself sympathetic for her sometimes, and found that she was someone whose plight most people could probably relate to. I mean, she felt like she didn't belong anywhere, and who doesn't feel that from time to time? 

I did find myself also pretty sympathetic towards Arthur Dent. Poor dude! I mean, the guy's in an alternate universe, in which both the planet he was born on, and the woman he loves doesn't exist. I mean, I thought he was finally getting a break in the last book. But maaaan, Douglas Adams is really brutal to Arthur in this book. When he does get a break, (making sandwiches out of all things) it's very short-lived, being given a daughter that he didn't even know he had! 

Ford Prefect was as brilliant as ever. I love that guy. He's like the epitome of the worst tour guide, often saying vague and unhelpful things. That whole conversation about ""Which King?"" ""I don't know Which King. But I do know The King."" was fantastic. 


While many are quick to point out that the book is more bleak than the other 4, (and I definitely agree) I felt that there were still plenty of humorous and light-hearted moments sprinkled (albeit in lesser amounts) throughout the book that does not make the book entirely bitter. (I'm sure if I would dare to lick it, it would taste almost bittersweet). One must not forget Colin, who's the exact opposite of Marvin, and The King himself makes an appearance, which I found absolutely delightful!

Now the ending... 


The ending was a bit of a downer, especially as it was getting really good towards the end, and felt like the ending was so abrupt. It also killed off, like all of the main characters, which I suspect would probably piss off a lot of people.

Overall though, I thought the book wasn't as bad as people tend to say it is, and I would definitely have regretted not reading it. Sorry for the whole rant hahaha. What did you guys think?

3htpo3,"So, today i started reading A Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy...","I know, i'm very, very, very (yet fashionably) late to the party. I apologise for that. I've had a gaming-focused life up until this point and have finally started using my imagination and catching up with the times! (i've read like 6 books!!!!)

Anyway, back to the point... I haven't got a scooby what is going on in this book. Is it supposed to be this way? I can just about get the jist of stuff. I kind of know where they are, i kind of know what they're doing, but 90% of what is said in this book means less than nothing to me.

8h5ex0,Help me understand Ford Prefect (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy),"The Hitchhikers Guide series is one of my favorites, but there’s always been one detail that has bothered me, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

When we meet Ford Prefect, he is introduced as Arthur Dent’s out-of-work actor friend from Guildford. Eventually, we learn that Ford is not in fact from Guildford, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. We also eventually learn that he chose the name Ford Prefect thinking it was a perfectly inconspicuous name for life on Earth, and that when the story picks up with him, he has been trapped on Earth for 15 years with no contact to anyone in the rest of the universe (otherwise, he would have left earth far sooner, likely to attend a party somewhere or enjoy the perpetual Saturday afternoons on Ursa Minor Beta).

Fast forward - Ford and Arthur Dent have been ejected from a Vogon Constructor Fleet ship, picked up in outer space against all probability by the Starship Heart of Gold, and Ford is reunited with his old friend Zaphod Beeblebrox. Upon seeing his semi-cousin for the first time in AT LEAST 15 years, Zaphod greets him with “Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in.”

My question is this - how the hell does Zaphod know to call him Ford? Presumably the only person left in the universe at this point who has ever called him Ford Prefect is Arthur Dent, shouldn’t Zaphod have greeted him as “Ix” (his nickname back on Betelgeuse 5)?

1t9dv1,"Which is your favourite of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy ""trilogy""?","I came across this thread whilst looking for opinions on which of the ""trilogy"" are the best.  http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/za4ho/hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_best_book/

A lot of the points made really struck a chord with me and I wanted to reply but couldn't for some reason.

I love the Hitchhikers series. I was a latecomer to them and I'm currently on Life, The Universe and Everything and I also think that it was made up as Adams went along. I think it works really well - his imagination is second to none. 

I also agree that characters have similar personalities. Having said that I think he was a brilliant storyteller. The little asides that pepper the plot are wonderful and provide some of the best laughs. 

As for the plot - I think this is a common criticism and stems from misguided, unpublished teachers and critics telling the imaginatively impotent to plan their story. That's why you end up with Once upon a time, in space, or perhaps in medieval times, a man met a woman, who was murdered, but they didn't know who did it, so the detective who has (insert foible here) and in the end the butler did it and they all lived happily ever after. I really think there's a lot top be learned from plots like Hitchhikers and Waugh's Decline and Fall (which also goes off on strange tangents), where the story is more style and perspective driven than plot driven. I love all of Waugh's work - The Loved One is another that really has no particular plot. The only thing I've read that goes off on more tangents is The Bizarre Letters of St John Morris, which is almost like comic fantasy / literary fiction. It is as if the pretentiousness of some literary fiction and fantasy have deliberately been juxtaposed with comedy. Not sure it totally accomplishes this but it's a crazy journey and certainly quite funny. Having said that, if you like Spike Milligan and Peter Cook, perhaps with a bit of Bob Mortimer, then you should find it funny, if not then steer clear as it is very (as the name implies) Bizarre.

I am about three quarters of the way through Life, The Universe and Everything and it is probably my least favourite of the three I've read so far. If I had to stick my neck out and pick my favourite of the first two then I'd go for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, if only for the fact that I love the point that Adams is (I think) trying to make with The Ruler of the Universe, and the 42 idea. The irony is that I've had at least two people tell me that 42 is all part of some secret concept to which Adams was referring!

So, What would be your rank for the ones you've read? I would rank the first three like this...

1, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe
2, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
3, Life, The Universe and Everything

I hope to add the other 2 asap! :)

fjt6dp,This whole Corona Virus saga reminds me of The Golgafrinchans from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.,"We are probably all going to die after being infected from dirty cell phones. 

The Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B was a way of removing the basically useless citizens from the planet of Golgafrincham. A variety of stories were formed about the doom of the planet, such as blowing up, crashing into the sun or being eaten by a mutant star goat. The ship was filled with all the middlemen of Golgafrincham, such as the telephone sanitizers, account executives, hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, and management consultants.

Ark Fleet ships A and C  were supposed to carry the people who ruled, thought, or actually did useful work.

The ship was programmed to crash onto its designated planet, Earth. The captain remembers that he was told a good reason for this, but had forgotten it, although the reason was later revealed to be because the Ark Ship B Golgafrinchans were a 'bunch of useless idiots'.

Flight to Earth
After the ship took off, no word was heard from either Golgafrincham or the other A and C ships.

After five years of traveling, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect were teleported onto the ship. They spoke to the captain and were very alarmed by the story of the ship.

On Earth
The ship crashes onto the supercomputer Earth and is wrecked, but many of the passengers and crew survive.  They begin running the planet in accordance with their previous useless ways.  Arthur and Ford agree that this explains a lot about later Earth inhabitants.  

Fate of Golgafrincham
A notation in the Guide about Golgafrincham after the departure of the B Ark states that the entire remaining population subsequently died from a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjt6dp/this_whole_corona_virus_saga_reminds_me_of_the/,2020-03-16 21:51:18,1,13,books

158pk79,TLDR: What Was the Funniest Book You Ever Read?,"My dad and I had a strained relationship, I am sure this is true of many fathers and sons. One of my very favourite memories of him is his talking to me about the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams. I think this would have been around 2003, I remember finishing the series right before the movie came out. Those were the days when my dad was my hero. Many years later I would think about him differently, realising that he had failures and insecurities, seeing his and my mom's relationship evaporate dissolve like ice into water. But through the hundreds of phone calls after the divorce and every time I saw him in person we would bring up this book series. I even tried a few times to get my dad to read books I thought equally absurd. 

I would say that Douglas Adams is the cornerstone of my sense of literary whimsy, but he is by no means the only piece. Later on I discovered Stephen Leacock, a humour writer who started his studies in economics but is now much more famous for the literary award that bares his name. I have read a very little of Mark Twain a few short stories and the Tom Sawyer/Huckleberry Finn books. I read around half of Discworld by Terry Pratchett and in many ways like it even better than Adams, but Adams will always be best because of the sentimental connection to my father. I recently discovered Adams wrote an essay on a humour author that inspired him, P.G. Wodehouse. I have read some but by no means all of Wodehouse, excited to dig into his comedy universe further, like the pre-cursor to the modern sitcom. 

My dad died last August, so in around a month it will be the anniversary. What books do you find funny and endlessly reread?

Quick question for the masses:  I've never read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I've seen it recommended again and again.  What I'm wondering is, is the recommendation for the entire series, or does the first book stand alone well?

I've got a long list of books to read, and I'd like to spread out what type (fiction/non/classic, etc.) of book I'm reading, rather than commit to a full series.  A 200 pg Guide to the Galaxy is much more appealing than trying to track down 4 other books before reading.

Bonus Question: Does the same apply to other sci-fi classics like Dune and Necromancer?

jmixc,"Just read through the first two Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Books, but..","People have long suggested I read the books, so I finally got around to it. I got through the first two, and while I'm loving the humor, either I'm constantly overanalyzing things, or the books just seem to glance over things.

**Potential spoilers ahead.**

One example: When Arthur+Ford are separated in the second book from Trillian+Zaphod, the fact that it happened just sort of.. fades away quickly. The characters seem almost completely emotionless, as if their only purpose is to humor the reader. 

More importantly, there's so much going on at the same time that I'm left to wonder whether there's any way the next books could wrap it all up. Yes, I shouldn't judge until I'm done, but right now, I'm: a) interested in what more we shall learn about the mice, if anything, b) whether the earth ever is rebuit, c) why the ruler of the universe is so messed up, d) how Arthur and Ford can ignore the fact that they just traveled back 2 million years in time, and have little to no intelligent company, and much more.

Basically, the story feels like a broken zipper--it keeps moving along, but the chain behind it isn't being tied together in the process. 

But mostly, it's just the lack of emotion. There's only one part where I see emotion, and that's when Arthur *tries* to feel the earth's destruction. After that, it just seems very emotionless. The characters seem like selfish assholes at some points.

Am I just overreading this, or misinterpreting it?

I'll start.,"Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion --- and yet not an emotion. If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one. It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal, not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was deadly --- again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly.

And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/swzv6/what_is_your_favorite_passage_from_hitchhikers/,2012-04-28 17:38:27,4,0,books
2730mt,I just finished read all 5 of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Mind. Blown. was yours? (x post with /r/dontpanic),"I have to make a 3 hour commute every week. Music has not been cutting it lately, and so i have been listening to audiobooks, with success. I honestly did not expect to get too far into The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. My attention span is not all that good. However, the moment i heard Stephen Fry's posh and witty voice, i was hooked on the book. the moment i heard the first hilarious guide entry, i was entrenched in the series.

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy made me wonder why it sold better than the Encyclopedia Galactica. While it does stress that you ""Don't Panic"" it was quite unlike the traditional fiction i read. Instead of a focus on traditional literary narrative, Douglas Adams seemed to focus on satirising every facet of humanity, science, space travel, politics, life, the universe and everything. While this focus was a little off putting at first, i got used to the enjoyable Guide tangents and the social commentary offered by the main characters. The ending was a tantilising shape of things to come.

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe gave a similar impression to that of HGGTG, but offer a brilliant twist at the end. With this twist was a hilarious take on modern humanity and why we are, who we are (Gogafrinchain and Zaphod discovering the real leader of the universe). The novel was a little more engaging that other, as Adams developed his descriptive language and really managed to pull you into that universe. As mentioned before, the ending was wildly jaw dropping, and, again, an excellent set up to the next novel. Also, Martin Freeman is an exceptional narrator.

*He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad.*

I loved that quote at the beginning of Life, the Universe and Everything. The prehistoric Earth and Lords cricket sequence are amongst my favourite ever book sequences. And how can you go past the crucial Agrajag chapter, which is equally as poignant and hilarious.  LTUAE was not my favourite of the novels; i thought, despite the meta-ness of the themes, that the adventure was TOO big. However, it was still an amazing read and hope to one day own a Bistromath.

So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish was my least favourite of the series. However, i thought it was still a great listen. Arthurs romance with Fenchurch was a little mushy for my tastes. *Also, if someone could tell me why the Earth re-existed, that would be great. For the life of me, i still dont understand that.* However, sending Arthur, Ford and Fenny back into space at the end was good enough for me.

Mostly Harmless was probably my favourite of the lot. The novel proved that Adams had a firm grasp on how traditional literature operates (despite my early perspective). Finishing the series where it began was so well handled and the inclusion of Stravomula Beta was subtle and ingenious. I so enjoyed seeing Arthur in his element as a sandwich maker, an extremely hilarious situation. Finally, the pay off for the major characters was exceptional (save for Zaphod).

This book opened my eyes to the vastness of the galaxy, how big life, the universe and everything really is. And how small and insignificant the things we do really are. All we can do is to find something that fulfills ourselves and try not to worry, or ***""Dont Panic""***

qgcmm,I teach at an inner urban high school and want to get all my kids a book.  Suggestions?  I'm especially having trouble choosing books for the teenage girls.,"When I was in high school, one of my favorite teachers gave all of his students a book.  Each student got a different book, picked out specifically to suit our tastes. Now, I'm a junior in college, and I run an SAT and college prep course in inner-city Indianapolis.  I have about 15 students, all from disadvantaged backgrounds, but all quite clever.  I'd like to give them all a book, but I'm having trouble with some of the girls. They eat up books with African-American or minority protagonists, but I don't want to hand them books strictly because the narrator is an African American, unless the story itself is good.  
So far, I've chosen **Stardust** by Gaiman, **The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak, & **Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy**.  However, I'd love some more input with suggestions.

gkolo,I refuse to buy any books with the movie version cover.,"Case in point, after reading that *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* post I realized I didn't have it in my library looked for it my local book store only to find the copy with the movie version cover.

Edit: That being said is there a [criterion](http://www.criterion.com/) type thing for books? 

Edit 2#: I went to my second hand book store and found a copy I liked for a good price also the [book depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/) had the same stuff for good prices. 

Also, obviously it doesn't change the content of the book, but for the price you end up paying for books I like to be able to marvel at the cover because it dedicated to the book. Also I like nice things.

Edit 3#: I should make it clear in my example, that this is certainly a book I've read before, I just didn't own it. I like collecting books that I love and I'm always happy to pay for an edition I find appealing. (Which has never been the movie version) Like a lot of readers, I tend to have a backlog of books that I'm intending to read so there is never any rush to get it into my hands. In any case, agree or disagree, it is all about opinion and it is a hard thing to argue but I've really enjoyed reading all the comments so far.

But there are a hundred other posts actually about books on this subreddit that are getting no attention maybe go give them a read too. This was just a quick post while I was browsing for books.

12n4ums,What are some of the highly suggested books on Reddit that you gave a try and hated?,"For me:

Catch 22-  hated it. Didn’t chuckle once. Outdated humor and I found it hard to follow what was going on. 

House of leaves - terribly pretentious book that makes you look up the meaning of a word every other sentence. Had potential at spots but the creative layout made it difficult to really get sucked in 

The Goldfinch - nothing happens for 90% of this book. This easily could have been 400 pages less. Finished it purely out of spite. 

Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - can’t say I hated it but it was definitely forgettable

5pgmwr,What's the book that has made you laugh out loud the most?,"It's funny because books don't seem to evoke the same emotions in me as films in the sense of sadness and laughter. 

I wonder if that's because I can see it coming, like when you watch a film with subtitles, you know the punchline. 

Anyhow, sure this question has been asked many times, the one book or series of books that I find myself revisiting (something I don't do often) is the Adrian Mole series by Sue Townsend. 

Even though there are now 30 years old, they still have me in hysterics. No other book has got anywhere near making me laugh like this. 

Also I think they are probably more funny if you are from the UK, as a teenage boy growing up in 80s Britain is probably a very different person to that in the USA!

Edit: wow, didn't quite expect this response, amazing what great discussion books can lead to!

In summary, a lot of people like Catch 22 and Hitchhikers Guide. 

I'm definitely going to give Catch 22 another go, and have already read HGTTG - yes it was funny.

v2wlg,"Hi r/Books! This has been done before I'm sure, but what the heck. What is the last book you read, current book you're reading and the book you're going to read next?","Alright, little reading background of me. For the first 19 years of my life I've read only books in my native language (Dutch). I wanted to improve my English, and since books improve your vocabulary more so than video games do, I decided it was time to pick up some English books and start reading. First of all I read the Harry Potter series in English (all of which I've read a dozen of times in Dutch, knowing the story helped me a whole lot in learning the meaning of words commonly used in books). After I got through those, I started looking around the internet (reddit) a bit, and found a brilliant post in which the OP asked for books people enjoyed ( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0o94/i_have_not_been_a_book_reader_my_whole_life_and_i/ in case anyone is interested).

Anyways, from that list I found a few books I might be interested in, asked them for my birthday a few weeks back and got quite a good bunch of them (Slaughterhouse 5, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, 1984 and a couple more I can't quite remember as I'm writing this, all the Reddit-classics).

So this finally brings me up to the entire point of my post and I'll kick it all of. Name your last, current and next book to read and if you have any recommendations or verdicts, please tell us.

Last: Slaughterhouse Five. (Loved it, though I've gotten a schoolbook copy instead of the original (called an Easy Reader), which is about 1/3th of the length of the original. The story didn't feel complete at all. I will buy the real deal any day soon and reread it, which I don't mind at all).
Current: Must be the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, just all five of 'em. Because everyone seems to love it so much. I've only just started in book one, but I can only imagine I won't read anything else before I've finished the series.
Next: Probably Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character

Anyway, due to a strange time interference between when a friend of mine said he would be in London and when he is actually going to be in London I have two amazing seats to [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Show](http://www.hitchhikerslive.com) to sell. The show features all the living members of the original radio show, is directed by Dirk Maggs - the man Douglas Adams wanted to complete his vision - and promises lots of special guests from people involved in h2g2 across the course of its life.


The show starts at 7.30pm on the 10th July 2012 at the [Aylsebury Waterside](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&safe=off&gs_upl=153371l153371l0l153604l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=aylesbury+waterside+theatre&cid=0,0,5361786504117461594&ei=wRD_TvgplL7yA6K52JIL&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&ved=0CBsQ_BI) (30-60 mins north of London, easily accessible by train) and these are some incredible seats, third row centre, so you'll be right in the action.


I'm hoping to sell the tickets so I can buy another pair for a night when my friend really is in London and, because it's you reddit, all I'm asking for is £53, the cost of the tickets, and then I'll post them out to you for free! Because I love you.


In the efforts of fairness, I'll offer the tickets up on a first come first served basis. Please PM for confirmation/any questions.


Thanks froods. Have a hoopy new year.

bl1qdy,"Perhaps, I was right not to have read the Hitchhiker's Guide books. Until now.","Guys, I really need to talk to somebody right now, because my life has taken a drastic turn for the worse. It was conveyed to me in writing by the 21st century genius, Douglas Adams, through his amazing Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It's a much beloved romp through space, with scifi-trope deconstruction abound. I found myself really relating to the MC - we all know how important that is, especially is such a captivating epic. Really all I could wish of the series would be a graphic novel adaptation, as I'm fond of that artform, especially after reading Watchmen. The book, as stellar (no pun intended) as it is, can easily be taken from such a point of view that an existential crisis is inevitable. And I'm afraid I've done just that. The latest few weeks have been unkind to me - I couldnt pay down my overdraft from getting the Switch, and I had the most crucial plot points of Endgame spoiled to me here, on reddit. Perhaps, with the books I'm reading I've   become mature enough to consider such deep issues. But I can't handle it at all - I can't live the same way I did, now that I feel the sheer pointlessness and delusion of our human lives. I feel as though all existence is just trifling smoke atop a vast void and it boggles my mind - I mean, wow - how can I ever feel ambitious after what Adams has shown me through the story. I'm filled with utter, horrifying existential dread. Those who had the fortune of basking in this masterpiece's likeness - how have you dealt with this revelation? I've been trying to distract myself by playing some Zelda, but I couldn't concentrate on the game and spilled my drink - now I have a beige couch stain.

It is always praised here as the most hilarious book ever written and I had big expectations. I found it painfully unfunny, as cringy as my dad's jokes.

[The Hitchhiker's Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386162.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) was alright I suppose, definitely not the masterpiece people tend to say it is. I guess I'm just not into that kind of humor.

[The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=DsD8rWHanR&rank=1) bored me so much I had to give up. To be fair, it has nothing to do with the writing but it wasn't what I expected at all.

j9rb70,"""Goodbye And Thank You For All The Fish"" the first time I finish a book in less than a week","I finished the hitchhiker guide to the galaxy in 5 days (breaking 1984 7 days record), and I must say, it was such an awesome book. Relaxing, not too serious, funny, and just the perfect definition of light book. And not just that, it was also inspiring, in its own way, inspiring to think about deep space, and the future as a whole, space travel is suddenly fun and cheerful, kinda like Futurama, not science involved, or even fiction science, it was just light, makes you wonder, again, in it's own way, what the future may hold, and if we will take part of it.

yjaul4,Lore/Guidebooks that exist in the universe they describe,"Stuff like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which actually exists as a guidebook in the story.

A ""meta"" example might be the novel in the movie *Michael Clayton*, which acts as a kind of lore for one of the characters' worldview and helps to guide some of his most important life choices. 

The Necronomicon and The King in Yellow are classic examples, but how far back does the trope go? Do parts of the Old Testament count as this, for parts of the New Testament?

oyuy4,How old should a child be before you introduce them to the Hitchhiker's Guide?,"My younger sister is 9 years old, and has yet to find a book that really sparks her interest in reading. She's fairly into more ""boyish"" nerdy things, like robots, computers, and space, so I think the Hitchhiker's Guide might be a good book to introduce to her. I don't happen to have a copy of the book here, so I can't look through it myself. I've told her some stories based on the hitchhiker's guide (Vogon poetry, whale and bowl of petunias) and she loves them. The problem is, I have no idea how age appropriate these books are. I was always way ahead of my age level, and I think I read these books at about 11, and didn't have much trouble. I have some of the sequels, and they seem to have some more adultish themes that I'm not sure a kid could or should figure out. My question is really, how age appropriate is this book to a nine year old?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oyuy4/how_old_should_a_child_be_before_you_introduce/,2012-01-27 07:05:13,30,14,books

Today I'm here to talk about Space Opera, my new bestselling book that combines the glam and glitter of Eurovision with the wry humor of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and then lights it all on fire. Ask me anything about writing, publishing, Space Opera, my other work, what I had for lunch, how cute my dog is, the air/speed velocity of an unladen swallow, ridiculous television, living in Maine, music trivia--really and honestly anything.

And yes, that means you can also ask me about the upcoming Mass Effect: Annihilation novel, which I also wrote, but I'm not going to give you spoilers, duh.

g5t9tz,I don’t understand: A guide to the galaxy.,"Hi there,

Non-native English speaker here. I just finished Armada and Ready Player One written by Ernest Cline. 

Two books I thought were nice and gentle reads definitely my top 2 favorite books all-time. However those are the first two “real” English books I’ve read. Thankfully I didn’t need an encyclopedia to read them because they were (again) fairly easy to read! :D

However now that I’ve started The Ultimate Guide Through The Galaxy.

I feel like I can’t even properly follow the story because of all the terms being used. 

I’m tempted to come back to it later, what should I do? PLEASE HELP meh",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g5t9tz/i_dont_understand_a_guide_to_the_galaxy/,2020-04-22 02:49:52,17,6,books

Has anyone ever actually read this? I'm trying to read it at the moment and it just seems like complete gibberish. I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is *whimsical*, Alice in Wonderland is *whimsical*. The Satanic Verses just seems like the author took a load of drugs and composited random ramblings and called it ""magical realism"" because it's not even coherent enough to be termed ""fantasy"" neither High nor Low.

I'm thinking it only became famous as a book because of the controversy it caused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a8nkr4/the_satanic_verses/,2018-12-22 19:20:16,59,0,books

lscqsu,The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul,"I just completed Douglas Adams, ""The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul."" I selected the book from my local library purely because of the name attached to it. Adams wrote one of my all-time favorite book series, ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" and I was /invigorated/. I was halfway through the narrative before I researched the book and discovered that it was a sequel to ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency."" It was absolutely wonderful.

Infusing mystery with fantasy (as opposed to Hitchhiker's which infuses an adventurous tone with sci-fi), the novel contains Adams' signature philosophical language and dry, British humor deriving from contemplations thereof. As engrossed as I can become in a novel, it's rare for an author to tickle my funnybone with words the way ole' Douglas does, by which I mean I've actually laughed out loudly upon reading a line or a character's gut-wrenching dialogue.

Of course, if you've never read Adams, the book's peculiar nature and the unpredictable behavior of the character's and narrative's course can make the story hard to follow. Fret not, the narrative and descriptions are particularly vivid, however, mentions of a character's longstanding beef with an unseen character over who can go longest without opening a refrigerator door, or a character experiencing two car collisions in one chapter, or something even more perplexing involving a soda machine that's only briefly explained near the end, can perplex the mind as it may prepare itself for twists but not unpredictable, humorous shifts in tone and dialogue as the narrative bounces from location to location to character to strange character. Douglas Adams has a signature skill in tying the tightest knots regarding the most complex stories.

Check it out! I intend to read the first book as well as return to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series once a full set that I ordered arrives at my home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lscqsu/the_long_dark_teatime_of_the_soul/,2021-02-25 18:05:36,15,56,books
