a2ht93,"I've been reading his biography ""The Frood"". There is a long running and often retold story that the idea for ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" came to him one night while stargazing in a field while on a hitchhiking venture. It's a fun story and likely true for the title at least, but in the years beforehand he dedicated his life to becoming a comedic writer/actor, with the goal of blending science fiction and comedy. He helped form a semi-successful sketch comedy group, worked with several members of Monty Python, was showrunner for a season of Tom Baker era Dr. Who, and developed a strange and ultimately abandoned video project with Run to Star.

I was the only person who selected The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

31gsd8,"I really enjoy the first four books (The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life the Universe and Everything, and So Long and Thanks for all the Fish), but I found the fifth (Mostly Harmless) much less enjoyable. Adams admitted that he was in a rough place when he wrote it, so its not as irreverent or humorous as the others. When my girlfriend read through them, I had her stop after four. 

But in my opinion, the first four are well written, satirical, sarcastic, she still remaining a straight forward sci-fi story.",,2015-04-05 02:06:41
31gsd8,"If anything, read it just for the sake of experiencing one of the most unique and fresh writing styles to have ever existed. Adams had a way of saying things that no author I've read has come close to emulating. The opening line from the Guide:

""""Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.""

whd18p,"The Encyclopedia Galactica says this about ones first experience with The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy: ""One becomes abundantly aware that this is a piece of art that one will wish to experience again, for the first time"". This was recorded by an Earthling who had met a man named Ford Perfect who wasn't infact a man at all but an editor of this very guide.  Ford, knowing the planet's fate, had lent him a copy to review after drunkenly discussing his current employment the day before Earth's planned destruction. Excitedly the earthing shared his insight on a local communications network with much delight.  It was only later that next morning when he saw an oddly shaped brick like object hanging in the air that he also recalled the words written on the front cover - ""Don't Panic"". So he ignored this oddity and continued to calmly make his tea and enjoy it thoroughly prior to the elimination of his homeworld. He had correctly assumed the impossibility of survival and was one of only two humans that were not panicking the moment of the planet's destruction.  The other was a man who had just awoken and thought to himself ""What a strange dream"".",CaptainPiracy,2022-08-06 09:45:56

4o6dy1,"When I was in elementary school I hated reading, I thought I wasn't good at it because I couldn't get into the stories. Then my stepmother gave me two books and told me I was grounded until I read them. One was a three story compendium of ""Myth-Adventures""  by Robert Lynn Aspirin and the other was the inaptly described trilogy ""The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"". I was grounded for less than 2 weeks and have been a voracious reader ever since.",DisappointTheFuture,2016-06-16 05:31:51
k3fy46,"I sadly didn't like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy at all. It just felt a little too random. It wasn't funny, it was just random, and somehow that was the funny part of it. Like a bunch of college kids got together one night and smoked a little too much weed. 

I expected more from what keeps getting recommended as the funniest book on everyones bookshelves.",,2020-11-29 20:10:04
k3fy46,"It's also important to note that the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy is as much philosophy as it is humour. What makes it truly masterful is how well he predicted the future from half a century ago and his use of surrealist satire to poke at the continued social commentary. 

He makes philosophical jabs at British panel shows, psychology, subatomic physics, lawyers, immortality, pundits, shoe stores, logical fallacies, erosion and environmentalism, politicians and politics, beaurocracy, egos, eat drink and be merry worldviews, human stupidity, hairdressers, telephone sanitation workers, consultants and those that made fun of telephone sanitation workers. 

And that's just what I can remember. 

If you don't see past the surrealism, the book may be too deep for you— because alot of what gives it weight is that underlying philosophy of nihilism. 

I would recommend two things: if you don't like HGTTG because of the gags, I would recommend his book Last Chance To See. He considered it his best book, but like all best books, it sold the least. I personally loved it— and as far as I can tell it avoids many of the tropes you disliked about his more noteworthy work.

The second I would recommend would be the original audio plays— the actors being so much into a 25 minute production. It's hard to hear the characters in anything but that voice.",NotsoNewtoGermany,2020-11-30 12:34:14

37k4sv,"Think of the movie as an amazing fan tribute to the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. I looked at it this way and I loved it.

However, it deviates immensely from the book. IMO making a movie adaption is not possible of an universe as complex and rich as Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy.",immahonest,2015-05-28 11:51:58
37k4sv,"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy humor comes from the way the words were written.  A film would not be able to pick up on many of the humorous details as the film would be visable and only actions of the characters could be used to protray humor.

An example of this is the opening chapter of the book when our hero (of sorts) wakes up, is shaving in the mirror and knows there is something important he has forgotten while he suffers from a hangover.  Of course that forgotten moment was his house being plowed under within a few hours.  How would a movie be able to show the humor behind the thoughts of a character unlerss they 'say' his thoughts in more of a narrative?  This slice of humor would be watered down in a visual format compared to the delightful way the written word describes it.  Within this book are hundreds of small moments like this that make up the entire theme of the book that a movie wouldn't be able to convey.

Watching the movie was like reading Cliff Notes.  It is far better to read the book.",lisabauer58,2015-05-28 16:03:32

The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and 
The HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy. 
Both poked at the beast that is ""normal society"" and let me know I wasn't alone in my questioning of everything. 
It all seems so mundane nowadays, but in my early teens these shaped my thinking in ways that still affect me.
Also, although not a book , Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" - huge impact.  I lost my Dad when I was 3, came from a big crazy tight family  -   I Turn 50 next week,
So the thinking you all take for granted now was not obviously present, publicly at least, in my youth. It certainly existed in a big way, but it wasn't accessible and obvious to us youngin's at the time.   ",Quiet_one,2013-08-17 12:54:49

7y5w4t,"As I was growing up there was always this book on our bookshelf at home called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I never really paid much attention to the title I would see the words The Hitchhikers Guide and blow it off. We had other travel guides and that one just seem to fit in with those. Over the years my mother would prompt me to read it several times and every time I had put it off thinking why would I wanna read some hitchhikers guide...

Shortly after I graduated High School both of my parents passed away and as I was going through packing things up I came across the little book from the bookshelf. I decided to open it and I read the first page, sitting on the floor next to the bookshelf I read the first page and then I read the entire book in one sitting and I cried, I laughed and I cried. I laughed at the hilarious insanity of everything that went on in that book and I cried because my mother had tried to share that with me and I had never taken advantage of that.

The entire book is full of awesomeness I’ve read it and all the other books in the Hitchhikers trilogy at least once a year since that time. It’s been 15 years now and every time I read it again, I think about my mom and how much she enjoyed it and how much she knew that I would enjoy it.",timeforincognito,2018-02-17 16:59:08
