bs3bus,"Just read my first Terry Prachett novel, Going Postal, and I have to say I'm a big fan!",My favorite part of this book is the underlying themes being thrown around about corporate corruption and the workers on the clacks towers. It had such a wierd parallel to some experiences in my life. I used to work in a warehouse/machine shop with crappy pay and far too many hours. There were definitely people there who we considered lifers due to their wierd allegience to the company no matter how it treated them. There had been everything from lost limbs to deaths at this place and still they managed to hold this wierd allegience to their job.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bs3bus/just_read_my_first_terry_prachett_novel_going/,2019-05-23 14:03:02,257,1466,books
uxlv52,Going Postal by Mark Ames,"Seventeen years on and I can't think of any book that better captures just why this keeps happening in America. The central thesis of [*Going Postal: Rage, Murder, and Rebellion from Reagan's Workplaces to Clinton's Columbine and Beyond*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64821.Going_Postal?) is that mass shootings are not the crime of any specific type of person but rather an endemic reaction to neoliberal capitalism. An atomized, nihilistic attempt at rebellion against a society that constantly devalues human beings in favor of transferring wealth upward to an oligarch class. Ames demonstrates how the political becomes personal, where these dehumanizing structures descend into the petty tyranny everyone experiences from bosses and from their peers in school. The really grim part of his conclusion is that removing the guns wouldn't do much to stop the killings, just reduce the body counts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uxlv52/going_postal_by_mark_ames/,2022-05-25 17:01:08,5,20,books
fpmgq3,"Took advantage of the quarantine to read Terry Pratchett's ""Going Postal,"" and wow. If you were like me and saw Pratchett's prolific writing as a sign of inferior quality.. DON'T!","I have had Pratchett's Discworld series on my list for years but always hesitated. Thinking to myself, ""Surely a series with that many books can't maintain any level of quality."" But I was wrong. To quote the SF Chronicle:

>""Full of nimble wordplay, devious plotting, and outrageous situations, but always grounded in an astute understanding of human nature.. an especially fine entry point to the series.""

This will probably get lost in new since so many of you know and have read his work, but if anyone is hesitating I recommend it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpmgq3/took_advantage_of_the_quarantine_to_read_terry/,2020-03-26 23:48:02,110,506,books
maonh8,Just finished reading my first Discworld novel Going Postal - wow!,"As the title says, just finished Going Postal and it's amazing. Quite different to what I expected too. It's funny and a light read at a certain level but also touches on big topics! But without making the whole story grim or boring. 

I've had Pratchett's books in my to read list for years but thinking that there's about 50 books that he wrote has always put me off. I thought with such fast writing the quality would be lower but it really isn't! So glad I gave it a go and I guess I will be picking up Mort next.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/maonh8/just_finished_reading_my_first_discworld_novel/,2021-03-22 14:17:46,20,83,books
618ix6,Funny coincidence I noticed while reading Going Postal.,"I'm reading Going Postal at the moment, and just came across this quote:  
  
>“People flock in, nevertheless, in search of answers to those questions only librarians are considered to be able to answer, such as ""Is this the laundry?"" ""How do you spell surreptitious?"" and, on a regular basis, **""Do you have a book I remember reading once? It had a red cover and it turned out they were twins.”**   
  
That seemed strangely familiar. I've just been reading a collection of Orwell essays, and I checked it. The following quote is from 'Bookshop Memories':  
  

>""Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear old lady who ‘wants a book for an invalid' (a very common demand, that), **and the other dear old lady who read such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a copy. Unfortunately she doesn't remember the title or the author's name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had a red cover.**""  
  
I'm new to this sub and its rules (this post was originally going to be an [image link](http://imgur.com/IQ6NovP) before I learned better) so I'm sorry if this is too shallow an observation, I just thought it was funny. Please feel free to dive into deep discussion about the ways authors consciously or unconsciously or coincidentally repeat each other's ideas, with references to jungian archetypes and My Purple Scented Novel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/618ix6/funny_coincidence_i_noticed_while_reading_going/,2017-03-24 12:05:46,12,24,books
