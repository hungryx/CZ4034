10y8b19,Happy 50th Anniversary to The Princess Bride,"Technically the real anniversary date would be the 1st of September, but we are at least in the same year!

I know we can't take anything promised by William Goldman seriously, he is a comedian at heart, but it does make me sad he is no longer alive to write Buttercup's Baby or publish a 50th year anniversary letter to us fans.

I wanted to ask if anyone could think of an author who you would trust to write it, seeing how Stephen King was recommended but turned it down, or is it best the way it is? A single chapter at the end of a great book.

Side note: I once convinced my entire class of seniors that if they could find a Florinese unabridged copy of S Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure I would give them 100% in their English Capstone class for the year and have to do no other work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10y8b19/happy_50th_anniversary_to_the_princess_bride/,2023-02-09 22:28:54,243,5579,books
ok1x4u,Just finished The Princess Bride,"Charming and enjoyable, of course, particularly the famous extended sequence where the masked man in black fights Inigo Montoya, Fezzik and Vizzini one after the other. Those scenes are truly a highlight of swashbuckling adventure, even if it's a parody. But it's a very fond parody, which is something that the best parodies usually are.

I was surprised by the framing device, with the authors digressions about the fictional author and the book he was adapting, his fictional family and the writing business. They were funny, original and interesting, but also surprisingly bitter at times, in a tone that is not that suited for child readers, like his loveless family (although I suppose most of it would go over their heads). 

If you have 30th anniversary edition my advice is to skip the 30th and 25th anniversary introductions, and the Buttercup's Baby teaser chapter. While they are funny extras, I think when considered as part of the book they are a bit too much, and tip the balance away from the adventure. The book works better if you think of those as optional extras and not as part of the main experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ok1x4u/just_finished_the_princess_bride/,2021-07-14 10:56:07,320,3898,books
4e46v0,The Princess Bride,"So last weekend I found out the movie was on Netflix and I watched it for the first time and it became one of my favorites. I asked myself, why am I just now seeing this? I've always known it was a book, but never read it. After the movie, I thought about looking for it. I was at work yesterday looking through books available on Kindle unlimited and saw it was on there and immediately started reading it (well, after texting my husband an overly excited message about how I found the book). I finished the book about an hour ago and wow, I LOVED it. I asked myself the same question, how am I just now reading this?? It's definitely a favorite for me now. I absolutely loved Fezzik and his rhyming. Inigo and his struggle to avenge his father. I loved it all. After I finished reading it, I was just sitting thinking about the book and how I'm so glad I read it and my husband turns to me and asks if I'm okay lol. Sorry for rambling, I just wanted to share with you all my love for this book.

i2278m,The Princess Bride made me furious until I realized I was an idiot,"Ok, so my wife and I recently watched the Princess Bride with our kids. I loved it again, fantastic movie.  As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

I would highly recommend it. The characters are vivid and enjoyable, and I really enjoyed the book-within-a-book format. I was fooled for a little bit thinking that it was a genuine adaptation of an older book, by the fictional S.Morgenstern, and I really loved the little asides the author makes as if explaining his “edits”.

akoxx9,What is it about the Princess Bride?,"William Goldman's idea to make *The Princess Bride* a movie was rejected so hard he turned his screenplay into a novel. Then, when it finally was made into a movie over a decade later, it was a flop. Yet somehow, *The Princess Bride* has become one of the most well-loved stories in recent memory.

For my own part I saw the movie first (I think that's pretty common). It was on TV, and I was instantly pulled in by the man in black taking out Buttercup's kidnappers one by one. By the time they left the Fire Swamp I was a die-hard fan. Recently I've been re-reading the novel, and trying to figure out what exactly it is about *The Princess Bride* that makes it so well-loved.

**Why do you think** ***The Princess Bride*** **is a masterpiece?** Is it the way it blends comedy with action? Is it how it subverts the fairy tale, making it unpredictable and unique?

**Or maybe you think** ***The Princess Bride*** **is overrated?** Why do you think so many people love it when you find it sub-par?

phqv4s,The Princess Bride is one of the few of which I love both the book and its movie adaptation,"As an adult, I still enjoy reading children's books. I love discovering how an otherwise cliche plot has a whole new meaning when reading it as an adult. (A special mention to A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness.)

This was how I discovered The Princess Bride three years ago. Once I started reading it, I just can't seem to stop. And once I finished reading it, I watched its movie adaptation after. And what an experience it was. There were so many things I love about the book and its movie.

One of the great things about The Princess Bride was the characters. Each of them have their own individualities and the casts of the movie just made it better! There's a reason why TPB was always mentioned on discussions about perfect casting. The casts really brought more life to the book characters.

There were many details in the book that were unfortunately not included in the movie, e.g. Prince Humperdinck's ""marriage proposal"" to Buttercup and how the story was told from the point of view of the omniscient narrator (this was the first time I read a book in this writing style and I really really enjoyed reading the narrator's shenanigans). BUT if there was one thing that the movie made iconic, then it's R.O.U.S! When those things came out of the movie, I was not prepared. I thought I was, but I was not.

The Princess Bride has a special place in my heart and one of the few books that I want to have a physical copy of and pass on to the next generation.

Edit: Thank you for all the recommendations, everyone! I may not reply to each one of you,  but I've read all your comments and made notes.

(Btw it took me a second to be florin isn't a country what is this guy talking about before I realized the author part was fictional too.) I don't feel for the author as a character. But I'm in the middle of the buttercup's baby so maybe there is something else.

So my question is, is there a specific term for a storytelling technique where a character is reading the story from another book? Is it a meta narrative?

koo5wh,The Princess Bride by William Goldman," Hey guys how are you today? Also, btw, Happy New Years! Anyway, lol, today I want to send a review about The Princess Bride by William Goldman. So, here we go.   


Review: This is an amazing book. Goldman manages to use a lot of elements, including comedy, fantasy, drama, romance, swashbuckling, adventure, fairy tales, and more to craft a wonderfully imagined fantasy. I also really like the way that the book is presented as an abridgement (the good parts version) of S Morgenstern's The Princess Bride, which makes it unique from other books I've read. I like this metafictional aspect too. It was very nostalgic for me and reminded me of my early days when I saw tales of people saving damsels, fencing, and more. I liked this adventure and Westley's death was emotional. However, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. It felt very underwhelming and anticlimactic. Other than that, it was a neatly written book.  


Rating: 9.4/10 ⭐  


Well, let me know what you though about my review and the book in the comment section below. See ya around!  


PS: I'm also going reading Buttercup's Baby. This was intended to be a sequel, but couldn't get fully published due to legal issues with the Morgenstern estate (obviously fictional). This is reprinted in my book, which I got from the library. It contains an explanation as to why Goldman could only abridge the first chapter and why he couldn't get it published and the abridged chapter. Really, it was just a sample chapter. However, in an interview, Goldman said he doesn't have ideas for BB. It turns out that there will be a 50th Anniversary Edition of The Princess Bride (coming in 2023) that will contain the full version, as the 30th Anniversary Edition only contained hints to the sequel's plot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/koo5wh/the_princess_bride_by_william_goldman/,2021-01-02 01:48:23,14,14,books
o1o1zk,I don't like The Princess Bride (Half hearted paragraphs),"Below are spoilers if you wanted to experience Saint Morgenstern's classic tale of high adventure and true love. (I read William Goldman's abridged version)

Why do I dislike the book? I think for me, Westley ruins it. He's such a central character that flaws will screw up most of the book. His drive to live is absolutely ridiculous, and he can survive crazy situations because of this. This is mostly a rant about Westley and his plot armor, so I will rarely mention other characters, save Fezzik.

Anyways, Westley is a big dumb idiot dingleberry. Now, if I were to elaborate, he can survive way too many things, no matter how many times he should have been absolutely bodied by other characters. First, in chronological order, his survival of the Dread Pirate Robert. Bob here kills everyone, but Westley survives by being a gentleman and asking nicely. That's understandable, and this event is a solid event with minimal armor. Next up, his duel with Inigo. This is where I get saltier than the Dead Sea. He beats Inigo with a classic ""This isn't even my final form"" by switching to his dominant hand. Not only is this complete bullshit, but he beats Inigo. Inigo is a wizard, and studied for 12 or so years for his abilities. Westley studied for 3 years at most, as the book confirms he started dueling after his capture by the Dread Pirate. He absolutely bodies Inigo and moves onto our next instance, his fight with Fezzik. Fezzik should have yeeted Westley, but Westley again bodies Fezzik. A little more understandable, since Westley probably had to wrestle goats or something on the farm. Lastly, his battle of wits with Vizzini. How in the name of RNGesus did he have the dream luck of being immune to a deadly poison? How??

Next is his fall from the ravine. Bloody hell, he shrugs off FALL DAMAGE. No broken bones, nothing. It was a steep ravine of which he could not climb up from. Afterwards, he waltzes into the fire swamp. Nothing wrong there, just a bit bizarre. Time skip to his death. He dies, but fuck him he's Jesus Christler Pacifica. He is revived by a chocolate pill made by a couple of crackheads. After that

Well its my bedtime. See ya, will edit in future maybe. (This was low effort, don't upvote it)

EDITS: (Continued from after that)

After that, he is wheelbarrowed in by none other than big boy Fezzik and Inigo ""You killed my father, prepare to die"" Montoya. Of course, they charge the gate, which is defended by brutes. Correct me if I'm wrong, but guards of that respect should be trained to take on a group of aquatic bandits, but NYEH, they run to their mothers because they soiled their trousers. Of course, Buttercup is rescued by Westley, and I cannot fault Westley just chilling in Humperdinck's bed. That is something I like because it feels so much like ""Hello there!"" from Episode III, Revenge of the Sith. 

This is a short blurb on Fezzik's plot armor. Again, I read the Abridged version By William Goldman, so this may be incorrect in the context of the book by Morgenstern. Anyways, it appears that Fezzik is saved by a typical ""I was prepared for your move!"" . He's saved from being sniped by Humper of Dincks by wearing a flaming Jacket. A flaming Jacket. For the love of God, why? And he's saved from this so he can be a tank to take the rest of the gang to an island in the middle of nowhere so Westley can copulate with Reese's Peanut Buttercup. Later, he dies, so it makes me wonder why in the bloody name of Sir Leigh Teabing that he is kept alive. In other words, it appears to me that he is kept alive so he can die later. Like, what the flying fish was that?  >:-(

Back to Westley, he's a fucking anime protagonist. That's my primary hate, as plot armor makes me insanely angry. For the same reason I absolutely hate The Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi, the amount of bullshit in the book is unmistakable.

When I got older it changed to Fezzik, but I think that might have had to do with the fact that I was learning about who Andre the Giant was and it really made Fezzik seem all that much more lovable. And recently I can't help but realize that every single line said by Vizzini is one of my favourites. I love his self-confidence, even if he does come off as an ass half the time.

He walked like a crab, side to side..."" [Here's an image of Humperdinck from the 2017 hardcover edition.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsdpCWcnbvW/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet)

In the novel Count Rugen is suave and intellectual, and Humperdinck just a brute who wants nothing more than to murder animals all day every day. In the movie I feel like Rugen and Humperdinck are interchangeable as far as how they're portrayed.

To people who have read the book and seen the movie: Which way to do you think works better?

To people who haven't read the book: Would you have liked to see Humperdinck be portrayed as more animalistic, or would it not have felt believable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aem0a3/prince_humperdinck_the_princess_bridebook_v_movie/,2019-01-10 18:43:15,8,3,books
aac3x0,Buttercup (The Princess Bride/Book v Movie),"I was looking over The Princess Bride. The first time I'd read it, I felt like the movie didn't stray too far from the book, but this time I couldn't help but notice how much of Buttercup's background and character arc are completely cut from the movie.

**Gone from the movie:** *her parents, her distain from being girly and making herself pretty to attract boys, her difficulty trying to live a normal life when people keep putting her on a pedestal, her realization that she needs to put Westley and her family before her own needs.* 

All of that's just from the first chapter!

I felt like movie Buttercup is portrayed as a selfish woman, and while she does suffer in the film, nothing she experiences really changes her personality. She stays selfish right up until the ending credits. 

Am I crazy? Did you get a different impression of Buttercup from the movie versus the book? Let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aac3x0/buttercup_the_princess_bridebook_v_movie/,2018-12-28 17:08:16,6,8,books
aidfaq,Life Isn't Fair (The Princess Bride/A Series of Unfortunate Events),"I recently noticed some interesting similarities between *The Princess Bride* and *A Series of Unfortunate Events*. Other than the fact that they're both written by fictional authors (S. Morgenstern and Lemony Snicket, respectively), they are both stories that turn fair tales on their head, and are essentially about how life isn't fair.

In *The Princess Bride* this is a concept repeated by multiple characters, and (in the book anyway) the ending has two of the main characters suddenly die, and the other two basically about to get captured and killed. In *A Series of Unfortunate Events* Snicket is begging the reader to stop reading, because it's only going to get worse and promises the ending will be sad (which, in a bitter-sweet way it sort of is).

I guess my question is: Why do authors use comedy and fairy tales to write about how life isn't fair? Both of these are aimed at younger readers, so is it just a way to lesson the blow for kids? Or is it more complicated than that? What are you thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aidfaq/life_isnt_fair_the_princess_bridea_series_of/,2019-01-21 19:04:07,9,4,books

Are there any times when you actually liked the movie more?

I have 2 examples where I actually liked the movie version more than the book.

1 The Hunt for Red October (Tom Clancy) I liked the book and consider it a good book but there is something about the movie that really grabbed me and emotionally involved me more than the book.

2. The Shawshank Redemption (Stephen King, novella in Different Seasons). I liked the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" but it was just a nice story. The film, I consider it one of the greatest films of all time. A masterpiece.

1bhr4xz,Finally got around to reading Tress of the Emerald Sea and its now some of my favorite fantasy of all time.,"Finally got around to reading Tress of the Emerald Sea and man, I cannot say enough good about this book. What an incredible, beautiful adventure by one of the best voices in Fantasy right now.

The story is set on a world where oceans are made not of water, but of spores that fall from the many moons of the world. The spores of the Emerald Sea, where our story begins, explode into towering, and sometimes deadly or destructive, vines when they get wet. Other spores have different but similarly catastrophic effects.

It starts with our lead, a young girl known as Tress on a small island who collects cups from places she's never been, in love with a prince who loves her back, and the story immediately drew me in. I was given big Princess Bride vibes as the prince was sent off against his wishes to find a princess to marry, and when he's betrayed by his father and sent to his doom, Tress decides the only sensible thing is to cross the deadly sea to rescue him.

And so begins a beautiful adventure story, full of fantastic characters on both sides. The villains are properly hateful and intimidating, the side characters are memorable and endearing, and the journey Tress goes through  is made all the better by their inclusion.

This is cozy fantasy at its absolute best and I cannot suggest it enough. 10/10.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bhr4xz/finally_got_around_to_reading_tress_of_the/,2024-03-18 13:47:36,41,138,books

wvy7sv,What do you think about the idea that “the book is always better”?,"So it's even become a meme that the book is always better. IMO, the book tends to be better, but there are clear exceptions. Especially if the film is a masterpiece or a cornerstone of modern cinema, or if the book is not very good.

The Godfather and Jaws are some examples. The Social Network: an Oscar winning film made out of a sensationalist nonfiction book. Or even Ready Player One, which is a very middling Spielberg film adapted out of a book many people love to hate.

And there are even cases where the book and the movie are great in their own spheres, sometimes even contradicting themselves: The Shining, The Princess Bride, even Jurassic park.

Its almost exactly like the movie, however there are slight differences, like Princess Buttercup is SUPER conceited, full of her self and I feel like her love isnt as strong in the book. That is all fine, BUT THE AUTHORS FUCKING ASIDES!!

He ruined the book for me. He came off so full of himself, and kept referring to feeling of wanting to cheat on hiss wife and how he hates his ""fat spoiled little brat of a son"". it was completely unnecessary for him to take you out of the story just to talk about himself.

11fkja7,"Finally finished ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas, and I'm dying to talk about it"," I recently finished The Count of Monte Cristo and my goodness do I have some thoughts on it. It took me about five months to finish it but every second kept me engrossed. It started when I read a post here probably close to a year ago singing its praises, and immediately put it on my ever-growing 'to read' list. After getting it for my birthday last year, I finally sat down and started reading it in early September of 2022.

Coming from reading basically only non-fiction works, I was surprised by how this book *immediately* got me hooked. I fell in love with Edmond Dantes character, and his betrayal, loss and heartbreak genuinely affected me. I found myself so frustrated at his turmoil, and wanted nothing more than his revenge to be brutal and all encompassing. Seeing the fall from grace of this young, idealistic and just genuinely good hearted kid, into a cynical, mean-spirited and extravagant man was just something that made me feel emotions from words on a page I had never experienced previously.

Really the entire cast of characters Dumas created I found to be extremely compelling and interesting to read about. Off the top of my head there's Noirteir, the entire Danglars family, Andrea Cavalcanti, and Haydèe to name a few. And of course the titular Count was the star of the show every time he appeared on page. I found myself as in awe of him as were the people around him. His long drawn out plan of revenge was as fun to behold as it was impossible to predict. I do wish we could've heard about the aftermath of all the characters. I was particularly interested in what happened afterwards to more minor characters such as Andrea and Franz specifically. I felt as though their characters had quite a lot of build-up but were essentially forgotten about once they'd fulfilled their purpose to the Count. 

Other than that, the bit of a slog in the middle, and a few minor gripes (Didn't get the translation by Buss so apparently there were quite a few changes and removals made in my translation) I think this is quite possible my favorite book I've read. Certainly my longest read!

I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts!

Edit: Also for all those wondering, I read the Barnes and Nobles bound leatherback edition. The translator is uncredited, but it is the unabridged version.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11fkja7/finally_finished_the_count_of_monte_cristo_by/,2023-03-01 22:38:23,433,3029,books

b6a6jf,I just finished The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle,"Mild spoilers? I don't see where to tag the post itself. 

I came into this book with no knowledge of it and mediocre expectations, and it has become one of my favorites, and certainly the best book I've read in a year or more. The poems drew me in almost immediately, but because they are brilliant but because they fit the tone of the story so nicely. 

I love how it takes an earnest look at fairy tales and their tropes, and mocks them while at the same time giving them real validity in the story. We're invited to laugh at the cliché of a hero giving a gruesome ogre head to earn the princess's favor (the ogre harmonizing is one of the best little details just casually thrown in there), while at the same time we are shown the very real and positive change in the character as a result of becoming a hero. He becomes a true hero not just because he slayed ogres, rather by slaying ogres he demonstrates that he has gained purpose and has begun to learn to care about something.

I feel like this book successfully does what *The Princess Bride* book tries to do. I nearly hated that book by the end (though there are parts I liked), because *The Princess Bride* only mocks the tropes and presents a very cynical take on what might happen in a 'realistic' fairy tale. It's rather unlikeable on purpose, and I didn't enjoy that. *The Last Unicorn*, however, presents the best of both worlds. Schmendrick is almost the embodiment of this, he is both wise and foolish, immortal and mortal, magic and not magic, heroic and cowardly, sensible and absurd. He points out the absurdities and then follows that with a good reason for their existence. I think he's the most compelling character by far, though Molly Grue gives him a run for his money. I love how sensible she is and full of the everyday sort of wisdom, even though she too has her foolish moments because she is human.

o14xzf,Catcher in the Rye: I Don’t Get It,"Borrowed Catcher off of my Religion teacher, and as I am working as an in school exam attendant, I’ve had plenty of time to read (finished The Princess Bride, great, Morriseys autobiography, not enough on the Smiths, finished Catcher, and started Fault in our Stars). All I really knew about Catcher was that Holden is a troubled teenager, and that it is a masterpiece. I did enjoy the book, but it didn’t strike me as amazing. Holden is entertaining and in someways relatable, but there’s never any huge change of his character. I’d love a discussion about the book. A few questions on the plot:
1. Does Holden end up in a mental institution? (“The psychoanalyst they have here”,”the woman’s wing”.)
2. Was Holden previously molested/assaulted? (Mentions people getting “Pervy” at least “20 times in my life”)
3. Does his mother have clinical depression? I suspect so as he uses the word “depresses” for anything that makes him feel in any way negative, showing a familiarity with the word but perhaps not it’s true meaning.

a4mvva,Is S. Morgenstern Real? (The Princess Bridge),"I know S. Morgenstern isn't actually real, but I was wondering what people thought about William Goldman inventing this fictional author of the Princess Bride.

Do you think S. Morgenstern is an interesting device in the novel, or do you feel it detracts from the proper story?

Why was all mention of S. Morgenstern removed from the movie adaptation? Do you think it's because it would have been too confusing for an audience? Or do you think it would have made the movie overly-complicated to include the subplot of William Goldman abridging it for his son?

Was there ever a moment when you did think S. Morgenstern was real? My sister actually convinced me he was real the first time I read the book. So I was a little disappointed when, a few chapters in, I realized he had to be an invention of Goldman.

And finally, do you know any other novels that include a fictional author (I know George R.R. Martin did something similar when he wrote *The World of Ice & Fire: The Untold History of Westeros*)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a4mvva/is_s_morgenstern_real_the_princess_bridge/,2018-12-09 17:46:31,23,9,books

I don't know if the key was the books I decided to read or the mood I was in, but those were good times...before something terrible happened to me. 

I read *The Princess Bride*.

That  was indeed a terrible thing for me, because I absolutely hated it. Didn't like the characters nor the pace or the dialogues in it. And finishing that book left me with a feeling of tiredness that made me stop reading books. I tried to read two after that, but I couldn't go through the first pages. I was just blocked and lost the desire to read. That happened a year ago, I haven't read since.

ajy6q9,Just finished The Godfather by Mario Puzo {Spoilers},"I'll be honest, the book took me over 6 days to read and it's less than 500 pages. But my Lord, never before have I been so enraptured in a novel. So intense. I just watched the movie because I'd never seen it and I truly am blown away.

The Godfather is one of those rare types of stories that I've forever fallen in love with, since the first story I read that featured my favorite trope, a man larger than life. Like The Count in The Count of Monte Cristo, Ged in the Earthsea Quartet, Kelsier in the Mistborn series, Hub and Garth in Second Hand Lions, Westley in The Princess Bride, even Ferris in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 

Michael and Vito were larger than life. I wrote in my review, ""The story focuses on the importance of family and friendship more than anything. It focuses on the fierce pride one has for his heritage. It focuses on the deep, sometimes sacrificial love one person can feel for another. It focuses on compromise, decisions, war strategy, social climbing and power hungry struggles. What it means to kill a person, what a life is worth. The value of the family unit. Of marital unity, of love in and outside marriage. Forgiveness. Of quieting your anger, of letting hateful rage grow cold. And it focuses on, my favorite, revenge."" 

Ever since I first watched Kill Bill as a kid I've been searching for something as revenge-filled, and I thought the book The Count of Monte Cristo fit the bill (and it still does) but as I read The Godfather I couldn't contain myself from gasping and saying ""oh shit"" every couple of pages.

ameevz,Tired of authors pushing romantic relationships that don't really help the plot,"I recently got into reading books again and randomly picked up a set of Dan Brown's books. Currently read about three of them and now on the fourth one and oh my days every single book has a romantic relationship developing that doesn't add to anything besides entertaining lonely single moms. 

Probably it's not only me who gets annoyed when they put some romance in the book just for the sake of it but I really feel the whole plot would be much more appealing without it. Like why can't female and male just  work together without having any sexual tension going on and rather just focus on the thing they're trying to solve. It's not like you want to fuck every coworker of yours in real life.

Oof this got a bit ranty but I already noticed they do it in movies that are not necessarily romcoms and annoyed to find it in books as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ameevz/tired_of_authors_pushing_romantic_relationships/,2019-02-02 14:15:59,76,111,books
xdrlj0,is there a specific term for a variation on the epistolary novel format that is essentially a single metafictional work rather than a series of letters/documents?,"Background: I recently read an story that was structured as a series of excerpts from various fictional academic works, a style that the author attributed to the “AlternateHistory” online forum. I found myself wishing I could read the rest of the “books” that these “quotes” came from. Those particular ones don’t actually exist, of course, but it got me thinking that something similar is probably out there. 

So my question is essentially “has this been done before, and what would you call it?”: a novel in the format of a fictional academic text? And does this style occur outside the alternate history genre? 

I thought this would be considered an epistolary novel, but every example of epistolary works that I know of consists of many letters/documents, unless it’s a diary.

Whether it's stress, or because I read a lot of intense books in a row and need a breather, or just because I remember something from one of them and suddenly need to be in that world again.

One frequent reread: the tales of the amoral, blindingly intelligent, often drunk, Master Li Kao and his former client and now companion, the innocent, massive, eternally loyal Number Ten Ox.

Barry Hughart wrote three books about them --  ""Bridge of Birds,"" ""The Story of the Stone"" and ""Eight Skilled Gentlemen"" -- with the intention of writing seven in total. He quit after problems with publishers and because he said he was falling into a pattern and wanted to stop while he was ahead. But at least we have the three.

I can't say they're unknown, since ""Bridge of Birds"" won the World Fantasy Award, but I don't hear about them as much these days and that's a shame.

1bkk8ss,"My journey to Stephen King's ""Holly"" reminded me of kindness and why I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again","“Holly” by Stephen King was a book I couldn't wait to devour but I wanted to get into it the right way. I went on a Holly-inspired reading marathon so I could jump in and be fully caught up. I’m talking about taking an entire week off of work to enjoy a BOOKcation with everything involving Holly. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, I devoured four novels and an entire short story collection written by King that featured Holly and it was such a rewarding reading experience.  
  
Just so you know, to get the most out of “Holly” I highly recommend that you read all five books she is in before reading this novel. The order to read them are…  
  
Mr. Mercedes -> Finders Keepers -> End of Watch -> The Outsider -> If It Bleeds -> Holly  
  
Now before I jump into my review of this novel, here’s a list of the trigger warnings I found while reading…  
  
\- Homophobic comments  
\- COVID-19 pandemic  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Politics  
\- Racism  
\- Sexual harassment  
\- Rape  
\- Abortion  
\- Cancer  
\- Alzheimer’s Disease  
\- School shootings  
  
If any of these trigger you, please don’t read this novel. One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion.  
  
As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate.  
  
Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc.  
  
In my opinion, King is 76 years old and will be 77 years old on 9/21/24. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong.  
  
These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life.  
  
Anywho, I loved this novel so much and I would consider it one of the best he's written if you go on this Holly journey. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there.  
  
Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his legendary work.  
  
The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her novel and not only what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things.  
  
To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time.  
  
Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful.  
  
Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance.  
  
It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me.  
  
Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending.  
  
I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did make me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created.  
  
I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all the novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again.

haduo8,Classic books where you preferred the movie more?,"Have you guys ever read a classic book and preferred the movie more?  
A few months ago I read little women and I thought it was already and I later watched the 1994 movie and absolutely loved it. I think it was partly to do with the fact I loved the cast so much (Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes) but it did more for me than the book did. Ironically it kinda killed my interest in the 2019 one (which was kinda what made me read it in the first place) that and I really didn't like the look from the trailer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/haduo8/classic_books_where_you_preferred_the_movie_more/,2020-06-16 22:01:49,26,6,books

r0zpdq,Wheel of Time: Skip the books but (probably) watch the TV series,"*The main motivation for writing this review is to attempt to articulate why someone may choose to skip reading the Wheel of Time (WoT) books, but may still want to watch the TV series. All I've ever heard is that the series is amazing. Yet, now that I've read the series, if I could go back in time and advise myself, I'd say skip the books and wait for the TV series (which I haven't watched, but I'm assuming will not have many of the flaws I'll identify below because the writing issues are not likely to be present in film).*

*I've had the WoT series on my list of books to read for at least ten years. During that time, I consistently heard good things about the series. Yet, when I read the series, I found it to be disappointing.*

*Perhaps the constant praise created a false sense of greatness? One that was unrealistic and unachievable?*

*Or maybe those who recommended the series read it when they were young. I'm not young, and I imagine that if I were to read these books in my teens, I may not be bothered as many of the below detailed issues.*

*For WoT books 1-11 written by Robert Jordan, here are the things that I found distracting and likely caused a lack of excitement for the series:*

\--

Weak conflict and little risk to characters. The story tends to be an explanation of success. Bad guys in the story only pop in when convenient and generally offer the possibility of resistance. Actual, tangible resistance comes in the form of disappointing finale battles that are lackluster and concluded in a few paragraphs.

The writing style includes a lot of telling instead of showing.

Huge continuous chunks of the book are dedicated to one single thread of the story before switching to another character/thread. I estimate these chunks were as large as 25-30% of a book. This can make connecting dots on the timeline between characters in separate places difficult. Mostly it just makes for a tiring reading experience.

Hyperbole is used constantly. Then, when that established hyperbole needs to be contrasted, or depth added, more hyperbole is applied in order to establish the contrast/depth. Yet, it doesn't connect. Saying X is more powerful than previously stated Y-which-is-so-powerful-it-can't-be-exceeded doesn't do the same thing as showing the reader through description and example that although Y was powerful, X turns out to be more powerful. Hyperbole inception does not make for interesting reading.

This may just be an extension of the hyperbole, but escalation is often done by stating an extreme. Then saying something was a bit more than that last extreme. These are arbitrary points of reference that fail to paint vivid pictures.

Analogies are used too frequently. To the point that they are distracting. Yet, because there is a lack of ~~direct description of characters~~ character POV writing and actions are often glossed over, the forest of analogy is not so much a distraction as a distasteful replacement.

Convoluted sentences. Not consistently, but enough that they are memorable. On several occasions, I had to re-read a sentence, and maybe re-read the sentence multiple times. The structure of the sentence or the word choices are just bizarre. In some cases, re-reading caught the point. In other cases, there was no hope, and moving on was all I could do.

Too often, paragraphs end with one or two sentences that can be skipped without losing value. This was usually because the content of the sentences was redundant throughout the books (the character complaining about the other gender).

Frequently, the beginning large chunks of a paragraph can be skipped without losing value because 60-80% of the paragraph is used to describe the color, design, material, etc. of clothing for everyone in the room despite that these details have no bearing on the story or character development.

The culmination of major plot points are wasted. Big battles, romantic interests that have been building over multiple books, are just barely glossed over when they finally come up for resolution. You'll read about the characters interest in one another for a whole book or for half the series, but then when the two characters finally connect and resolve that interest, the delivery is flat and its done in a page. Maybe two.

Anticlimactic face-offs with characters that are the main bad guy for a whole book. Each character does a few things then it's over.

The writing style feels similar to the style of speech used by the grandpa reading to his grandson in The Princess Bride movie. To me, it feels cartoonish. A plethora of exclamation points, character's jaws drop, eyes bulge out of the head, fists planted on hips - oh, how the fists are regularly planted on the hips. Them women know how to plant fists. - And you shan't be worried about how women fold their arms because it is always under their breasts. This is fortunate because without that clarification, I would probably assume they are folding their arms behind their back or between their legs, like regular people do all the time. Sarcasm aside, the frequency is probably the reason the arm folding + breasts feels like a problem.

No sense of risk or loss to main characters. There was never a point where I felt (and really believed it was a possibility that) a main character was potentially going to die or have some serious injury.

Righteous characters and evil characters both follow stereotypes and tend to be flat and predictable.

""Good-guy"" characters tend to be weak and suffer from bouts of irrational thoughts regarding violence. Going into detail would require spoilers, so I won't. Suffice it to say, character choices didn't agree with the context of the story and interrupted my immersion in the story.

Weak male characters so wrapped up in women being protected despite atrocities committed by the woman. Again, the logic within the fantasy realm didn't add up for me, and this interrupted the immersion.

Most characters hold the same views of the opposite gender. The men think girls are impossible to understand and complain about them constantly to themselves and to other male characters. The females think that men are stubborn/dumb/etc. and complain about this constantly to themselves and to other female characters. The monotony.

The end.

\--

*All of this being said, I think the WoT series has amazing concepts and that those concepts are connected in very interesting ways. I like the world. I did not enjoy the delivery. I'm looking forward to the TV series hoping that the problems outlined above will not make their way into the TV series' presentation.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r0zpdq/wheel_of_time_skip_the_books_but_probably_watch/,2021-11-24 07:44:10,25,0,books
