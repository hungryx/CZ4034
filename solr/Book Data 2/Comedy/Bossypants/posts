gtsvqi,'Bossypants' by Tina Fey,"I had read a lot of good reviews on the Internet about 'Bossypants' and had very high expectations and I can safely say that it exceeded all of them,

Tina Fey's rise to comedy stardom is not your conventional story, but what makes it even more interesting is the amazing blend of humor (of course cause it's Tina Fey) and her very casual and informal tone. I just couldn't take my eyes off the book. It's engaging and an amazing taste breaker if you're tired of long and elaborate books with a much heavier tone. 

'Born A Crime' by Trevor Noah is next on my list!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gtsvqi/bossypants_by_tina_fey/,2020-05-31 04:53:06,4,5,books

hj1d1,"Bossypants Review ~ “Women are not as funny as men.” Whether or not you believe it, you’ve certainly heard that idea somewhere. 
In Bossypants, Tina Fey acknowledges that inequality between the sexes isn’t a conspiracy theory, yet more of a miscommunication. ",,http://www.escapeintolife.com/book-reviews/bossypants-review/,2011-05-24 17:18:43,2,7,books
