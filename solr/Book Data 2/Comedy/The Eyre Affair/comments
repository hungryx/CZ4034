3fkomr,"I don't think it's necessary to read *Jane Eyre* first to enjoy *The Eyre Affair* if you don't want to. Just bear two things in mind: 1) If you're in two minds by the end of the book, give *Lost in a Good Book* a chance, and 2) *The Eyre Affair* spoils the hell out of *Jane Eyre*, and *Lost in a Good Book* spoils *Great Expectations*.",satanspanties,2015-08-03 07:42:14
