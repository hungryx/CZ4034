3fkomr,Jane Eyre and The Eyre Affair,"So I'm interested in reading The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde. Problem is that I've never read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë and from what little I've read about the The Eyre Affair the plot revolves around having previous knowledge of Jane Eyre. I'm willing to give it a go but before I do I thought I'd ask if Jane Eyre is worth reading for someone without  previous knowledge of the genre or the period? Also, any specific edition I should look out for?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3fkomr/jane_eyre_and_the_eyre_affair/,2015-08-03 02:30:14,5,3,books
4m6t54,What's the worst book you've had to study for a literature course?,"I'm currently studying ""The Eyre Affair"" by Jasper Fforde for my undergrad literature course. I think it's utter garbage; self-indulgent, lacking in structure, overlong, incoherent, inconsistent and pretentious. It's everything I hate about postmodern literature, and it's honestly the worst novel I've had to analyse for a literature course. So I was wondering, what are the books you've had to study and have disliked intensely?

xqa853,Can someone help me with the theology of Jane Eyre?,"I just read Jane Eyre for the first time (for pleasure, this isn't homework). I am really confused by the treatment of St John Rivers.

He is one of the creepiest, most disturbing literary characters I've read. I was begging to have the Almost Bigamist back (Rochester). He seems to be abusively sucking all the joy out of Jane. He doesn't even thank her for giving him a quarter of her fortune or for fixing up their house. He tells her she's evil for taking a break for once in her horrid life (to fix up his childhood home). He was manipulative, his faith was completely hollow (did he miss saved by grace and not works?), and he keeps telling Jane that if she doesn't marry him she'll going to hell, which was just awful and also theologically wrong on so many levels.

But Jane and his sister call him a good man and the book ends in praising him for martyring himself. What in the world? I was hoping for him to die of malaria (which he basically did) and I NEVER wish death on a character. How is this person a good example of a Christian? What point was she trying to make here?

Some sections that creeped me out the most:

*I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell. When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.* 

""***Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!""***

 *the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance*. (She isn't being perverse! She offered to go as his sister and he's demanding her to be his wife)

 *All this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by malice, but on principle*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xqa853/can_someone_help_me_with_the_theology_of_jane_eyre/,2022-09-28 11:32:47,76,102,books
r3y47f,Liking references to classics when you don’t like the classic in question,"What it says on the tin. Are there any examples of references to or “inspired by” certain classics that you enjoy even if you disliked it (or don’t have first hand knowledge of). 

Two examples - The Stars’ Tennis Balls by Stephen Fry is based on The Count of Monte Cristo. I have no interest in reading the original, but I appreciate the anagrams and allusions to it. 

Another is one of my favorite series - the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde. It begins with The Eyre Affair. I read that for 9th grade reading and have negative desire to touch it again. Later books deal with other Brontes and Austen, which I still have yet to read. I still find the books fun and enjoyable. 

Anyone else appreciate references without firsthand knowledge/appreciation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r3y47f/liking_references_to_classics_when_you_dont_like/,2021-11-28 06:47:32,12,0,books
8yzryp,The Bronte sisters: which do you fancy most?,I'm completely besotted by the Brontes having read most novels and poems. Just curious as to which Bronte you most love and why? I love Charlotte's Jane Eyre so much I wrote an (unfinished) English literature thesis on it. I love the way she portrays Jane's strong moral compass & the teasing often infuriating flirting between Rochester and Jane. Although there are limitations as to Rochesters character as adeptly portrayed by Jean Rhys in Wide Sargasso Sea I think that ultimately he treats her as an equal his 'likeness'. I read this novel when I was 13 and I still remember distinctly the cringe worthy cartoon cover. It's been a lasting love affair! I would love to hear your thoughts!,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8yzryp/the_bronte_sisters_which_do_you_fancy_most/,2018-07-15 06:19:59,16,12,books
2bpppu,"An exploration of the perpetual ""What's your all-time favourite book?"" threads, and why I find the question limiting. Why can we only pick one, and why should we? An essay of sorts, I guess...","I love this subreddit, and I see this question asked in one way or another pretty much every other day. From: ""What's your favourite book"", to ""If you could only read one book forever..."", and the multitude of ways it is either asked, implied, or rephrased. The fact is I can't possible choose just *one single novel* and be completely satisfied with the answer. I have read so many books across such a vast variety of genres, that I couldn't even pick one from each genre as a favourite, let alone a single one as the epitome of the greatest book I've ever read in my entire reading history.

I understand, however, why it is such a popular question, and I'm not saying there isn't merit in it, because everyone has a different answer (mostly), and people ask it because they want to discover something new, or connect to a person who has the same favourite as they do. But I feel like the single nomination of a favourite novel by a single person allows no context for what that person has actually enjoyed or liked in their entire reading experience outside of that one novel, and gives no indication of whether or not you'll like it too, because there is nothing else to compare it to against your own.

So every time I see these threads, all I can think is ""There is no way in the world I can possibly pick one."" And I recount the number of times I've read a brilliant book and uttered the words ""I think it's in my New Top Five"". Which got me to thinking, what exactly would that top five be? Because I thought five was pretty generous, so I decided to sit down, be absolutely ruthless and try to compile my True (or new) Top Five. Needless to say my list got completely out of control. 

So I was more ruthless, and it only served to make me more annoyed at my self-imposed constraint of five. I started making excuses for two books being equal, and enforcing comparisons on them in order to keep them equal in my ""pseudo-top five-but-in-reality-top-ten"" that really weren't there. Because they weren't equal, they weren't the same novel, every novel is its own being, and the comparisons I was trying make for the sake of leaving them both in my True Top Five completely demeaned not only the novels themselves but the authors too, and it doesn't mean that I enjoyed either of them any less, or any more. So, let's just make it ten. Ten is good. Ten is *really* generous.

So I looked at my list that in my generosity I intended to expand from five to ten, and was still loath to cut any of them out, and I was left with twenty. I figured if these were the first *twenty* books I could recall off the top of my head as potential candidates for my True Top Five (but really ten, but now twenty), then they all deserve to be on it.

So I'm going to post my True Top Twenty, and I admit to taking some joy in the alliteration of the name of my list, and some joy in saying that I love all of these novels equally for completely different reasons, but I love them all the same. 

I'd love it if you could share your unedited and pure lists of favourite novels without making any sacrifices. Maybe some of you have fifty, and maybe some of you really do just have one, either way I would love for you all to share them. Here are mine in absolutely no particular order:

- *Use of Weapons*, Iain Banks

- *Jane Eyre*, Charlotte Bronte

- *A Spy in the House of Love*, Anais Nin

- *The Count of Monte Cristo*, Alexandre Dumas

- *Bleak House*, Charles Dickens

- *Godel, Escher, Bach*, Douglas Hofstadter

- *The Eyre Affair*, Jasper Fforde

- *The Ocean at the End of the Lane*, Neil Gaiman

- *A Confederacy of Dunces*, John Kennedy Toole

- *Looking For Alibrandi*, Melina Marchetta

- *Crime and Punishment*, Fyodor Dostoyevsky

- *The French Lieutenant's Woman*, John Fowles 

- *The Woman in White*, Wilkie Collins

- *Middlesex*, Jeffrey Eugenides

- *We Have Aways Lived in the Castle*, Shirley Jackson

- *The Blind Assassin*, Margaret Atwood

- *If Not, Winter*, Sappho (fragments of, translated by Anne Carson)

- *The Left Hand of Darkness*, Ursula Le Guin

- *Frankenstein*, Mary Shelley

- *Revelation Space*, Alastair Reynolds

- *The Secret History*, Donna Tart

- *The Night Circus*, Erin Morgenstern

- *Tipping the Velvet*, Sarah Waters

Oops. That's twenty two. Does it matter? Not to me, it still adheres to my titular alliteration, only now it's my ""True Top Twenty-Two"".
