198bntm,Candide (written in 1759) is without a doubt the funniest book I've ever read,"If you've ever wondered if people had a sense of humor during the 18th century then look no further than Voltaire. Candide is, without a doubt, the funniest book I've ever read. From start to finish the exploits of Candide will leave you smiling ear to ear. This was one novel I couldn't help but read in a single sitting, and at many points I found myself laughing out loud at jokes and plot points that happened several pages or even chapters earlier.  
  
Voltaire's dark sense of humor is enough to warrant a read, but for those familiar with the philosophical and historical context in which Candide was written there is a deeper sense of appreciation for just how precisely he managed to lampoon some of the dominant philosophical ideals of the time. As a shameless philosophy nerd, I'd be honored to explain for the uninitiated in (hopefully) the least pretentious way I can.  
  
Voltaire lived at a crossroads in history where people began being disillusioned with God, Monarchies, and the hostile environment academics were forced to work in the confines in. During the 1600's many of the world's greatest philosophers were creating masterpieces, and challenging ideas that sometimes lead to their death, exile, or imprisonment. On one hand, you had Decartes, Spinoza, John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton championing a less dogmatic society led by scientific pursuits. On the other hand you had guys like Hobbes and Leibniz who were eager to preserve the social order by advocating for monarchies, and hypothesizing on a system of metaphysics that could prove the existence of God.  
  
The main idea Voltaire challenges is the passive optimism championed by Leibniz and his writing about perfect worlds and Monads. Basically, Leibniz argued that multi-verses exist, but that because God is good and all powerful we must be living in the most perfect of all worlds. Voltaire took a look around at all the violence, rape, and slavery around the world and thought this attitude was awfully optimistic. You've no doubt heard expressions like ""everything happens for a reason"" or ""It's all part of God's plan."" It was this sort of passive attitude towards change Voltaire was looking to confront.  
  
Voltaire, a critic of the Bible and fan of Isaac Newton and Bacon, set out to criticize the ideas of Hobbes and Leibniz in Candide by demonstrating how this system of beliefs tricks the general population in to believing that everything is always how it should be. Throughout the novel, Candide proofs that Murphy's law applies to him more than any other soul. After being schooled by a personification of Leibniz, he is expelled from his castle and subjected to torture, capture, violence, and a slew of comical adventures that must be all part of God's plan.  
  
It's remarkable how fresh, funny, and modern this novel is even after centuries. The only writer with a comparable wit and clever sense of humor I've read is Oscar Wilde. Voltaire earned a reputation during his lifetime for being one of the most clever men who ever lived, and his wit is on full display in his magnum opus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/198bntm/candide_written_in_1759_is_without_a_doubt_the/,2024-01-16 19:35:05,88,405,books
jsga41,Finished Candide. All is for the best,"\- I finished Voltaire's 1759 masterpiece Candide today, on a gloomy Veteran's Day afternoon. Never has a satire made me so sad (a sadtire?). The philosophy and theology of the times were being lampooned here by Voltaire, and while quite clever, also brought me into a melancholy state of mind about what is truly meaningful in life. There are a plethora of ideas and philosophies, titles and religions that are referenced in Candide, and each end in destruction and/or misfortune. The 18th century was a innovative and romantic time, and yet was also extremely brutal. The book is meant to be witty and humorous, and it totally is, but the brutality naive Candide and Cunegonde, and his mates face is a commentary in the times to which Voltaire lived. I always find so much historical value in the writings of those who came before us.

\- The idea of ""the best of all possible worlds"" or ""all is for the best"" is a notion steeped throughout the book. Voltaire obviously crushes the idea through the misadventures of Candide and Pangloss, who are steadfast in this belief. Pangloss, the promoter of this teaching, sort of uses it as a way to do as he pleases in life. He bangs the castle maid. He speaks candidly to men of greater nobility. And, these errors and his resulting punishments are explained through his belief. Candide, a portrayal of innocence, is a picture of a cruel world devouring that which is ignorant. I felt for Candide, and his pure, foolish love for the radiant Cunegonde whose caste was above his own. Caste systems in Europe were very real, and punishments for fraternization harsh. A culture we have some trouble realizing in our modern society today (though some could argue we still have caste systems in play, just at a more subtle level).

\-I had been on quite a run reading the Bible. We in today's age regard the Book as a monument of antiquity, but in Voltaire's time and work, you can get a real sense about how fervently denominations fought and died for strains of the same religion. Both in Christianity and Islam. Often the pious here are depicted as just as derelict and lecherous as heretics. And they likely were. The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, literal wars over such small differences in belief. What did that look like? I often wonder what it was like to live in those times, in those great cities, with blood being shed over opinions. What was that like? The burnings, the tortures, the executions, the sieges, the rapes by supposedly devout followers to Holy Beings. It frustrates me to think we have been such a cruel and bloodthirsty people since time immemorial. What is it inside of us that delighted, and sometimes still delights in such evil?

\-Slavery. One of those human institutions that bring out the worst of humanity. Economically a boon in colonial times (and before), slavery always evidences the idea that some societies and races need to have power and dominion over others. Power over race. Power over sex. Power over cultures. Listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcory History episode 'Addicted to Bondage' for a really good commentary on our need to subject certain peoples to such horrors throughout human history.

\- Not to speak too much on the tragedies of Candide, there is plenty that is fun and witty here. The old woman with half a butt cheek killed me. Voltaire's critiques on critics are both clever and relevant to today. This book is filled with wise one liners that are simple and feed the soul. ""Cultivate your own garden."" It is easy to discover why this work is a favorite of many thinkers and revolutionaries of more modern history.  I do not think Voltaire really believed in the pointlessness of it all, but I think this is more of a commentary on enjoying that which is simple. Living in the moment. Dwell not on the treachery of life that we cannot control, especially in light of our recent politics and world condition. Be here. Do well. Do not strive over trivialities. Don't cheat your neighbors, it'll come back on you. Suffer the meek and the innocent. Read Candide. It's 130 pages, a quick read, and it will force you to re-evaluate that which is really important in today's world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jsga41/finished_candide_all_is_for_the_best/,2020-11-11 20:39:05,35,83,books

tgz9z,How does Candide reflect Voltaire's religious beliefs?,"I'm currently doing a research project. At this beginning of this project I read Candide as an introduction to Voltaire's opinions on religion. My teacher said I should really focus on the ideas in Candide if I want to write about Voltaire's importance. Unfortunately, much of its meaning is symbolic and not just plain said and, for that reason, I was hoping some of you could help me understand some of the messages.

Edit: I said that this was for a project, the reason I said it was to be honest, I could have easily left that out. Now, I should explain it a bit. It is in no way a book report. Candide is just one element of a research project based on Voltaire's importance. The truth is that the only reason I asked this question was for clarification and I was not expecting r/book to complete my project for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tgz9z/how_does_candide_reflect_voltaires_religious/,2012-05-10 19:56:27,22,0,books

I have a copy of *Candide* in French back in the States that has a rhyme scheme throughout, which AFAIK (not much) wouldn't be too far off from the nature of the novella. However, I've found another French copy of *Candide* with annotations and questions, but there isn't a rhyme scheme. I'm guessing that the French in this second book is updated, much like is done with Shakespeare, and thus the rhyme has been lost -- but again I haven't found anything online to suggest that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6d4l4y/does_the_original_french_version_of_candide_rhyme/,2017-05-24 19:57:35,3,7,books
1rol8a,Explanation for the last lines of Voltaire's 'Candide'?,"Just interested in what you guys make of the ending. 

—You are perfectly right, said Pangloss; for when man was put into the garden of Eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, so that he should work it; this proves that man was not born to take his ease. —Let’s work without speculating, said Martin; it’s the only way of rendering life bearable. The whole little group entered into this laudable scheme; each one began to exercise his talents. The little plot yielded fine crops . . . and Pangloss sometimes used to say to Candide: —All events are linked together in the best of possible worlds; for, after all, if you had not been driven from a fine castle by being kicked in the backside for love of Miss Cunégonde, if you hadn’t been sent before the Inquisition, if you hadn’t traveled across America on foot, if you hadn’t given a good sword thrust to the baron, if you hadn’t lost all your sheep from the good land of Eldorado, you wouldn’t be sitting here eating candied citron and pistachios.

3sppdd,"Just picked up a copy of Candide, and I have to say it has the best cover of any book I have ever seen.","Today I was in my school library and really bored, so I was looking for a book to read to kill some time in class.  I couldn't find anything for awhile, but my eye eventually caught onto a book with a funny- looking person on the spine, and I decided to pick it up.

At first I was hesitant to check out the book because I saw Voltaire's name on it, and I was afraid that like most authors from the Enlightenment I wouldn't be able to stand his prose, but then I remembered that Voltaire is supposed to be this witty, hilarious writer from what I've heard; plus there were comics on the front, so that was a big plus.

And wow, am I glad I picked it up. The little bit I read of the book so far has been enjoyable, but the cover art is amazing. The comics on the front do a great job of explaining the premise of the story, and the other comics on the back and inside the jacket are really good too.  The cast of characters in the jacket and the map put there are really nice to have, though there are some spoilers in it.  Not to mention the back of the book with a summary of the contents and reviews that made me chuckle.

Just the attention to detail and care that went into making the cover astounds me. It's a Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, if any of you reading are interested.  

I really appreciate the cover, and I hope I enjoy the story as much as I loved the cover.
