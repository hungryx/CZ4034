8ms5gw,I know I'm late to the party but Terry Pratchett is brilliant.,"I'm currently reading *Small Gods.* It's the fourth Pratchett book I've read. I read *Good Omens* because I'm a Neil Gaiman fan and I thought it was alright. Then once Pratchett passed away I thought, ""Well, better see what all the fuss over Discworld is about."" I read *The Color of Magic* and *The Wee Free Men* and thought they were fun send\-ups of the fantasy genre. 

A friend recommended *Small Gods* so I picked it up for some relaxing summer reading. But I can't take it to the beach because I always need a pen nearby to take notes. It's like watching Monty Python or History of the World for the first time again, with its biting satire on religion, politics, and philosophy. Reading it, I picture Pratchett with just a desk full of one\-liners and metaphors jotted on scraps and post\-its, working them in between his characters, stories, and dialogue.   


Here are some of my favorites so far:  


""Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.""  


""There are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.""  


""Fear is a strange soil. Mainly it grows obedience like corn, which grows in rows and makes weeding easy. But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance, which flourish underground.""

""People think that professional soldiers think a lot about fighting, but *serious* professional soldiers think a lot more about food and a warm place to sleep, because these are two things that are generally hard to get, whereas fighting tends to turn up all the time.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ms5gw/i_know_im_late_to_the_party_but_terry_pratchett/,2018-05-28 18:17:41,1233,9057,books
67k4ss,"Thoughts on ""The Wee Free Men"" as a sixth-grade read-aloud?","Hey everyone,

I'm currently substitute teaching for a sixth-grade class in a rather conservative part of the country. It looks like this placement may unexpectedly become long-term, which means I may have a chance to meet one of my little dream(s): I may be able to pick my own book to read aloud to the class, after we finish our current reading.

I would love to pick up Terry Pratchett's ""The Wee Free Men,"" as it's a fun, fun story, starring kids about the same age as my class, and deals with lots of more-mature themes.  

However, I'm also a little concerned about length at this point in the school year, and I seem to remember some material might not be entirely appropriate for the little 'uns; for example, the main character briefly describes Where Babies Come From (which I can just skip over), and repeatedly gives strong whiskey to some side characters (which will be harder; to give you an idea, today's journal prompt was something like ""why do people commit crimes?"" and a surprisingly large portion of the answers were ""Because alcohol.""). 

Any thoughts?

xrhxl0,"Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series is beautiful & inspiring. Read it, then gift it to all the young women in your life.","I read these books as a kid and enjoyed them, but they really shine upon re-reading. I just finished Wintersmith (#3) via Libby last night, nearly shed a tear.

The Tiffany Aching books are set on Pratchett's Discworld, but as with all Discworld series they stand perfectly on their own. The books are about the title character, a young girl from a rural agricultural village who grows into some magical powers and has to reckon with forces beyond her ken, and also the joys and perils of family, community, and responsibility.

Right off the bat these novels are utterly delightful. The first one, *The Wee Free Men*, features Tiffany befriending a gang of tiny Scottish fairies who love nothing more than drinking, fighting, stealing, fighting while drinking, drinking while stealing, and fighting while drinking & stealing. They have a whole vocabulary of ~~nonsense~~ Scots words such as ""crivens,"" an all-purpose curse that I'm going to start using daily, and their typical approach to any problem is to rush in and start kicking it. They rule. 

I won't spoil the plots of the books, but I will say that almost all of the major characters are badass ladies who get shit done. They teach amazing life lessons along the way, a couple of which have made their way into the ""Quotes"" note on my phone: 

>TIFFANY: It shouldn't be like this.

>MS. LEVEL: There isn't a way things should be. There's just what happens, and what we do.

-

> GRANNY WEATHERWAX: Stars is easy. People is hard.

-

> Why do you go away? So you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving. 

I love these books a lot, and I think any young human (and especially young women) would get a lot out of them. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

EDIT: These books are, of course, great for people of any gender, and boys need female role models too! 

I have been informed that ""crivens"" is valid Scottish slang. Sorry, ye daft scunners.

680cb2,I just discovered the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett,"I bought The Wee Free Men at a thrift store for very cheap thinking that it was a stand-alone. I really liked it because it was light and funny and the protagonist was a very sensible young woman. At the end of the book was a preview of the next book in the series. And I think the whole of Discworld isn't actually a series but they all happen in the same universe. Some are connected, others are stand-alones. 

I'm excited and at the same time apprehensive to dive into another ""series"" because the number of books in it is somewhat daunting. Has anyone read this series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/680cb2/i_just_discovered_the_discworld_series_by_terry/,2017-04-28 02:20:46,276,690,books
y8c1qf,"Finding it hard to be motivated to read books in recent years, but I finished The Way of Kings last night and loved it.","I'm sure it's not unfamiliar, as a kid I would devour books, Discworld was my favourite and I always got the new books (my copy of Wee Free Men signed by the man himself) but as I've gotten older even though I still love stories reading has been difficult to commit to.

The Stormlight Archives caught my eye a few months back and I finally started to read the first book a few weeks ago, but found it tough to get into (not uncommon) especially given the unfamiliar setting and rules of the land, which became clearer by the mid-point and was clearly very deliberate. But once the plot got going I couldn't put it down, probably one of the more interesting Fantasy (high-fantasy?) worlds I've come across and I will be diving into the rest of the series ASAP.

I don't know if this will rekindle my love for reading in general, but I hope so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y8c1qf/finding_it_hard_to_be_motivated_to_read_books_in/,2022-10-19 19:36:00,16,40,books
gkg4qe,"Plot, character development, etc. aside, who is your favorite writer purely in terms of the beauty of their prose?","My favorites are John Steinbeck with his elegant prose, Virginia Woolf with prose like brush strokes painting the world & ephemeral feelings, and Ray Bradbury with prose like golden stardust. 

In terms of new and probably less known prose masters, I recently discovered Carmen Maria Machado. She writes short stories and I was completely blown away by her The Husband Stitch even though I find most of her stories redundant and overly abstract in terms of subject matter.  

A recent favorite passage of mine comes from Terry Pratchett's Wee Free Men: 

""Glint, glisten, glitter, gleam...
Tiffany thought a lot about words, in the long hours of churning butte. Onomatopoetic , she'd discovered in the dictionary, meant words that sounded like the thing they were describing, like cuckoo. But she thought there should be a word that sounds like the noise a thing would make if that thing made a noise even though, actually, it doesn't, but would if it did. 

Glint, for example. If light made a noise as it reflected off a distant window, it'd go glint! And the light of tinsel, all those little glints chiming together, would make a noise like glitterglitter. Gleam was a clean, smooth noise from a surface that intended to shine all day. And glisten was the soft, almost greasy sound of something rich and oily.""

6kt05j,Three Men in a Boat is one of the funniest books I've ever read.,"I often read comedy books, Douglas Adams, P.G Wodehouse, Oscar Wilde, Spike Milligan etc. and have always enjoyed them, but rarely do I find myself laughing out loud while reading. *Three Men in a Boat* is in a class of its own where comedy novels are concerned.

What surprised me so much was how fresh many of the jokes are for a novel written 128 years ago. There were so many great moments, the hedge maze at Hampton Court, the taxidermy trout in a pub in Streatley, or almost any time Montmorency is mentioned.

I cannot recommend this book enough, but if I go on I'll spoil many of its best parts, so I'll leave you with my favourite passage:

>*It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.*

>*I love to keep it by me; the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.*

>*You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me; my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon*

>*And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn't a finger mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.*

EDIT: Too many replies now for me to answer them all individually. I'm very glad so many of you already know and love the book. If you're looking to read it, as others have pointed out, there is a free version on Kindle and a free audiobook version on Spotify, though apparently the Hugh Laurie version is abridged.

If it's not your cup of tea, hey that's fine too. Horses for courses.

f3v68n,"Today is the 30th anniversary of the “Pale Blue Dot” photo, I always go back to Carl Sagan’s book when I think of this image","I truly believe these might some of the most important words ever said. Carl Sagan had a way of seeing things for what they really are. This to me is the best description of that photo of earth taken billions of miles away. 

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

6urlby,Searching for something appropriate to read while waiting for the upcoming eclipse? Grab a copy of Isaac Asimov's Nightfall.,"For those who aren't familiar with it, Nightfall is a 1941 science fiction novelette that explores a civilization that lives in the constant daylight of multiple suns, and has never experienced darkness. It's a quick read, and is widely available free online. The story was conceived after a conversation Asimov had about this Emerson quote:

If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God?

15rr2du,I just finished reading The Stand by Stephen King!!,"It was amazing. It was so moving and emotional in \*those\* scenes. I loved the characters. Each had so much depth to him or her. I think my favourites would be Frannie, Glen and Tom, and then maybe Stu and Nick. 

I was kind of bored at the whole bit with Trashcan Man and the Kid. That was really... disturbing. 

The character development was really good. Harold, who started off as a 16 year old younger brother attracted to Frannie, ending up as this complex kind of villain. Larry, who started off as ""ain't no nice guy"", becoming more in control of himself and had more morals. 

Okay, but what happened in the end? Randall Flagg is reincarnated into another continent? Then would Mother Abagail also have been reborn? Why did the four men have to go west just to have three of them blown up? Do Frannie, Stu and Peter stay in Maine? Does everyone leave the Free Zone and repopulate dead America? 

What if Nick hadn't tried to stop Harold's bomb? What if he ran outside with everyone else? Perhaps no one would have died that night. I cried at that bit. It was so real. I imagine most books keep the main characters alive but no, not King. I thought it was a good decision though. 

The writing was amazing. I could picture it so well. The feelings, the scene. Especially how King described the dark man's presence. It was the kind of book you can't put down, the kind of book you forget it's a book while reading it; you just disappear, losing track of time, fully wrapped up in the story.  I loved it. I think it is now one of my favourite books of all time.

60l9cg,I just finished Feet of Clay by Terry Pratchett. The Discworld city watch books are some of the most fun I've had reading in a long time.,"They're just so much fun to read! I feel like Pratchett put just as much effort into the jokes as he did the story and world, and it's made one of the most entertaining writing styles I've had the pleasure of reading. All the different characters play off each other well, and the world itself is such a cool satirical homage to fantasy settings.

I'm debating on whether I should keep going with the watch books or switch over to the witches for a bit, because I've heard they're just as great. Any opinions?

Also, probably my favorite thing I've found with his writing? The inability to tell the difference between running gags and worldbuilding. The river Ankh being a non-Newtonian fluid, B S Johnson's adventures in measurement, Vimes' boots made of cardboard, they're all hilarious but each adds their own new detail to the world.

171fqg2,The Tenth Justice... and legal thrillers in general... do any women like them and is the genre ever aimed for/about women?,"Hi everyone, I started reading the Tenth Justice and I'm on a quest to binge more legal thrillers. I used to love John Grisham and the like as a teenager. It's part of what inspired me to go to law school. 

But then as a lawyer I rarely had time or motivation to read much, let alone read books about lawyers. Now I ""read"" a lot more with the help of audiobooks (although I'm actually reading this one in paperback because a friend gave it to me, and I'm stocking up on legal thriller paperbacks I find for free in Little Libraries and that friends give me). 

Has anyone else read The Tenth Justice? I would love to discuss it and the genre in general. It starts out being about a guy who went to Yale and is now clerking for a Supreme Court justice. The description said he's going to find out top secret information about a case and be blackmailed about it. 

I find the premise interesting but I also find myself getting annoyed that so many of these books are written by men and are about men. I went and looked at the paperbacks I've amassed so far in my quest to read more legal thrillers, and they're ALL by men, about men, for men, supposedly, although I as a woman like them but would like them even better if they were about female lawyers.

Does anyone think there's a market for legal thrillers written about women/for women? I know that Melissa F. Miller writes a series about Sasha McCandless. And I have read another book about a female lawyer that was self-published and pretty good although I can't remember its name. 

I wonder why trad pubs don't seem to publish this type of thing aimed at women? Are there other women here who like to read legal thrillers and do you think that the genre could be aimed towards women more? Is it sexism or just the market? Or maybe it's just me and I'm somehow driven to the ones that are aimed at men and missing ones that are aimed at women?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/171fqg2/the_tenth_justice_and_legal_thrillers_in_general/,2023-10-06 15:45:51,11,8,books
pzcxcg,Phantom of the Opera is the timeless classic of two edgelords simping over the same streamer who lives for likes [spoilers],"Happy Spooktober!

Gaston Leroux's *Phantom of the Opera*. A classic that has been adapted into dozens of films and decades of stage productions. Horror beyond imaginable horror abounds at the Paris Opera House as the ""O.G."" Opera Ghost wreaks non-threatening havoc and plays spooky pranks on the new managers, until he finds \~Christine\~

Christine is a young, beautiful understudy to the actual headliner Carlotta. One night, she has to fill in and is an instant hit because she magically sings better than anyone else! Turns out she's been getting free voice lessons from the OG himself. All he asks is that she ~~write his name on her thigh~~ simply love him! She obviously does, because she's the woman in this story.

OG, whose real name is Erik, literally lives in the basement, btw.

Raoul (who is important because his brother is a count?) once got Christine's scarf out of the ocean. When he *goes to her dressing room* and she doesn't recognize him, this is literally how he introduces himself:

>""Who are you?""  
>  
>""Mademoiselle,"" replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, ""*I am the little boy who went into the sea to rescue your scarf.*""

and everyone laughs at him. She tells him to leave because she needs some time alone (with OG, her platinum level patron).

The rest of the book is about Raoul trying to prove to Christine that she should love him because he ~~got her scarf that one time~~ loves her more than OG does, because OG is ugly, and OG threatening to hurt other people if Christine doesn't love *him*. 

Christine loves whoever has most recently declared their love for her.

I honestly think this book and story have staying power only because they tell the story of two desperate men, one is rich and the other is passionate but ugly, threatening and committing violence to win the hand of a pretty girl they know nothing about. And unfortunately, [that's relatable.](https://people.com/music/andrew-lloyd-webber-sarah-brightman-affair-memoir/)

P.S. Don't miss the casual racism that flows through the book, strangling the plot with a punjab lasso, a term Leroux himself came up with to make a noose sound more foreign and exotic.

P.P.S. I actually do want to see a modern adaptation where a trust fund edgelord and a nefarious, basement-dwelling neckbeard go toe to toe in a futile effort to win the affections of a Twitch streamer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pzcxcg/phantom_of_the_opera_is_the_timeless_classic_of/,2021-10-01 17:33:22,84,1578,books
uh1nuo,I've finally started reading Lord of the Rings. Why did no one tell me this was a fairytale?,"Alright so I know a lot of you may be rolling your eyes at what I'm about to say because it's ""wow so obvious"", etc. However, in my (non-English speaking) country, people don't generally read Lord of the Rings. Everyone watched the movies, of course, but only the folks really interested in fantasy literature read it; and personally, I don't really fit that category. I don't have anything against Robert E. Howard or anything like that, but it's just not the genre of book I've grown up with. So please be gentle if I end up repeating something that everyone but me apparently knows.

Also, please note that I've only read 10% of the trilogy (about a quarter of the first book), but I've read some of his interviews and his essay On Fairy-Stories, so I feel reasonably confident on thinking what I think.

Anyway, in 2020 I was temporalily suspended from work and confined, and so I had a lot of free time. I intended to read Lord of the Rings, and I did start but the prologue kept me from going on - it was just too many names and I had my own preconceptions of the story. After telling a friend of mine that LotR was a bit too complicated for my mental state at the time, she convinced me to read Dune instead.

Please stop laughing. (It was great btw)

I got through my mental state through grit, having to make sense of all the words and actually enjoying the complexity. I then took a break reading some Discworld and a lot of comics, and eventually tackled War and Peace. Russian names are the bane of my existence, but I powered through it.

Feeling quite uppity about myself, I started just this weekend on Lord of the Rings, expecting a very dry story recounting a complex tale full of the serious names of serious men who did serious things. I did love the movies, but I felt like I wouldn't enjoy them as much if they were stretched over a thousand pages.

Imagine how surprised I was to then find out that it was a *fairytale*. An honest to God fairytale, with ""and there he found great delight""s and ""O Gandalf! Please tell me!""s and other phrases like that.

The aesthetics of the story feel taken directly from a Howard Pyle illustration or one of Andrew Lang's Fairy Books; and I *bloody love* fairytales, especially well-written ones.

See, I was vaguely aware that there was a rift between Swords and Sorcery fiction and Tolkien fiction, but I didn't expect it to be *this* deep. Frodo behaves like one of King Arthur's pages, the descriptions - both of the history of the world as of the page-to-page character interactions - feel like modern adaptations of late 19th century literature. It's not only a fairytale, it's clearly written by someone who *loves* fairytales.

Like, take the Elves for instance. Contemporary fantasy tells me I know elves, they're the civilization of pointy eared guys that live on the forest and are generally detached.

*Tolkien* elves, on the other hand, feel like fairies. As in, the fair folk. Sídhe. Whatever. They don't feel like ""a civilization of guys"", they feel like ""a people""; a group of fantastic creatures like dragons or giant boars. They feel like the kind of person King Arthur would meet dining in the middle of the forest and playing with a golden ball. Like, they're magical, that's the driving point.

I feel like years of being close to people trying to understand Tolkien in a rational, grounded, real-world way kinda poisoned the way I saw the story. I figured that, if people were arguing about how the economy of the elves worked, or if the Balrog had wings (and the properties of wings for that matter), that the story concerned itself with that sort of question; or at least took it into consideration. What I've found was a fairytale from a world that doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't really *explain* a lot of things, just like fairytales, because they expect the reader to piece stuff together from their understanding of the world.

There's this example that really stuck with me from when I was reading the One Thousand and One Nights as a teen that mentions, in passing, that a Djinn was muslim. That felt weird to me; why would the Djinn practice a religion? Wouldn't they have their own religion? Are there Djinn mosques? Among a ton of other questions cropped up. And then it hit me: the Djinn is muslim because Allah, in the story, is the creator of everything. *Of course* the Djinn is a muslim, and could be a christian too, *why wouldn't* he be?

This is similar to how Beowulf treats Grendel too. Like, Grendel in a more modern story would show up, kill some guys, and Beowulf would predictably get real angry and hunt the monster down, because he's a monster and the like. But that's not how the people who wrote Beowulf saw the world; the mother of Grendel comes afterwards demanding his blood-price, because that's the law. And teen-me would have thought ""wait, why would she follows the law of men?"", but from the poem's point of view, the more apt question would be ""why *wouldn't* she follow the law? The law is of *this land*, not just of men, and everyone contained in this land follows it.""

A great example of this inside the world of Tolkien is during the first night of Frodo's journey, a fox looks at him and thinks ""huh, Hobbits this far? that's unusual"", and moves on with his life.

Personally, I really don't see a lot of this in contemporary stuff, because well... foxes don't think. And grounded stories don't feature thinking foxes, or the mom of the monster persecuting legal resource, or muslim forces of nature, because that's the *logical* step you'd take. That's ""how it'd happen in the real world"", but Tolkien doesn't really seem to care that much about this at all, and I love his work for it.

In short, I expected another Dune, and received a King Arthur story. I'm really enjoying the story, the clear passion that goes in fields and trees and the land itself, even the little songs every so often. I expect it'll only get darker as tragedy strikes and the quest gets closer to its conclusion, but fairytales are like that.

Sidenote, but I really appreciate how seriously Tolkien takes death and how commited he is to pity. As a Christian myself, it feels really refreshing to see something like this:

>‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’

>‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.’

>‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.’

>‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.

>‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.’

>‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.

God bless his work. And God bless Terry Pratchett too, I only got interested in LotR in the first place because of him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uh1nuo/ive_finally_started_reading_lord_of_the_rings_why/,2022-05-02 22:36:47,412,2500,books
11503e9,What's the most subtle literary allusion you've found in a book?,"By ""subtle"" I mean one that you think very few people, if any, would catch.  That could be for a number of reasons.  Perhaps the way it's presented is very off-hand (some others like to ""hide"" allusions, others like to knock you over the head with them).  Or maybe it's referring to a work that few people would have read, or a passage in a well-known work that isn't often quoted.  
  
I'll give you the one I'm thinking of as an example.  
  
In the book ""Little, Big"" by John Crowley, the main character (at the time) receives a gift of a hat.  The paragraph reads:  
  
> ""What more?"" Mr. Woods said, looking around him, finger to his lips.  Mrs. Underhill with one of her needles pointed to a round leather box on top of the cupboard.  
Right! Mr. Woods said.  ""How about this?""  He finger the box from its high place until it fell into his arms.  He popped open the lid.  ""A hat!""  
It was a red hat, high-crowned and soft, belted with a little plaited belt in which a white owl's feather nodded.  Mr. Woods and Mrs. Underhill said Aaaaah, and watched closely as Mr. Woods fitted it to Smokey's head.  ...  
  
I'm spoiler-izing the following few lines so I don't ruin the book for anyone (plus you can make your guess and see if you're right!)  

If you need a little hint: >!The book is subtitled ""or, The Fairies' Parliament""!<

>!The paragraph I quoted is referring to a poem called ""The Fairies,"" by William Allingham.  It starts with:!<  
>!Up the airy mountain,!<  
>!Down the rushy glen,!<  
>!We daren’t go a-hunting!<  
>!For fear of little men;!<  
>!Wee folk, good folk,!<  
>!Trooping all together;!<

>!And __white owl’s feather__!!**<

Subtle?  Or am I underestimating the number of people who would catch this reference?  I'm 100% sure this is an allusion to the work I mentioned because the 6th line quoted above is used in a completely off-hand manner in another of the Author's books.

4cyc3s,"Hunter S Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72"" is always a great pick, but even more so in this year of bigoted demgogue candidates and the most credible talk of a brokered convention since the one depicted here.","I came across my old copy while moving today, and thought I should put it out there for anyone who may not know about it.  Since I'm much better at having a conversation than holding forth on why it's such a great read, here's an excerpt from Tom Seligson's contempraneous New York Times Review:

>As the National Correspondent for Rolling Stone magazine, Hunter S. Thompson--author of the celebrated sixties' drug-scene book ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""--covered the entire 1972 Presidential campaign. He has now enlarged his articles into a book that is the best account yet published of what it feels like to be out there in the middle of the American political process. ""Fear and Loathing"" runs month by month from December, 1971, when Thompson began campaign coverage in Washington, through the Democratic primaries, both conventions and on past the election. His book is a mixture of personal narrative, diary entries, tape-recorded interviews and telephone conversations with the candidates and their managers, occasionally irrelevant fantasies and--towards the end when he was running past his deadline--an extended interview with himself.

>Thompson writes on two levels. On one, he is the journalist observing the candidates in action from any accessible perspective. His comments in this regard are revealing both about the problems of campaign coverage and the differences among the candidates. His first encounter with McGovern was in the men's room at the Exeter Inn in New Hampshire. ""People have been asking me about it ever since--as if it were some kind of weird journalistic coup, a rare and unnatural accomplishment pulled off by what had to have been a super-inventive or at least super-aggressive pervert. . . . The point is that anybody could have walked up to that urinal next to McGovern at that moment, and asked him anything they wanted--and he would have answered, the same way he answered me."" Such coverage was virtually impossible with Nixon, who Thompson and the other campaign reporters hardly ever saw except on closed-circuit television.

>On another level, Thompson is defiantly subjective. Unlike his more conventional colleagues, he feels free to denounce hypocritical political maneuvering when he spots it. He saw Humphrey in Florida struggling to co-opt Wallace's position on busing and then later in Wisconsin trying to ""nail down the Black Vote by denouncing Wallace as a racist demagogue, and Nixon as a cynical opportunist for saying the same thing about busing that Humphrey himself had been saying in Florida."" Thompson's reaction: ""There is no way to grasp what a shallow, contemptible and hopelessly dishonest old hack Hubert Humphrey is until you've followed him around for a while on the campaign trail. The double-standard realities of campaign journalism, however, make it difficult for even the best of the 'straight/objective' reporters to write what they actually think and feel about a candidate.""

10fjnl7,Has ANYONE read the underrated YA bop of The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle???,"As a young queer kid I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This was MY book made for ME. 

It is about this 14 year old girl named Charlotte. The year 1834 and this upper class white woman from a background of privilege has to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. On a boat. Full of men. Gross men. Lower class men. *Sailer men*. ***Alone***.

She was supposed to be escorted with two other families but they never showed up for mysterious reasons. And a lot of whack ass stuff happens on the boat. The boat is rumored to be cursed. The Captain is being extra weird.

She ends up slightly kinda sorta befriending a man who is black, poor, old, and just the complete opposite of her. His name is Zachariah and he is the coolest dude on the boat.

Shit hits the fan. And I beg you to stop reading this post and just read the book to prevent spoilers




















Zachariah dies during a mutiny on the ship. Charlotte blames herself so much she puts on pants and joins the crew.

Captain Jaggery calls her Mr. Doyle. Blames her for a murder and damn the rest of the book is just a high seas adventure.

I am gay. I didn't know I was gay reading this during the mid 1990s. But The Backstreet Boys were making me feel funny on the inside so I definitely was feeling confused. I have never been a ""traditional man"". I like wearing dresses, doing my hair, wearing jewelry, and fixing my makeup to complete my outfit. You should have seen my Madonna vogue impression. 

I am 98% sure my gender is male. But I have never cared for gender roles. I was always so confused about my gender when I was a teenager. Was I really male? What does it mean to be male? Am I transgender? Female? In-between?

And here comes Charlotte. This badass female who wore pants and lived life like a man but was still female. This *cis* woman was defying gender roles while still being cis. It was unheard of during the time and I have never read anything like that in my life. I was reading a book about a person LIKE ME.

I remember being a kid and playing pretend as Charlotte Doyle. I had a full ass epilogue to the book in my head that I would act out. Charlotte growing up as Captain of the Seahawk. Hiding her female gender in public, but on the high seas she was completely free as a female. A female who just wore pants and lived a more masculine role. Finding love. Rediscovering her family and siblings years down the line and making amends with them.

Avi just wrote this book and my little gay ass just ran with it. 

As an adult and rereading this book, Charlotte is definitely a queer character. But her queer identity is never clear so *anyone* can fill in her shoes. A transgender male can see himself in her shoes. A non-binary person who doesn't see male or female can put themselves in her shoes. Or a little gay boy who doesn't want to live a traditional masculine role can see himself as Charlotte.

I became a teacher later in life. I always lead the LGBT club in my school and this book was always given out to my rainbow students. A lot of them found themselves in Charlotte place and the rest of them fell in love with the swashbuckler murder story on the high seas. 

It is such a good fucking book and I wish more people know about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10fjnl7/has_anyone_read_the_underrated_ya_bop_of_the_true/,2023-01-18 21:59:37,21,41,books
17wihxz,The sisters of Dorley Hall By Alyson Greaves,"The Sisters of Dorley Hall, by Alyson Greaves.

I cannot recommend this book series enough as an LGBT/transgender read.

The series explores the protagonist Stef uncovering a secret force femme programme at a campus in the UK called Dorley Hall, a secret corrective facility that reeducates violent and abusive men, by turning them into girls against their will.

 However, Stef is not a violent or abusive man, they are a closeted trans woman who gets their way into Dorley Hall to exploit free healthcare (Go UK!)

I will state that this will not be an easy read if you struggle with themes of dysphoria and torture - it is incredibly heavy on themes of dysphoria and how it being forced upon you in a context of not being trans feels like. 

As a transfemme myself, I cannot say in words how difficult some parts of reading it was, parts made me choke up and cry about my own personal experiences of coming to realize my own trans journey. 

The author herself is transgender and I feel that really helps get a narrative across of trans themes and how it presents in a context of it being forced.

I can't recommend it enough!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17wihxz/the_sisters_of_dorley_hall_by_alyson_greaves/,2023-11-16 09:05:41,2,16,books
wcrux1,"The Dark Tower kinda sucks, no?","I was gifted a free (old, 1st ed) Kindle w/ the Dark Tower series on it, so I read the 1st book. It felt surprisingly amateurish, I honestly couldn't believe how disappointed I was in it all-around:

* the meager character development,
* thin plot that relies almost entirely on mystery the readers' intrigue,
* an inevitable and trite confrontation at the end of an overall predictable odyssey.
* The fictional world development, again, just felt anemic.
* And I ***hate*** (and am insulted by!) the way he wrote the female ""characters"", oh my god - and why does the gunslinger feel so many of his (nonsexual) feelings in his loins??
* Even the language, again it's borderline amateurish, just a lot of dull sentences reinforced with wholly unnecessary colorful adjectives, and way too much description of landscape that's done *much* better by other writers (Jean M Auel comes to mind).
* Dialogue is built riddle upon riddle, as though he trusts the reader to follow the breadcrumb trail, and then - agonizingly - the reader is patronized *over and over again* with reminders: ""Allie, you know, the girl with the scar I fucked and then killed? The one from the town. The murder spree, remember? With all the people? After all the sex? That Allie."" JFC YES WE REMEMBER, would you care to clarify *anything else in this goddamn plot?!*

The Afterword was the most well-written part of the entire book, and that was written in the form of a letter from King to the reader (EDIT - though he did compare himself to *fucking Chaucer, the nerve!*). I will say there were chunks of prose, few and far between, where I admired the writing, and tiny sprinkles of other well-utilized language here and there.

I know people (men/boys mostly) who have been totally enamored with this series and there is not a single thing I find appealing about it. I can only imagine that their interest is in identifying, somehow, with the pallid stoicism of the gunslinger whose emotions are Oedipal and un-evolved. I truly believe if this wasn't written by King it would have been passed over as some creative writing exercise by a neckbeard wannabe.

Shall not be reading the rest of them. Ugh. **UGH I SAY.**

**EDIT:** Downvoted a bunch so far but no substantive arguments to the contrary. If you disagree, *why do you disagree?* I need some explanation from an alternate viewpoint.

**EDIT2:** Thanks everyone! This was apparently the **#1 most controversial post on all of Reddit** in the hour after it posted, gaining me automatic access to the exclusive r/ControversialClub subreddit.

I don't think I've ever been this invested in a book before. The descriptions of everything he experiences are so well written that I found myself wanting not to read on, just to escape the uncomfortable feeling the scenes are creating. I think it captures the post WWI feeling of a world in chaos tremendously. What are your take on the book, and what are your favourite passages? 
I've included one of my favourite passages just after we arrive in NY. 


""It so happened that just to one side of my bench there was a big hole in the sidewalk, something like the
Metro at home. That hole seemed propitious, so vast, with a stairway all of pink marble inside it. I'd seen
quite a few people from the street disappear into it and come out again. It was in that underground vault
that they answered the call of nature. I caught on right away. The hall where the business was done was
likewise of marble. A kind of swimming pool, but drained of all its water, a fetid swimming pool, filled only
with filtered, moribund light, which fell on the forms of unbuttoned men surrounded by their smells, red in
the face from the effect of expelling their stinking feces with barbarous noises in front of everybody.
Men among men, all free and easy, they laughed and joked and cheered one another on, it made me think
of a football game. The first thing you did when you got there was to take off your jacket, as if in
preparation for strenuous exercise. This was a rite and shirtsleeves were the uniform.
In that state of undress, belching and worse, gesticulating like lunatics, they settled down in the fecal
grotto. The new arrivals were assailed with a thousand revolting jokes while descending the stairs from the
street, but they all seemed delighted.
The morose aloofness of the men on the street above was equaled only by the air of liberation and rejoicing
that came over them at the prospect of emptying their bowels in tumultuous company.
The splotched and spotted doors to the cabins hung loose, wrenched from their hinges. Some customers
went from one cell to another for a little chat, those waiting for an empty seat smoked heavy cigars and
slapped the backs of the obstinately toiling occupants, who sat there straining with their heads between
their hands. Some groaned like wounded men or women in labor. The constipated were threatened with
ingenious tortures.
When a gush of water announced a vacancy, the clamor around the free compartment redoubled, and as
often as not a coin would be tossed for its possession. No sooner read, newspapers, though as thick as
pillows, were dismembered by the horde of rectal toilers. The smoke made it hard to distinguish faces, and
the smells deterred me from going too close.
To a foreigner the contrast was disconcerting. Such free-and-easy intimacy, such extraordinary intestinal
familiarity, and up on the street such perfect restraint. It left me stunned.
I returned to the light of day by the same stairway and went back to the same bench to rest. Sudden
outburst of digestive vulgarity. Discovery of a joyous shitting communism. I ignored both these
disconcerting aspects of the same adventure. I hadn't the strength for analysis or synthesis. My pressing
desire was to sleep. O rare, delicious frenzy!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q0do4r/passages_from_journey_to_the_end_of_night/,2021-10-03 08:19:40,1,12,books
12yzi0m,Historical inaccuracies stopped me from enjoying 'The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi.',"Being a big fan of Shannon Chakraborty's Daevabad Trilogy, I was excited to start a new series by her. Unfortunately, I found 'Amina Al-Sirafi' disappointing. The plot was predictable, the characters didn't have much personality, and there was a ridiculous number of anachronisms, especially in its portrayal of sex and gender.

The protagonist, Amina, acts more like a modern-day American than someone who lived in the Middle East in the Twelfth Century. There's a scene where she sees a girl being sold at a slave auction - presumably to be forced into sex-work - and starts ranting about men hypocritically having extramarital relationships while expecting their wives to remain chaste. A valid point, but wasn't it normal for men in the Middle East at that time to have multiple wives and concubines? Why would she be so outraged at an accepted part of her culture? She's also much more open about her own sexuality than one would expect from a woman during that period of history. 

Amina's first mate is openly gay, something which she not only accepts, but it's implied always has, never mentioning that it took her time to be comfortable with his sexuality. 

The whole purpose of Amina's journey is to return the daughter of a deceased crewmate to her family. When she finds the girl, we learn she ran away from her family because she is transgender, which Amina instantly understands. The character should really be referred to as a he, but that doesn't happen until the very end of the book. 

Gay and transgender people have always existed - even if those terms didn't - just like there have always been women who rebelled against their culture's expectations of them, but the way those ideas are incorporated into the plot of this book aren't consistent with its setting. 

Speculative fiction can be an excellent medium for commenting on social issues. For example, 'The Dragon Prince' has complex female and queer characters whom the other characters respect. But that show takes place in a world that is entirely fictional, it is acceptable for the writers to invent their own norms. 'Amina Al-Sirafi' is also a fantasy, but it takes place in our world during a time and place where people had very specific attitudes about the roles different genders filled.

Novels exploring what it meant to be a woman or queer in pre-modern settings can be compelling \*if\* the author respects the nuances of what those identities meant to people who lived during the time period in-which their story is set. Sarah Waters does this beautifully in 'The Paying Guests' and 'The Fingersmith.' 

What makes all this so frustrating is that Chakraborty begins the novel with an author's note explaining how she tried to recreate Twelfth Century Islamic society as accurately as possible. You can't have it both ways. You can't say you care about accuracy in your historical-fiction novel, then use it to soap box about your own modern political beliefs. 

I'm not an expert on Medieval Islam, so anyone more educated on these subjects can feel free to correct me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12yzi0m/historical_inaccuracies_stopped_me_from_enjoying/,2023-04-25 23:19:26,15,22,books
skhkt4,"""Forget the Alamo"" Review (Trigger warning for Texas)"," “Forget the Alamo” is as much a historiography as it is a moral question of the symbolism of Texas’ roots. Authors Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson, and Jason Stanford have no qualms tersely stating facts about the Texas Revolution: it was about slavery. It is under this discomforting axiom, along the historical unveiling of the Alamo’s iniquitous triumvirate of heroes—William B. Travis, Jim Bowie, and Davy Crockett—who fought for the establishment of slavery, that the narrative of heroism must reconcile with prevailing facts, morals, or what some call “revisionism.” However, the heroism promulgated by those obsequious to the apocryphal narrative—that is, renditions by Disney, John Wayne, and a few third-rate writers—proved every bit as pernicious as the one initially fabricated by Sam Houston. 

Unlike Texas’ mandated 7th-grade Texas history class (which I have *endured*, and I use that word as an affirmation to the authors’ point), the book substantially weaves the purview of an intricate political and economic climate leading to the Battle of San Jacinto. Texas was a hostile land for anyone who dared to call it home. The Spanish colonists in Texas were subject to hostilities from the Comanche, Apache, and inclement weather. Barely able to sustain the settlement in San Antonio, the Spanish governor of the province fielded an offer from Stephen F. Austin’s father, Moses Austin. The provincial government approved Austin’s offer, and after his death Stephen would take reins over the American settlement. However, Stephen F. Austin was explicitly clear that the only way Americans were willing to settle in Texas was with slave labor. Spain allowed slavery, but after Mexico won its independence from Spain, slavery was outlawed in all its territories, including Texas. Herein lies the incipient cause of the Texas Revolution. 

The Mexican government would experience political infighting and regime changes, but the country was always overwhelmingly against slavery. Austin and his allies would negotiate government provisions allowing loopholes for his settlement to keep slaves, but Mexico had enough of the political maneuvers and appeasement; slaves were to be freed. Even so, the conflict was not this simple. It began with Tejanos (Texans of Mexican descent) fighting against the latest iteration of centralist Mexican government. The opportunistic American settlers were eager to join the insurrection if the euphemisms for “freedom” and “federalism” meant the freedom to own slaves, which they did. 

By the time General Santa Anna, Mexico’s president, gathered an army to fight the rebellion in Texas, the Alamo was being fortified by Travis, Bowie, Crockett, and a contingency of Texians, Tejanos, and American military “deserters” (I use quotations because there is reason to believe the U.S. supported the rebellion with soldiers they listed as deserters who would return to their U.S. Army posts). Vastly outnumbered, everyone in the Alamo knew the odds were against them. Travis’s famous letters from the Alamo, requesting reinforcements, were read with reluctance to send aid. Few would muster to reinforce them. Santa Anna arrived waving a no quarter flag, and the Alamo fell after days of siege. 

For whatever strategic importance or irrelevance the men at the Alamo fought, it was vindicated with the heroic narrative the chief of the Texian regular army, Sam Houston, invented to rile his men. Sam Houston fabricated heroic accounts of the Alamo and used the loss as a battle cry in his victory over Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto. In a sense, fighting, despite being outnumbered and facing a blood flag, is heroic. But given ample opportunity to destroy the Alamo and withdraw east, as Sam Houston ordered before the siege, the last stand at the Alamo was hubris. There was nothing gained, if not for the battle cry. Houston would capitalize on their martyrdom, and so would future generations. 

The real story of the Alamo would be distilled into a purely heroic narrative. Presidents would use the story of going down fighting to the last man as a pep talk during war or professional sports games. Accounts of men surrendering to Mexico’s forces, such as Crockett, were left out of the story’s traditionalist lore. However, the mere facts that discredit fictional renditions are not the only point of heated contention today. 

Before Texas was embattled in protecting children from guilt or discomfort from critical race theory, Mexican-American children have been subject to those very things that the Republican Party claims it wants to prevent. Mexican-American Texans have expressed discomfort or guilt from the heroic narrative of the Alamo in the state’s mandated Texas history class that paints their ancestors as bad guys, but Hispanic groups would attempt to ameliorate their pride.

Among the Anglos who defended the Alamo, there were Tejanos who fought and died with them. Tejanos would later suffer injustices from the Anglos in Texas. Many were removed, or ran away from the Anglos’ hostilities, and their history was whitewashed. However, some Hispanics, including Texas school board members and LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens), would argue for the inclusion of Tejanos in the heroic narrative of the Alamo to “instill pride in Hispanic children” (p. 277). After infighting and Twitter controversy, the Texas schoolboard moved to appease everyone fighting for a slice of the Alamo’s ethos. The state now mandates that the story of the Alamo include “the heroism of the diverse defenders” (p.283). 

Despite this facile appeasement, there still remains the overarching cause for the heroism at the Alamo: slavery. While much of the country has abjured the imbuement of Confederate causes by removing statues, Texans and their politicians have been using the Alamo as a rhetorical contest of signification. Whether they want to preserve the false, traditional narrative, or include diverse defenders, it remains an immoral cause any way they appropriate it for people’s egos. Although not every Tejano wanted to preserve a slaveocracy, the fact remains they were complicit no matter how much Anglos were responsible for coopting the Tejano’s fight for federalism. Eventually, Tejanos got what the Mexican government experienced from the immoral slaveholders all along—betrayal. (Who would have thought that people who own humans as chattel could not be trusted?) 

For the sake of accuracy, Tejanos should be included in the story. It should also be clear that the men in the Alamo fought to keep slaves. However, if America is willing to condemn the imbuement of Confederate causes, the Alamo’s narrative should be no exception to this judgement. The conversation about the Alamo should transcend the contest and appropriation of the Alamo’s ethos, and the event should be taught for what it was without underlying narratives. As the authors put it, the Alamo should be treated as any other historic Spanish mission. 

The book traverses the morass of the Alamo’s curated symbolism, infighting between museum lobbyists, politics, and contemporary cultural conflict—all without losing sight of the underlying cause of the war. The mere emphasis on the role of slavery invariably draws ire from those who seek to compel the euphemisms of “freedom from tyranny,” being fought for and won in 1836, in a state where African Americans would not be freed from their tyrants until June 19, 1865 (for which we now celebrate Juneteenth). If all it takes is a statement of facts for Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick to [cancel](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/01/texas-forget-the-alamo-book-event-canceled/) the authors’ book event at the Bullock Texas State History Museum, the magnitude of the symbolism warrants the book’s writing. And if the authors are accused of [presentism](https://www.texaspolicy.com/dont-forget-the-alamo-do-fight-the-books-revisionist-fake-history-to-the-last-man/) by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, despite thousands of men dying in a moral fight to free slaves *in 1836*, the book warrants reading. These recalcitrant, baseless accusations project the inculcation of falsehoods. There is always room for nuance and skepticism of motives, but the truth of slavery’s role is self-evident. The book is not a belligerent in the culture war. Rather, it winnows facts from euphemisms, and it challenges compelled thoughts and narratives that obfuscate a sordid cause.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/skhkt4/forget_the_alamo_review_trigger_warning_for_texas/,2022-02-04 16:29:24,62,54,books

I've been reading these books and yeah, they're lots of fun, but there is something not quite right about them that I can't put my finger on.

It seems like the scenes aren't that descriptive. Or rather, it feels like some scenes should have a lot more description than they end up having. Like, the author brings up this one thing and you're like 'Oh, that is important, it's probably going to go for at least a page or so.' but then it just turns into a paragraph or something.

If anyone else has read this series and would like to put in their own two cents, please, feel free. I've been dying to talk to someone about this series, but I don't have any friends who have read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11e69rn/something_about_the_series_cute_mutants_by_sj/,2023-02-28 13:38:53,5,11,books

16kt6i4,"Thoughts on ""The Salt Grows Heavy"" - a story that isn't talked about enough.","I recently started posting reviews and thought I'd also share them here. Any feedback on my writing and pointers on improving it are appreciated.

# Review of ""The Salt Grows Heavy"" by Cassandra Khaw

Ever wondered what happened to Ariel after the credits rolled?

Are *'happily ever afters'* even a thing?

In this morbid retelling of the classic fairy tale, the mermaid never got her ‘happily ever after’. As a matter of fact, she never even signed up for it.

>It is always interesting to see how often women are described as ravenous when it is the men who, without exception, take without thought of compensation.

Kidnapped from her home by the prince, disfigured, and forced to bear his children, she becomes the mother of the plague.

Mermaids have teeth, and their humanoid children? Well, no one knew what they would entail until it was too late.

>I glimpse the fair circle of their victim’s face; its eyes gouged, its cheeks flensed, its skull emptied of sweetbreads. Mermaids—especially those born half-prince—leave nothing to waste.

Now, as her daughters consume the kingdom, the mermaid finally finds herself finally free.

On her path without a destination, she is joined by the plague doctor, and this unlikely duo takes us through the nightmarish landscape of the world of ‘The Salt Grows Heavy’.

From the very beginning, I was in awe of Khaw’s writing. Even though it is riddled with obscenely complicated vocabulary, her vivid imagery and the casual goriness of her writing more than make up for it.

Despite being laced with horror, at its core, ‘The Salt Grows Heavy’ is a tale of love.

It is a story of finding companionship in the most unlikely of places, and a lesson that not all love looks the same.

>I would follow them into the demise of the universe where every heaven and each hell is shuttered, and there is nothing of us but motings of wan light, and there is no bodily apparatus with which to express affection, no recourse save to glow weakly in worship until at last, such things are swallow too by the dark.  
That I would love them even then.

If someone were to ask me what the plot of the story exactly is…I wouldn't be able to answer.

But that is the charm of this novel. Khaw’s words draw you in and it holds you hostage. It is, what I can only describe as a sort of literary Stockholm Syndrome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16kt6i4/thoughts_on_the_salt_grows_heavy_a_story_that/,2023-09-17 06:15:55,9,34,books
bq85u4,"What is ""Machiavellian Politics""? Using the book ""The Prince"" to actually explain the term.","So many times in conversation, people will use the word Machiavellian, but they don't mean much by it. People use it without reading his book. On Google, it is defined as trying your best to maintain power. I thought this was interesting, because that was the face-value reason he wrote ""The Prince"", but not actually a summary of it's contents.

Generally, when the word comes up in conversation, it means something along the lines of ""deceitful politics"" or ""cruel politics"". I want to use his book to try and let people know what Machiavellian politics actually are.

I will give a kind of bulleted list describing what he considered to be good politics. I will also take the liberty to ""translate"" ideas into a modern setting (For example, I will say states, not principalities). It is also important to note that ""Machiavellian Politics"" as defined in the Prince, specifically addresses parties of great power, It would apply more to the President or a Saudi leader than to a member of the US House.

---

Chapters I-III - Discussing the types of states, not referenced when someone says ""Machiavellian Politics""

**How Machiavelli would handle politics are described after this point.**

Chapter IV - There are two types of administrators under you, people appointed by you (Ministers), and people appointed to power before you were (Nobles).

Nobles are fickle, **it is easier to turn peoples of power who have held that position for a long time to your cause**. But they won't support you in the long term. **Your appointed bureaucracy will help you rule effectively if you appoint them after attaining power.**

Chapter V - How to conquer free people, not relevant to the definition.

Chapter VI - **Setting unattainable goals is good.** Because the hard work you will do to achieve them will be of benefit.

Acquiring a position of power with skill is the hardest way, but the best way.

Chapter VII - Acquiring a position of power through luck or money is the easiest way, but the hardest to maintain.

**Before taking power, you must set up the roots of people loyal to you.** Do this by making friends and eliminating enemies. **It is much harder to create loyalty when you already have power.**

Chapter VIII - Acquiring a position of power with criminal acts is the worst way to do it.

However, if one needs to use criminal means for power, **all criminal acts must be done all at once to achieve power**, then **use your gained position in a manner somewhat consistently benevolent.** Constant crime won't let you rule forever.

Chapter IX: **It is much better to have the support of the lower class than the upper class.** The upper-class desires too much, the lower class just wants to be left alone.

When delegating power to Magistrates close to the common folk, the common folk will like the magistrates more than the ruler. **Delegation of power should be done in positions far from the commons.**

Chapter X - **You must be charismatic and hopeful towards the commons during wartime.**

Chapter XI - Satire about religious governments, not relevant.

Chapter XII - **Using your army is always better than using the army of others.**

Chapter XIII - Not using your army may seem good in prosperous times, but time is fickle and it will fail eventually.

Chapter XIV - **War is the most important thing for a leader to study.** Because you cannot have the ""armed"" men in your nation loyal if you are not ""armed"" yourself. And they have the power to break you.

Chapter XV - **The standard moral compass is wrong.** The dichotomy of Condemnation vs Praise is usually thought of in terms of virtues (compassion, faith, craftiness, and generosity) and sins (Cowardice, cruelty, stubbornness, and miserliness).

**The true dichotomy that makes a man good vs evil is Doing what is Good for your state vs what is bad for your state. If an act of stubbornness is used to safeguard the state, then it is morally good.**

Chapter XVI - **Generosity is bad.** Eventually, you will run out of money, and retracted generosity is received worse than never having any.

**Stinginess is good**, because saving money will eventually be perceived as generosity, by building public works and maintaining low taxes for example.

XVII - There are two types of cruelty. The cruelty that makes men fear you. The cruelty that makes men hate you (Taking land and abusing women are listed as examples). **You should be loved and feared**, but being feared is better than being loved if a choice is to be made.

**One should never commit cruelty that makes one hated.**

Chapter XVIII - **A ruler should always keep the facade of benevolence and trust.** Do not act menacingly or untrustworthy. However, **one should always break a promise if breaking it benefits you**. Determining if a broken promise will benefit you is a great skill, and hard to achieve.

**Men are fickle, do not trust them.**

Chapter XIX - Never be hated by your people. **Force other people in the Bureaucracy to implement unfavorable laws, only implement favorable laws yourself.**

Chapter XX - **Having an armed population is great for trust. Disarming a population is terrible for trust.**

If these arms are the subject of revolt, a leader should incite revolt to oust them from hiding, and put them down quickly.

Chapter XXI: **Gain reverence by waging war, avoiding neutrality, having allies weaker than you, public displays of rewards and punishment, and my letting the common folk be, maintaining low taxes.**

Chapter XXII - **It is best to advise yourself.** If you are uneducated in a situation, having helpful advisors is acceptable. **But not recognizing you need advisors makes you a useless ruler.**

Chapter XXIII - Have useful advisors, **flatterers are useless.**

Chapter XXIV - Not relevant (Current state of Italy)

Chapter XXV - Half of one's ascension to power is luck. **One must adapt to luck as best as possible**, like men build dikes before a river floods. **If you continue to make the same decisions that got you power in the first place, and never adapt, you will lose it.**

1b6lvy2,"The Hemingses of Monticello, by Annette Gordon-Reed","I'm not quite done with it yet, got about 50 pages to go, but I want to go ahead and plug it now since I'm sure my opinion isn't going to change in the next hour or two.

To me the most remarkable thing about the book is how legitimate and powerful the author makes an awful lot of speculation.  There are really very few records of Sally Hemings' life, and her long term relationship with Thomas Jefferson was treated very quietly even among his friends.  As though it were nonexistent.  And so the book is really built on sand.  Until now, I would have said this much speculation must doom a book to being trivial.  Not worth consideration.

But when the speculation is so careful and thoughtful as it is here, I see now there's a difference.  It's possible to get real meaning out a miscellaneous collection of very small incidents.  And the author does that.  She inflates these people, the Hemingses, into a whole tribe of different people with different discoverable characteristics, human characteristics that differentiate them from each other and from us, and unite them as a family, at the same time.  She takes a group with almost no historical existence and recovers them as individuals, as a people, and as an aspect of their time.  As a lens, through which to view Jefferson and his people.  It's really wonderful.  I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but here it is.  It should have won a Booker Prize.

To me the most telling paragraph was this one:  ""The lives of Robert and James Hemings were even more complicated than Douglass's on this score, for there were many more ways in which Jefferson raised their expectations about what they had a right to have in life.  It would have been a far simpler matter for Jefferson, and forestalled the conflicts that later arose, if he had given Robert and James Hemings fewer or no opportunities to develop identities apart from him.  Their heritage almost surely affected the way they viewed their circumstances.  The Hemings brothers knew that the man who controlled their lives had inherited a fortune that would have been theirs if they, the sons of John Wayles, had been born free white men.  Robert was an eldest son in a world where that position meant something.  There was nothing the brothers could do about it, but that did not prevent them - as \[Frederick\] Douglass would do years later - from considering the obvious.""

To me, it's one thing to consider the bulk theft of the lives and work of the enslaved people who made the Virginia system work.  It all blends together and gets the label ""slavery"" and disappears into ""whaddayagonnado.""  It's quite another to try to imagine how many individuals were robbed, under color of law, of wealth that would have been theirs if they had only been white.  It particularizes the problem, for me, in a very different way.  Jefferson's wealth came primarily from his marriage to Martha Wayles, because her father, John, had no sons to whom to leave it.  Well; he had sons.  Martha's brothers.  The Hemingses.

Well.  It's a very good book.

ba95t1,The War on Normal People,"###Disclaimer   
I was told long reviews aren't welcome here, so this isn't that. I would try to be reasonably brief. I can't do justice to the book within a reasonable length limit, but I'll try my best.

Frankly, American society is fucked, and most Americans don't know it yet. A metaphor I find appropriate — it appears in the book as well, so perhaps it inspired me — is the story of the frog in a pot. The story goes that if the water in the pot is suddenly rapidly heated, the frog would jump out of the water immediately, but that if it is gradually raised over time, the frog would continually adjust until it's too late to flee, and it's thus boiled alive. America is that frog, the water is her economy, and the fire is automation.   
   
Eric Weinstein said:   
> No one ever thought that capitalism would get eaten by its son technology.  
  
That's where we're at now. In the US economy inequality is at [an all time high never before seen in US history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) ([the richest 5% of Americans own two thirds of the wealth](https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/), and the trend is only worsening. We've automated away four million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2015, and by some estimates by 2030 we'll have automated away 45 million. This great displacement of workers from the work force could have catastrophic societal effects and is already wrecking society currently (suicide and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicular deaths as the chief causes of deaths in America. Life expectancy has declined for three years straight (last time this happened was the Spanish Flu in 1918, labour force participation rate is at 63% (comparable to Guatemala and El Salvator) and by almost all performance metrics, society is on a spiralling downward trend (Social unrest would only exacerbate as millions more are displaced from the work force, so it isn't getting better anytime soon)). Yet GDP, and the stock market prices are at record highs. For the vast majority of Americans, the economy isn't working for them.   
  
&nbsp;   
The book is split into three parts.  
   
Part 1: ""What's Happening to Jobs""  covers the changes happening to the job market. Several jobs (both blue collar and white collar, basically any repetitive work regardless cognitive or manual) are amenable to automation or replacement with artificial intelligence. These jobs are going and are not coming back. Unlike previous industrial revolutions, this one is different — History repeats itself until it doesn't. The invention of the self driving car is a different kind of invention from the invention of the automobile. For the first time in history we now have machines that can perform tasks that where exclusively the purview of humans in the past, and that's going to cause a permanent, radical shift in the job market. The fourth industrial revolution would create new jobs, but the jobs would be much fewer in number than the displaced jobs, may be in different locations, and would require vastly different skill sets. For every 100 jobs you displace with robots, you may create only 10 jobs servicing the robots, administering them, working on software, etc. The job market is undergoing a fundamental change, and the old market isn't coming back.    
   
&nbsp;   
Part 2: ""What's Happening to Us"" focuses on the relationship between humans and work. Voltaire said work keeps at bay 3 great evils: boredom, vice and need. Work provides structure to people's life. It fills them with a sense of purpose of belonging, and makes them feel valuable. For men in particular, unemployment is one of the worst things that can happen. Long term unemployment causes more unhappiness than the loss of a spouse or limb. Men who are unemployed volunteer less often than employed men, participate less in their communities, and generally become more antisocial. They end up succumbing to alcohol and drugs, and many take their own life. The problem Yang says is that humans need work, but work doesn't need us.    
   
In a world without jobs, if these needs are not met, society would continue it's downward spiral, and eventually violent outbreaks would occur. To prevent this, we would need to fundamentally rethink the social contract and how we intrinsically value ourselves when the market does not value us.    
>If revolution there must be it is better to undertake it than to undergo it.    
    
&nbsp;   
Part 3: ""Solutions and Human Capitalism"" presents a vision to move forward. In the first two parts of the book, Yang drives home the point that dystopia is our default, and that following the logic of the marketplace would drive us off a cliff. In this part he focuses on solutions that he believes can move us in the right direction.   
   
The first step is a proposal for universal basic income to handle at least the need provision of work and free up people to pursue more creative or entrepreneurial ventures that may be too risky in our society.   
   
The other major proposal, is a fundamental rethinking of our economy. As is, the economy doesn't serve humanity, humanity serves the economy and that's perverse. You achieve what you measure, so Yang proposes indexing economic well being by other statistics that more closely reflect the wellbeing of the average person than something like GDP (e.g quality adjusted life expectancy, childhood success rates, etc). Building on this, Yang proposes centering our economy around human welfare to form a new kind of capitalism which he calls human centered capitalism (or human capitalism for short). He goes into specific details of his human capitalism approach and paints an optimistic image of a bright future.

oqvpyn,"The count of monte Cristo final chapter, trying not to spoil but please inquire within.","The Greek girl haydee that the count takes as his lover at the end of the book somehow doesn't sit right with me. As part of his revenge against Mercedes husband he bought the girl as a slave to use as a pawn for the destruction of fernand. And while I know she is complicit in that act of revenge because Fernand is who betrayed her father and consequently was responsible for his murder I can't help but feel that their intimacy isn't organic. He repeated stated that his love for her was like that of a father but unlike a good father he did not allow her to live as though she were free, she was legally and contractual obligated to his every whim and although she had anything and everything she needed or wanted and occasioned the plays and concerts were a means of getting out it is explicitly stated that the count was the only man she ever had any interaction with outside of his other servants. To me it was the equivalent of having the most extravagant jail cell life had to offer at the time the book was written in but at the end of the day she was very much doomed to her cell like Edmond was.

This isolation and seclusion I think was the main catalyst of what made her feelings for the count as strong as they were because she had to have been extremely lonely and socially isolated to the point that to have her emotional needs met then her feelings for him as her sole social outlet, provider, and protector had to transform into something more than what it would have otherwise been, i.e instead of loving him as a father like how he loved her as a daughter she had strong romantic feelings as she grew into a woman. The basis of her love for him was of isolation and him being her only form of sustenance and so it would seem impossible for her to have any form of romantic interaction outside of him.

If my interpretation is off please let me know but it seems that everybody around the count was as much a prisoner of his revenge as he was and instead of letting her live free with a golden parachute and disappearing like I believe he should have he took her as his own knowing full well she had never even had an opportunity to court other men outside of trying to set her up with Maximilian but even that was facilitated by the count himself and not of her own free will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oqvpyn/the_count_of_monte_cristo_final_chapter_trying/,2021-07-24 18:43:41,19,10,books
i765zf,I got excited about reading for the first time in years,"So for the past few years I have been struggling to read. I tried all type of genres,I picked up old classics, I tried out highly acclaimed fantasy series,I even tried motivational books. And nothing was sticking. I would get a third of way through the book and realize I wasn't enjoying it. For example I started The Way of Kings by Branden Sanderson. Highly acclaimed, the summary seemed right up my alley, but 1/3rd of the way through I just didn't care and put it on the shelf. I feel like I should like it but I didnt 

I was mainly attributing it to the fact that I feel I don't have a very good imagination. Im one of those people who watches the movie so that when I read the book everything is already in place, I know what everyone looks looks like ECT. Than I connected it to my lack of understanding, so I started to take notes. Write down a summary of each chapter as I read them. This led to it taking a long time for me to read a single chapter though.

Well last week I discovered Marvel Unlimited. Basically you pay 10 bucks a month and you get access to an insane amount of marvel comics. Now I love the X-Men, I was reading through the original comics a while back. So I did the free trial and I gathered up the old X-Men comics, the newest ones, and a random series I found called Black Bolt.

kqs440,Can the interpretation of books grow along with their authors? Or are they set in stone?,"I have wanted to make this post for a while, but put it off out of fear of the divisive nature, but here it goes. Let me preface all of this by saying I am not taking sides, I do not think one side is right/wrong, and anybody is allowed to enjoy a novel however they want. 

For years, discourse over Fight Club and American Psycho has remained incredibly fervent. Most of it revolves around people from more left leaning circles mocking people from more right leaning circles for idolizing certain aspects of characters like Patrick and Tyler. The interpretations of most at the time of these books’ releases is that they were very clever satires on subjects like masculinity.  Many lauded Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk as great subversive satirists.

But, those books were released decades ago, times have changed, and so have the authors. Most probably would have put both Bret and Chuck as left leaning at the times of those books’ releases. Now, I think it is very fair to say that both men now lean to the opposite side. For easy examples of this, I would say listen to Bret’s podcast that he actually did with Chuck, it is free on Bret’s Twitter. 

Without having to get too specific on the details of what these men believe in now, I will just ask my questions. After years of laughing at “fans” of Patrick and Tyler, would it be fair for those types to now laugh at THEM because Bret and Chuck are more on “their side”? Will those books and characters remain satire even if the authors no longer subscribe to the ideologies that the satire is tied to? Will the mainstream interpretations of these books always stay the same? Hell, Bret has seemingly “furthered canon” by talking about how Patrick would react to current events. 

I don’t want to start arguments or anything, just curious on how people feel about my questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kqs440/can_the_interpretation_of_books_grow_along_with/,2021-01-05 06:06:33,11,1,books

uigzdm,"In 1980, the godmother of SFF, Octavia Butler, wrote an amazing essay that for many reasons hasn't been read or heard of. If you you are a writer, reader, or lover of SFF you owe it to yourself to read it. She skillfully writes about issues still plaguing the entire industry today.","> Fourteen years ago, during my first year of college, I sat in a creative writing class and listened as my teacher, an elderly man, told another student not to use black characters in his stories unless those characters’ blackness was somehow essential to the plots. The presence of blacks, my teacher felt, changed the focus of a story, drew attention from the intended subject.

These are the first words of Octavia butlers powerful essay, ""The Lost Races of Science Fiction"". These words written in 1980 would make me think Butler could predict the future. Her words hit home today even greater when conversations of diversity are more readily had, but came from a a time when people rarely talked about diversity and representation to this extent. The biggest reason for me making this post is because people haven't read her or this wonderfully crafted essay. It was 1980 and it didn't make a splash in the lit world. Partly because it was in a magazine that was only published once and was ran by a teenager. Thankfully it was collected in a book recently so it's more easily available. 


 I've recently re read it and found a few parts so profound I wanted to share them and start a discussion. I'll include a link to the the entire essay at the bottom.

-----

>Science fiction reaches into the future, the past, the human mind. It reaches out to other worlds and into other dimensions. Is it really so limited, then, that it cannot reach into the lives of ordinary everyday humans who happen not to be white?

>Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why? As a black and a science fiction writer, I’ve heard that question often. I’ve also heard several answers. And, because most people try to be polite, there have been certain answers I haven’t heard. That’s all right. They’re obvious.

>Best, though, and most hopeful from my point of view, I’ve heard from people who want to write science fiction, or who’ve written a few pieces, perhaps, and who would like to include minority characters, but aren’t sure how to go about it. Since I’ve had to solve the same problem in reverse, maybe I can help.

>But first some answers to my question: Why have there been so few minority characters in science fiction?

>Let’s examine my teacher’s reason. Are minority characters—black characters in this case—so disruptive a force that the mere presence of one alters a story, focuses it on race rather than whatever the author had in mind? Yes, in fact, black characters can do exactly that if the creators of those characters are too restricted in their thinking to visualize blacks in any other context.

>This is the kind of stereotyping, conscious or subconscious, that women have fought for so long. No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters. No writer who regards blacks as people would get sidetracked into justifying their blackness or their presence unless such justification honestly played a part in the story. It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.

On the various writing subs and even reading subs we see people talk about black characters as being political and only write them if it's relevant to the story. Or if they see a character who's black they need immediate justification for that or else it takes them out of the story. 

She suggests that writers who have trouble giving black characters interesting backgrounds and stories, and writers who get sidetracked justifying “why” a character is black, are incapable of regarding black people as people. She compares this to the stereotyping that women have historically received and concludes, “It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.” This is especially apt because of her double identity as a woman and a black person and how they intersect. 



>Now, what about the possibility of substituting extra-terrestrials for blacks—in order to make some race-related point without making anyone…uncomfortable? In fact, why can’t blacks be represented by whites—who are not too thoroughly described—thus leaving readers free to use their imaginations and visualize whichever color they like?

>I usually manage to go on being polite when I hear questions like these, but it’s not easy.

>Onward, then. Let’s replace blacks with tentacled beings from Capella V. What will readers visualize as we describe relations between the Capellans and the (white) humans? Will they visualize black humans dealing with white humans? I don’t think so. This is science fiction, after all. If you tell your readers about tentacled Capellans, they’re going to visualize tentacled Capellans. And if your readers are as touchy about human races as you were afraid they might be when you substituted the Capellans, are they really likely to pay attention to any analogy you draw? I don’t think so.

This is something I've felt but usually don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain. I've seldom met a ""racism but it's androids, elves, meta humans, aliens"" metaphor that didn't fall flat to me as a black person. Butler takes everything I've felt about it and puts it on display. It always made me feel like white people couldn't emphasize with me as a black person when I talk about racism and discrimination but could completely get it if it was an alien or fantasy race. 



>That brings me to another question I hear often at science fiction conventions. “Why are there so few black science fiction writers?” I suspect for the same reason there were once so few women science fiction writers. Women found a certain lack of authenticity in a genre that postulated a universe largely populated by men in which all the power was in male hands, and women stayed in their male-defined places.

>Science fiction writers come from science fiction readers, generally. Few readers equal few writers. The situation is improving, however. Blacks are not as likely as whites to spend time and money going to conventions, but there is a growing black readership. Black people I meet now are much more likely to have read at least some science fiction, and are not averse to reading more. 

She touches on a question that is still being asked. A question that ive asked too when I was younger. I think the growing readership gets more diverse every year year! I think that the more we get diverse readers we'll see diverse writers get more chances and properly compensated because the disparity between award winning and exceptional black authors and new and unproven white authors is too high. [This article about the viral hashtag  #PublishingPaidMe into the numbers] (https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/6/17/21285316/publishing-paid-me-diversity-black-authors-systemic-bias) 

>A more insidious problem than outright racism is simply habit, custom. Science fiction has always been nearly all white, just as until recently, it’s been nearly all male. A lot of people have had a chance to get comfortable with things as they are. Too comfortable. Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change. But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest. You can still go to conventions and hear deliberately sexist remarks—if the speaker thinks he has a sympathetic audience. People resent being told their established way of doing things is wrong, resent being told they should change, and strongly resent being told they won’t be alone any longer in the vast territory—the universe—they’ve staked out for themselves. I don’t think anyone seriously believes the world of the future will be all white any more than anyone believes the present world is all white. But custom can be strong enough to prevent people from seeing the need for science fiction to reflect a more realistic view. 

>A second insidious problem is laziness, possibly combined with ignorance. Authors who have always written of all-white universes might not feel particularly threatened by a multicolored one, but might consider the change too much trouble. After all, they already know how to do what they’ve been doing. Their way works. Why change? Besides, maybe they don’t know any minority people. How can they write about people they don’t know?

Custom and laziness are two of the biggest reasons why science fiction and fantasy has been kept so monochromatic and from the outside looks so unwelcoming to anyone who isn't the standard white man. Customarily she makes the point of people getting comfortable and people get upset at being told their established way is wrong. It's why people need to keep speaking up when talking about diversity so the laziness problem doesn't cone into play where people get complacent and they won't do the thing all writers have to do research. Thankfully butler covers that too. 

>But what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject?

>They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, co-workers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. I’ve done these things myself in my reverse research, and they help. Also, I people-watch a lot without talking. Any public situation offers opportunities.

Thirty years later, Octavia Butler’s words still hold true. Science fiction is getting more diverse, but minority characters are still sorely lacking. Books written by straight white men still flood the market, many of which conveniently forget the existence of people who exist outside of this demographic. However, Octavia Butler would be pleased to know that there are more black science fiction writers today than there were in 1980. Take a look at N.K. Jemisin, opens a new window, who broke new ground in 2016 by becoming the first black author to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel!

I don't wanna put the whole article up because it wouldn't fit and because it deserves to be read in its entirety. But maybe my words aren't enough! Here's a few excerpts from reviewers talking about the essay. 


In her review for the Women’s Review of Books, Nisi Shawl writes about

Butler’s long out-of-circulation 1980 essay, “Lost Races of Science Fiction.” A manifesto about the erroneousness of excluding black characters from SF because of the “messiness” involved in depicting nonwhites, “Lost Races” ends with a half-jubilant, half-deploring assessment of science fiction’s attitudes toward inclusivity and prejudice. “Times have changed,” Butler decrees. In the next sentence, though, she admonishes the field that “it still has a long way to go.” That her pronouncements on this matter hold true nearly forty years after they were first published speaks volumes about the slow rate of social change and Butler’s continuing centrality to our understanding of the fantastic genres.

A review in Bookforum calls it “a blunt 1980 essay on the absence of nonwhite characters in the genre.”

**TLDR** Octavia butler the godmother of modern sff wrote an amazing essay on how she would go about using black characters in her stories using the hypothetical situation that you’re a white writer faced with the task of introducing a believable black character into her story.

What did you guys think?,"On the one hand, I burrowed through all ~500 pages (1000 on an e-reader!) in about 3 days, on the other the depth of plotting and characterization is on par with the DaVinci Code. 

No spoilers ahead, but fairly specific criticism: The Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women, and that pretty much sums it up; every male character is paternally sexist at best and a sexual sociopath at worst. Except of course for the hero (a thinly veiled author self-insertion), who drops every pair of eligible panties in the book in short order.

I love books which evoke a sense of place or expose a facet of a society I'm not familiar with; this just felt like it was trivializing real societal issues by burying them in hundreds of pages of exposition (drawn-out fruitless sub? plot on financial fraud) or utterly sensationalizing them (violence against women).

kty3u8,"My uncle recommended me ""Immortal"" by José Rodrigues dos Santos, and this book caused s huge impression on me. I don't compare it lighthy with Orwells 1984, but it does deserve the comparison.","To add to this, the book obviously has some inspiration in 1984, but it is mostly not a work of fiction. Most of the book happens as a discussion between two men about the advances of Artifical Inteligence (AI), and its positives and negatives, in summ, an almost philosophical discussion.

On the other hand, it also adresses China in great lengths, particularly how China is using AI to create a totalitarian surveillence state, whose lenghts not even Orwell could imagine. 

The two parts above are absolutely not fiction, and ars based on numerous scientific books, papers and articles that the author lists in the end.

The glue to all of this is the fictional part, which I will not discuss here as to keep the book interesting and spoiler-free for those reading it.

Thanks again!

The Book of Ralph just appeared in stores on August 9. 

As a 43 year old, part-time philosophy professor, I am happy to say this is my first novel, and my agent was able to get me an audio book deal and a film option. It is never too late!

The novel is a first contact story. Here’s the pitch: 

>A message appears on the moon. It is legible from Earth, and almost no one knows how it was created. Markus West leads the government’s investigation to find the creator.

>The message is simple and familiar. But those three words, written in blazing crimson letters on the lunar surface, will foster the strangest revolution humankind has ever endured and make Markus West wish he was never involved.

>The message is ‘Drink Diet Coke.’

>When Coca-Cola denies responsibility, global annoyance becomes indignation. And when his investigation confirms Coca-Cola’s innocence, Markus West becomes one of the most hated men on Earth.

>Later, five miles above the White House, a cylinder is discovered floating in the night. It is 400 feet tall, 250 feet in diameter, and exactly resembles a can of Campbell’s Chicken Noodle Soup. Nearly everyone thinks the cylinder is a promotional stunt gone wrong, just like the lunar advertisement. And this is exactly what the alien in the cylinder wants people to think.

>Ralph, an eccentric extraterrestrial who’s been hiding on the moon, needs Markus’s help to personally deliver a dark warning to the White House. Ralph has a big heart, a fetish for Andy Warhol, and a dangerous plan to save the world.

12vyvdf,"I want to talk about ""The God Eaters"" by Jesse Hajicek.","So I just finished this book called The God Eaters by author Jesse Hajicek and need to share my thoughts on it or I will explode.

The book is a 2006 M/M romance/fantasy novel, following the relationship of two young men, Ashleigh and Kieran in a western/colonial/steampunk inspired fantasy world. It is self-published so it's only available on paperback from amazon, or you can read it for free online on the author's blog [here](https://gomichan.livejournal.com/274098.html) . I couldn't find out much about the author except that they are a gay man born in 1972 living in Minnesota. I guess this contributes to the obscurity of the book, and why it's so hard to find places online in 2023 talking about it. It is about 450 pages and mostly an easy read, so it goes down pretty quickly. 

While this is a romance novel and hence mainly concerned with the growing relationship between the two main characters, I found the worldbuilding to be quite engrossing, making me turn the pages as much as the interaction between the main characters. The story features the theocratic imperialist state of Eskarn that's occupying the newly conquered lands of Iavaiah, where the plot takes place. Unlike most fantasy novels, the technology level is quite advanced, featuring guns as weapons in adidtion to magic. The magic system is rather unique: while everyone can theoretically learn ritual magic as a science, only the military of Eskarn is allowed to study it, which means the few people that manifest a natural Talent are limited to their specific magic type (e.g. pyrokinesis, telekinesis, telepathy etc). Eskarn, for reasons revealed in the plot, rounds up all such people in the prison-lab facility of Churchrock where the first third of the novel takes place. The characters meet there and establish their relationship through their shared trials, leading to a prison break. As the novel unfolds, the history of this world is revealed as well as the reasons for its current dystopian state, and how it relates to the two main characters and the titular ""God Eaters"". I loved how original and gritty the world was, making is as much of a third main character as the main couple.

The two main characters personalities were captivating. Kieran comes from a traumatized background, having to do horrible things by his age of 19 to survive. This is contrasted by the meek personality of Ashleigh who at first is taken under Kieran's protection. The sheer despair of the first third of the novel, where the characters are subjected to the worse-than-death conditions of Churchrock is contrasted by a deep love for life that under-runs their entire relationship. I feel the author is able to capture despair in some scenes extremely well as each of the main characters ends up in desperate situations. A highlight of this is the scene where >!Kieran has just succumbed to his wounds and passed away but managed to force the deity hiding in his soul to return his body to life by seeing the sheer despair of his lover who inteds to commit suicide rather than live without him.!< I feel the main theme of this book is lust for life even in the face of utter hopelessness and despair. While there is a fair amount of abuse, mental and physical, thrown at the characters, it serves to make their desire to live free  and together even stronger, especially in the prison segment of the book. While the novel does feature some sex, it is only explicit in 2 scenes so it did not come across as gratuitous at all.

On the other hand, the novel is not without its faults. The fact it is self-published does shine through in a few places, such as a (very) few inconsistencies and a couple dips in writing quality. In some places you can tell the writer does not write for a living and the novel could have benefitted from an editor's pass. Regardless, this is a beautiful piece of art that I wish would get more attention, and hence this post.

ovfwdb,"""Catch and Kill"" by Ronan Farrow. I thought I knew about the Weinstein Story, but it's much deeper and so much scarier underneath the surface.","TW; subject includes sexual assault

Quick summary of the book: Catch and Kill is predominantly Ronan Farrow's journey to uncovering and making the public aware of Harvey Weinstein's decades of predatory sexual assault and harassment against the women he worked with. He follows this with a look at how Weinstein wasn't an isolated case, but one of many offenders in an industry where men were abusing their power and using it to silence their victims with NDAs and payoffs. 

I thought I knew about the story, but there is so much more involved including ex-isreali agents, a large network of powerful figures at the NBC network that Ronan Farrow encounters, private companies that specialize in catching and killing sexual assault stories while silencing and intimidating victims, and even privately sold software that is used to track journalists, one of which was used to track and kill journalist Jamal Khashkoggi. Connections to Donald Trump and Jeffry Epstein are mentioned due to companies shared. I was only really curious on how much it actually cost and how many people are directly involved with these companies specializing in smear campaigns, sending intimidating threats, and etc.

My first thought was that there was a terrifying amount of power for a movie producer to have and the amount resources and connections to continue sexual assaulting women for decades.  I came away thinking how many more industry's continue these practices and how much more terrifying it must be for the victims who have no support even if you are a famous actress. The most recent story of the toxic culture at Activision Blizzard, makes me think how many more have been silenced.

The most horrifying was when the victims shared their stories with their encounters with Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. The acts performed and the aftermath including what they could and couldn't do. You feel they were cornered and didn't have anything to help them, which forced them to take an NDA and a settlement. The Victims even after the NDA had their careers destroyed, intimidated and tracked, facing PTSD and mental health issues stemming from paranoia, victim blamed, and slut shamed. The victims are brave stepping forward and encouraging others for stepping forward to tell their story. I just wonder if the system, the internet, and the perpetrators will go to stop and dismiss the ""Me Too"" movement. 

As for the writing, it's nothing stylish as it is appropriately first person in Ronan's POV and the process of journalism is a lot of hard work, vetting, and source checking. At times you feel the paranoia and even the fears he had being watched and attempts to have the story dismiss by Matt Lauer, and even the heads of NBC. He does a good job keeping to the point and sharing his history with the subject matter including his sister's rape allegation against their father Woody Allen. I haven't read many investigative journalism books except Bad Blood and a few others. So I can't really compare that much whether it's extremely written. 

Overall, if you can handle the subject matter. It can deepen your perception on what ""rape culture"" is and how it continues to persevere, the conception of the ""Me Too"" movement, and how many end complying with predators whether they know it or it. I was left angry, saddened, and a little bit hopeful that victims are listened to and consequences are dispensed to the perpetrators. Unfortunately I'm reminded that we had presidents, supreme court justices, politicians, and celebrities that run free and flourish without consequences.

12irgk7,"Mary Toft; or, the Rabbit Queen","Why would the man who steampunked Shakespeare’s Tempest, who used a time machine to make me believe in fatherhood, use a woman birthing rabbits to ask, *What is true?*

*Mary Toft; or The Rabbit Queen* (2019) seemed a great departure from Dexter Palmer’s previous books. *Version Control* (2016) was a staggering science fiction masterpiece that remains one of my favorite novels of this still young century, and *The Dream of Perpetual Motion* was a wild romping steampunk satire of industrialists, so I was confused by this turn towards historical fiction. This simply wasn’t what I expected or wanted. Then, on top of that, he chose one of the strangest cases of medical fraud in history as his subject. But here we are in 2022 and I’m still thinking about all of this.

While this never reaches the ecstatic emotional heights of *Version Control* or the raucousness of *The Dream of Perpetual Motion*, *Mary Toft; or, The Rabbit Queen* is a radically bold step in a career that continues to surprise.

>*“The truth of the matter. Is it a thing that exists outside of our minds, waiting for us to perceive it and know it as true? Or is truth a thing that collectively resides within the minds of all men, a matter of consensus, subject to debate, subject to alteration? The world outside our minds neither true nor false, but merely there?”*

*Mary Toft; or, The Rabbit Queen* explores fraud and forgery and our need to believe when confronted by the unquantifiable, the unspeakable. John Howard, the male-midwife to Mary Toft, and his apprentice Zachary Walsh are the principle viewpoints of this story. Through them, we meet the owner of a traveling carnival of curiosities (think PT Barnum’s museum of “freaks”) and his daughter, Mary Toft’s husband, and a sequence of esteemed doctors from London who descend upon Mary Toft to investigate the baffling event of a woman repeatedly giving birth to rabbits. Conspicuously, the novel only briefly acknowledges that women existed in England in 1726.

We’re concerned, here, with intellectuals. Men of science, of medicine, the early generation of male-midwives who credentialed the field and capitalized upon these self-given accreditations. All esteemed members of their communities, some with direct connections to King George. John Howard keeps up with the latest scientific developments, devotes himself to the scientific method, reads John Locke (though he struggles to comprehend any of it—turning Locke’s book into a signifier of a certain type of person more than as philosophy to engage with). Encountering something unexplainable, so outside the possible science available, instead of retreating to the obvious—so lovingly stated by his wife: *she cuts them up and sticks them up her*—he leans towards the possibility of something transcendent, something scientifically novel. And as he pulls more and more of these butchered rabbits out of Mary Toft, he grows to believe it more rather than less.

This is what leads to the rest of the actions in the novel. The surgeons arrive from London, all of them respected and draped with kingly authority for their medical expertise. Each one, in turn, experiences the grotesquerie of Mary Toft’s births. Confronted by the foul, inscrutable event, each one falls into the absurd. Rather than acknowledge the limits of their credentials, the limits of their knowledge of female bodies, they believe what they must: a vast new vista of moral science (only a wretched woman could give birth to an animal, yes?) opens before them, and they will forever have their names linked to this discovery. This goes on, the belief becoming more entrenched, despite John Howard’s wife mocking them to their faces, insinuating the obvious conclusion. Eventually, they make their way to London where Mary Toft becomes both legend and signifier—of what depends on the person finding the significance—even as she stops giving birth to rabbits.

It’s in these moments that Palmer finds situational comedy to rival *Seinfeld*. There’s something just so goddamn funny about these respected doctors half-running down the street to be the first through the door of Mary Toft’s house, and thereby staking their claim of authority as first among equals. Then, of course, there are the tortured explanations cloaked in moral language they invent to make sense of why this woman is giving birth not simply to rabbits, but to rabbits that seem to have been cut into pieces and even skinned.

Palmer’s prose does a lot of work here. In the past he’s leaned into bombastic maximalism or quiet but assured prose to tell a story. Here, he leans into a bit of forgery, a bit of fraud, a bit of subtle fun. The prose feels both 200 years old and thoroughly modern; a tightrope designed to fall from (Thomas Pynchon’s *Mason & Dixon* (1997), for example, collapsed a bit under this). He recalls the distant past, leaning into the verbose affectations of 18th century English writers, while remaining clear and precise enough that no modern readers will feel lost or put off by the style. While this works as a metabolized meta-metaphor, it does, at times, cause the novel to loosen a bit. Too, Palmer creates an atmosphere of terror and discomfort when the doctors encounter the gruesome sight of watching a human woman give birth to a chopped-up rabbit that would fit well alongside David Lynch or David Cronenberg at their body-horrorest. The absolute anvil of dread weighing John and Zachary down as they return again and again to Mary Toft’s bedside to take rabbit parts out of her is both disquieting and ironic.

Later, Zachary watches a desperately poor man attempt to eat a live cat for a cash payout while an aristocrat expounds on the differing natures of men: the degradation of the poor makes him feel *more* human because they become *less*. Zachary, instead, sees how this form of entertainment could only be done out of spite and pure hatred for those who find amusement in it.

While the novel is named after a woman, it is almost obsessive in the lengths it goes to exclude any women from the narrative. Leaving us only with the men, their thoughts and beliefs, their dreams and nightmares. There are, really, only three women in the novel.

Upon hearing John Howard’s first visit to Mary Toft, his wife Alice immediately has nothing but scorn and derision for her husband, the medical expert, the male-midwife, the intellectual scientist. She spots the fraud for what it is, despite never laying eyes on Mary Toft, describing vulgarly as possible, as if to shock her baffled husband into realizing the obvious: a woman cannot give birth to a butchered rabbit, no matter how immoral or deranged she may be.

Anne Fox, the daughter of Nicholas Fox, the proprietor of the carnival of curiosities, never meets Mary Toft except through rumors, though she’s immediately dismissive of the whole affair. Her livelihood depends on fraud and forgery, in the suspension of disbelief. She engages in a sort of forgery daily, though she rejects this description. For her, there is no fraud because to be a woman is to live in a masquerading world of manners and perceptions.

>*“Well, to begin with,” Anne said, “I myself am not real. I, Anne Fox, daughter of Nicholas, am an illusion—in your mind; in the mind of your master; even in the mind of my own father.”*

Then there’s Mary Toft who serves primarily as a vessel for rabbit corpses throughout the novel. She says almost nothing and much of the novel seems to have nothing to do with her, despite, you know, the fact that she seems to be birthing rabbits, stumping the King’s physicians. Her body is discussed and described in front of her as if she were no more than furniture. The doctors never acknowledge her. They make wild theories as to what must be happening to her, as if she plays no part in any of this.

>*And so I am becoming, not myself, but a mixture of the dreams of others, of the many pleasing lies they tell themselves: my husband, and the surgeons, and those to whom the surgeons speak, and those who overhear their words.*

And so those are the women. One engaging in fraud right before the eyes and hands of esteemed surgeons, another living through fraud and forgeries, and a third spotting them so plainly.

>*“And we thought that perhaps we might get a glimpse of the woman,” said Frances. “Speak to her even, if there’s a chance of it; find out how she feels. How does she feel?” The question puzzled Zachary, even as he realized that perhaps it shouldn’t have.*

All novels reflect the time they were written. Even historical fiction, for all its slavish devotion to historical accuracy, tells us more about us, now, than it does about us, then. This novel about fraud and forgery, about belief, about a woman in 1726, was published at a time when expertise is fetishized by a certain type of American or derided as quackery by another type of American, while questions of bodily autonomy rise again to national debate. Palmer, in his own way, wrote about the era of information by pulling us back into a world struggling to break free of old superstitions, of legends, of demons and monsters, of a time when the most confounding question posed to man was the female body. While *Mary Toft; or, The Rabbit Queen* follows scientific men in an unscientific age, believing themselves to be arbiters of truth, slashing back at the myths and legends and superstitions around them, each one is duped by an uneducated woman who they barely even see or acknowledge, even when their hands are literally inside her.

And, really, it’s comically absurd and pathetic.

Palmer handles this subtly and I could imagine some readers not seeing the farce written boldly on every page. Palmer’s narration eschews explanation or moralizing. He inhabits the woldview of these surgeons and so it’s all taken quite seriously and dramatically. Of course, this is the joke, yeah? Because that’s the best kind, yeah? The novel itself working as a forgery for what it really is, leading the inattentive reader to be duped and inviting the careful reader in on the scheme.

The whole novel is absurd. Farcical. And yet it is played straight. The gruesome birthing scenes are effectively disgusting and horrifying. It’s enough to make you believe alongside John Howard. Even the comedy is very understated, and I can easily imagine the Seinfeldian nature of the humor to fly right past many readers. It’s a hilarious novel that may never make you laugh, which is a bit of magic. It takes the case so seriously that you almost feel indignant for these august medical professionals when Alice shatters the veneer of the illusion the male-midwives find themselves caught inside.

While this novel is maybe more impressive in what it does, in a technical way, than his previous novels, it lacks those dramatic and emotional heights that made *Version Control* unforgettable. Emotionally, the novel is more distant and restrained. Even conceptually, it’s a simpler novel. Too, its subtlety and willingness to lead the reader astray may cause many to completely misunderstand the novel, which isn’t exactly a weakness but may not be a strength. Though, it’s this subtlety that excites me every time I consider that he wrote a novel about women by writing about men.

We know Mary Toft only because the best and brightest of the time couldn’t see the body in front of them in 1726. Without ever stating the question, Palmer demands of us in 2019, in 2022, in whatever year you read this: *Do you even see yourself?*

puoi93,The Handmaid's Tale and Gender Lenses,"\- Today, I finished The Handmaid's Tale, and man... I didn't know books by women were written so well! Just kidding. I say this in jest over the recent revelations and debates here at r/books over how men read women authors. But, my jest has a point! It sort of aligns with my struggles with this book. I am a man, foremost, and reading this book was quite uncomfortable for me. It was a great book, let's get that out in the open. But, it was an uncomfortable read. And, I think the real reason for this discomfort was the feeling that when confronted with many paths of emotion to embrace-many moral stances to lay a firm hold on- I couldn't figure which was the right one to choose. This is the crux of where some of us are at using the cultural lenses of gender studies, and why I think Margaret Atwood's book is a masterpiece. Now, for my convoluted rant/review on the story:

\- You read The Handmaid's Tale, and you find yourself getting upset. Our protagonist, a young woman who has been through a range of tug-of-war-like events, lives a life not uniquely her own, dominated by masculine-dictated rules in a recently-formed overtly patriarchal society in the old United States of America. She exists during this transition from the former democratic, free USA to this stern, strict, oppressive religious-state, where women are given a place in society as wives, housekeepers (Marthas), child-bearers (Handmaids), teacher/disciplinarians (Aunts), or the unworthy positions of Unwomen or colony-dwellers. Our protagonist is a handmaid, a somewhat honorable position (I guess), where one is kept in great care as their womb is to house infants in a society where war, toxins, and a weird caste system prevents just anyone from giving birth. We never really learn her true name, but her given one, Offred (""Of Fred"") which I kept reading as ""off-red"" which I suppose would have been apt as well. All handmaids take the name ""Of-(to be filled in by whomever there Commander is)"". This is all a set up to just make you feel an underlying sense of dread over the lives these women, especially Offred, live. And, Atwood has done an incredible job setting this mood, especially for male readers, in my opinion.

\- So, throughout the novel, at various instances I am upset and uncomfortable. I think it is hard to write down why, but I will attempt to. As a man there exists a protective, heroic quality to many of us, where we'd like to jump into the pages and rescue Offred, and give her a new life. Yet, I don't think this is the path Atwood wants us to take here, and I think this is the attitude that has gotten us into this society in the first place. These men display an ownership of women that should strike a nerve, yet as a man which nerve is it striking? It's a tough swallow. And, I tried to think realistically if I lived in this society, where would I fit in? As a guardian? As a rebel living on the treacherous outskirts? How would I react? This book forces you into some tough corners. Maybe the point is to get us to see and feel as women do? Maybe it all acts as symbolism as to how we are ignorant of the woman's perspective in our day-to-day lives? I admit I can be guilty of that. I would love to hear some other perspectives from those who have read the book. 

\- I feel like we live in a society that tries to box us all into a definable container concerning our beliefs and ideologies. I think that is why we have so much conflict between us, and maybe between our genders. Many of us are still seeking out our truths, and it is tough to choose the right paths in these instances. I listen to something like a Bill Burr comedy routine about ""male feminists"", and in the moment you think you can relate to the absurdity of that. Yet, is it so absurd to try and relate to the opposite gender on some level? I don't think so. We have carved out terms like ""white knighting"" and ""virtue signalling"" to call out those who, I suppose get too holier-than-thou concerning being woke about the plight of women. I was accused of that in my review of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and I kind felt insulted about it- and, yet I guess, in the end I don't even really know what those terms are getting at so- why get spun up? This book has forced me to confront a lot of my own views on women, and much of my own ignorance, and reflect on the many paths one can go down concerning gender observations. And, maybe there is more than one right viewpoint we can approach with this.

\- In the end, I guess I am just getting thoughts off my mind. I do recommend this book, though it isn't a necessarily enjoyable read (although some of its descriptions about ""the little things in life"" are nice). At times, I felt I just wanted to rush through the book to get it over with and get to the end, as Offred wanted to just get through her Ceremonies. But, this book will challenge your ideologies and cause reflection towards relationships you thought you understood. I am married to an Asian woman (OfKeaton126), who is just an absolute peach, and this book has made me consider more not only her perspectives as a woman, but as one from a different set of cultural norms and values as well. Not to say I was ignorant of those things before. I have always observed what gives her enjoyment, happiness and peace, but maybe need to spend more time considering why. None of us are, nor should be so easy to place in a definable box. So in that sense, I think this book has taught me something I hadn't reflected upon before.

\-Margaret Atwood is a wonderful writer! (for a woman) ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/puoi93/the_handmaids_tale_and_gender_lenses/,2021-09-24 17:27:01,43,18,books

1047n0h,In Praise Of All Quiet On The Western Front," Hello! I have been posting book reviews for a minute over at [r/books](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/) . Recently, as in a week before Christmas, I returned from a military deployment in Africa, where I had enough free moments to power through a couple books. Now, that I am settling back and re-adjusting, I wanted to center a discussion around one specific title: All Quiet On The Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque.

\- I have had a deep love for the mysterious stages of existence since I was a boy, and an imagination that often prompted me to picture myself among life in different worlds, universes, and eventually different eras in history. History grew to become an obsession for me in recent years with life allowing for me to join a graduate program in the discipline. As a man in my early 20's, over a decade ago, the idea of having my own place, even if but a small one in history, played a large role in me joining the service. The harrowing stories of the men and women who fought, the conflicts that arose, the drama between the different governments, the advancements in technology, the attitudes of different societies and cultures at war thrilled me. I saw it all as an incredible, extreme phase of human experience, and one, thankfully, we do not have to endure in these peaceful days. Remarque's All Quiet On The Western Front reinforced this notion, and enhanced my awe of those who were thrown in the meat grinder of World War I as I myself progressed through my own lonely nights in Africa.

""***Earth with thy folds, and hollows, and holes, into which a man may fling himself and crouch down. In the spasm of terror, under the hailing of annihilation, in the bellowing death of the explosions, O Earth, thou grantest us the great resisting surge of new- won life. Our being, almost utterly carried away by the fury of the storm, streams back through our hands from thee, and we, thy redeemed ones, bury ourselves in thee, and through the long minutes in a mute agony of hope bite into thee with our lips!""***

\- In doing these reviews, I try to make these writings a celebration of the author and their art. So, I will include a few passages that hit me just in their mastery. All Quiet is just littered with extremely quotable excerpts, and I couldn't possibly include them all. Here our protagonist, Paul Baumer, fighting for the German army of the Central Powers on the western front bordering France in World War I, conveys to us his extreme gratitude that the terrain is merciful enough to grant him divots, holes, ditches and trenches to fling himself into as the demonic artilleries rain down from overhead. The message here is that the extreme brutality of life on the battlefield creates a certain appreciativeness for the very smallest protections, benefits, pleasures. Remarque is magnificent in his sculpting of the personalities of his World War I cast, and continually gives us a sobering sense of the hell these characters are enduring.

***""He is right. We are not youth any longer. We don’t want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing. We fly from ourselves. From our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces. The first bomb, the first explosion, burst in our hearts. We are cut off from activity, from striving, from progress. We believe in such things no longer, we believe in the war.""***

***""We have become wild beasts. We do not fight, we defend ourselves against annihilation. It is not against men that we fling our bombs, what do we know of men in this moment when Death is hunting us down— now, for the first time in three days we can see his face, now for the first time in three days we can oppose him; we feel a mad anger. No longer do we lie helpless, waiting on the scaffold, we can destroy and kill, to save ourselves, to save ourselves and to be revenged.""***

\-I mean, both of these passages just exemplify that the very existence and life we live in today has no relation to those who fought in wars like the Great War. How could it? We see these young kids about to don uniforms and sport guns as the last vestiges of something we can grasp and relate to ourselves. We have been able to enjoy the freedoms of youth while these boys never could. I love how Remarque displays the metamorphosis of these kids forced into becoming warriors, and what they had to experience to survive another day. I had these thoughts working the lonely night shifts out in my tents in the middle of the desert, and even I can reflect and look within myself to see I was afforded everything growing up that these poor souls were not. For all the complaints, the loneliness, the hardships of being away from family, always on the lookout for something hostile and malevolent, it compares so exponentially little to the days of 1917. I have returned and become myself once more. These boys, whether they physically survived or died, had all had their promise, potential, personalities, freedoms- everything which made them who they were before the war- perish on the battlefield. It is absolutley haunting.

***The silence spreads. I talk and must talk. So I speak to him and to say to him: “Comrade, I did not want to kill you. If you jumped in here again, I would not do it, if you would be sensible too. But you were only an idea to me before, an abstraction that lived in my mind and called forth its appropriate response. It was that abstraction I stabbed. But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand- grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony— Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy? If we threw away these rifles and this uniform you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert. Take twenty years of my life, comrade, and stand up— take more, for I do not know what I can even attempt to do with it now.”***

\- Reading this actually choked me up, and worked me over. As a student of history, and a serviceman, more and more I realize all fighters from all countries are more or less the same at heart. It's so easy as a youngster to see the world as good vs evil, black and white. But, the older you grow, the more you ship out, the more cultures you are exposed to and interact with, you realize we all endure the same struggle. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Not to sound unpatriotic, or anti-American, I just have come to sympathize with all who are in the field, or on the flightlines, ship decks, caves, mountains, jungles, hollows and so forth. We are all here to do the bidding of the throne, and in the end you hope to God their vision is the right one. Reading how Paul goes through a wave of emotion and thought upon killing a Frenchman who hopped inadvertently into his foxhole is so powerful. Life is so precious, regardless of who someone is and where they are from.

***""Life is simply one continual watch against the menace of death;— it has transformed us into unthinking animals in order to give us the weapon of instinct— it has reinforced us with dullness, so that we do not go to pieces before the horror, which would overwhelm us if we had clear, conscious thought— it has awakened in us the sense of comradeship, so that we escape the abyss of solitude— it has lent us the indifference of wild creatures, so that in spite of all, we perceive the positive in every moment, and store it up as a reserve against the onslaught of nothingness.""***

***""Shells, gas clouds, and flotillas of tanks— shattering, corroding, death. Dysentery, influenza, typhus— scalding, choking, death. Trenches, hospitals, the common grave— there are no other possibilities.""***

Life is the way it is for us, because of the manner in which life existed for them.

***""And men will not understand us— for the generation that grew up before us, though it has passed these years with us already had a home and a calling; now it will return to its old occupations, and the war will be forgotten— and the generation that has grown up after us will be strange to us and push us aside. We will be superfluous even to ourselves, we will grow older, a few will adapt themselves, some others will merely submit, and most will be bewildered;— the years will pass by and in the end we shall fall into ruin.""***

The bittersweetness of the return home. I watch my petite Asian wife stir a stew on the stove as I write this, the memory of her being alone and my being away nearly forgotten. Maybe that's what eats at some of the most- that our sacrifices are so easily and understandably misunderstood. And how could anyone not in the same place, in the same boots understand? And, why do we not sympathize for those who had to endure without us, in our absence? I myself feel I have no ground for such criticisms after reading Remarque. Every smile, every moment my wife's soft brown eyes light up upon seeing me around once more, is something the victims of these devastating wars can never experience. Yet, we can try to understand through the help of masterful writers like Erich Maria Remarque. I encourage you to try.

I leave you with this:

""***I stand up. I am very quiet. Let the months and years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear. The life that has borne me through these years is still in my hands and my eyes. Whether I have subdued it, I know not. But so long as it is there it will seek its own way out, heedless of the will that is within me.""***",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1047n0h/in_praise_of_all_quiet_on_the_western_front/,2023-01-05 19:26:32,13,42,books
6xe0zk,The Experience of PTSD in Literature,"> “Now we would wander around like strangers in those landscapes of our youth. We have been consumed in the fires of reality, we perceive differences only in the way tradesmen do, and we see necessities like butchers. We are free of care no longer – we are terrifying indifferent. We might be present in that world, but would we be alive in it? 

> We are like children who have been abandoned and we are as experienced as old men, we are coarse, unhappy and superficial – I think that we are lost”

The part of *All Quiet on the Western Front* where Paul Baumer is on leave from the front lines and comes back home to see his family, is one of the most harrowing and compelling descriptions of PTSD and psychological trauma I have ever read. 

I’ve read many books that portray extremely traumatic events, but almost all seem to ignore the experience of characters who go on living with that trauma. Do you agree that compelling descriptions of PTSD/trauma seem to be rare in literature? If so, why? What other books do it well?

2k31ol,Why Boromir is the best member of the Fellowship in the books and how his character is totally ruined in the films. [SPOILERS],"SPOILERS

Having spoken to a few people about this in the outernet, it seems I am the proud owner of a somewhat unpopular opinion. I am posting here because I am interested in the opinions of more bookish people rather than those whose main experience of LoTR is the film series.

I know I'm not alone in thinking Boromir was a pretty cool guy but where I feel slightly alone is in how much of a cool guy I think he was and why he's so cool. Let me explain. I'll get around to how much I hate what the film did to him nearer the end of this post (and it's not just because they made his ring-stealing antics look nasty. They were pretty bad.)

I think Boromir is the most sensible and critical yet the most brave and by a million miles the most noble of the fellowship. He has been the somewhat reluctant hero of a catastrophically besieged and relentlessly embattled people. His father, before he became too bitter to be of any use to anyone all but disowned Faramir but Boromir didn't lose any love or respect for his brother. With their father trying to drive a wedge between them, Boromir could easily have started to foster the same opinion as his father but he doesn't, he is magnanimous and loving.

Boromir, unlike Aragorn, has been suffering at the hands of the forces of evil for years right alongisde his people and risking his life for them frequently (while Aragorn has been fannying around in tights in the forest) and isn't driven by some prophecy or tradition. He carries the burden of one of the last bastions of hope on his shoulders and he does it manfully, courageously and humanely. I could go on but I'm sure this isn't something that escaped everyone's notice so I'll move on.

So then somebody tells him that there is an all powerful artifact he could use to defeat the dark lord. To be honest, he rightfully does feel like the person to whom this should be entrusted because he has selflessly led the battle against the darkness for a very long time. Then someone tells him that a skinny, stinky tramp from the forest should be the one to save the world?? Let's think about these characters as if they were humans. How would we feel? Crucially I think, despite all the influences that doubtless could have made him so, Boromir still isn't vainglorious. He IS the last defender of humanity and is being faced with the prospect of someone telling him, after many tragic, apocalyptic years, that some people who have never even seen an orc, intend to take the one thing that may be able to save the world from destruction away. I know this is hardly a subtle conflict in the book so I don't think I'm saying anything groundbreaking here but I am driving at the sum of my explanation being something discussionworthy. 

Here comes the reason he is so noble. He goes along with it!! He doesn't seize the ring, or refuse to play if they're not going to let him have it. He doesn't go home *against his better judgement* he follows  the fellowship to lend his skill as possibly the best known warrior in Middle Earth to protect the ringbearer on a quest he believes may end in disaster. We could say here that he always intended to take the ring forcibly but I don't believe that's the case, personally. His eventual near defection comes from a combination of his deep grief at the plight of his people and most importantly the ring's supernatural power.

Anyway, moving not so swiftly on. I think Boromir is by far the most human character. Not being a fantasy person usually (I did love LoTR though) absolutely nothing about Aragorn's 'destiny' really pushed any buttons for me at all. I always saw him as a moody opportunist who favoured old tales and whimsy over hard work and pragmatism. The fact that he was 'right' being a quirk of the fantasy genre and I realise that fantasy is all about old tales a whimsy. Boromir's humanity made him seem all the more brave and noble to me.

On to why one line in the films makes me almost hate them. ""I would have followed you, my brother... my captain... my king."" I can't stand that line. I hate it. In contrast with his final utterance in the book it changed his personality, his character and perhaps counter intuitively, I think for the worse. 

His final words in the book are as follows:  'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said. 'I 
am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty 
at least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken 
them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and his eyes 
closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again. 
'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.' 

In the book he was never, and should never have been, I don;t think, part of Aragorn's weird personality cult. In the book his concern is for the safety of the Hobbits he died trying to defend and the people that he believes in his dying moments he has failed. The film line might SEEM more selfless but I don't think it is. It makes him look weaker, his convictions look less important and sensible and his concerns more about a man he barely knows and has never fully trusted rather than the unfathomable weight of literally saving all the free people in the world that has been put on his shoulders and he, tragically, feels he has dropped. He dies thinking about everything he has been expected to save and how he has failed, not about how much he loves a man he has never even seen eye to eye with. In the book: Tragic, harrowing, ever-noble, selfless. In the film: Sycophantic, weak and senseless. 

I know a lot of people like Boromir, I know he is often seen as a tragic hero, I'm not saying I have hit on anything new there. But I hate the sheer weakness displayed in him in the films when really he was by orders of magnitude the longest-suffering and strongest of all the characters, possibly the longest-suffering and bravest man in all Middle Earth.

TL;DR - Boromir is misunderstood, boohoo. I can't really briefly sum up what I was talking about so see above and stick it out if you are interested in talking about our friend old Bozzer.


EDIT: I'm not going to rephrase my original post because that seems dishonest but I'm sorry about bashing Aragorn! I was trying to be somewhat lighthearted in saying that all he had done was ""fanny about"" in the forest. I have only read the novels but I got the impression that his work as a ranger allowed him more ""breathing room"" and he had been fighting evil off-and-on for a time and mostly gathering intelligence with the Dunedain. He has also been acting with the knowledge that Gondor stands between Middle Eart and destruction. I would contrast that with Boromir who knows little to nothing about the shadowy war that the Dunedain are fighting and from the moment he was old enough to know what's what he has believed that the fate of the entire world depends on him... that's some pretty stressful shit right there...

EDIT 2: And another thing! I forgot to add another of my points. Regardless of what Aragorn has been doing or not, Boromir knows very little about it or him. Him and his ancestors have been fighting and dying in the defence of Gondor for generations and then this man arrives and says ""Thanks a lot for devoting your lives to the fanatical defence of the freedom and lives of your people but... they are actually my people. I'll be taking that throne back now, my loyal subject."" Imagine being Boromir!! That must take some swallowing however noble you are.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for wading in to the discussion! If I may I'll just add some things that you have made me think about that I never had before, which is the great thing about talking about stuff!

Someone pointed out that Boromir represents the military element of the fellowship. I think this is very good analogy. We could have him symbolise the military because he believes in the power of might, the importance of duty and crucially the protection of those who can't defend themselves.  I think he is fighting to protect people rather than ideals, for actual beings who look up to him rather than for ideas. I think Boromir could exhibit the finest traits we like to believe a military officer would possess. Having been an army reserve officer myself maybe this is why I like him so much. (I'm not saying I posses his qualities, I would like to have done though!)

With Tolkein having been an army officer in wartime I assume he will have seen the best that military commanders could be in the field. Brave over and above the call of duty, fatherly, leaderly, protective, sacrificial, staring suffering and death in the face and having the protection of others still foremost in his mind. Tolkein also would presumably have seen the worst that happens when a military commander with little knowledge of the nuances of a complicated conflict get to make decisions just based on their military prowess or experience. I think it's really interesting to see Boromir as a highly decorated and undoubtedly ideal military officer in some respects but showing the tragedies that can result when essentially flawed men (as everyone is) have superhuman trust put in them.

One more thing I'd like to add is the prevalence of the opinion that Boromir is the most human character. Of course he literally is in terms of races in the book, but he is also the most like us in many ways. A lot of people have said that maybe we would make the same decisions he does faced with the situation he is and I believe that, too. I think we can love Boromir for him being the most relatable but showing in a lot of ways what we all wish we could be, confident, brave, able, in a position where we can save the lives of others. He seems protective, fatherly and concerned about other people. We can love him for his humanity.

We can also hate him for his humanity because he shows what even the best of us can be like, corruptible, single minded. Maybe over simplistically he is the best and the worst in us whereas the other characters don't feel like us. I love him for this, I think he shows a lot more best than worst.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2k31ol/why_boromir_is_the_best_member_of_the_fellowship/,2014-10-23 10:32:26,313,1096,books
afudtp,The Most Important Book,"The most important book ever written is, by far, Adam Smith's [*Wealth of Nations*](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html).   It doesn't cost anything to read.

A free book sure sounds like a great deal.  But what happens if we don't use our money to reveal how much we love a book?    Well, writers aren't mind-readers.  If they can't see the true and actual demand for books, then the supply will invariably be really wrong.  

Does this mean that Smith's book shouldn't be free?  No, it just means that we need a really good excuse to use our money to reveal our true love for it.  This really good excuse is... *ranking books with money.*

Right now there a few websites where you can use your money to rank books.  I don't want to link to them, or name them, because I don't want to get accused of promoting them.  To be clear, none of them are my website.  Nor do I work for any of them.  I'm simply a guy who really appreciates the concept, given that I've read *The Wealth of Nations*.  

What I'd like to do is civilly discuss the concept of ranking books with money.  Here's basically how it can, or could, work...

On one of these websites you could post a question, for example, ""Which is the best Sci-Fi book?""

People could reply with a nomination (one per reply) that hasn't already been made.  You could read through the replies/nominations and spend your money on the best ones.  Everybody would be able to sort the replies/nominations by value.  In theory the cream would quickly rise to the top.  

So what do you think?  Does this make any sense?  

One objection that you might have is that this system would give too much influence to rich people.  Well, if it truly *is* the case that J.K. Rowling, for example, shouldn't have far more influence than most people, then it would behoove us to figure this out sooner rather than later.  

My preference is that, on these websites, participants will also be able to give a ""thumbs up"" to their favorite replies/nominations.  This way we would be able to sort the replies in two ways...

1. By money (unequal influence)  = market
2. By votes (equal influence) = democracy

Then we will be able to decide for ourselves which system is better at ranking books.  

I'll leave you with the most important passage from the most important book...

>It is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them to turn their stocks towards the employments which in ordinary cases are most advantageous to the society. But if from this natural preference they should turn too much of it towards those employments, the fall of profit in them and the rise of it in all others immediately dispose them to alter this faulty distribution. Without any intervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society among all the different employments carried on in it as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society.  — Adam Smith, [*Wealth of Nations*](http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN17.html#firstpage-bar)

iepzn9,"Please give The Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy a chance, if you haven't already","Hi everyone. I hope these sorts of posts are allowed, because when you have just finished what you've realized to be your favorite series of all time, you want everyone to know about it. 

The Border Trilogy is made up of three novels: All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain. They take place in the 40s and 50s and are centered around two boys and their journey into manhood. The first novel, All the Pretty Horses, is about John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old free spirit who leaves his Texas home and travels down to Mexico to become a real life cowboy. He leaves with his friend Rawlins, with not much except their horses and their clothes on their backs. Along the way, they meet a 13-year-old boy named Blevins, a real pistol. Lots of Mexican liquor is drank and lots of funny dialogue ensues. 

The second book, The Crossing, is about a young man named Billy Parham, who lives on the Mexican border. He is trapping wolves with his father, since they have begun eating the cattle around the area. Well, he catches a wolf, a pregnant wolf. He falls in love with it, and takes it upon himself to release her into Mexico for a better life. The Crossing as just as much about Billy's crossing into manhood as it is about him crossing the border. It is devastating and some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read. 

In the third book, John and Billy have joined together to work at a cattle ranch, and have developed the deepest friendship you can imagine. 

These books are Western Gothic, though McCarthy's writing is so beautiful that we often get descriptions of men, horses, and wilderness that seem to be a homage to the Old West. To say his writing is difficult is an understatement. He is often compared to William Faulkner, and you will need Google translate for several of the passages written solely in Spanish. However, while McCarthy's writing may be described as ""pretentious"" by some of the harshest critics (several people say this with 1 star reviews on Goodreads), he is also deeply earthy, sensuous, and just plain beautiful. If you stick with these books, you will come across the most wondrous paragraphs you can find, that leave an imprint in your heart and a longing in your soul. Consider this paragraph from All the Pretty Horses: 

*That night he dreamt of horses in a field on a high plain where the spring rains had brought up the grass and the wildflowers out of the ground and the flowers ran all blue and yellow far as the eye could see and in the dream he was among the horses running and in the dream he himself could run with the horses and they coursed the young mares and fillies over the plain where their rich bay and their rich chestnut colors shone in the sun and the young colts ran with their dams and trampled down the flowers in a haze of pollen that hung in the sun like powdered gold and they ran he and the horses out along the high mesas where the ground resounded under their running hooves and they flowed and changed and ran and their manes and tails blew off of them like spume and there was nothing else at all in that high world and they moved all of them in a resonance that was like a music among them and they were none of them afraid neither horse nor colt nor mare and they ran in that resonance which is the world itself and which cannot be spoken but only praised.* 

I am not afraid to say that I cried at several parts of this book. And not just a tear or two either, but full blown crying sessions. This has never happened to me before. I cried for these characters like I cried for my old friends, because they became my old friends. 

These books are deeply beautiful and visually stunning. They're not just about the west either, if that's not your thing. They're about boys reaching manhood. They're about brotherhood and fellowship. They're about fathers and sons. They're about romance, and it is so shocking to me to find that the author of No Country for Old Men has written some of the most sensual love scenes I have ever read. 

Anyway, I digress. Perhaps re-read my post and play a drinking game with some fellow vaqueros. Take a drink of Mexican cider every time I use the word ""beautiful"" or ""stunning"" or ""deep."" But it really is that good, folks. And maybe this post won't really get a lot of notice. Maybe my swooning will annoy you. But if I can just get one person to read these books, I will consider my job done. There simply isn't another story like John's or Billy's in the world. 

Anyhow thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iepzn9/please_give_the_border_trilogy_by_cormac_mccarthy/,2020-08-22 20:38:47,30,63,books
9sdhta,Question about the Count of Monte Cristo (spoilers),"Just finished the book for the first time last night and one thing struck me as I thought about it a bit. The Count left two people alive-Danglars and Villefort-who know who he is. He got his revenge of course since they're disgraced (and one crazy), even though still alive, but is it wise to leave people alive who know you're an escaped prisoner and that have their own motivation now for revenge? 

The reasoning I can see:

1. They're both now broken men with no credibility so no one would believe them anyway.

2. They have no proof the Count=Edmond.

3. Edmond has been free so long and was never convicted so no one would care to try and throw him back in jail even if he was outed.

Granted, with his connections and resources, Edmond could easily disappear probably if someone did come after him, but it just seems like an unnecessary risk. There could be some detail he's missed. Why not get rid of the only two enemies who know the secret?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9sdhta/question_about_the_count_of_monte_cristo_spoilers/,2018-10-29 14:20:17,6,2,books
60wrva,The Virginian by Owen Wister,"Just wanted to see if anyone else has read (and enjoyed) the Virginian.

I thought it was truly epic. 

Clearly, it was the cornerstone of a lot of Western books and films, but it was also atypical. The hero is strong and silent but he's a trickster figure, too. 

There's a wide cast of interesting characters, a genuinely moving romantic plot, and true tragedy befalls on men and animals. The hero and the villain's animosity towards each other grows in fits and starts and naturally. Even the Native Americans are treated with a levelheadedness. 

I love Western films and have read a bit of Western fiction and the Virginian feels old and new to me. It's free on Project Gutenberg if you're into such things.

Hell, let me know if you don't like it, too. There doesn't seem to be too much discussion about this book in general.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/60wrva/the_virginian_by_owen_wister/,2017-03-22 19:22:22,7,9,books
vk121m,Watership Down and the Aeneid,"Just some thoughts and questions after reading this amazing book for the first time as an adult. Would love to hear other's thoughts, especially if you have also read the Aeneid!

I read Virgil's Aeneid many years ago as a student and had come across a mention of Watership Down in some critical essay on literary influences of the Aeneid. Thinking that it would be a direct spinoff based on the Aeneid, I was prepared to find many directly parallel scenes and characters, and also braced myself for poignant deaths and losses.

But after reading WD, I find that it is far less similar to the Aeneid (and far happier!) than I expected. Yes, there are some elements that made me think of the Aeneid, but there were no truly direct parallels, and I was surprised and happy that all of Hazel's original companions from Sandleford survived! I was absolutely certain that Bigwig was going to die -- first in the trap, then in the face-off with Woundwort -- so it was a joy to see Bigwig as an old veteran training the little rabbits at the end! Here are some other similarities/differences between WD and the Aeneid that struck me:

&#x200B;

* The escape from Sandleford Warren: I thought the man-made sign heralding the destruction of the warren was somewhat like the Trojan horse -- towering over the rabbits, visible to them but not fully revealing (since they can't read), like how the Trojans saw the horse but didn't know there were soldiers inside. But Hazel and his band escaped before the destruction even began, and all of Hazel's original companions made it out, unlike Aeneas and his companions who escaped DURING the destruction, and his wife Creusa died in the chaos. (Of course this is more like Holly and Bluebell's escape, and the death of their companions.)

&#x200B;

* Fiver's visions and trance-like prophetic state are very typical of the Sibyl in classical literature, and also to Prof. Trelawney in Harry Potter (also obviously inspired, and even named after, the classical Sibyl!)

&#x200B;

* Cowslip's Warren: Supposed to be a ""distraction"" like Carthage was to Aeneas, but notably Carthage was still being built by Dido and her people (Aeneas stayed and helped) while Cowslip's Warren was already long-ready. Also, Dido and the Carthiginians certainly weren't trying to trap Aeneas and his men in order to sacrifice their lives to save their own. When Hazel and co. want to tell Cowslip and co. the story of their journey, Cowslip and co. are not happy. Yet in the Aeneid, it is actually Dido herself who requests to hear the story of the Trojan's struggles and journey!

&#x200B;

* Underworld journey: In the Aeneid, it is the hero Aeneas himself who journeys to the Underworld and meets his deceased father and Dido. In WD, the main characters don't have that experience -- rather, the story of El-ahrairah's journey to Inle is told. Of course, El-ahrairah is very similar to Odysseus in cunning, and that reference is even included in the book itself!

&#x200B;

* Hazel's audacious nighttime raid on Nuthanger Farm to free the does: similar to Nisus' and Euryalus' ill-fated night raid on Turnus' camp. But Hazel escapes with his life, although he is initially presumed dead and sustains a severe leg injury.

&#x200B;

* Efrafa: In the Aeneid, Aeneas and his men must fight the native Italians (Rutulians) for their right to settle in that land. Aeneas must vie with Turnus, the leader of the Rutulians, for the hand of Lavinia, the Italian princess, but that's not the main focus. On the other hand, in WD, Hazel and co. face no enemy rabbits when establishing their new warren (Honeycomb) on their chosen land. They choose to engage in conflict with Efrafa because they themselves want to take the does. This reminded me a LOT of the early Romans' rape of the Sabine women, not the Aeneid! (But of course in WD the does actually want to escape Efrafa and go to Watership, and are not carried off by force.) I expected more fighting and drama similar to Turnus' slaying of young Pallas, which in turn enrages Aeneas to kill Turnus when Turnus has surrendered. Overall, I was expecting some poignant deaths to befall Hazel's original band of rabbits, but was very happy when that didn't happen! (Yes two of the does died on the way back from Efrafa but we didn't really know them ""personally"" like we knew Hazel and co.) Even Woundwort's death/disappearance is shrouded in mystery.

&#x200B;

* Lucy rescuing Hazel from the cat: the chapter title is even ""Dea Ex Machina"", recalling Venus' saving her son Aeneas' life when he is wounded by an arrow in the final battle.

I'd love to hear from others who have also read the Aeneid! Were you surprised by the presence/absence of similarities? Having heard that WD was ""too dark a book for children"" and mentally prepared myself, I actually found it not as dark as I expected. My other favourite animal classic is Animal Farm by George Orwell, and I certainly found that much darker and more poignant, especially (spoiler) >!the death of Boxer!<, although it is a much shorter book than WD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vk121m/watership_down_and_the_aeneid/,2022-06-24 23:11:16,10,18,books

x53261,The Bookeaters Semi Review and it’s subversion of fairytales,"The Bookeaters is a pretty good version of reverse fairytale.

Now I love fairytales, especially whimsical nonsense, looking at variation of tales and seeing what sticks and changes, so I have a pretty good idea what it truly means to reverse a fairytale. Most people would assume “just have the princess save the Prince, make the princess a monster” or take existing fairytales and switch them to be more feminist or engaging. The main problem people focus on is “women=objects/things to be saved”. While you can do this, they ignore many other staples of fairytales or is done in a shallow way. I think The Bookeaters is a pretty solid subversion of many fairytale staples. 

Let’s break it down; you’ve got your “princess”, Devon, who is not only outright referred as a princess but is considered one by the family dynamic. Girls are rare, girls are highly prized, but they’re commodities. Much like actual princess in days of yore; one must behave and bare children to keep the line going. Devon must look the part and act the part (for the most part, she knows she can toe the line and won’t be physically punished). The variation on the trope here is while princess often marry knights, princes, or worthy commoners in the end, Devon seeks to escape her “princess” lifestyle and ends up doing something, wanting to find a sense of normalcy where she can be free with her son. 

You’ve also got the romance factor. Your typical fantasy is heterosexual which Devon is not. She ends up falling in love with a female dragon/princess. Both end up rescuing each other; Hester wanting Devon to come with her to get Redemption, Devon saving her from her family’s old ways. This change isn’t anything new, it’s one of the first changes when you see subverted fairytales. It does fall a little bit on “love at first sight” in a way, but in a way more casual manner. The characters didn’t really develop feelings until they actually met as opposed to just looking at one another but their romance develops in like, 2-3 days. 

You’ve got your knights and dragons, of course, not much needs to be explained there. Although, the knights here aren’t rescuing princesses but seek power, ending up being one of the main villains of the novel. The dragons aren’t evil beasts that must be killed, but people who can’t control their desires and instincts because that’s how they were born. The novel has sympathy for the beasts and princesses of fairytales.

What I particularly thought was interesting the addition of religion. Most, in not all, fairytales exist to be a lesson in morality, often stemming from Christian influence. I feel many fairytale subversions leave this out because it’s not often considered. Fairytales are no longer lessons to teach people, but stories with fantasy elements. It’s how modern fairytales are described, something magical but also slightly twisted which ignores the heavy morality of it all. It’s why “good” characters are pretty and “bad” are ugly and why terrible things happen to bad characters. Devon will ask Kai’s victims if they are good. Killock will give sermons and say eating minds is their communion. Christianity here is twisted and it’s obvious , the characters note it’s an obvious and twisted version of religion (which is also interesting because when you have religious villains, many will twist said religion but you don’t get examples of how the religion is supposed to be practiced or *how* the words are twisted). I would have loved to see more with Devon wrestling with what her fairytales have taught her vs how the world actually is when she was younger and growing up. I wanted more of Killock but since he was introduced somewhat later, he couldn’t be showcased as much as I’d like, especially with so many other villains in the novels. 

You’ve got the absent mother, absent not by choice but by forced duty. You’ve got running away and discovering a strange world but that world is the human world, not the strange other creature world you’d typically see. You’ve got giant woodland castle like manors being essentially free range dungeons. 

Then of course you have the strange “mythological” creature. I love the concept of the Bookeaters and the lore that went around them and I would have loved to see more of their beliefs in the Creator. I liked the concept of the mindeaters and them taking on personalities of their victims. 

Finally, you’ve got your darker elements because what is a fairytale if not dark (though that can be disputed really, the Grimm brothers are not the original writers of many of their fairytales and some really are just lighthearted adventures). This is seen through the heavy patriarchal elements of the family. The enemy of the princess’ tale is not evil stepmothers, stepmother overs, witches, fairies, or their own failed sense of morality, but men. The ones that usually save princess from their fate or go on adventures are the villains because they keep a almost medieval system, though the concept is necessary for their species to survive. Most of the men Devon interact with manipulate her, Devon cannot have her own agency; family comes before all. Family and agency are, arguably, the most important themes of the novel. 

I feel like I should like this one, but I’m honestly not sure how I feel. It’s feels more “handmaids tale” then “Cinderella”, which is fine, not what I was expecting. I feel like it didn’t grow on me as I was expecting more of a high fantasy, whimsical, chaotic adventure than a more fiction-fantasy family conflict. That doesn’t mean it’s *terrible* and I hated it, it was different from what I was expecting. It reads like a straight fiction more than a fantasy though, but it borrows a lot from classic fairytales and makes its own legend. The writing was very average, it didn’t draw me in, mostly being very straightforward which was a disappointment.  It was good at what it attempted to do if what that was was twisting typical fairytale elements and making a story from that. But as a book that’s I’d want to rave about and reread, it was okay. Not terrible, not bad, not good, it was fine, very lukewarm. I’d recommend it passively, but it seems to fit a particular niche, not quite fantasy, but too whimsical to be straight fiction. 

If you like this, I recommend Son by Louis Lowry, especially if you’ve read the Giver.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x53261/the_bookeaters_semi_review_and_its_subversion_of/,2022-09-03 19:46:40,2,2,books

7s15rl,The Stand - Spoilers,"Hey guys, I just finished this book and have been thinking about it.  I really liked the overall story and the journey of all the characters.  

Yet I still do not understand the ending.  Mother Abigail sends the four men to Vegas with no clear instruction on what to do.  Three of them make it there, just to end up destroyed with the entire city due to Trash Can Man's nuclear option.

Am I missing something?  They were heading towards a possible showdown between God and the Devil and their followers - but nothing really became of that at all.  

The tall man - or Randall Flag was never really understood or seemed to be the threat that the Free Zone thought he was.

Idk.  I really enjoyed the story, but it just seemed to anticlimactic on how it all ends up when everything is said and done.

I have been going through a Stephen King binge lately, and this ending reminds me of IT - where the entire journey to get to the end was great and memorable but I feel the the execution of ending it all felt a little off.

8r44im,Torn on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"Well.. I hope I don't get downvoted! That's kind of a risky thing to say on Reddit, haha. I guess what I mean is...I hope nobody takes offense because I am probably the weird one with this.

My husband and I are book buddies. The books we have read together and enjoyed so far are The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Rosemary's Baby, Red Dragon, The Time Traveller, American Gods (basically lots of Neil Gaiman) and I am sure more. But the first book we are at a disagreement at is The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He loves it and is on the third one. **I hate it** and can't get through the first hundred pages of the first one. 

For that reason, I am aware that my criticisms of the book may not be entirely well-founded as opposed to someone who has finished it, but I thought I would share anyway. This book is putting me in a rage actually, and I don't rage at books easily. So maybe I should share with you all to see if you can hear me out, or otherwise shed light on an alternate opinion. 

My issues with the book don't even involve the confusing names, or the long winded exposition on just about everything. It doesn't even entirely involve the Wennestrom case, although that doesn't help. My issue is with Blomkvist, and the implications his character places on the book.

For one, he seems like the author's pet, sort of like the author is living through the character. I guess I don't have any proof of this so feel free to disagree, but it just kind of seems that way. The author has been touted to me as quite the feminist, but he doesn't seem to realize that Lisbeth is a much more interesting character than her male counterpart, Blomkvist. As unique and as strong as Lisbeth is, Blomkvist is boring. The one thing about him that seems to be interesting to the author is that he is Mr. Stud Muffin. He can bed just about any woman. No woman, no matter how powerful in the story, can resist Mr. Stud Muffin. I just find it odd.

I also find it odd that if this is supposed to be a story that is so feminist, why much of it is seen through the eyes of Mr. Stud Muffin. What message is the book sending if it touts itself as ""Men Hating Women"" but has the main character bork most of these women? Why am I supposed to like Blomkvist in this light if he literally cheats on his wife and ends up leaving her and their daughter? And all because ""they [he and Erika] knew they would end up together."" Really? Another line: ""They were like heroine to each other."" Is anything really *like* heroine? 

It is consensual but still, weird to me. And that's the thing. I think the sexism of the other male characters is intentional, but I'm not sure about Blomkvist. Is it intentional, or is he the author's fantasy? Either way, it is angering me. I'm not a prude or anything and wouldn't be so annoyed if this book wasn't touting itself as being so self aware. 

So I dunno. Just my thoughts. I could have totally misjudged the book and if I did, please let me know. It is just a very strong impression I got. My frustration is from genuinely trying to connect with this character. Ughhh. 

Anyway. Let me know if you know what I mean, or if I am an idiot. I dunno. Dune has been sitting on my shelf for a while. I think I may try that instead. 

Also sorry if grammar sucks. I am rambling.

14hv5ul,Review: The Way Home by Peter S. Beagle (A Quasi-Sequel to The Last Unicorn),"*X-post from* r/TheLastUnicorn

Peter S. Beagle's *The Way Home*, a follow-up of sorts to *The Last Unicorn*, was recently published to relatively little fanfare. I was surprised to discover that it had already been out for a month by the time I heard about it. I was able to read it this week, so I thought I'd put my thoughts out there to drum up a little discussion.

The book contains one novelette and one novella. The novelette, ""Two Hearts,"" was first published in 2004, and serves as a coda to *The Last Unicorn*. Because this story is already nearly 20 years old (!), I will pass over it except to note that it is excellent. If you like *The Last Unicorn* but haven't read this story yet, I can't recommend it enough.

The book as a whole takes its title from the novella: *The Way Home*. It focuses on Sooz, the protagonist/first-person-narrator of ""Two Hearts."" Sooz herself is a great Beagle character: a quirky, imaginative, headstrong girl who has a penchant for getting drawn into the affairs of wizards and fairies. In ""Two Hearts,"" she ended up at the center of a sort of last hurrah for the cast of *The Last Unicorn*. At the end of that story, Molly Grue taught her a song she was to sing on her seventeenth birthday, with a promise of adventure to follow; The Way Home is the story of that adventure.

Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this adventure was terribly compelling, or that it felt like it needed to be set in the world of *The Last Unicorn*. The plot, in brief, involves Sooz going to rescue her long-lost sister who was abducted by fairies; along the way, she makes another friend as well. I think one of the main reasons this story didn't quite work for me is that I didn't find either of these characters nearly as compelling as Sooz. They are her only real conversation partners for most of the story, and while they are not without personality or purpose in the story, they also didn't carve out rent-free space in my mind the way the characters from *The Last Unicorn* did. I wonder if, in part, it's because the cast of the story is so small: a larger cast would create more opportunities for different characters to play off of each other, revealing foibles, quirks, hidden desires, and what have you. I also didn't feel that the new characters captured that enticing blend of archetype and idiosyncrasy that the characters in the original book embodied so well.

To give a complete review, I should also mention that something quite dark happens near the beginning that casts a pallor over the whole work; don't read the rest of this paragraph if you'd rather not read about sexual violence. >!Shortly after entering the fairy realm in search of her lost sister, Sooz is raped by four men she encounters on the road. It's dealt with about as tactfully as can be hoped for, but I have two major problems with this. First and foremost: I just don't think that's a story element anyone wants in a Last Unicorn-adjacent work. It strays too far from the established tone. Second, I don't think it was necessary at all. While Beagle doesn't fall into the trap of ignoring the effects of rape--it's made clear that, though Sooz is able to recover, she will carry the trauma with her for life--there are many other ways he could have given Sooz a wake-up call to the darkness of the world without resorting to what amounts to a cheap cliché. Thematically, the story is in part an exploration of the way some people and experiences really stick with us and define us, so I wonder if he wanted to include something that would act as a dark counterpoint to the bonds Sooz forms with her two companions along the way. Still, there are many other ways he could've accomplished that without having his story take such an out-of-place turn.!<

I don't want to sound completely negative, though: I didn't think it was a bad story, just a disappointing one with one really strange and off-putting writing decision. I did enjoy the dream-like portrayal of the fairy realm-->!especially the way Sooz is able to use a sort of dream-logic to win the day in the end!<. Sooz's voice was nearly as much fun to read as it was in ""Two Hearts."" And the ending was suitably bittersweet. Still, I can't help the feeling that *The Way Home* just isn't anything remarkable in the end. I'd be interested to compare notes, if anyone else has read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14hv5ul/review_the_way_home_by_peter_s_beagle_a/,2023-06-24 15:00:42,4,6,books
akie8h,"Currently reading Ulysses and enjoying the crazy ride thus far. The prose, my God.","Been flirting with reading Ulysses for a year or so. Every couple of weeks, I'd go on a research rampage about Joyce or Ulysses and, in that, got a general impression of the book. I liked the idea of me liking it, so there was some intellectual pride involved that was pretty irritating to deal with. So yeah, there was a lot of hype in my mind. Now that I am reading it, I can barely put it down. There's an itch in my brain to pick it up every time I have an idle moment. 

As an aspiring writer, this book already means a lot to me. All the elements I've been toying with in my WIP I'm seeing mirrored in this book. It makes me feel understood. So stylistically, I'm in love. Fragmented, impressionistic sentences. Free-associative webs of sensations, urges, memories, fantasies. Recurring imagery, thoughts, fixations. Minimal to no exposition. Densely psychological. How he maps the contents of consciousness so adeptly. The world is so tactile. So many scenes are almost like memories in my head.

I literally almost shed a tear over this passage;  **Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times,** ***diebus ac noctibus inurias patens ingemiscit.*** **To no end gathered: vainly then released, forth flowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.** 

""Lifted, flooded and let fall."" The imagery, the allusions, the insight.

""Loom of the moon."" I mean, wow. 

I have no one to talk to about this. Although I have been effusive in my praise, I'm still largely undecided on how I feel about it thus far. It's still early days, but I'm seeing what the fuss is about. Large parts of it are so confusing and I don't want to undersell that. There are passages where I'm not entirely sure what's being communicated or what's happening, even though I'm using a guide after I've finished a section. Like the Proteus chapter. Felt like I was clinging for dear life onto any semblance of meaning. I dimly grasped the connections between his thoughts, and the prose and imagery was top-notch. It was the sort of confusion that was fascinating and frustrating in a way. Currently on the Hades chapter. Bloom's ruminations on Rudy were heartbreaking. It's not your fault, my guy. This book will not let me be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/akie8h/currently_reading_ulysses_and_enjoying_the_crazy/,2019-01-28 01:35:29,20,36,books
x4njxo,"The Moontide Quartet - Almost a Game of Thrones rival, held back by inconsistent characters and plot contrivances.","The book series Moontide Quartet is very very close to being good. 

For the most part I enjoyed the series, which is why it is even more annoying that the problems keep piling. A mug with a small crack can still hold water but if the cracks are everywhere it starts leaking. 

Major spoilers going forward so if you are interested stop. 

It starts with stuff that is core to the books world: the tide bridge. It is made out to be the most important thing in the world that everything revolves around, yet there are airships right from the start that do kinda ruin it. If the empire really really wanted to, they could just send non stop soldiers over with air ships, which is basically what they did at some point anyway. So really the main plot of making the tide bridge permanent is nonsense. 

But the real core problem of the story is this: the love stories. Or rather the characters and their interactions. 

Easiest example is Kazim. At first he is so madly in love with Ramita that he stalks down the grand magus and kills him to finally free her and be with her. Then when she tells him to go away cause he killed her husband (that she grew to love maybe 3 or 4 pages before that point), he doesn't spend a single sentence being sad or heartbroken. Instead he is too busy doing magic at that point. And later on he and Elana get super stockholm syndrom when he tries to kill her and she imprisons him for 6 months. And then they have most purest loving relationship that even transcends magic and reality! Its not good.

Not much better is Alaron and Cym. From the start Cym tells Alan that she's not interested in him and wants ""a man like a lion"". Alan is still pursuing her, stalker style, and even rescues her from tribal men that captured her, where she again tells him to sod off. Which if it ended there might have been funny, but after that the entire story around Cym starts to torture her for not siding Alan. She finally does get her ""man like a lion"" in the form of a shapeshifter that kills mages to sustain himself. The 2 also get stockholm syndrom love (notice a trend?) but not really. For one she gets an abortion to get rid of his child, and secondly the magic symbiosis Kazim got with Elena never happens between them. The longer you read Cyms story the more it reads like someone who got rejected in the past and is now having revenge on this character they created. That is ofc just speculation but it certainly feels that way reading it. 

And I am going to not even mention the Lesbian princess that is forced into a violent marriage (I think its a fetish at this point). 

So yeah. That certainly held the books back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x4njxo/the_moontide_quartet_almost_a_game_of_thrones/,2022-09-03 06:30:33,0,6,books
pmhhev,The Tattooist of Auschwitz - My thoughts,"This is gonna play off like an analysis, feel free to share your thoughts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""The tattooist of Auschwitz is a story of two ordinary people, living in an extraordinary time, deprived not only of their freedom, but their dignity, their names and their identities' '. Throughout the novel, Morris illustrates the comradery, selflessness and the unconditional affection the camp members have for each other, at a time of hardship. Morris demonstrates this through the uplifting moments in the camp which originate not from the actions taken to survive but the strong relationships that had developed between the camp members. Under such brutality Lale not only met the love of his life, but he also saw the gypsies like his own family and Nadya repeatedly reminded him of his own mother which ultimately led him to not only use his extra rations for himself, but to also share for others. 

Significantly, what was most astonishing was the unity of the camp members, despite their differences. When Lale speaks to the group of men he is ""captivated by the differences and similarities between their cultures"" emphasising how the variety of cultures didn't serve as a hindrance, but fuelled the unforgettable and unique relationships ignited within the camps. The extent of unity is emphasised by Lale's realisation that 'in another life I would have nothing to do with you. I would probably turn away from you, or cross the street if I saw you walking towards me' emphasising how the monotonous nature of life discourages perhaps the most significant things life has to offer- human interaction. It's fascinating how a society of privilege encourages people to take precautions and 'turn' and 'cross' away from strangers whilst at times of hardship human connection and togetherness seems to be essential for survival. 

Furthermore, Morris illustrates how selflessness leads to a ripple effect of compassion amongst the concentration camp. This is reflected in Lale's friendship with Aron where Lale ensured Aron remained sane under the brutal regime and when Lale became ill Aron ensured he recovered and kept the Nazis from realising Lale was ill as it would have led him to be shot dead. Tragically however Aron was shot dead by the Kapo simply because the kapo felt like inflicting suffering. Once Lale had woken up and had recovered he was told by the prisoners of Aron's efforts and how they were inspired by him to save 'the one'. From this the term was coined to 'save one save them all' emphasising the importance one individual can have on the survival of others. This is further conveyed through how Lale saves a random man Jakub on his first night by giving him extra rations and then years later he uses his role to save Lale when he is caught smuggling money and jewels. Through this Morris illustrates how compassion and self sacrifice strengthens the unity and communal support within the camp. 

Significantly, the novel celebrates the individual experiences of each character that went through such struggle and suffering. Overall from the novel Morris illustrates the significant impact empathy and compassion could have on the world, as at the moments of suffering it is the unconditional communal support that allows the camp members to get through the struggle within the camp.

15ae4ig,The Murderbot Diaries: Somehow better than what everyone says (very light spoilers),"*The Murderbot Diaries includes All Systems Red, Artificial Condition, Rogue Protocol, Exit Strategy, Network Effect, and Fugitive Telemetry, by Martha Wells (as well as some short stories which I haven’t read)*

Everyone is saying how great The Murderbot Diaries is, particularly its main character Murderbot. I bring low expectations into reading really popular fiction, not because I expect them to be bad but because I’ve been let down more than once. So I read The Murderbot Diaries not expecting much, and… yeah. It’s even better than what people are saying. I loved this series, so much so that I just had to write about it.

(Minor spoilers ahead) (I tried to make sure reading this would not detract from reading The Murderbot Diaries for the first time afterwards)

### Characterization

In an attempt to avoid rambling incoherently (despite reading I’m not actually a good writer myself), I’m going to try structuring this into sections, starting with the highlight of the series: the characterization. It’s not an exaggeration to say Wells is a bit of a genius in this field, and it’s why so many people come away loving the main character. 

The story is told in first person. In my experience first person is used primarily to provide a limited perspective to the events that occur and secondarily to give us a look into the mind of the character it follows. Wells takes these two usually separate qualities and blends them together seamlessly. Events do not simply occur and are described in a Murderbot story. Instead, everything that happens is understood and contextualized through the mind and experiences of Murderbot. Things that Murderbot doesn’t care about, things that you might expect to be described at times, just aren’t in the text, and conversely things that are only really important to Murderbot are in the text. It’s an intimate experience. Everything that happens, you know how Murderbot feels about it. If it annoys it. If it… well, usually things annoy it. But sometimes things awe it, or stun it, or frustrate it, make it shy, make it excited, even make it happy (though it hesitates to state that so honestly). I truly came to understand all the interesting quirks that make it feel human (though I definitely would not want to say that to its face). 

This isn’t a revolutionary idea, but it’s aided and brought to excellence by Murderbot being such a deep and interesting character. Its motivations have layers that are wound complexly with its history as a slave and its desire to be free, and it’s constantly growing (figuratively; it doesn’t actually grow). You get to see it confront human and relatable problems in an honest display of raw emotions while it tries to navigate the messed up universe Wells creates. Everything feels so raw and unfiltered, and by the end I felt I understood Murderbot just as much as I do anyone in real life. Which has to be one of the nicest things I’ve ever said about a fictional character.

While Murderbot is definitely the highlight, there’s more to talk about. The main cast that surrounds Murderbot shifts from book to book, but they always feel fleshed out, at least as far as what Murderbot understands about them from its interactions. They have motivations, quirks, interests, families. Maybe most noticeably, they are always likable. Very likable, even. A lot of authors will throw in the one or two characters that people are supposed to dislike, either for them to have growth or just to be a villain. Wells doesn’t bother with that, and it’s refreshing, my dear reader. So refreshing to just follow a group of characters that I like for once. 

### Queer representation, and other progressive qualities

I’m gonna level with you. The queer scene is scraping for good rep, and bless her, Wells delivers. I started this series not knowing there was queerness at all, and frankly it blew my mind. This wasn’t just a lesbian here, gay couple in the background there kind of thing. Almost everyone is queer. Important characters are in marriage pacts of 3+ people of various genders. There are non-binary characters (including Murderbot of course) and even genders that don’t exist in our world, with unique pronouns and everything. And all these people just, exist. No unnecessary justifications for why someone is the way they are. The books don’t miss a beat. They’re just a normal part of society.

Wells is a female author so it’s expected that women are written well. Nevertheless I feel compelled to note, at least in passing, that this is indeed the case. Women are often the driving force of the narrative. They are independently characterized, never having their identity defined by their relationship to a man, and have their own interesting qualities, motivations, etc. Wells doesn’t try to give her women the masculine traits that are perceived as “strong” by a lot of (our) society, but instead just lets them be people, of all types. One benefit of the story being told from Murderbot’s perspective is it doesn’t care about (or maybe just doesn’t even notice) how attractive people are, so the story isn’t even given a chance to trip into the annoying pitfall of every important woman has to be attractive, unless they’re evil in which case they are unattractive. Also they hold a lot of positions that gender roles would usually dictate be filled by men, including such fancy titles as planetary leader (okay, that’s not technically accurate but close enough). 

Maybe what most people will notice though is the communist Preservation Alliance and how it’s characterized, its past, its benefits and flaws, and its juxtaposition to the Corporation Rim (which is exactly what you expect it to be). While they are good enough not to clumsily state so outright, these books are staunchly anti-capitalist, progressive works, and if that resonates with you, you should really give them a try. 

### Pacing

A lot of the Murderbot books are short, hovering around 150 pages. Too short, according to a lot of people, which makes sense when you see the prices they’re charging for these things. However if you can get around the price, whether by using your local library or, uh, other means, you might find it refreshing that an author doesn’t take their time but instead gets right to the details. These books are excellently paced. They never drag, and they’re never longer than they need to be. People generally like having more to read, especially when it’s good, and believe me I get that. But there’s not a single story here that I wish was fluffed with extra words just so we could read full length novels. If nothing else, these books respect your time. And they’re great for rereading.

### Good vibes

The Murderbot Diaries has good vibes. It’s a little hard to explain outside of that phrase but I’ll give it a try. Despite the perils the characters face, the books feel like they’re trying to make me smile as I read them, constantly. As mentioned before, the characters are likable. I felt myself giddy with excitement on several occasions seeing certain ones interact in what I knew would be wholesome encounters. The bots and human constructs have bonds that make me feel warm inside. Murderbot is hilarious, to the point where I was laughing aloud reading the first book and was still going by the end of the journey. There are occasional sad moments, but by and large these books seem designed to make people happy, and while there’s nothing wrong with a sad story, it really does feel nice to smile so frequently while reading. 

On top of that, once I read a bit of Murderbot and understood it well enough, its mind became oddly comfortable. It’s like slipping into a second home, where I know how things work, what makes it tick. The writing style is smooth and eloquent enough that I found myself neatly reading page to page, not being distracted by odd dialogue or melodramatic descriptions. The books are suspenseful and engaging, but they aren’t taken to the point of ridiculousness like some YA, nor do they obsess over particularly sensitive content like much of the literature targeting adults. Despite being set in a corporate dystopia, there isn’t much needed in the way of content warnings. They’re comfy, and I think that’s nice. 

### Identifying with Murderbot

I touched on this briefly in the characterization section, but ultimately I decided it was probably a good idea to give this its own spotlight. Despite its name, it is so easy to identify with Murderbot. It has traits that (at least I imagine) are common in readers, certainly myself. It’s shy and doesn’t like spending time around people. It’s bad at communicating. It doesn’t understand its own feelings very well and retreats to the comfort of its favorite soap opera when it can. But it also cares about people, and it wants to help them in the ways it knows it can. Basically, it’s a very endearing introvert.

There are also problems it faces that people of various backgrounds can identify with. People treat it differently, as if it isn’t human (in the philosophical sense, because okay it’s not technically human, but it has feelings and these people really need to understand that). They ignore it when it’s in the room, or judge it based on their preconceived notions of its species. People of all sorts of marginalized groups will understand that feeling. There are others but I’m omitting them because spoilers. Ultimately, I think a lot of people will be able to see at least some part of their life experiences in Murderbot. As a black genderqueer person I resonated with a lot of its struggles in ways that felt personal to me, and I imagine the same could be true for you too.  

---

So that’s why I think The Murderbot Diaries is so great. This was mostly for myself, to get out all of these feelings, but if someone out there considers reading Murderbot because of this post, that’s awesome, and you totally should. There’s even a full length Murderbot novel coming out in November.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15ae4ig/the_murderbot_diaries_somehow_better_than_what/,2023-07-26 18:46:13,62,363,books
10v41iu,I read 20 candidates for ‘The Great American Novel’ (1826-1960). Here are some thoughts.,"Over the last 6 months, I’ve read as many early candidates for the “Great American Novel” as I could. No list could be exhaustive, and there are valid qualms about the concept of a GAN at all, let alone which novels are included. I stopped with 1960’s ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’; whilst undeniably great American novels follow that time period, this is where I chose to end this project. If there are any other great candidates from before 1960, I’m eager to hear them.

There wont be any significant spoilers here, just general impressions. Also, I'm Australian, so I hadn't read most of these in school, as many of you likely would have.

#James F. Cooper - Last of the Mohicans (1826)#

Having never seen the film, I didn’t know what to expect of this novel. I found the writing to be mostly excellent, highly evocative of the atmosphere of the New England frontier, and treats the Native American situation with a great deal more respect and reverence than the contemporary whites probably did. In terms of the narrative itself, I found it surprisingly closer to a near-swashbuckling adventure of Treasure Island or King Solomon’s Mines, than to the historical epic which I had expected.

#Nathaniel Hawthorne - Scarlet Letter (1850)#

This novel was largely excellent, albeit repetitive even for such a short novel. What struck me most, after having spent the previous year chronologically reading through Gothic novels, was that The Scarlet Letter largely adhered to those conventions: it purported to be derived from a lost manuscript, where a young woman is cruelly maligned for an expression of love, tormented by repressed authorities, under constant threat of a wretched elderly man, sequestered away, and is liberated in the last moments at the cost of her true love’s life. I hereby name The Scarlet Letter to me the first American Gothic novel.

#Herman Melville – Moby Dick (1851)#

I have a somewhat complicated relationship with this novel. I’ve read it three times. I regard the opening chapter as the greatest in all of literature. Though I am no expert in the contemporary attitudes, I regard both Moby Dick and Typee to be relatively progressive in their attitudes towards race. I also think that a homo (or bi) sexual reading of Moby Dick is entirely valid. I also understand that in a time when undertaking world adventures was uncommon, encyclopaedic descriptions and chapters double as being educational and immersive, as well as entertaining.
All that said, not every encyclopaedic chapter is worthwhile. There are chapters defending the classification of the whale as a fish (Chapter 32, although I remain unsure whether this is a tongue-in-cheek jab at the notion), as well as the notion that the whale will not be hunted to extinction (Chapter 105). Several of the ship-life chapters feel worthwhile in the beginning, but their value decreases rapidly as the novel progresses, until the final quarter of the book where it just seems to stifle and pad out the pacing of the narrative, when it should be culminating to its greatest climax.
If one takes the controversial position of skipping the encyclopaedic whaling chapters and adhering solely to the narrative, then one will find a modern Shakesperean tragedy with all the wonder of Homer’s Odyssey. After three reads, I believe I will next experiment with an abridged read, in which only about half of the encyclopaedic whaling chapters are kept.

#Harriet Beecher Stowe - Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852)#

There is an apocryphal tale that Abraham Lincoln, upon meeting Stowe, remarked: “So this is the little lady who started this great war.” Written in protest to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and whose popularity is often cited as increasing abolitionist sentiment in the lead-up to the Civil War, there might be no more important American novel than Uncle Tom’s Cabin.
Where the work suffers is that in a post-slavery age, its treatise comes across as rather obvious. The novel exists deliberately as a work of propaganda. That is not a criticism, but an observation. Every scene, every encounter, even the omniscient narration between, targets the reader’s prejudices and confronts their complacency with slavery. This is what makes the novel such an important work, but it does mean that as a novel, the work has aged poorly, and lacks the narrative enjoyment of fiction. When setting aside the aged constructs, the proud and powerful soliloquies of George and the conflicted yet biting wit of Augustine St. Clare were my favourite parts of the novel.
The greatest prescience of the novel comes in the chapter Reunion, where it is remarked that mere emancipation is not enough, and that education must follow. Stowe calls to task the Northerners who would free the slaves and then have no hand in helping raise them to true independence. I am in awe of how far-seeing this novel is in the issues which would plague civil rights for a century beyond her time.
The novel culminates with the ultimate Ecclesiastical question, and the answer which Tom derives from the Gospel: though they suffer beneath the lash, had any yet fallen so far as Christ did? In that faith is his protection. It is, however, in the final chapters that the purity of Christianity and my own sensibilities are split from one another. To make Tom a Christ-like figure is the only real ending this novel could have, but it is one decidedly less satisfying than Django Unchained.
After completion, I researched the history of the Uncle Tom epithet, and was disheartened to see that unsanctioned minstrel shows gradually reduced the character of Tom to a stupid, obsequious creature, in order to fit within accepted norms. Though the germ of that portrayal is present in the humility and loyalty of Tom, it is such an insult to his character that time has taken even that away.

#Mark Twain - Tom Sawyer (1876)#
This was a fun, light-hearted childhood romp. I enjoyed the greater insight of the third-person narration, which was very funny. Aside from that, there’s not much more to say about this novel, until…

#Mark Twain - Huckleberry Finn (1884)#

Now, in shifting the narrative from third-person to first, we lose much of the grand wit and insight of Twain the narrator, and instead we get the intimate, immersive and confronting perspective of the young and uneducated vagrant Huck Finn. I don’t want to dwell too long on the obvious ways in which this novel has aged; suffice to say that I found the narrative so much heavier than Tom Sawyer right from the outset, with Pa Finn perhaps being the first American villain in the mould of Stephen King: the horrors of domestic abuse. I loved the tale down the Mississippi, especially with the Duke and the King con-men, but when they reached the plantation of Tom’s family, I found the last several chapters nearly intolerable, devolving into a farce and making horrible light of Jim’s plight up until this point. I was actually shocked at the paucity of this ending, and turned to the internet, where I saw (for the first time) this this is a widely-held position, with Hemmingway being the most vitriolic, calling the ending “a failure of nerve”.

#Stephen Crane – The Red Badge of Courage (1895)#
There is a wit and candour to this short novel which marks it immediately as a spiritual predecessor to Heller’s ‘Catch-22’, if it was led by Catcher’s Holden Caulfield as a protagonist. There is a self-assured idealism which can only come from youth, being wiped away in the brutality of war. The themes here seem so far ahead of their time, feeling more akin to the post WW1 Modernist movement.

#Jack London - The Call of the Wild (1903)#

Good Lord. I had picked this up as a ‘comfy’ novel to read in a few days, thinking of the wholesome man-meets-dog tale in pop culture. But dear dog, the violence and cruelty in this novel. I had just recently sustained an injury in breaking up a vicious dog attack, and reading the savagery between Buck and Spitz was traumatic. There is prose here worthy of note, especially in the instances of Buck’s trance before the fire, and especially the wolfsong in Chapter Three, beginning with ‘the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead…’ It is a harrowing masterpiece, and I’m especially fond of the prose at the finale, where Buck is no more, and there is merely the Ghost Wolf.

#Upton Sinclair - The Jungle (1906)#
“I aimed at the public’s heart, and accidentally hit in the stomach.”
America has been many things at many times, including the ‘Land of Opportunity’ for generations of migrants. This is the only novel in this list which really captures the plight of the first-generation migrants to America, and their struggles. Much of the novel is virtually devoid of dialogue, and this gives it an impression equally between a documentary and a cautionary fable. Those who have read ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ will have some hint at the descending hell of despair this novel describes. And when you think you have reached the lowest level, the ninth circle, you count the pages and realize you are only halfway done. Reprieve only comes when our characters have nothing left to lose but their lives, and to lose even that might come as a relief.
If I have one major criticism of this novel, it is that the last few chapters forego an actual plot, in order to become a series of lectures. This is what Sinclair really wanted to say, the conclusion to his treatise, but where ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ explored the theme through plot, here is but a dialogue between newly-introduced intellectuals.

#F. Scott Fitzgerald - The Great Gatsby (1925)#

I’ll admit, I had considered skipping this novel, as I turned the Baz Lurhman movie off halfway through. Decadence is not in vogue any longer, but this excellent book captures from the very outset the mixed cynicism and awe of an excess which – we can see now – was doomed to fall. It might be this very fact that The Great Depression has made The Great Gatsby all the more impactful. Every line was wonderful, and it has made me want to seek out F Scott Fitzgerald’s other work. In short, I consider this to be the ‘Picture of Dorian Gray’ for the American 1920s.

#Ernest Hemmingway – Three Novels#
I read A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea, and The Sun Also Rises. For completion, noting here that I consider Hemmingway to be the perfect author for emotionally-stunted, semi-literate men suffering from toxic masculinity. No redeeming qualities, save for the fact that his books are short enough to suffer through quickly. (I am aware that my opinion is not a popular one, please accept it for the good-natured ribbing it is intended as, and I’ll meet you all in the parking lot after the curtain closes.)

#William Faulkner – The Sound and the Fury (1929)#

I had some small notion of what to expect when going into this…thing, and had read a plot summary in advance in order to contextualise what I was reading. Three sections: Part One following Benjy might conceivably have content to justify its opacity, and I’ve heard of a color-coded version which would untangle the timeline of events, but for the most part I just let myself go along with it, and found it an entertaining read. Part Two (Quentin) was far less imposing than I was led to believe, and I think that’s because the multi-page stream of consciousness has a few clues in dialogue tags to indicate what is happening, so I was able to follow it well. Part Three is of course the easiest to follow via Jason, and wraps up the novel well. Largely, I consider this to be a successful experiment largely because of its brevity and because of the strength of the characters.

#William Faulkner - As I Lay Dying (1930)#

As I Lay Dying is far more straightforward than TSatF, but this is still a modernist novel. I loved Darl as a possibly-unreliable narrator, with some of the most evocative prose I’ve read in a good long while. Anse and Vernon Tull each had an appropriate voice which easily drew me in, though I found the limitations of their thought processes frustrating. On the far end of the scale, we have Vardaman and Dewey Dell. Dewey may be excusable for suffering from some sort of trauma, and there are suggestions that Vardaman – like Benjy from TSatF – is mentally impaired. Still, it makes for a frustrating read, and even in the lucid characters, I find that stream-of-consciousness rarely justifies itself with its rambling disjointed nature. I appreciate that Faulkner’s novels are short, permitting experimentation, and it’s largely its brevity which permits the atmosphere to outlast the frustration.

#John Steinbeck - The Grapes of Wrath (1939)#

I have rarely read a book so expertly crafted. It balances the voice and heart of Twain with the starkness of Faulkner. Chapter 14 (a short chapter) is to my mind the centrepiece of the novel. A blending of the American and Socialist spirit – made literal by the stringing together of Paine and Jefferson with Marx and Lenin. A cry of this oppressed creature, sitting at the fulcrum of the Old America and New. Even if The Grapes of Wrath is not the GAN, this chapter sits in the centre of the conversation.
The interspersal of 3rd person omniscient narratives set apart from the Joads is a masterwork of tension, granting the reader glimpses of what is to come, rewarding close attention, and sparing us the trauma of the moment. But through all this pain there is still joy. I laughed in this book, a lot. I laughed at the human spirit, at its brotherhood, and its defiance.

#J.D. Salinger - The Catcher in the Rye (1946)#

I went into this novel with zero expectations. I did not know in what year it was set, nor what it was about, except that it was seen as a “coming of age” tale, and that Holden Caulfield was a difficult pill to swallow for adults. Maybe I was prepared for his attitude, then, for I found this novel very interesting as an examination of adolescent depression, angst, and suicidal ideation. All that said, I still find this novel somewhat overrated, and don’t really see a great deal of the importance for it as a supposed ‘GAN’. It has been said that this is a “war novel without the war”, and I can see that, but it remains a tale of less substance than I had hoped for.

#Ralph Ellison – Invisible Man (1952)#

After so long down this list, it moves me to say that here is the first novel written by an author who in fact belongs to the downtrodden class from which the narrative speaks. Make no mistake; Stowe, Sinclair, and Steinbeck speak powerfully, and convincingly. But even in the opening words of the Prologue, I am moved by a distinction which is now, in hindsight, so obvious. None better can speak to the African American experience, than an African American writer. That being said, I struggled with the narrative. It is visceral and confronting, and I am often left with a powerful feeling, yet wondering what the meaning of it is. Perhaps this is the point: that the feeling of discrimination is more powerful than any concrete facts.
The opening of Chapter 5 is particularly stunning, as it transitions to astute observations of gospel choirs: “as the defeated come to love the symbols of their conquerors”. It comes as a striking follow-up to ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’, which so strongly advocated fir the need to educate freed slaves. Here is a novel set within the ‘benign’ education system, and it still poisons with its patronising.

#Ayn Rand – Atlas Shrugged (1957)#

There are very few impartial sources (non-Capitalist think-tanks) which include ‘Atlas Shrugged’ as a ‘Great American Novel’. I include it here because I included Upton Sinclair’s ‘The Jungle’, and few novels have had as great an impact on contemporary American thought (for good or ill) than ‘Atlas Shrugged’. It warrants discussion.
For full disclosure, roughly between 2008 and 2016 I was a Libertarian, and devotee of Ayn Rand. I am no longer a Libertarian, nor partial to capitalist thought, but I do continue to take a more measured approach to Rand. Growing up in the early years of the Soviet Union, she was in the first group of women to enrol at Petrograd University, and by age 20 she had successfully migrated to the United States. Under any other ideology, a woman such as Rand – who grew up under an oppressive social system, and escaped it to the Land of Opportunity at the height of the Roaring 20s, only to devote her life to the ideological dismantling of her former system – would be lauded as an icon.

The novel is a mammoth one – over half a million words – and is regularly targeted for thin, unrealistic, undynamic characters, and egregious moralistic rants. I find this criticism largely unfair, as it misses the intended point. ‘Atlas Shrugged’ is a novel depicting ideological archetypes in place of people. When characters clash and either change or do not, it is ideologies being represented and debated. Each character clearly represents a viewpoint taken to its absolute conclusion, and the plot exists in order to facilitate this ongoing debate. Frankly, as a literary device, I think that its success speaks for itself. Ayn Rand differs from other popular philosophers in that there is never any doubt as to what she means, and she is incredibly direct in hammering this point home (in this, she is the opposite of Jordan Peterson, so hides behind so much pseudo-intellectual babble that he can deny any accurate indictment).
As for the ideology espoused: Rand formulated Objectivism, and in John Galt’s novel-length speech, takes you from Point A (existence exists), to Point B (I exist, therefore I am), and walks one through with clear steps to Point Z (Free-market Capitalism). Rand fails as a philosopher at the same point all who have tried this fail: the ‘Is-Ought’ paradigm. Halfway, at Point L (biological means for survival) she makes a leap to Point N (that rational-self-interest is ethically necessary), whilst skipping the crucial Point M: Why this is true. She doubles back to justify this jump with thin excuses: “Just try living under the uncompromised logical extreme of self-denial!” But this diverts from logical arguing to results-based arguing. I noticed this on my first read, but dismissed it. On my second, it bothered me, and by my third read, I had moved onto being a ‘Libertarian Socialist’, and Rand had no further hold on me.

I find it sad that Rand’s success and the cult-of-personality around her ideology has become such a burden to the political dialogue of the USA. One should be able to read important but flawed novels from throughout history, and see the importance of their thought and the life which produced it. To read Plato’s ‘Republic’ today, it is not utopian, but borderline Fascist. Yet we still value it as a text to learn from in its historical context. Written during the Cold War by a former-Soviet woman, this novel deserves a place as a symbol of America.

#Harper Lee - To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)#

What is there to say about this novel which has not been said before? Anything I could say feels less specific to this novel than to this project as a whole. If feels like the natural bookend to Stowe’s ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’; whereby the conversation began and ended more than a century apart, with African Americans still striving for their equality. I’d read this book a few times before, the first time being as requisite reading in middle school, but reading it at the end of this saga of Great American Novels strikes me with a more pressing question: Why – if the history of Great American literature is the history of protest novels and tales of struggle against oppression – is the need for protest literature still as necessary in the 1960s as it was a century before, and half a century after? What lesson isn’t being learned?


I end this list here. Other later American novels I intend to read include works by Pynchon, Capote, Kerouac, Kessey, Heller, Morrisson, Ellison, Nabokov, and McCarthy, but they won’t be covered here. I’m also aware that there are other Hemingway, Faulkner and Steinbeck novels variously regarded as their ‘best’, but in this instance I was content to stick to their most-read. In the case of ‘East of Eden’, I am choosing to save that novel for a later date, as I feel it will be something special, but Grapes of Wrath is quite obviously the more prominent candidate for the GAN.

Conclusion
So, is there a single ‘Great American Novel’? For its intent and impact, it’s hard to dismiss ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’, as sitting so prominently in such a major turning point of American history, capturing the atmosphere immediately before the Civil War. In the same way, ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ is a product of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era, perhaps the next most important era in American history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10v41iu/i_read_20_candidates_for_the_great_american_novel/,2023-02-06 11:11:36,159,234,books
y0tnyl,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape? Ephebophilia, Realistic to the Story, or Something Else??","While waiting for my kid to finish swim lessons the other day I saw the title *What's Eating Gilbert Grape?* on Libby and having vague memories of the Depp & DiCaprio movie my mom watched on cable television I decided to give it a shot.  I finished the book up late last night and felt the movie was a pretty decent make of the novel, but wanted to get some other perspectives on how people felt about the ephebophilia in the storyline. 

While the whole thing gave me *Catcher in the Rye* vibes, unlike Holden our main protagonist is a 24 year old adult.  While his life has seemingly stalled since high school, unlike his younger brother he doesn't outright suffer any condition that would diminish his mental capacity to that of a younger male. 

Enter *manic pixie dream girl* Becky, who is 15 but so hot every man in town wants her and every girl is threatened by her.  Becky is mature, and wise, and sage and the only person who *gets* our dear protagonist. She is such a free spirit she dances in the rain with no music and won't kiss Gilbert while he is hating himself! She knows all the other girls are insecure because of her bodacious body and tells Gilbert to be nice them because of how they are feeling. Wow such maturity for a teenager! There is no backstory for how Becky became this intelligent and old soul, her parents are divorcing so she is forced to spend some time with grandma that summer but that is about all that is mentioned about Becky that doesn't involve how sex-able she is or how she is handling Gilbert. Oh yeah Grandma totally loves and encourages the 24 man-child sniffing around her granddaughter. 

Then there is Ellen. We know Ellen's backstory because as the protagonist's sibling it is laid out for you, but Ellen is 16 and was previously the most fuckable thing around for miles until Becky rode into town on her bicycle and stole the crown.  Ellen is so hot, Gilbert's best friend (another early twenties man-child) has been wanting to ask her out since she was 9 and by the end she is boinking the late-20s funeral director's son in his company hearse. Of course, Ellen is a childish and annoying whore though and not at all like Gilbert's mature virgin mary Becky.

The other women in this town are geriatric (employer's wife) or related (mom and sister) and they are all totally un-fuckable. Poor big sister only had one boyfriend in her 34 years who got busted kissing her younger (and therefore obviously more sexier?) little sister. The other legal-aged female adults are all trying to fuck Gilbert but he has no desire for that(or at least not anymore in the case of the one).

So what is up with all the men drooling over the teenagers? 

I tried to think this was a deliberate part of the storyline, but it adds so little.  Again, Becky is nothing but a hollow fantasy girl of a character so why couldn't she be 18 and just out of high school? Ellen could be screwing any random guy when Mom kicks the bucket - why not a boy from the youth group she starts hanging out with?  

Why so many paragraphs about the hot bodies of these 2 teenage characters while only unappealing adjectives are used to describe the other female characters?

I also thought this might be a remnant or ""sign of the times"" as midwest poverty looks the same in a lot of decades and maybe ""back then"" that was just how it was. This excuse was taken away as the book was published in 1991 where I think we were starting to realize you shouldn't be screwing teenagers but maybe not.

&#x200B;

The book itself is an easy read, and scratches the surface of some hard truths without dragging you too far down the suffering highway so I can see some appeal in most of the story, but the role and writing of the two teenage characters really stood out to me. So tell me fellow readers, what were your impressions of this book? Am I being too sensitive? Is the age essential to the story? Did the author have intentions that went over my head? What are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0tnyl/whats_eating_gilbert_grape_ephebophilia_realistic/,2022-10-10 23:40:23,11,16,books
oabpbc,"Ministry for the Future, Kim Stanley Robinson [spoilers]","I just finished this science/speculative fiction book that examines the next few decades vis-a-vis climate change and the human response.

I have read most of Robinson's work, ever since the Mars Trilogy, and I've found him thought-provoking and intelligent.

It is clear that Robinson has a lot of knowledge of the mechanics of climate change, technology, and miscellaneous other information that buttresses the novel.

That said, I found this book unsatisfying. It begins with a massive heat wave causing a die-off in India. This sets a tone that, in my opinion, he does not follow through with. It is basically a singular occurrence, and other than a storm destroying LA and another heat wave in Texas, nothing more of note happens, which in my opinion, beggars belief.

The book demonstrates various desperate tech fixes and geoengineering solutions to the problem that I found far too efficacious. In a relatively short span, the world has converted almost entirely to masted sailing ships and dirigible-style airships. It made me wonder what all those airships were using for lift, because as far as I know, Helium is getting harder and harder to come by, and Hydrogen is dangerous and costly to isolate.

Most incredible, the book gave the impression that once the good guys started killing off the mean old billionaires and petro executives of the world, the downtrodden masses just marched arm-in-arm into the brave new world of the future. That the poor are naturally virtuous and will all gladly do the right thing once the money men stop exploiting them. I find this naive to the point of insanity. Furthermore, I think the black wing of the Ministry (which is responsible for criminal/terrorist acts to further the cause), would be found out within a year, the Ministry would be closed, and it would be an enormous scandal.

I agree with most of the proposals in the book, such as Half Earth (I'd actually do him one better and leave 2/3 of the Earth's surface free from human habitation), but in reality, I think that the attempt to make this happen would engender riots, civil wars, and interstate conflict the likes of which we haven't seen in generations. He gives no indication that anyone even sniffed at the idea of a massive centralized redistribution of capital and reorganization of everyone's way of life.

Finally, it wasn't all that interesting of a read, as far as narrative structure. Main character Mary is okay, kind of a bore, doesn't really develop, but fine. Main character Frank sucks and is unlikeable. No other characters are really fleshed out, and the story, such that it is, just kind of ends.

In summary, it was a passable commitment of climate change-related ideas to paper, but overall you can give this one a miss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oabpbc/ministry_for_the_future_kim_stanley_robinson/,2021-06-29 16:24:38,3,21,books
k1950h,Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana Jr.,"I just finished reading this novel and I absolutely loved it. I would recommend to anyone who wants to read a novel about sailors and sailing, or if you were a fan of Moby Dick or The Terror. I enjoyed reading it more than I was expecting (I thought it’d be dense and boring but instead, the writing was easy to understand and well written, and I learned sailing terms and the many different parts of ships and sails.) The novel follows the author on his two-year voyage from Boston to Cape Horn, and around the America’s. 

My favorite passage from this novel is as follows: 

“Death is at all times solemn, but never so much so as at sea. A man dies on shore; his body remains with his friends...but when a man falls overboard at sea and is lost, there is a suddenness in the event, and a difficulty in realizing it, which give to it an air of awful mystery. A man dies on shore—you follow his body to the grave, and a stone marks the spot. You are often prepared for the event. There is always something which helps you realize it when it happens, and to recall it when it has passed. A man is shot down by your side in battle, and the mangled body remains an object, and a real evidence; but at sea, the man is near you—at your side—you hear his voice, and in an instant he is gone, and nothing but a vacancy shows his loss. Then, too, at sea...you miss a man so much. A dozen men are shut up together in a little bark, upon the wide, wide sea, and for months and months see no forms and hear no voices but their own and one is taken suddenly from among them, and they miss him at every turn. It is like losing a limb. There are no new faces or new scenes to fill up the gap. There is always an empty berth in the forecastle, and one man wanting when the small night watch is mustered. There is one less to take the wheel and one less to lay out with you upon your yard. You miss his form, and the sound of his voice, for habit had made them almost necessary to you, and each of your senses feels the loss.”

Dana eventually became a lawyer who devoted his career to fighting for the rights of sailors and slaves in court. He later went on to help create the anti slavery Free Seal Party and even served on the Massachusetts legislature. 

What are your favorite books about sea life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k1950h/two_years_before_the_mast_by_richard_henry_dana_jr/,2020-11-26 05:23:23,7,8,books

**Winner**|System Collapse|Martha Wells|Following the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize. But there’s something wrong with Murderbot; it isn’t running within normal operational parameters. ART’s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza’s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they’re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what’s wrong with itself, and fast.|/u/OnetB
**1st Runner-Up**|Light Bringer|Pierce Brown|The Reaper is a legend, more myth than man: the savior of worlds, the leader of the Rising, the breaker of chains. But the Reaper is also Darrow, born of the red soil of Mars: a husband, a father, a friend. The worlds once needed the Reaper. But now they need Darrow. Because after the dark age will come a new age: of light, of victory, of hope.|/u/Vermithor-BronzeFury
**2nd Runner-Up**|Starter Villain|John Scalzi|Charlie's life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan. Then his long-lost uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to Charlie. But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser death rays and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they're coming after Charlie. His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture capital. It's up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyperintelligent talking spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look pretty good.|/u/Zikoris

But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death?|/u/austinlambert03
**1st Runner-Up**|The Will of the Many|James Islington|I tell them my name is Vis Telimus. I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilised society in allowing my strength, my drive and my focus – what they call Will – to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do. I tell them that I belong, and they believe me. But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart. And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family. To survive, though, I will still have to rise through the Academy’s ranks. I will have to smile, and make friends, and pretend to be one of them and win. Because if I cannot, then those who want to control me, who know my real name, will no longer have any use for me. And if the Hierarchy finds out who I truly am, they will kill me.|/u/lilghost76
**2nd Runner-Up**|Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries|Heather Fawcett|Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is the foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius scholar and a meticulous researcher who is writing the world's first encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people.

Nor does she care to spend time with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the townsfolk, get in the middle of Emily's research, and utterly confound and frustrate her. But as Emily gets closer and closer to uncovering the secrets of the Hidden Ones--the most elusive of all faeries--lurking in the shadowy forest outside the town, she also finds herself on the trail of another mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really want?

**Winner-TIED**|Happy Place|Emily Henry|They broke up six months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends. Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most. Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It’s a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week… in front of those who know you best?|/u/86rj

With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she’s long abandoned the search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to round out a satisfying life. But when Sally’s friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actor who guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show—and in society at large—who’ve gotten romantically involved with incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called the ""Danny Horst Rule,"" poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would ever happen for a woman. Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as both host and musical guest for this week’s show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder whether there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn’t a romantic comedy; it’s real life. And in real life, someone like him would never date someone like her...right?|/u/jellyrollo

**Winner**|The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder|David Grann|On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. But then . . . six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death--for whomever the court found guilty could hang.|/u/Guilty-Pigeon
**1st Runner-Up**|Poverty, by America|Matthew Desmond|The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow.|/u/apageinthestacks
**2nd Runner-Up**|A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan's Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them|Timothy Egan|The Roaring Twenties--the Jazz Age--has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he’d become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows – their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman – Madge Oberholtzer – who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees. |/u/baddspellar

mph1aw,"You should read The Prometheus Rising, it's really a life changing book","I'll just post here an intro (avalaible as a free sample in any e-book store), it will explain a lot more than my messy writing could do, the book is like tutorial to parts of human brain and nature, with exercises to go with it: 

*William James, father of American psychology, tells of meeting an old lady who told him the Earth rested on the back of a huge turtle.

""But, my dear lady,"" Professor James asked, as politely as possible, ""what holds up the turtle?""
""Ah,"" she said, ""that's easy. He is standing on the back of another turtle.""
""Oh, I see,"" said Professor James, still being polite. ""But would you be so good as to tell me what holds up the second turtle?""
""It's no use, Professor,"" said the old lady, realizing he was trying to lead her into a logical trap. ""It's turtles-turtles- turtles, all the way!""

Don't be too quick to laugh at this little old lady. All human minds work on fundamentally similar principles. Her universe was a little bit weirder than most but it was built up on the same mental principles as every other universe people have believed in.
As Dr. Leonard Orr has noted, the human mind behaves as if it were divided into two parts, the Thinker and the Prover. The Thinker can think about virtually anything. History shows that it can think the earth is suspended on the backs of infinite turtles or that the Earth is hollow, or that the Earth is floating in space;1 comparative religion and philosophy show that the Thinker can regard itself as mortal, as immortal, as both mortal and immortal (the reincarnation model) or even as nonexistent (Buddhism). It can think itself into living in a Christian universe, a Marxist universe, a scientific-relativistic universe, or a Nazi universe—among many possibilities.

As psychiatrists and psychologists have often observed (much to the chagrin of their medical colleagues), the Thinker can think itself sick, and can even think itself well again.
The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on one law only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.
To cite a notorious example which unleashed incredible horrors earlier in this century, if the Thinker thinks that all Jews are rich, the Prover will prove it. It will find evidence that the 
poorest Jew in the most run-down ghetto has hidden money somewhere. Similarly, Feminists are able to believe that all men, including the starving wretches who live and sleep on the streets, are exploiting all women, including the Queen of England.*

ben97t,Thoughts on Lord of the Flies by William Golding (Spoilers),"\- As always extreme thanks and gratitude to anyone who takes the time to read these musings, and those who also choose to discuss. I really appreciate it as it furthers my own understanding of the book.

&#x200B;

\-This was my first re-read of Lord of the Flies in about 20 years. I read it in middle school, and found much more value in it re-reading freely for pleasure as an adult. The symbolism was not as lost on me, and having lived through each phase of boyhood, understood the characters and what they symbolized with more clarity. I understood the trauma that came with the grotesque. I felt the fear in the uncertain and chaotic, and likewise the hope for imminent rescue. I was able to immerse myself in the jungles with Ralph, Jack, Simon and Piggy, and kudos to Golding for being so vivid in his descriptions of the island. 

&#x200B;

\- The take home messages I received from Lord of the Flies are numerous. We are a product of the environment we are contained in, and can devolve rather quickly if environmental circumstances dictate. Most of the boys transform from civilized English lads to vicious montrosities eager to shed blood of both animal and rival tribesman. It proclaims the dangers of tribalism. It presents the impacts of leadership, and that the masses can adopt the ideologies, right or wrong, of those who rule over them. It reveals a certain synergy between morality and society in that society works when we all agree to a moral code to live by.

&#x200B;

\- The deaths in Lord of the Flies are powerful, and impacted me thoroughly. Everyone talks about Piggy's death, but to me his was the LEAST grotesque. As an aside, Piggy honestly annoyed me throughout the novel. I don't care that he was obese, and felt bad that he had asthma, and that Jack constantly took swings at him. But, from the very start he was whiny, annoying, accusing, fearful, shrill, cowardly, lazy, and a tad racist. I know he represents the intellectual, the reasonable, and the loyal, but I found him quite irritating at times, and even a bit of an asshole. His death did not hit me as hard as I thought it would based on what I had remembered from my first read long ago.

&#x200B;

\-Simon's death was awful. Simon, someone suffering from some type of mental trauma (possibly schizophrenia?), still was a free thinking individual. He alone had the courage to face the ""beast"", and then the morality to try and bring truth to his fellow man. He was absolutely massacred for it, a martyr, the book even implying that our protagonists may have had a hand in it through the ensuing madness. His death was truly tragic. And, though Ralph and Piggy mourned him with regret later on, he seemed quite forgotten by the rest of the island.

&#x200B;

\-Innocence was lost at the sow's death, and this was the most horrific sequence for me. I had trouble stomaching this group of boys taking extreme delight and pleasure butchering a sow giving milk to its young. True they had killed a pig or two prior, but before it seemed purely for survival. The sow's death was something different, something macabre. 

&#x200B;

\-Lastly, I often wonder about what happened to the boys upon rescue. True enough, Ralph remained with a bit of dignity, representing the free-thinking, moral individual. Out of the big'uns, he alone left the island with virtue. But what of Jack? Or the wicked Roger? Or Samneric? What kind of PTSD will they endure, and what kind of mad men will they possibly one day become? Will they ever really be civilized again? Interesting prospects left untold to the imagination.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you to anyone who reads. I do this for my own closure, so this has become quite therapeutic for me, even without much feedback. I will respond as quickly as possible to anyone who would like to discuss!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ben97t/thoughts_on_lord_of_the_flies_by_william_golding/,2019-04-18 16:00:09,13,44,books
v3cgxz,"I spent the last 12 months in a remote wilderness lodge with no internet and cell service, and spent all my time reading. I did a ranking and mini-reviews of the 40ish books I read in that time","EDIT: Damn, wasn't expecting this to blow up! Thanks for all the encouraging words (and awards). Cell data comes and goes here so I'll be checking the thread here and there answering whenever I can. It's really nice to talk about this stuff though because I'm pretty much the only serious reader up here lol

A little background first: In early 2021 my life kind of fell apart very quickly. I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown.

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I really just wanted to isolate myself, lose myself in some good books, and recalibrate my mental state after all the shit that went down. The last 12-13 months have basically just been work, read and hike/camp among the beautiful northern landscapes the lodge was located in.

I managed to read close to 40 books in that timeframe, and I wanted to share my thoughts on them with the sub as reading, more than anything, helped me center myself and get some perspective on my life. I read across a variety of genres and have ranked them with a little mini-review below, from worst to best. I didn't do an overall ranking, but rather ranked the books I read within their specific genres/categories.

**Classics/Literary Fiction:**

8. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: Honestly, this book kind of irritated me in how transparent it was at being shamelessly emotionally manipulative. It was certainly very well-written, but I found Jude just unbelievably stupid as a character and after a certain point in the story, found myself losing any kind of empathy towards him. The rest of the characters are fairly non-descript. The book is kind of morbidly fun to see just how over the top the misery porn can get though, but I hesitate to actually call it “good”

7. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway: I’m starting to think that Hemingway might just not be for me. I’ve read The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises previously, and found them “just okay”. That was my prevailing sentiment towards AFtA as well. I do like Hemingway’s terse, succinct style, but in this one, I felt it actually kind of worked against him because it makes both the war setting and central relationship feel a bit flat. But the worse thing about the book is the character of Catherine. Jesus christ, she is annoying. Just an insipid, silly character. I did like the downbeat, depressing ending though

6. A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this book throughout the first couple hundred pages. It’s dense, slow and filled with a shit ton of what fills like unimportant minutiae. But it eventually comes together, and the slow buildup really manages to create an epic scope and magnitude that are unlike anything else I’ve read from old Charles. It’s a story that demands concentration and attention, and by the final, powerful third act, it’s well worth it.

5. East of Eden by John Steinbeck: An epic, multi-generational family saga, East of Eden is a work that for me works masterfully on both an epic and an personal scale. It’s hard to encompass everything this story does so well in a short review. It’s both a biblical, mythical retelling as well as an intimate character study punctuated with some best-in-class writing. It makes the Salinas Valley into a living, breathing entity of its own, with these macro and micro tales of good and evil spanning its expanse. Also, fuck Cathy Ames. All my homies hate Cathy Ames

4. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: This is my first encounter with Woolf, and it solidified for me that I will be coming back to her body of work multiple times. It was definitely a bit of a struggle getting into it, as you’re jusyt thrown into the deep end with Woolf’s abstract prose and stream of consciousness style. But once you grab hold of what Woolf is trying to do, it becomes a beautifully melancholic story with a pastoral feel that nonetheless manages to really capture a huge gamut of human emotions and perspectives

3. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: Horrifically beautiful. It’s fairly challenging to start, but once you start vibing with McCarthy’s style and writing, the narrative just completely immerses you into it. It’s like a surreal, fever-dream, gruesomely violent vision of the Wild West with gorgeous depictions of the landscape, brilliantly written dialogue and prose that begs to be read over and over, and the most unforgettable villain I’ve come across in literature. This is a novel I can see myself going back to time and time again

2. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I was flip-flopping between this one and Middlemarch as the #1 book in the classics/literature category but it’s very close. This book is, on the surface, “just” a murder-mystery but in actuality is a dense, complex philosophical exploration of various facets of life. This is a masterpiece of character development as we see ideas of free will, morality and family told through multiple different lenses. It’s also a bit of a treatise on religion and the meaning of faith. In short, it’s a *lot* and there’s probably a ton that I didn’t even get in one read-through. Nevertheless, it’s an epic tale that I found both illuminating and entertaining

1. Middlemarch by George Eliot: A wonderful, atmospheric slow burn, and might be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Honestly probably in my top 5 of all time. I found it to be such an all-encompassing look at the things that make us human, and feels both incredibly personal and universal at the same time (kind of like East of Eden). It’s a story about marriage (hit me particularly close to hom) and about sacrifice, with masterfully sketched characters and an exploration of life in era to the minutest details. “Immersive” is a word that gets thrown around a lot for books but that’s what Middlemarch truly is – a totally lived in feeling of a small, nowhere English town a couple of hundred years ago. I found it unforgettable

**Historical Fiction:**

5. Shogun by James Clavell: This is a huge, huge novel, both in its page count, as well as the scope of the story and the characters. Historically speaking, it did seem a little mythologized and perhaps overly romanticizing of the whole samurai/warrior culture, and the main protagonist is a bit of a bland nothing white male fantasy. Clavell’s prose is also merely workmanlike. But as an entertaining story, it fares much better, and is actually very well-paced for something that’s almost 1200 pages.

4. Hawaii by James Michener: This is my first book written by Michener, and I can see why he came to be seen as the godfather of historical fiction. This, like Shogun, is an absolute unit of a book, and although it’s plenty flawed, I came away from it with something close to awe just based on the sheer scope of the timeframe that Michener captures here. the formation of Hawaii in the first chapter is some of the best storytelling I read in the past year. However, this is a book that gets progressively less interesting as it goes and moves into the “present” time, and the characters are little more than pawns. Still recommended though especially if you find Hawaii interesting

3. Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel: Once I figured out that everytime this book uses “he” (which is a LOT), it’s almost always referring to the main character Thomas Cromwell, I started to enjoy it a lot more. It’s really eloquently written and Cromwell is a brilliantly developed character. It’s a story that requires a lot of focus but to me it eventually paid off, and the narrative really carries you along once you get used to Mantel’s idiosyncrasies.

2. I, Claudius by Robert Graves: well-written, funny and hugely informative. Really a slow burn character study of the eponymous Claudius, and the compulsively entertaining look at the back-door dealings and family conflicts of that era in Rome. I thought it also did a pretty great job at exploring the thirst of power and the excesses certain people are willing to go to achieve it. Just a great, multifaceted read overall.

1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry: This book is seriously a contender for one of my top 10 favourites of all time. To begin with, the two main protagonists are just incredibly written and developed, and the attachment you have towards them carries you through to the monumental length of the narrative. It’s an emotionally powerful story with an excellent main plot and smaller side stories that are all great in their own right. Just a truly epic tale told by a master storyteller

**Science Fiction:**

6. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline: I imagine I would have probably liked this book if I was still in high school, crammed as it is full of video game power fantasies and endless pop culture references. But good god, actually reading it as an adult was a painful experience. Other than being a compendium of 80s homages, it fails spectacularly on almost every level. Bad writing, bad characters, tedious, dull storytelling. It’s frankly just awful

5. Foundation by Isaac Asimov: Look, I know this is a foundational (hehe) “canon” text in the sf genre, but I just found it to have too many issues to truly enjoy. The concepts and ideas are great – eye-opening and fascinating – but for me, the book fell flat in almost every other area. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, the writing style is about as wooden as it gets, and the book is very much of its time (i.e. dated af) when it comes to women. Really, this is just a collection of scenes with characters sitting in rooms and talking. Dynamic storytelling it is not, despite the interesting concepts

4. Dune by Frank Herbert: I don’t know if this will be unpopular or not, but I honestly thought Dune was just…ok. I watched and loved the movie, and decided to jump into the book afterwards. While I do appreciate the worldbuilding that went into it – as well as the often weird, surreal 60s drugged-out atmosphere – as a piece of storytelling I feel like Dune has been improved upon over the years. I still respected it as a forerunner of so many different kinds of sff stories we have these days, but taken on its own merits I found it to be interesting but rather turgid on the whole

3. Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: I can’t imagine a more definitive fictional story about Mars than this one. The amount of thoughtful research and extrapolation of science, technology, politics and society that has gone into this novel is simply phenomenal. It honest to god at times reads like an instruction manual for the first Mars colonists, whenever we end up getting there. That does work to the novel’s detriment at times though, as it can feel a bit dry and overly technical at parts. But I still found it to be a grand, immersive read, and the somewhat boring parts were more than compensated for by the overall sweep of the story and the author’s incredible vision of a Martian future for humanity

2. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin: Complex, thoughtful and human. This isn’t the first Le Guin book that will appear on this list either. This book is the best depiction of a realistic utopia I’ve ever seen in fiction, and it does what the best sf does and presents a fascinating “what-if” look at a cool concept. Unlike a lot of sf, it succeeds hugely in two other areas. The first is creating a fully-realized central character – Shevek is an awesome protagonist with a lot of depth and nuance. The second is Le Guin’s inimitable prose, which is elegant and beautiful while still somehow managing to be simple and concise

1.Hyperion by Dan Simmons: This might be the best sf novel I’ve ever read. It’s the rare sf story (imo) that is both excellent from both a literary and “entertainment” perspective. It’s just crammed full of cool ideas and concepts, and I loved the Canterbury Tales-esque structure, which leads to the book’s greatest asset – the characters. I found each “pilgrim” to be fascinating and well-developed, and their respective stories were beautifully told, ranging from thrilling, scary, funny to downright haunting and tragic. The Priest’s Tale and the Scholar’s Tale have both been etched in my mind since I read them. This book is an incredible achievement and to me a high-water mark for the speculative fiction genre

**Horror:**

5. The Troop by Nick Cutter: Not much to say about this one. It’s a pulpy, B-movie-esque story without much in the way of characterization, prose or depth. But it does disgusting body horror better than almost any other horror novel I’ve ever read. Some of the scenes are downright grotesque and repulsive, and I have a high tolerance for that kind of stuff. It’s a quick, easy read and but not particularly memorable outside of the gross-out factor

4. The Elementals by Michael McDowell: A fun, atmospheric and really well written Southern Gothic horror story. This book is akin to Haunting of Hill House in that it deals in subtlety and a sense of creeping doom. It’s a definitely slow burn but that really helps it in building a stifling sense of gloom and dread. The characters are fascinating and it really is very well-written. Highly recommended if you like horror novels focused more on atmosphere than gore/jump scares

3. The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories/The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories by HP Lovecraft: I’m combining these two collections into one as they’re essentially just one big compendium. After reading these, I’ve become a huge Lovecraft fan. I’m aware of his racism and xenophobia but I believe in separating the art from the artist to a certain degree. Anyway, I thought these stories were mostly pretty awesome. I actually love Lovecraft’s verbose, overwrought prose – it really gives the stories a certain level of operatic, melodramatic ambiance. Some of the Dunsany-inspired stories are downright gorgeous. The mythos is fascinating and in the best stories – At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Colour out of Space etc. – he reaches a kind of dark, horrific grandeur. Reading these in the remote northern landscape was truly a fantastic experience

2. The Books of Blood by Clive Barker: Dark, horrific, visceral, erotic – this is an incredible collection of horror short stories. Barker is a hell of a writer – a few levels above most in this genre, and he has a uniquely twisted and dark imagination obsessed with the human body, and in particular, sexuality, and how the body can be a battleground of all sorts of horrors, physical or otherwise. Some of them also have a dreamlike, surreal feel to them. In particular, I was blown away by “In the Hills, the Cities” – it’s a story unlike any I’ve ever read before, mind-boggling, bizarre and haunting. Also of note are “The Midnight Meat Train”, “Rawhide Rex” and “Dread”, but honestly they are all pretty damn great even at their weakest

1.The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson: The amazing show led me to the book, and although the source material is almost completely different other than sharing some names with the characters from the show, it’s an incredible story in its own right. Jackson’s prose is probably the best I’ve come across in this genre, and her ability to create atmosphere and mood is without peer. The setting just feels alive in all its creepy, gothic glory. It’s a fairly small, intimate story but a very powerful, often gut-wrenching one in how it captures the main character’s very human flaws and insecurities. In the end, it leaves us pondering about what’s more terrifying – a seemingly haunted house full of ghosts or the doubts and self-loathing in our own hearts?

**Non-Fiction:**

5. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari: Yeah…I wasn’t really feeling this one. I understand why it’s popular and it did start off very well. But the vast majority of the book is just too full of speculation and the author’s own musings without much in the way of concrete evidence. I also found his mythologizing of hunting and gathering and seeming dislike of the agricultural revolution strange and misguided. The whole book just felt a mile wide and inch deep. Superficial, surface-level exploration without any true insight or in-depth analysis of a complex topic

4. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain: Wow, if ever there was a non-fiction book tailor-made for Reddit, this is it lol. I have to admit, this book did come to me at the perfect time, as I was in a pretty closed-off, solitary mood after making my big move. I liked it well enough, and the insight into analyzing introvert behaviour was fairly interesting. But honestly, for the most part, this book just felt like it was preaching to the choir, about how awesome and helpful introversion is. It tends to conflate a lot of psychological aspects and concepts with a generalized sweep without really delving deep into them. Ultimately, it really feels like a narrative that’s just self-affirmation for introverts. Which I guess is not all bad

3. The Ancestor’s Tale by Richard Dawkins: I’ve always been a huge fan of Dawkins and evolutionary science in general, and this book to me, is his masterwork. It’s painstakingly detailed look at 4 billion years of evolution through certain ancestors that’s structured like the Canterbury Tales. It’s a little different from Dawkins’ other books in that it’s a bit more technical and maybe not as friendly to the layperson – and also missing his trademark snark and cynicism (whether that’s a good thing is up to the read). But it’s incredibly enlightening and informative, and even eye-opening.

2. The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg: If you have any interest in astronomy and cosmology at all, then this book is a must-read. It’s fairly old, written near the end of the 70s, but aside from missing the discovery of dark matter, it’s still very much relevant and probably the best encapsulation of the big bang and the beginning of our universe you can find. It straddles the line perfectly between being appropriate for a casual reader and someone more academic

1. Endurance by Alfred Lansing: Boy did I pick the perfect book to read while living in a cold, remote landscape. Endurance is without a doubt one of the most thrilling, intense stories of survival I’ve ever read. You come away with awe and respect at not only the courage, determination and perseverance of these men, but also at the sheer unfeeling power of nature itself. Some of the events and twists are so crazy that it feels like the contrivances of a Hollywood director – in the best way possible. Lansing captures everything with some truly mind-boggling amount of research from primary sources, and creates an incredibly entertaining – and scary - narrative

**Fantasy:**

6. The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan: This was the only DNF book for me out of my entire list. I had read Eye of the World and The Great Hunt before, and I did a quick summary read-through of those two books to catch me up on the third book. I remember finding the first two books flawed even when reading them as a teenager but tried to give the series another shot. It’s a no go, to be honest. I just can’t over how weirdly juvenile and archaic all the characters and their interactions are. It borders on being cringeworthy and Jordan’s understanding and writing of female characters is just baffling. The plot just seems like more of the same. Bad guy of the week needs to be stopped by motley crew of magically powered teenagers. I’m calling it quits on Wheel of Time for good

5. Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson: I read the first book of Stormlight a few years back and thought it was alright. Have seen rave reviews of WoR and decided to give it a shot and honestly came away really underwhelmed. There are some cool ideas for worldbuilding here but I don’t really find Sanderson to be a good writer at all. Aside from the wooden prose, the characters just come off as shallow, fantasy archetypes and the plot is both convoluted and nonsensical at the same time. Too much time is spent on explaining how powers and magic works – which I also found to be an issue with the first book. I can see the appeal of these books for younger readers as they basically are like spectacle-filled action movies, but they are not for me

4. Red Rising/Golden Sun by Pierce Brown: I read these back to back because they’re fairly quick, easy reads. These are essentially mindless action movies in book form and they were a pretty nice change of pace as I needed something lighter after Wolf Hall. The character is a total Gary Stu, the dialogue is ridiculous and the story is crazy over the top. But yeah, it’s pretty fun, can’t deny that

3. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susannah Clarke: Man, this book might have taken me the longest out of everything I read in the past year, and there were times when I was contemplating dropping it. I’m glad I persevered though because I eventually came to love it. It’s essentially a Victorian novel, written in that era’s style with almost scary accuracy, and a fantasy novel-of-manners. Once you get on its wavelength, you start to appreciate the writing and the beautifully immersive world with some fascinating characters. The footnotes are amazing and the slow burn really helps create a wonderful atmosphere that carries you through to the end

2. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin: Man, Le Guin is on her way to becoming one of my favourite authors. This little book is beautiful and punches far above its weight in terms of ratio of size to content. It’s a small little thing, especially compared to a lot of the bloated doorstoppers common to the genre but for me, it contained more emotion and wisdom than 10 Jordans or Sandersons. Written in Le Guin’s clear yet elegant prose, it has a fairy-tale-esque melancholy atmosphere, as if it’s a story you’re being told in front of a fireplace by your grandfather or something. It’s a story of self-discovery and learning to accept the dark parts of yourself, all brilliantly written. Will be continuing with the rest of the series eventually

1. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe: Preface – I only read Shadow and Claw so far but holy shit. What a book. Mysterious, mystical, weird, beautiful and often frustrating – BotNS is unlike any fantasy I’ve ever read. It probably has the most gorgeous prose I’ve ever come across in the genre, and the usage of allegory and metaphor was really well done. The strange, dreamlike, almost surreal ambiance is what really stood out to me, and despite the obfuscations of the plot and the language, this still makes the book easy to get lost in

That’s it for my reviews/analysis! Let me know what you guys think of these books. I’m in the process of going through another batch of stories and may post another review thread in a year or so lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v3cgxz/i_spent_the_last_12_months_in_a_remote_wilderness/,2022-06-02 16:14:23,668,12845,books
10o3o6j,"Finished the first four Earthsea books, and I have been storing an emotional ramble inside (super long post, sorry!)","This might be the most disorganized post ever, but I am blown away by the Earthsea books. I made a post a bit ago on here talking about how much I love the first book, and at the time I had never read anything of the series but that. A few comments told me I was in for a treat and that was so true. I knew I was, but wow. I have become so attached to these characters, and I have processed things going on in my personal life through these stories, and I just can't believe it. I know I have more to read in Earthsea ahead of me, but I loved those 4 books so much that they make me want to just start them all over again. I had some quotes that I have nowhere to put that I wanted to share and talk about, and maybe someone else on here wants to yell at me about Earthsea too. :) 

Also general warning for spoilers! 

I've decided to spare this post the super long quotes that are stuck in my head, but I think about Tenar in Tombs of Atuan a lot, when she weeps for her years wasted serving a useless evil. She weeps because she is free.  But before that, I was loving the book, although I will admit I was also waiting for Ged to show up. Once he did I was even happier. And Tenar and Ged together is just so interesting. The dialogue in Earthsea is so interesting, I just want more and more of it when I read it. Once they're out of the tombs, this might be the thing I thought about most after finishing the book. 

""She watched him, and never could she have said what was in her heart as she watched him, in the firelight, in the mountain dusk.""

I suppose in hindsight it's maybe a bit obvious that that's romantic, but at the time I wasn't sure. Either way I loved their bond and I love both of their characters. 

I really didn't expect The Farthest Shore to be so bleak, but I still really enjoyed it. Only a few pages in I was already so invested in the relationship Ged and Lebannen, which is amazing to me that she can make me love her characters so quickly. 

""...and he pushed Arren lightly between the shoulder blades, a familiarity no one had ever taken before, and which the young prince would have resented from anyone else; but he felt the Archmage's touch as a thrill of glory. For Arren had fallen in love."" 

As soon as I read that I was immediately in. I loved this book. I didn't expect the themes about immortality and consumerism and I enjoyed how she wrote about that, I found some moments a lot spookier than the last two books had been, especially the ending. I was a little sad to hear of Ged being cooped up as an Archmage, and was delighted that apparently that was also how he felt about it. I liked Lebannen's perspective in his youth and not knowing exactly what he should do. And when he starts to distrust Ged a little bit, with the despair. And I keep mentally returning to Ged telling Lebannen that he will not hear the despair, he is not aware of it because he simply refuses to cater to despair. I have a lot of despair in my daily life and this has legitimately helped me process it: 

""That selfhood which is our torment, and our treasure, and our humanity, does not endure. It changes; it is gone, a wave on the sea. Would you have the sea grow still and the tides cease, to save one wave, to save yourself? Would you give up the craft of your hands, and the passion of your heart, and the light of sunrise and sunset, to buy safety for yourself, safety forever? ... That is the message that those who know how to hear have heard: by denying life you may deny death and life forever."" 

After Ged and Lebannen bonding so much it was difficult to read them being in death and being so dry and far away from life. I kept worrying once they returned to life that Ged would die and I feel like if Ursula was a more stereotypical writer he would've just died (and so would I, I have become unreasonably attached to this fictional wizard.) When the Doorkeeper said ""He has done with doing. He goes home."" I had a lot of ideas that were basically all wrong, and all based on trying to force Ged to retain his power and fame and previous life, somehow.

As a result, Tehanu blew me away. 

I loved getting back to Tenar, and I love how she has grown. Questioning her life and her responsibilities and the power of women. Her relationship with Therru is amazing.

""... You have scars, ugly scars, because an ugly, evil thing was done to you. People see the scars. But they see you, too, and you aren't the scars. You aren't ugly. You aren't evil. You are Therru, and beautiful. You are Therru who can work, and walk, and run, and dance, beautifully, in a red dress"" 

""She had done right to make the dress, and she had spoken the truth to the child. But it was not enough, the right and the truth. There was a gap, a void, a gulf, on beyond the right and the truth. Love, her love for Therru and Therru's for her, made a bridge across that gap, a bridge of spiderweb, but love did not fill or close it. Nothing did that. And the child knew it better than she.""

""Wrong that cannot be repaired must be transcended.""

I enjoyed her wondering how men would know what a man is, if they have never been around women. It was like Tombs again, I was very happy with Tenar, but I love them together, so I was even happier when Ged arrived. I was very sad about his shame and despair though. I worried he was permanently empty, and I suppose this is mentioned as a possibility from Moss in the book too, that perhaps without his power he is a husk. I have been coping with my life with these books and Ged being that way honestly made me really sad, even after I put the book down for the day. I hated him running away, and I hated Tenar going through the curse and trying to raise Therru with almost no help.

And somehow, in something like the span of four pages, Ursula turned this very beautiful but heart wrenching book into one of the most comforting things I've ever read. Don't get me wrong, I loved the entire book, but I was still sad the old Ged was gone. ""Why does Hawk the Goatherd weep for Ged the Archmage?"" I guess I needed the time to understand it, just like he did. That the power was never going to give him what he gained there with Tenar. I remember in the previous book Ged saying that maybe he will learn what he was never able to learn once they are finished with the journey and I wondered what he meant. I didn't expect the answer to be so simple and wonderful. 

""They lay that night on the hearthstones, and there she taught Ged the mystery that the wisest man could not teach him.""

I love their affection, there might not be more for me to say about it beyond that. It is so beautiful to me after getting to know their characters so well. The ending freaked me out with all the creepy wizardry but Therru being named by Kalessin and all deciding to stay in Ogion's house is just perfect. I don't know how she writes so simply but so perfectly, and it strikes me so deeply, emotionally. I feel like I will be returning to these characters for grounding and comfort for a long time. Now, this post is much too long, very sorry! 

On a joking note, I find it very funny that Ged has just been casting spells and flying around and in his boat for 50 years before he has sex and once he does he's like you know what, this is pretty cool, actually.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10o3o6j/finished_the_first_four_earthsea_books_and_i_have/,2023-01-29 09:19:37,28,291,books

orexln,"""The Sultan of Monte Cristo"" (by Holy Ghost Writer) 2013. Alleged sequel to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" [SPOILERS]","This is the funniest Monte Cristo-related thing ever! When viewed as a parody/satire, it works! The author ""Holy Ghost Writer"" has created a sequel, and it's pretty loopy and a fun read...at least the first half is. The Count and his new wife, Haydee are headed to Albania, when they somehow get sidetracked in capturing a notorious pirate, Medusalocks (""Captain Dread"" already taken by the ""Monkey Island"" video game?) and Haydee admits to being a secret Muslim all along (What? As if he never noticed, especially during Ramadan?) The Count immediately converts to Islam, as he had a convenient shipboard imam with them (? For Ali, right?).

In the meantime, Mercedes discovers a long-lost letter from Dantes' father, revealing his secret origins. In true DaVinci-Code fashion, >!the letter says that Edmond Dantes is a descendant of Mary Magdelene and the Merovingian dynasty(!)!<. Mercedes, her love for Edmond reawoken, stops her all-day praying and weeping and gets her mojo back. She grows hemp, and sees a huge business opportunity in hemp-based lotions, soap, milk and cheese. (That's funny- where did all this entrepreneurial spirit come from? She had NONE in the original book!) She visits the Morrels (in Paris) to start a business partnership with them. And to relay a message to the Count (Please see me! Important letter from your Dad!).

The Count, after reconciling the Bible and the Koran, decides to return to Paris to forgive Villefort. Villefort is staying at the new ""Monte Cristo Insane Asylum at Auteuil"". The Count (in a new disguise) gives Villefort medication to heal his mind, and recommends the excellent biography, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"" (lol) that will explain everything. Oh, and Madame Danglars will be around soon to help. He also informs Villefort that Valentine is alive, and he will arrange a meeting with her.

Countess G throws a huge ball, and the Count and Mercedes attend. Now that he's a Muslim, the Count can have more than one wife, so he asks Mercedes to marry him, with Haydee's pre-approval. She agrees, on the condition that she gets an exclusive monopoly on hemp in Albania because, after all, she needs financial security, right?

The book switches gears and heads off to somewhere in Arabia, where a spunky Bedouin girl named Raymee informs her father Abram that she refuses a marriage to the Caliph of Mecca... a marriage contract assisted by an ugly merchant named... Danglars.

When Danglars and the Caliph's advisor Dr. Omar arrive at the family's oasis, Raymee's outspokenness and surprisingly modern views embarrass the men. Abram accepts gifts from Danglars, including, you guessed it... a copy of the famous book, ""*The Count of Monte Cristo*"" by ""investigative reporter Alexandre Dumas"". She scampers off, hides and listens in while the men discuss the terms of marriage contract- she's being engaged against her will! Abram agrees to a reverse-dowry... somehow the Caliph is supposed to *pay him*!!!

A servant announces that Sultan Sinbad of Albania (the Count) is spotted heading for Mecca, and they be passing by. Sultan Sinbad stops at the oasis and enjoys Abram's hospitality. He's also quite taken with Raymee. The next morning, Abram, Raymee, her cousin Mumad accompany Sultan Sinbad and his caravan to Mecca, with a stop at Shechem (as the Count's inner voice told him to do).

The caravan is attacked by bandits, and with a combination of bluffing and a poison dart, the bandit leader is killed and the bandits run off. >!Abram throws a big celebration feast and Raymee seduces Sultan Sinbad later at night. Her true intent is revealed... she wants to conceive a son who'll become the ruler of Arabia, being that the Caliph has only daughters!!<

>!The rest of the trip to Mecca goes without a hitch. Raymee tricks Mumad into agreeing to make an unknown sacrifice for her. The entourage (with Raymee) performs ""Hamlet"" for the Caliph. The Caliph is totally captivated, and Raymee negotiates her own bride price on her own terms, which he agrees to. With the deal concluded, she announces that Mumad will become her personal eunuch... the operation to be performed right there- onstage(!!!) Dr. Omar whispers to the Caliph, doubting her virginity, and for that, Dr. Omar is condemned to the same fate- Raymee's second personal eunuch.!<

>!Sultan Sinbad is shocked by the proceedings. During the marriage feast, he asks her about it and she explains that she had learned lessons from reading his biography... she would not let Mumad become her ""Fernand"". She's become cold and calculating and wants power through fear to control the people under her. !<Sultan Sinbad warns her of the lesson that he had personally learned- that revenge will backfire on her someday.

The End.

Now obviously, a lot of things are unresolved. what about Haydee and Mercedes? What about the hemp partnership with the Morrels? What about Villefort? Does he regain his senses and embrace Valentine again? Will any of them help save Benedetto? How's the hemp biz in Albania doing? This is not the last of the Monte Cristo books by ""Holy Ghost Writer""... there's more for sale at you-know-where's Kindle store... ""One must make a living"", as Bertuccio says.

I enjoyed the first half WAY more than the second. I was doubled-over laughing during Part 1. The tone completely changed in Part 2. ""Where is this leading... how does the Count come into this?"" I wondered. He does come in and he is played for a dupe. >!But, I guess the son that he had conceived with Raymee will go on the become a powerful ruler- a scion of 2 major houses- the house of the Magdelene/Merovingians and the House of Ishmael.!<

I'll give this a generous 3 stars for the first half, the laughs and the sheer entertainment value. The second half gets an eye-roll.

And, BTW, who is that ugly old man on the cover? Surely it's not the Count, who should be in his early 40s? Is it a statue of a Saint in Paris? Is that Abram, the father of Raymee? Or is it a random piece of clip-art to fill the need to have cover art of any kind?

yj7kgf,Review for The Rose and the Dagger by Renée Ahdieh,"Having enjoyed The Wrath and the Dawn, I have to say that this was a letdown. I still like Renée's writing style, and I still enjoy her worldbuilding for the most part, but there was something left to be desired with a lot of this sequel. The Rose and the Dagger takes place two weeks after The Wrath and the Dawn leaves off. Khalid is dealing with the restoration of Rey after Sharhzad's dad, Jahandar, destroyed it. Shazi is now living in a Badawi tribe encampment with her past lover, Tariq, who wants to wage war on her current lover, Khalid.  


The love triangle is an exhausted trope. I hate reading about a woman whining over who they will choose. Thankfully, this novel doesn't have that particular nuisance; instead, it just has Tariq annoying the shit out of everyone by not getting the hint. It's very Jacob Black of him to be physically unable to realize that he's not the one. Every time he touched Shazi without her consent was uncomfortable as fuck. And I'm annoyed that it looks like he's going to get the super babe, Yasmine, who is now a sultana. He doesn't deserve that superior of a woman.   


I wasn't nearly as invested in Khalid and Shazi's relationship in this as I was in the TWATD. As I stated in the last book, the only real reason I even shipped them was that their scenes together were so good. But I can't forget the fact that Khalid essentially raped Shazi. I understand that this is a historical fantasy, and it's common for men and women to have sex the night of the wedding(especially in arranged royal marriages and of course, it usually sucked for the women) but what makes this all the more awful is that Khalid never slept with any of his other wives before. Something about Shazi made him decide to climb into her bed not once but twice. Like....ew? Khalid, why? I'm not fond of it at all.   


I was far more invested in Irsa and Rahim's romance, only to have Rahim die!! I teared up reading Irsa learning of his death. But I feel like we were cheated out of a potentially meaningful conversation between Irsa and Shazi when the latter learns of Rahim's death. Instead, we see what Shazi feels through Khalid's eyes, and it feels like we were cheated. The previous book had a lot of excellent conversations between women, and this book feels like it backtracked on that. We also miss out on the exchange where Despina and Yasmine reveal their treachery to their father. That could've been some PRIME DRAMA.   


Magic takes a more prevalent role in this book, but it still felt lacking to me. When they broke the curse, it was super underwhelming. It felt like nothing happened afterwards aside from Khalid taking a nap. No relief that he no longer has to worry. No sharing in joy with anyone about being free of this curse. Nothing. It just ends, and then we move on to Shazi getting kidnapped. Again, felt like we were cheated out of some critical character development.   


I would've liked to know more about Artan and his family.   


I'm super confused about Despina and her deception?? Despina in this whole book confused the shit out of me. So...she tells Khalid she wants to marry Vikram, aka the Rajput, after he asks for her hand, right? But then she and Vikram both show up in Parthia after it's revealed Despina is the Sultan's daughter. So for like two chapters, we think she's a traitor, but then it turns out she gave Vikram a map of the dungeons and decided to lead Shazi to safety...but okay, so here's my question. Did she know that Shazi was going to be taken to Parthia? Did she plan this with Vikram in advance? Why if Vikram wanted to marry Despina and Despina claimed she wanted to marry Vikram did she lie about the baby being Jalal's, and why did she get with Jalal the second she saw him? None of this is EVER explained, and it's super frustrating because I don't know what's happening now with Vikram. Like the absolute fuck???   


Also, now that Despina and Jalal are back together, does that mean Khalid and Jalal made up?  


I hated Jahandar in this book with a passion. He was so pathetic to me. Like he kills his daughter's husband, and all he can think about is how no one is paying attention to him. SO then he resurrects him and gives his life in the process...and like, was he doing that just finally to get some recognition? Also like, we don't even get to see him die or see his daughter's reactions to it! He dies, and then it's time for the epilogue. Like wtf? Also, I HATE the trope of resurrecting love interests like it loses all gravitas when you do that shit. It is also a massive slap to Irsa that she loses her love, but her sister gets hers magically resurrected. And Khalid deserved to die. Rahim didn't.   


Also, shouldn't Khalid be dead by now anyway? I don't think anybody can survive months of not sleeping. HE would be out of his mind by now, if anything.   


I also can't believe there was hardly any reaction over killing Shiva's dad when this whole thing started to avenge Shiva. Like....just yeah. I wasn't thrilled with this conclusion, sadly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yj7kgf/review_for_the_rose_and_the_dagger_by_renée_ahdieh/,2022-11-01 12:35:36,2,5,books
w4xch,"Just finished Ken Kesey's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and am blown away. ","I thought it was going to be one of those rare books that was not as good as the movie, being that the movie was so good. Man was I wrong. First off is the fact that the book is told through the perspective of Chief Bromden, which is fascinating. Through him we learn about ""the Combine"", which is what he calls the combination in his mind of authoritative figures that control people through the use of subtleties. The combine is personified in Nurse Ratched mainly, and the people that dammed the Columbia river, where he lived as a child. The idea of the Combine is basically just an expansion of the books main theme of oppression through subtleness and coerciveness. It allows the theme to be explored to a level untouched by the movie. What impressed me the most about the book though, was the beautiful imagery and how well the mood translated to me. Kesey has some incredibly vivid imagery for a book that almost all takes place in a completely white building. When McMurphy takes the guys on a fishing trip and they're all happy and not having to deal with Nurse Ratched I just felt incredibly free and happy. This passage in particular stood out: 

   ""I notice Harding is collapsed beside McMurphy and is laughing too. And Scanlon from the bottom of the boat. At their own selves as well as the rest of us. And the girl, with her eyes still smarting as she looksfrom her white breast to her red one, she starts laughing. And Sefelt and the doctor, and all. 
   It started slow and pumped itself full, swelling the men bigger and bigger. I watched, part of them, laughing with them-and somehow notwith them. I was off the boat, blown up off the water and skating the wind with those black birds, high above myself, and I could look downand see myself and the rest of the guys, see the boat rocking there in the middle of those dividing birds, see McMurphy surrounded by his dozen people, and watch them, us, swinging a laughter that rang out on the water in ever-widening circles, farther and farther, until it crashed up on the beaches all over the coast, on the beaches all over all coasts, in wave after wave after wave.""

I remember grinning like a fucking idiot while I read that. The imagery of the laughter circling out and crashing with the waves is beautiful to me. Although the story's ending was tragic becuase of [Spoiler](/s ""our hero McMurphy's lobotomy"") I finished the book feeling triumphant and glad for how he inspired the guys and gave them confidence. 

Sorry for the inarticulate ramblings. I just really wanted to get all of this down and thought this would be a good place to do it. Thanks for listening r/books!

11lw818,The Sun and its Shade by Piper CJ (Rant Review),"0 Stars.

*thank you to NetGalley for the ARC copy*  


**THERE ARE SPOILERS FOR THE END OF THIS BOOK IN THIS REVIEW**  


**the writing**  
I know this is an ARC, so hopefully, these errors will be fixed by the time it's published, but there were a lot of punctuation marks and typos that needed to be corrected. Multiple instances of missing quotation marks when the chapter is starting with dialogue. The prose is just as overwritten as usual. Piper uses 97 words when she could use 5. It comes off just as pretentious and melodramatic as it did in the last book. Everything is so over the top that I constantly rolled my eyes. She misuses words all the time and has ridiculous metaphors that you have to reread 2 or 3 times just to make sense of. Basically, everything is as convoluted as it possible could be. Maybe some of ya’ll like this, but objectively this is not good writing. Sorry, not sorry.   


**plot/characters**  
So at the end of book one, Amaris and Gadriel escape from a battle arena on the back of a dragon, HP style and then jump off its back and conveniently land right next to this magic academy. The book ends, and one would assume that the sequel will lead to Amaris going to the academy and learning to hone her magic. If you thought that, then you would be WRONG.   


So we start exactly where we left off with little to no recapping of what happened in the last book. You're expected to remember, but it's hard considering how many unnecessary words are jammed between what little plot is actually in these books. They get taken to the magic school, and everyone thinks Gadriel is a demon, and they want to cage and study him. In some supremely dramatic and ridiculous monologuing, Amaris convinces the masters of the school that he's harmless. Amaris convinces herself Gadriel(now Gad) is her new best friend, but when Gadriel says, 'we fought together in Aubade' in response to being asked ', what does this woman mean to you?' she loses her MIND. She gets so assblasted mad because she thought they were friends, but APPARENTLY NOT. It's pathetic and ridiculous, and like Amaris is so naive and has no idea how the real world works at all. She cannot conceive why Gadriel won't share secrets he was sworn to keep with her even after he explains it could mean his life. Like how is Amaris supposed to be likeable lol?? Because Gadriel said they weren’t friends, and Amaris took that shit personally. Then he blames her for his shredded wings, and as usual, Amaris can’t take responsibility, much like her author counterpart. And this becomes a recurring thing in the book. Amaris stays butthurt nearly 500 pages in all because Gadriel said that she was ‘someone he fought together with’. Literally the entire book is them hot and cold with one another and it's exhausting. Neither of them are likable at all.   


They look at some books at the academy for two seconds, find zero answers and guess that this tower of magic has everything they need. And conveniently, *it does*. They climb 10,000 steps and find the hall of prophecies from the order of the phoenix (you know, the room full of shelves with glowing blue orbs well, this room also has shelves with glowing blue orbs, but the shelves are spiral-shaped, so it’s not plagiarism, guys.) otherwise known as the hall of orbs, and Amaris realizes the floor is invisible and there's an illusion cast over it. Gadriel goes to step over it, and instead of warning him like a normal person, Amaris screams wordlessly. That's it. Then she starts berating him for not paying attention to his surroundings, even though she should know by now that she can see illusions, but Amaris is too stupid to figure this out. After all, she's been aware of her powers for three years and only just started questioning their limitations and capabilities. She is literally an idiot. Gadriel asks Amaris if he can make the jump. She reads WAY too much into this question and thinks, ""oh my god, Gadriel is putting his LIFE in my HANDS. He TRUSTS me."" And I'm like...bitch; you're the only one who can see the distance. Are you for real rn? Anyway, he makes the jump, and Amaris cries in relief. Literally cries. Imagine if Indiana Jones cried in relief every time he solved a booby trap puzzle while searching tombs. He would look like an idiot. Amaris has a full-blown panic attack, considers leaving and becoming a seamstress and then jumps, doesn't make it, and almost dies, and then Gadriel saves her. They touch some magical glowing blue balls, get sucked into a pensieve(I mean orb), and see some curses/blessings where faeries explode into golden dust. They meet the oldest man ever, who happens to show them the exact thing they needed to see, then get tossed from the Tardis Tower. (it’s bigger on the inside)  


Gadriel gets some conveniently 'manufactured' wings and can now fly again(literally has no lasting ill effects of having his wings literally shredded), and then they realize they've learned everything they needed to know and leave. (WHAT? YOU HAVE LEARNED LITERALLY NOTHING) They try to convince Amaris to stay, and she pretends like she's going to and then leaves at night, but it's the most dramatic thing ever. She tries to write it like it's something worthy of ballads, but there is no good reason why it would be. They didn't even *do* anything there. And that's it. That's all that happens with Amaris' magical boarding school plot, and that's when I realized how much of a waste of time this bullshit book is. You had a whole ass magical boarding school, and you didn't use it at all?? You could've had Amaris attend school, actually learn some things since she is the biggest idiot ever and then solve a whole mystery of how the school is corrupt and experimenting on people with unique magic while also searching for the answers to the curse. But no, Amaris learns about her powers in a different way, and WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT.   


There’s a line I want to point out that I found hilariously ironic, and Piper(and Amaris) should take her own fucking advice. *” Ignorance is no one’s fault, but once you’re made aware of your lack, the choice to remain oblivious is when you become culpable.”* So, if this is true, then why didn’t Amaris take advantage of the magic school so that she could not be ignorant about her abilities? Why does she continue to be ignorant of how she speaks with Gadriel by calling him terms she knows are offensive and racist? If this is true, why wouldn’t Piper fix what people have pointed in her book out as being racist, ableist and plagiarized. Why wouldn’t she do the work so she can not be an ignoramus? Hmmmm...  


Now, the way that Amaris chooses to learn to wield her power is she ‘verbally consents’ to allow Gadriel to help train her. This book has a warning for consensual breathplay, but once again, Piper is full of shit and a liar. Saying, “yes, I would like you to train me to use my magic”, does not equate to “I consent to you strangling me in my sleep.” Yep, you read that right. Gadriel waits until Amaris is deep asleep, stands over her in a position that will ensure she can’t fight him off and strangles her until she explodes with sonic power(much like Ciri's power from the show....god, the plagiarism just will not stop.) And when she gets upset, he berates her for not using their safe word (snowbird). Tell me, how the fuck was she going to use a safe bird when you are cutting off her airway? How is she going to speak, let alone breathe? He says that he’s doing what any general would do for his troops, but in what fucking universe does a general strangle their troops in their sleep? This is not consensual breathplay, Piper, and if you think it is, then you need to reevaluate yourself and look up the definition of the word consent.   


Now on to Nox. Nox has been honestly just as irrelevant in this book as she was in the last book. She’s hanging out with Malik and Ash and has become a sudden Yes Man, and after literally a week hanging out with them, she decides she loves Malik. Are you fucking kidding me? This honestly makes me mad because Nox was coded as a lesbian. I don’t give a fuck if Piper says she’s bisexual. She wrote about her being repulsed by men, preferring women’s company. She literally says she doesn’t like men and prefers women, but because Piper really wanted to write some hetero smut, she forced her to be bisexual? Stupid af. Not to mention her obsession with Amaris. Has she suddenly forgotten about that all because one guy was nice to her? That’s pathetic. Stand your fuckin ground, Nox. Having her fall for Malik in this is a bad call because it nullifies the fact that she fought her way free from having to fuck men against her will just to get to the woman she loves, only to immediately fall for a guy for literally no reason. Malik doesn’t do anything to deserve being called ‘pure’ because he is literally no better than a sexy lamp at this point. If she had taken the time to actually cultivate a relationship here where Nox slowly learns to trust Malik, that would be a completely different story. But Piper was too eager to jump in and write smut.   


I also think it’s a strange choice to make your ‘dark fae’(which, according to Gadriel, is a racist term that has been used very freely throughout the entire book) have their powers associated with ‘nightlife’ and then make them all dubious POC. She even made their country's flag ‘bronze for the skin of its people’. That is a supremely weird thing to do. Nox literally says she is good at being sneaky because of her dark fae blood, which is also what makes her ‘bronze’. Gadriel, who is also dubiously brown, is good at picking locks. Like…Piper….what the fuck are you doing???? Stop being RACIST!!!???  


Everything that happens in this book is pure convenience. Nox and Amaris constantly stumble upon the answers. There is no motivation; there is no urgency. Nox dallies most of the time at the Duke of Henares' house, eating a malum malus she got from the tree of life(which is called Yggdrasil because Piper can't make up original concepts, apparently, and has to steal from everything else). She sees the tree’s memories and watches this princess pray to the All-Mother for protection for her *son*. Then we find out that the priestess, who is only ever referred to as the Tarkhany woman with ‘onyx skin’, was blessed by the All Mother with immaculate conception and guess who the baby was? You guessed it. Amaris. The super white snowflake was immaculately conceived by a woman with very dark skin(because Piper has a really weird obsession with the contrast of dark and light skin, I guess). This is what they say to the nameless priestess(who actually dies earlier in this book in a very throwaway scene) when she asks if she gets to raise the child she just birthed. *”The child belongs to everyone and no one, beloved….This babe is the manifestation o the prayers of the faithful.”* So not only is Amaris literally the purest PERFECT SNOWFLAKE ON EARTH BECAUSE SHE IS A MANIFESTATION OF A PRAYER(in other words, Jesus), but a nameless black woman was used and killed off for no other purpose than to be her vessel.   


We later discover that Nox's pen pal from the Chamber of Secrets, aka Tom Riddle, was actually the Gray Matron all along! She gets Nox to travel *all* the way back to the orphanage and tells her the truth(even though she had a literal magic quill she could've used to save everyone some time). Ya'll are gonna love this. Turns out that Princess Daphne, Queen Moirai's daughter, had a child with King Ceres from Raascot(the dark fae king dude). Daphne was apparently already married, and so to hide her child from this nameless husband, she goes to this CHILD MILL, leaves her daughter there and asks for a baby(specifically a boy) with similar coloring to her baby's. Then she leaves Nox there with the Grey Matron and brings the boy back with her and the boy immediately gets murdered because the nameless husband knows it's not his. This has left me with so many questions.  


a) how did the orphanage/child mill have a baby of Nox's exact coloring when in TNAIM, we're told that Nox is a novelty and people of her complexion are never sold at the orphanage? She is literally put on display as a trophy *because*of her skin tone. So how did they manage to have a baby to exchange conveniently? (also, wow, way to callously kill some nameless child, Piper.)   
b) how did no one realize Daphne had a baby girl? were there no midwives when she gave birth? this is medieval times; I highly doubt she gave birth alone because there's a huge chance of her dying. So how is it not a single soul outside of the nameless priestess and Agnes knew that Daphne actually had a girl? When Daphne went to the temple to pray for help, she asks for help specifically for her *son*. Why would she ask for help for a son she does not have? I know Piper was trying to trick us or whatever, but...that's just bad writing? Do you think the All-Mother is gonna realize you're actually talking about your hidden daughter, Daphne?   
c)why, if Agnes never intended for Nox to be sold, did she allow Millicent to take her to the brothel? She says she didn't know how to deny her without spilling the beans, so she just....lets Nox be taken? In what world does that make sense? If she's supposed to protect Nox why did she let Nox think it was Amaris who needed to be protected? Why would she allow Nox to put herself in harm's way to protect Amaris? Why would she allow Nox to be whipped? Why would they constantly talk about Amaris being perfect and unmarred if it was truly Nox who was the important one and they knew it all along? None of this makes sense.   


Nox was named Nox, so she wouldn't forget the north. Fucking kill me. Well, she clearly knew nothing about it, so.   


Amaris tells Gadriel that she got turned on when he choked her nonconsensually, so then he chokes her consensually(even though she freaked out when he choked her and this could easily trigger her into another panic attack, but okay.). She blows him, and he finger bangs her while choking her but won't take her virginity because it should be gentler the first time. First of all, you cannot tell me that Amaris still has her 'maidenhood' when she's been riding horses all this time. Piper doesn't know shit about horseback riding, though, and that's obvious. Second of all, I am convinced Piper has a secret incest kink. Why do you ask?   


Well, Nox and Amaris were written as sisters, but now they're apparently star-crossed lovers? (yet they're boning random men along their journey to find one another. Makes sense.) Nox and Amaris are actually 100% based on Yennefer and Ciri from the Witcher, which is a mother/daughter relationship(Piper can say this book has nothing to do with the Witcher all she likes, she literally dedicated to this book to Henry Cavill as Geralt. We're not idiots.). Amaris calls her fellow reevers her 'brothers' and then tries to fuck one of them. And now she has a daddy kink with Gadriel(proven by the fact that Piper continuously calls him Dadriel.)   


Don’t give your money to Piper CJ.   


currently reading  


This is what happens when you write a book in 9 days and don’t accept constructive criticism. You get sentences like this.   


“She knew she was about to watch the head of a man as it was gnawed from where it connected to his shoulders.”  


The whole book is like this. How did this pass the beta reading process?? This is not ready for publication.

6au7ta,Jane Austen and the alt-right phenomenon,"This year, on the 18th of June, there will be two centuries since the death of Jane Austen. The reasons of her death are still unknown – different studies on the subjects shows that it was caused by Addison's disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma or even poisoning (as suggested by Lindsay Ashford). Ms. Ashford said that it happened not because she was poisoned by someone, but because arsenic (toxical agent) was used to cure different diseases in that time, including Rheumatism (Jane suffered from it in the last years of her life). 

The epitaph composed by her brother Henry praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the ""extraordinary endowments of her mind"", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer. It happened partly because of her family. Her biography “A Memoir of Jane Austen” which was written by her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh in 1870 was trying to depict her as a content housewife and it hid many details of her life – for example, depression and anxiety. It also happened because Jane Austen wasn’t very successful as a writer in her lifetime. Three of her novels – “Pride and Prejudice”, “Emma” and “Sense and Sensibility” were relatively acclaimed by critics and higher class enjoyed reading them, but “Mansfield Park” wasn’t published for the second time and the rest of her books were published only posthumously due to economical state of her family.

Two centuries later she is known all over the world. This summer there will be many different events dedicated to her life and legacy (you can find a complete list here – janeausten200.co.uk). They are supported by the community of her admirers called “janeite”. Her face is to appear on £10 notes and £2 coins.

Austen´s books are admired by everyone – from sentimentalists to cynics, from communists to capitalists, from teenagers to seniors. One of the newest admirers are alt-rights, political movement of libertarians and conservatives. Milo Yiannopoulos quoted her at the University of Colorado. Andrew Anglin and Matt Forney did it in their blogs. American academic journal “The Chronicle of Higher Education” published an article by prof. Nicole Wright on that. Despite Ms. Nicole putting “The Fountainhead” and “nationalism” in one sentence she has some interesting thoughts. She writes that nowadays many people recognize Jane Austen as an example of white nationalism. She writes “By comparing their movement not to the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels, but instead to the cozy England of Austen — a much-beloved author with a centuries-long fandom and an unebbing academic following — the alt-right normalizes itself in the eyes of ordinary people”.

Devoney Looser, a professor of English at Arizona State University, also offers an interesting point of view on the subject. “Conservatives and progressives have been fighting over how to read Austen's fiction for a century and a half” she says. ""Suffragettes were marching through the streets of London in support of women's rights, carrying a Jane Austen banner, and at the same time elite men in private clubs were arguing that her genius was in her describing a limited world that celebrated women's confinement to the domestic sphere. That's quite a political contrast”.
Maria Casa, editorial manager of Penguin Classics sums the debate up “Her style and characters are influencing the modern women. They are strong, independent and always reach the man of their dreams”.

hdomi0,"SPOILERS : Just finished ""The Fall"" by Albert Camus, here are my thoughts.","Book : The Fall  
Author: Albert Camus   
Translator: Robin Buss  
(Page numbers with respect to the Penguin Classics Edition 2013)

**Day 1**

Well, I must say, this is a weird read. At first I did not understand what was happening, but then, I could see how the story is structured. The protagonist of the story, *Jean-Baptiste Clamence*, is having a conversation with a stranger he meets at a bar, and it's just one side of the conversation that we hear, that of the protagonist.  
The protagonist is weird, he kind of feels like an absent-minded guy, who claims to have born knowing how to live, a typical ignorant arse who just lives ""day to day"". But there are moments which reveal he has been through or is going through an existential crisis, the world or the self he thinks he knows is not quite the case. There are moments where he says stuff that hits something in you. I feel I can see through him, and at the same time on moments I feel I am being seen through. So yea, it is weird.

I found a sweet word today while reading, *reverie*, it means, daydream. There are a few bits that I have bookmarked and those I would like to expand upon here. There is a reference to the tiny mob fishes who eat you down to the bones in a few moments, in context with life which eats you down to the bones with the job, responsibility, family and shit.

The protagonist talks a good deal about death, at times fascinating, and at times naive. Around Page 21-22-23, he talks about how death awakens feeling in you, how you find it easy to love the friends who are dead, because they leave us free, they leave us with no obligations, so tribute or good words come easy, words which they probably waited all their lives to hear

>""No, what we like in our friends is fresh death, painful death, our own feelings, in short ourselves!""  
""They were sleeping through their little lives and then….""  
""They need tragedy; after all, it's their little moment of transcendence, their aperitif.""

The protagonist further talks about death at page 42, where he wishes to abandon a lady - on which he spent a great deal- in form of death, as it would have consolidated their bond, once and for all. He continues in terms of death on Page 46, that men are not convinced of your arguments or the seriousness of your suffering, until you are dead. He says, as long as you are alive, your case is debatable and open to skepticism.

>""If we are to end, doubt, we must stop existing, purely and simply.""

I don't like quoting the protagonist, or reading his words as fascinating for some reason, as I said, I find him naive and I feel I can see through him, but I also said at times I feel seen through, never the less, these lines are great.

At a point on page 32, the protagonist spills some great beans, he says , he lived from day to day, with no continuity, other than ""me-me-me"". He says he does stuff, but quickly goes on to forget almost everything and all, except himself, or the stuff that gives him pleasure, just some neurotransmitters making him seek out same shit over and over while forgetting the physical reality and his memories, just satisfying his cravings, from one day to another. He says he goes through every act in an absent mindedness. This portion was pretty fascinating.

There is another interesting portion on page 18 and page 35, around ""justice"" and his vocation. Initially he claims, his life is sweet, that

>""Judges punished the crime, the accused atoned for it, and I free of all responsibility, beyond judgement or punishment, reigned at liberty, bathed in a prelapsarian glow.""

And then at a further point, he narrates an incident, which is quite contrasting to this conclusion of his. He says that in the court, being on the side of the guilt, their crimes did not cause any harm to him, and made him powerful since he was the victim of their crimes. But when he himself was threatened, he became not only a judge like the rest, but also like an angry master who wants to strike the wrongdoer regardless the law. He goes on to claim that, after this incident, it was difficult to carry on his profession.

There is a vivid and neat section on 40-41-42, about one of his affairs where he is startled by a passive lover and her words about their failed affair, that he goes back to win her, establishes a sadistic relationship with her, harming her, making her obliged to make love anywhere anytime, treating her brutally, until she confesses one day in violent throes of pleasure and pain, the she likes it. He then abandons her. The protagonist is also shocked by his own oppressive nature, and he also claims that he had spoken most truth till date only in this affair. And its her break up that he wishes ends in death of her.

This bit is also an extension of the protagonists vice, that he likes to keep it short, and leave anytime he wants, but only after he forces the mistress to pledge to not take any man in the future, that way he is free and yet he owns them. He feels he treats humans, like objects in a cold storage.

>""..I could not live unless all creatures throughout the world, or the greatest possible number, were turned towards me, eternally vacant, deprived of independent life, ready to respond to my call at any moment, in short, condemned to sterility until the day when I might deign to shine my light upon them. In short, for me to live happily, all the creatures whom I chose had not to live at all. They were only to receive life, from time to time, at my good pleasure.""

(I personally do not feel humans or any objects deprived of their independence would be any fun, or would be anything at all. Sure it is pleasing to have humans whenever you want them, but depriving them of their independence or their own self, defeats the whole purpose of wanting them in the first place.)

The last bit for today, I am out of time. He says, something about punishment, and that punishment without judgement is fine, because it leaves us innocent, we even have a word for it, ""misfortune""

**Day 2**

I just finished off the book, and I must say, it is weird, obviously, just like everything else, yea. A portrait turning into a mirror for the audience, apt line. I mentioned the protagonist seems naive at times, and seems like he very well knows it, since he is talking of a journey here. His journey. Well, let's just get back to the notes.

1. Duplicity  
There are moments where he talks about having two faces, kind of blur at the start, a bit clear later on. He talks about how his life/humanity is all about duplicity. He says modesty helped him shine, humility- triumph, virtue to oppress. He talks about his birthday and how he intentionally played down just to give himself up in to the charms of *virile melancholy* He continues to say that his indifference won him love, his selfishness ended up into him acting kindly to others.  
These are things that anyone can resonate with in general. But yet they are remarkable when put in words.
2. Absent minded  
Yea, this was a neat one too, he claims that for most parts, almost all of his life, all the "" i was born knowing how to live"" was nothing but an absent-minded role play, that he was going on with, forgetting the yesterday, loving the self, satisfying selfish urges. It was just an act, it felt like a game, with rules, and that he had no seriousness about anything. It seemed to him a tedious game. Human affairs were not a serious matter
3. Judgement  
He talks about this a lot, it more like one of the central themes as far as I can see. He talks about the human nature to judge, in the early parts, he claimed that he was free, and his nature kept him above all, he was at a height, and he was not judged, atleast that is what he liked to believe. Since his moment to moment full, but empty life, gave him no scope to think, he wasn't aware of the fact that he was judged all the time. Everyone judges everyone all the time,  
""..so people hasten to judge, so as to avoid being judged themselves..""  
The most natural ideas according to him is that humans like to think that they are innocent, even if that meant accusing the whole universe. That is a dramatic line of course, I do not completely fathom it. How else do you escape judgement? By becoming rich, wealth shields you from shit. Further on page 73, he talks more about Judgment. He claims that humans cannot bear being judged, and more so, if they are being judged **without a law**. And this is the torment that everyone finds themselves in.  
I came across an interesting thing called ""little ease"". It sounds pretty neat. the author claims that we all judge each other, and find each other guilty and that we all live in little ease, all the time. And that innocence is dead.
4. Innocent  
The protagonist claims that every man wants to think he is innocent, it is an interesting contrast to the judgment of the men. We judge, so as to prove our innocence. and it could not be more true I guess. I see these dickheads all the time, judging humans, here and there, no doubt. I had more to expand on this section, but I can not recall at this moment. Ah yes, there's a part where the presumption of innocence is questioned by the protagonist, he says,  
In any case, we cannot be certain of anyone's innocence, while we can confidently pronounce everyone guilty. Each man bears witness to the crimes of all the others: this is my faith and hope.""
5. Debauchery  
This is probably one of the neatest sections for me, I could not stop thinking about it. The Protagonist despaired of love and chastity, dives into mindless sex, becomes ""corrupt"". And this section is beautiful, he recalls a few moments, where he is lying between two whores, to numb to be troubled by hope, or any other emotion really. He claims that debauchery is **liberating**, because it creates no obligations, no promises and no sanctions, you are free, in true sense, from all physical restrains.  
""It is a jungle, with no future or past, above all with no promises or sanctions. The places where it happens are cut off from the world: you abandon fear, like hope as you enter.  
He goes on to say he wants to thank all those nameless faces, those nights they shared, for helping him through the times, how he lived like he was immortal. He says he has a taste for immortality, after all, the thing he loved the most was himself.  
The section makes me want to try this immortality out, with your senses numb, your pleasures excess, and no existence of time. Only the moment, with no restrictions or obligations binding you to anything really.
6. Hope  
There's a tiny part, almost a single line, where he says,  
""Hope is no longer a torture""  
I didn't quite understand why hope was a torture.
7. God  
Protagonist says, religion is out of fashion, and more so it wasn't even required in the first place. He claims that we do not need religion to create guilt or to punish, and that we humans are good enough for that. And that we should not fear the day of judgment, but the Judgment of the Men. Because humans are capable of drastic measures to punish and judge fellow humans in order to prove their own innocence.
8. Superhuman  
Protagonist claims that it superhuman, just to keep carrying on, to go from one moment to another is a big feat for an individual in itself, Knowing of your guilt and yet not dying but carrying on is a superhuman feat.
9. Freedom  
There is a great deal of talk about Freedom, but I must say it was quite weird, and I guess I did not understand it all, but yea, like he claims that freedom is bullshit, or more like, He feared freedom, he was scared of it, and that so is everyone, all atheists secretly cherish god, because they are scared of freedom. So they pray that they are on their knees. The protagonist claims that slavery should be cherished, and according to him, The pope should be forgiven by all. Because he needs it more than others. That everyone should become slaves, adopt a god or a master, who is more bad than us, ""knaves"", he calls them.  
i'll attach a picture below when I figure out how to do so.  
I find the protagonist quite self serving all in all, In the end, he is no different than he was before, its just that now he has rationalized everything he does. And he has did that by first judging himself, making himself feel pathetic, breaking himself down to the bone in front of others, so as to become worthy to judge others. While confessing, he jumps from I, to we, to the eventual you, when the listener breaks down in front of him. This just makes his life more bearable for him. 

But the end of the book is horrifying in a way, He talks about The Fall, the bridge. And he asks the lady to jump again, so that he can save both of them. He says to the listener, tell me about your life, and says ""Brr, the water was cold"" but its too late now, he claims, it is always too late. Thank goodness.  
Pretty dark I guess, isn't it. The fall, basically is a metaphor, and not so subtle one, to the lady who jumps off the bridge, and shouts for help. And the protagonist neatly ignores her, which sets him onto this journey, where he has learnt to live with that fact, in fact feel better about it.  
He claims, by confessing everything, he can reveal his true nature to everyone, by doing so, he enjoys his nature, and then later a delicious repentance. He claims to have climbed a summit higher than everyone, from where he can judge everyone, because he has accepted his duplicity, instead of pushing it away. He the king, pope, master of this world, and everyone is his subject, because everyone shares with him a common misery and sadness, and a despair of being unable to escape it, while he has accepted it, and **paints a portrait of himself as he confesses, eventually turning it into a mirror for the listener.**  
Well, I guess, that's it? Yea, quite self serving, and long. But yea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hdomi0/spoilers_just_finished_the_fall_by_albert_camus/,2020-06-22 08:49:25,2,14,books
hc5dhz,The well of ascension (Misborn 2) romance and Kelsier [Spoilers],"So I am near the end of Well of Ascension book . I didnt like Vin and how stupid she was in falling for Zane. I didn’t like how she fell in love with Elend in the first book because they had spent so little time together, but thought, OK as long as we have the romance out of the way. It seemed useless unless Zane becomes relevant again in the future. U could have had the same arc without him, but the fact that he looked like Elend cheapens their romance even more. “I am SO HARD TO TRUST but I trust the people I am not supposed to so easily, and they just happen to be the only boys that I would be able to have get it with.” 

Also, in terms of the seige. I guess this is my own thing and can’t fault them but if the gates werent meant to be seiged and you know that it cant take a a hammering, why not try sealing off the gates with brick BEHIND the gate. Or at least reinforce the gates! You had months, this should have happened, especially since it wasnt like the city were using the gates anyway! 

Finally, and this is what bothers me the most, they treat Kelsier like he was arrogant and ruthless when. There really was nothing that he did to make any person he knew feel as though they were less and yes he was charismatic and confident and a LEADER. So yes people will gravitate to a leader. Moreso, you KNOW why he tried to become famous- he had a goal and he accomplished that goal. But what is the worst thing is how they say he was ruthless. To sympathize with the enemy of your people who had raped and enslaved your population for a thousand years is not mercy it would have been foolish. And ok if you are saying he was ruthless to the Skaa that helped the nobility- well what was he supposed to do? Try and ask them to join him AS he was destroying the Noble’s keep?! He didn’t go to kill a Noble because he thought it was fun; he did it because he was rebelling. Not ONCE did I think he was ruthless in the first book. Yet everyone says he is ruthless-especially Vin - in the second book OVER AND OVER! Vin killed hundreds of men based off of what? The intel given to you by your enemy? The only other person who could have a chance to kill you one on one! Also they dismiss Elend killing Jastes. And he wasn’t even shaken by killing his best friend! And I am not saying he was wrong to not kill Jastes but he acted as judge, jury, and executioner dor a city he wasn’t king of. Not to mention if you formed an alliance with him you could have used his power he had in other places. And what of Vin in the first book, she went along with all of it; not because she believed in freeing the Skaa for the majority of the book. She continued because she liked the crew and liked going to the balls. 

I am sure the book ends well- it seems that is probably Sanderson’s strength. There Is ALOT I like about these books but the romance is bad and to mischaracterize such a central character to the first book is infuriating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hc5dhz/the_well_of_ascension_misborn_2_romance_and/,2020-06-19 17:55:13,3,6,books
6mu08d,The Handmaid's Tail,"The spelling of my post is intentional and in reality is the reason I feel I need to vent.
I found this novel to be fairly decent, until it became downright awful. 

Also, I don't feel there are spoilers here, but if you are a spoiler-stickler, avert your eyes!

When I want to know what to read, I first ask, does it suck? So, does The Handmaid's Tale suck? Well, it hesitates to suck at first ... But oh does it suck in the end? 
Did I just use 'suck' to allude to a sex act? Did I ever! Did I type 'in the end' because sexual organs are at the end of our torso? Perhaps I could write prologues to Margaret Atwood novels! 

The Handmaids Tale, though problematic in plot and clunky at times, was a serviceable novel, until the very end. I think it is worth a read. But be forewarned that the last bit erodes the rest. 

By the end, I'm not referring to the end of the protagonist's tale, mind you. Had that ambiguous ending been the last page, I may have admired this novel on the whole. 

I am referring to the Historical Notes section written as the novel's ending. Simply put, it is a revelatory unravelling of all the words and author's effort preceding it. 

In one closing ""chapter,"" Atwood revealed to readers that she had not been the skilled writer we thought her to be. Here is a spoiler-free snapshot of just one cringe inducing paragraph amongst dozens in the closing pages. It is also a snapshot of the undoing of what could have been considered a fair work of art. 

But even more importantly, it is the microcosm of all that is wrong with the ""historical"" section at the end. It is evidence of, metaphorically speaking, of an artist paining a suitably nice scene, and then trying so ardently to show her patron her proudest portions of the painting too soon; only to smear her heavy hand all through the still wet paint!

The last paragraph of page 300 heading into 301, we get this:

-A professor speaks to let us know how the book came to be preserved. Because that's so important, for some reason. I guess Atwood felt a reader's imagination wouldn't do.

-He tells jokes even the most dimwitted person wouldn't try (which Atwood uses to reveal to us her ""mastery"" of prose.)

-He says that the name The Handmaids Tale is referencing Chaucer's Canterbury's Tales. Oh Margaret Atwood! Did you not think we could see that without you forcing our head down to look? Must you rub our noses in it? Was this entire book just an attempt at your mental masturbation through ""shockingly"" oppressive tropes?

-The professor then actually calls out the homonym of tale and 'tail' as in: Getting or chasing a woman's rump ... That is the part where it seems Atwood wanted to take away anyone's inevitable joke about a handmaid's tail-end. This part is so clunky it will drive you crazy! It feels like the author saying: ""I'm heading you sophomoric jokesters off at the pass! You can't discredit my work if I do it first!""  Um, Margaret, that joke is so stupid, you can have it. So painful.  
-Finally, this supposedly educated professor gets laughter and applause for a pun a teen might say; namely, 'the BONE of contention.' This is, at least to me, the true end of the novel because all creditability the author had at appearing skilled is GONE in an instant!

The last section of the book is when you will know Atwood so desperately wanted you to acknowledge the following: a.) That she came up with a good title. b.) That this whole novel could be as if we were looking and judging Puritan society. Deep! So deep! and c.) That she has effectively beaten all sophomoric jokesters to the punch!

The book isn't great, but i recommend you read it just the same. See if you agree that the actual ending was one too many! 

For me, it became quite clear that it was written by someone who hoped you could see her as great. Still, I am glad to have read it because now I have reason to loathe it. For that reason, I implore you to do the same ... Its good to read a missed opportunity sometimes. 

Can you imagine Steinbeck inserting an epilogue that explains how George came to have the tale of he and Lenny told to the world? I realize Of Mice and Men wasn't told in first-person, but you get my point - he would never have shat on his finished work like this, just to get your attention and beg for your praise!

In fact, I cant imagine a quality author taking such pains to make sure you knew how the story came to be, or to make sure you understood just how clever he/she was in writing the title of the novel! Never. 

Smart, clever, skilled writers know when to let the chips fall where they may, let history judge the work and frankly, when to stop.

This novel needed to end as she stepped into the unknown.  Which is where I will stop.

1754as,After 20+ years my mom finally got the courage to self-publish her book and it's free this week on amazon!,"My Mom has been working on and off on a fantasy novel duet since before I was born. Last year she finally decided she wanted to share it with everyone and got up the courage to self-publish it. I'm SO proud of her and I figured I would see if I could help spread the word. It's free this week for download to amazon kindles (although it's also available in paperback if you're into that) so I wanted to see if maybe some of you had interest in checking it out. It's very similar to Game of Thrones and other hierarchy-type fantasy novels. Here's the book description, links to the amazon page and her website are at the bottom!

A quest to find a lost prince.

A duke goes to war to be made a king.

A young man and woman discover love in a season of strife.

A woman of arcane power exceeds her own expectations, to the damnation of them all.

Upheaval and change are in the wind. A throne sits empty as the stories of a prince, long deemed lost, are once more being told. The Pentachy, a vast kingdom ruled by the five Great Houses, finds itself on the sword’s edge of civil war. 

Far from home, family or friends, Hollin, the Head of the Great House of Langstraad, a woman of charm with a will of adamant, rides forth to use her powers political and arcane to prevent the destruction of the Pentarchy. 
“As a child, my father taught me to ride, to fly a hawk and to wield a sword. I have never climbed through unknown mountains, but I am not afraid to try.""

Within the walls of Castle Lir, Hollin’s beloved cousin, Ian de Medicat, is forced to marry an unwilling bride in order to secure an alliance ensuring that Langstraad will not stand alone when tides of war wash against it.
""You have been born and raised in a Great House, my lady. Think of how alliances are truly cemented: either by mutual physical gains of property or by marriage; and those got through the familial alliances of marriage are the stronger and harder to dissolve. I need this alliance to keep Langstraad safe and, like it or not, you are the key that I have bargained for.""

In Dacara, at the Scholastium Arcana, the Mage Masters turn deaf ears to the pleas of those asking them to come forth and help preserve the integrity of the Pentarchy.
“Neither we nor any under our rule will wage warfare of any kind within the Pentarchy.""

The threat of war seems fated to become a reality. Soon men will be betrayed and murdered, armies will assemble and something not of this world shall find an entrance into it. As the bonds of temporal and magical forces that hold the Pentachy together begin to dissolve, both men and women will learn all too well where the lust for power can lead the unscrupulous – and the unwary.

“…once the game has been set in motion it will go on whether you will or no.""

I was in middle school when the movie came out and in elementary when the book was released, and I remember being aware of it being something of a Big Deal, at the time.

I can recall overhearing bits of red wine and scotch-loosened conversations with a lot of embarrassed laughter, blushing, and hands over faces, while the men in the other room grunted and watched football or talked business, depending on which side of the family I was with.

I knew it made adults feel and act weird.

Without ever having active designs on reading it, one day a short time ago, as I was sorting through 10 gaylords of free books, I came across a copy of it.

I placed it in the ""Oh, hell yeah!"" pile.

Short while later and here we are. Me trying to convince you to give it a read and you wondering what's so good about it to make me want to come here and tell you to, as if I know anything.

I'll try to keep this brief.

* This is the first book to make me cry. I have not read The Notebook, but the movie seems to be the only one where every guy is all, ""Yeah, I cried watching that shit. It was beautiful."" The Notebook has nothing on this.

* Writing style is just, I don't know. This one's probably personal, but his literary voice has an appeal like an Attenborough narration, for me; I fucking love it!

* The pacing in this is like a metronome strapped to the front of a freight train; steady and immense.

* The writing doesn't paint a picture for you; you paint it. The writing is Bob Ross walking you through painting a beautiful picture with the blade of a knife. 

Full disclosure - the story is also perhaps so captivating to me as the plot sounds all too familiar, minus the children, to me. It fucking hurts. I almost wonder if the characters thoughts in the novel are near-universal since the similarities are almost eerie.

Here's a few lines from it:

>His admiration was genuine, she could tell. She reveled in it, bathed in it, let it swirl over her and into the pores of her skin like soft oil from the hands of some deity somewhere who had deserted her years ago and had now returned.

>And in the catch of that moment, she fell in love with Robert Kincaid, Photographer-writer from Bellingham, Washington, who drove an old pickup truck named Harry.

.

>""I have one thing to say, one thing only; I'll never say it another time, to anyone, and I ask you to remember it: In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lifetimes you live.""

I know exactly what he means in that second quote, inside and out, backwards and forwards.

That line would not sound odd coming out of my mouth.

I know how she feels where you can pinpoint the moment you fell in love with them; when you stopped fighting it and accepted that your hearts would now be in sync for life, no matter how far apart you were.


Edit - looks like I've failed in brevity. Welp, there goes my witt, too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/68yfux/i_finished_a_book_and_yes_it_blew_me_away_the/,2017-05-03 05:19:31,9,20,books
5jbjsa,I just finished Blood Meridian and I have to talk about the ending (Spoilers obviously),"My apologies in advance for the wall of text!

First of all, wow! Holy smokes this book blew me away. The prose is so unbelievably beautiful. The way he paints the landscape is breathtaking. I've never felt so engulfed in and intrigued by a novel with such a loose plot. This book really made me slow down and appreciate every little detail in the language. Speaking of language, I was surprised with how much I didn't mind the lack of quotation marks and loosely structured conversations. The dialect/accents were fun to decipher at times and remind me of Trainspotting. 

My god, the violence! I knew going in that this book had a reputation for being super fucked up, but I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. I think the part that got me the most was when the gang is massacring the peaceful tribe and one of the Delawares takes two infants and smashes them against the rocks by there feet. I was so into it and reading too fast when I flew right past that line and then came to a screeching halt. 

""Wait... What..."" *goes back and rereads, slack-jawed in horror* 

So, on to what I really want to talk about: the ending. There seems to be a lot of debate about what happened. I mean, it was pretty damn ambiguous. But, I loved it.

I was having a difficult time grappling with the seemingly out-of-nowhere shift on the Judge's part when he starts hunting the kid and Tobin after the Glanton gang is massacred. I couldn't really understand why he made that switch when it was happening. But after the ending, I felt like I was able to piece things together.

So, here's what I think happened...

Everyone in this novel is evil. Well, not *everyone*, but you know what I'm saying. Everyone that we care about as characters are pretty fucking vile people, the kid included. **BUT** the kid has that little nugget of resistance in him. Not good, just resistance to the potential pure evil at the center of every man's heart that the Judges represents. We know the Judge has a compulsion to dominate everything in the land as evidenced by the lines about free birds insulting him or when he flat out states ""whichever exists without my knowledge, exists without my consent"" (god damn the judge is such a crazy fucking awesome villain). The judge sees Tobin and the kid attempting to escape after the massacre as them trying to swim out of the whirlpool of his (pure violent evil) influence and in doing so, they would be free of his domination. Obviously that is unacceptable to the judge. During the hunt, he yells something to the kid about the kid's mutinous acts within the gang. this confused me and I was backtracking thinking I somehow missed the kid selling the gang out to the Yumas. I think that what he meant was that he recognized the small bit of resistance to pure evil that lay in the kids heart. That resistance (even if it was a private, almost subconscious resistance) was a mutiny against the gang's blind devotion to the evil influence of the judge. 

The kid eventually escapes and we get rushed through a decade or of the kid's young adult life. during this time, we never see the kid (now ""the man"") kill another human being. He even tries to help a stranded old woman out on the plains (I mean, she turns out to be dead already but hey, he tried). 

Then he shoots the 15 year old boy outside of the town of sin. And of course, right after that is when he sees the judge again for the first time since the jail cell, after the hunt. 

Ok so, the meat and potatoes...

He and the judge speak in the bar and then the man tries to sleep with the small prostitute. He leaves, unable to perform and is presumably pretty sexually frustrated and overwhelmed by his encounter with the judge. He goes to the ""jakes"" (had to google that one, never heard an outhouse called that before) and the judge greets him there, where he ""gather(s) him in his arms against his immense and terrible flesh."" It seems a lot of people believe that the judge killed or raped (or both) the man in the jakes and left a scene so gruesome that it could not be described save for the bystander saying ""good god almighty."" I do not think this is so. Right before this happens, it is stated that the little girl whose bear was killed had gone missing and men were about looking for her. I think that the man finally crumpled under the weight of the judge's dominance and gave in to the pure evil in his heart. I think he raped and killed the little girl in the jakes. The judge's embrace of ""immense and terrible flesh"" was his wave of influence finally fully washing over the man. I think the man standing outside the jakes smoking a cigarette and casually warning others not to look inside is *the* man and the judge dancing in the end is his celebration of finally possessing the man's heart. To me, the judge is half person, half idea. He is not truly *just* an evil man and he is not truly *just* a personification of pure evil. He is both and in this scene, we finally see that. The judge ""says that he will never die"" because he is violence. He is evil. Violence and evil in human beings will never cease to exist and sometimes, they may fully consume a man. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text! I'm just so giddy about this book. Reading it was truly and amazing experience. I love that the ending is so ambiguous and that everyone seems to have slightly different interpretations. I would love to hear yours. Please share!

TLDR; The judge does not kill the man in the jakes. The man rapes and kills the missing girl whose bear was killed in the bar. The judge's weird hug was what he represents (pure violent evil) taking over the kid once and for all.

podluc,"20 years later, I re-read ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and","For those of you unaware, this was a very successful, best seller book in the early 1990's and while any Amazon listing pretty much says what I'm about to say about the plot, I'll cover it just to make the mods happy. 

>! Set in the 1960's, it's a story of a married woman but lonely woman, who lives on a farm in Madison County, Iowa in the 1960s.  She's living the typical life of a farm wife and feels dead inside, taken for granted and yearns to feel alive again.  

>! She is alone on the farm while her husband and children have left for the county fair for a week with a steer they plan to enter.  A photographer stops by her farm after being unable to locate a few bridges he is trying to photograph. He asks for direction, which she provides and after some flirting later, they have a 4 day love affair.

The book came out in 1992 when I was in middle school and the movie came out in 1995 while I was in high school.  I originally read this book back in the late 1990's (like 1999) when I was in college, mainly on the advice of my girlfriend at the time.  As a guy, romance books were not my genre but I kept an open mind.  

Some non-spoiler views from 20 years ago verse today:

1) I thought the literary voice was awesome when I first read it and now 20 years later I still enjoyed his writing style and his tempo.  

2) My understanding of the book changed as I got older and became married myself. It also gave me a different perspective on the book. Before I just saw it as a romance novel.  Today I see it as a romantic adult fantasy. 

3) Today the book seems quite tame in the subject matter verse when it originally came out so I doubt it has the same punch as it did originally. When it came out, the target audience would have been around the age of the children whom discovered their mother's diary from the 1960's. 

4) There was some contention back when this novel came out, due to the ending of the book, regarding if it was based on a real person and events or it was purely fictional.

5) The dialog felt contrived and unrealistic.


Spoiler-filled summary of the book: 

>! The book starts out with the grown children of Francesca Johnson, just after her death, finding an old diary which recounted the affair between herself and Robert Kincaid, a free-roaming, globe-trotting  photographer.  She was an Italian immigrant who married an American (WWII war bride) and ended up in a small town in Iowa. She was college educated, taught in a local high school but felt isolated in her simple, mundane life, lacking intellectual engagement.  When Robert arrives asking for directions to various bridges, the roads are poorly marked and she has trouble explaining how to get to them so she rides along with him, showing him the way.  She spends all day with him as he takes photographs and tells her stories of his travels, it reawakens her yearning for a more worldly life. He told her he wasn't like other men, he was a free spirit, an artist, a poet, a vegetarian.  She succumbs to desires that have been dormant inside her for years. She and Robert realize the next day the have both fallen in love so they allow themselves to experience emotional and sexual passion, and end up falling even deeper in love.

>! Reality hits them both as at the end of the week, she went back to her family responsibilities to save her family the sandal and censor of the community, and he respects her enough to just leave he be. Years later after Robert has passed away he had his ashes scattered at a bridge that she had left a note at for him to join her for dinner (the bridge where they knew they fell in love) and she had requested her children cremate her remains and scatter them at the same bridge.  The children are confused as they wanted to bury their mother in at the family plot next to their father.  In the movie, they scatter her ashes at the bridge but the book ending doesn't mention if the children scattered her remains at the bridge or not.  

My Spoiler-filled review and critique:

>! As a young man in my 20's, this really plucked at my heart strings.  I read *The Notebook* right after *Bridges* and I thought Bridges was the better story while I liked the writing style of *The Notebook* more.

>! Fabulous sex, no slip-ups and they never see or talk to each other again, san a couple of letters sent over the years. They hardly knew each other, but they really loved each other. He loved her intellect, she his manliness. This fling was fated, it was out of their control, ""they'd been moving towards each other not just their entire lives, but for several lifetimes"". Top that.

>! As a young man, I though the worst feeling besides heartbreak was that feeling after an empty, meaningless one-night stand. Yeah, we guys can feel that too.   As a married man, I realize after reading this book that the 'one-night stand' that makes the rest of your life (multiple decades of it) dreary, empty and meaningless is much worse. That's what is heartbreaking about this book. That these two people had a really strong connection (I'll take issue with this later) and spent the rest of their lives pining for each other.  I think the author realized that too as he wrote a follow-up book (I haven't read it, just saw the wikipedia page about it) where Robert and Francesca have to deal with the loneliness of their lives after the affair.

>! Where the adult fantasy comes into play was where it took them one day to fall deeply in love. As a young 20-something, sure, I believed it was possible. As a 40 year old looking back, it's a nice fantasy but it is not reality.  They could have had lust for each other, as they both fulfilled something the other needed, they may had loved the idea they had of the other person but 4 days isn't enough time to really get to know someone and have a deep, meaningful connected love. True love takes the day-to-day living with the other person. It takes going through the ups and downs of daily life and facing life challenges together.  Insta-bake Love, that's the fantasy. You can't microwave love. (Look at you *The Bachelor* and *The Bachelorette*).  

>! A criticism I have about the author is that we also learn so little about Francesca or her life beyond a simple backstory. Sure, I get that this is a diary so she wouldn't be writing about herself deeply but this is also a novel and the author should be filling in this world, if even to mention things in passing, so we get a sense of her life.  Robert is fleshed out so you get a real sense of a professional photographer at work but nothing much about Francesca living on the farm.  They raised livestock as her two teenagers and husband had taken a steer to the county fair...so what other animals did this farm have? Were there smells of the farm wafting through the air?  Were their animal noises at night?  Did they have a garden (most farms do) she had to tend?  Who was doing the chores around the farm while the husband and teenagers were away? Did they have farmhands or neighbors helping while the rest of the family was away? Was there a farm dog or farm cat(s)?  Being one who has grown up in a farming state and community this was something that always bothered me. Also, the author made anyone from a rural area in America sound stupid simply because they didn't drink certain types of alcohol or read esoteric poetry.  

I think Bridges touched on the fantasy of a multitude of middle-aged women who feel trapped in mundane lives, taken for granted by their families. Women who fantasize of a manly stranger who would see their 'real' self, fall deeply in love with them instantly and offer them something more, that's why it was so popular back when it first came out. From the standpoint of a man, I enjoyed the fantasy of it but I feel I enjoyed it more as a young man than I did an older man.  YMMV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/podluc/20_years_later_i_reread_the_bridges_of_madison/,2021-09-14 22:51:31,14,17,books
bspuc4,Catcher in the Rye: Is it about coping with the effect of rape and molestation?,"I first read the Catcher in the Rye about 12 years ago in high school and this novel has always disturbed me a great deal. Many articles have been written about the Great Gatsby's unreliable narrator (Nick Carraway) and homosexual undertones, but much less has been written about the Catcher in the Rye's unreliable narrator and many hints of pedophilia and child molestation. This is what I think. Feel free to agree or disagree.

Jane Gallagher: Victim of child molestation by her ""booze hound"" stepfather, Mr. Cudahy. This was clearly implied by Holden Caulfield comment of him ""tried to get wise with her"". Her stepfather used to run around the house naked. She refused to answer her stepfather when he asked if there were any cigarettes in the house and later couldn't stop herself from crying in Holden's presence. They soon kissed without kissing each other's mouth. Holden bonded and identified with her because Holden himself was very likely also a victim of molestation (more on that later). Childhood trauma possibly caused Jane to become a ""slut"" in high school as she went on a date with Stradlater and was possibly raped again.

James Castle: ""Skinny little weak-looking"" (possibly gay) Castle allegedly jumped to his death while wearing Holden's turtleneck. He called Stabile ""conceited,"" so Stabile and ""six other dirty bastards"" went to Castle's room to torment him. Holden refused to tell us what they did to him because it was too ""repulsive"" but the clear implication was something sexually humiliating. My guess is rape, possibly with an inanimate object. It was also possible he was murdered and thrown off the window instead of jumping to his death. Mr. Antolini, who was later revealed as a sexual predator, was the one who carried Castle's body away, which implied a close relationship between Castle and Antolini. It was possible Castle was molested by Antolini.

Sunny and Maurice: Like Jane, Holden identified with and empathized with prostitute Sunny, who seemed to be around Holden's age, and put her on a pedestal. Her pimp, Maurice, came across as an exploitative pedophile.

Mr. Antolini: Married to a much older rich woman. Seemed to have a distant relationship with his wife. Fostered close personal relationships with male pupils, including Holden (used to play tennis together) and evidently James Castle. When Holden stayed over at his place, he called Holden ""handsome"", didn't provide Holden with any pajamas (presumably wanted him to sleep naked), and later pet Holden's face while he was asleep. When caught, he claimed to be just ""admiring."" My guess is Antonili and wife were each other's ""beards"" and touching Holden while he was asleep was part of the ""grooming"" process.

Even Antolini's ""advice"" could be interpreted as an offer to enter into a ""pederasty"" relationship. ""You’ll find that you’re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You’re by no means alone on that score. You’ll be excited and STIMULATED to know. Many, many men have been troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You’ll learn from them–if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It’s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn’t education. It’s history. It’s poetry.""

Stradlater and Ivy League bastard: Both guys have rape-y vibe. Ivy League bastard was feeling up his date under the table while simultaneously telling a story about a guy in his dorm who tried to commit suicide by overdosing an aspirin. The date was telling the Ivy League guy to ""Don’t, darling. Please, don’t. Not here."" This is similar to many of Stradlater's dates (""Please, don't. Please."" Stradlater clearly was a date rapist and Coach Ed Bankey was complicit in his effort given that he often used Bankey's car. After his date with Jane Gallagher, he didn't boast about his conquest, leading Holden to think “something had gone funny.” Holden fought Stradlater, but was easily manhandled. The implication was Jane resisted Stradlater and he raped her and traumatized her all over again.

Carl Luce: Holden's student advisor at a previous prep school was a ""fat-assed phony"", well-documented pervert, and possible predator 3 years older than Holden. Luce used to corrupt younger students (including Holden) with graphic descriptions of weird sexual kinks and fetishes, including beastiality with ""sheeps"" and homosexuality. He also had a habit of prying into younger students' sex lives. By Holden's telling, Luce knew ""who every flit (gays) and Lesbian in the United States was."" Additionally, Luce claimed gays could be ""recruited"". ""He said that you could turn into a flit practically overnight, if you had the traits and all."" And Holden suspected Luce was a closeted homosexual. ""I kept waiting to turn into a flit or something."" When Holden met up with him, he was in an odd relationship with a much older Chinese sculptress from Shanghai (cue to ""Asian Dragon Lady"" stereotype). Luce claimed he was dating her due to his preference for ""Eastern philosophy,"" which apparently considered sex as both a “a physical and a spiritual experience."" Reading between the lines, it seems clear that Carl Luce was a closeted homosexual who might've ""turned out"" Holden when he was his student advisor and was now being ""pegged"" by his significantly older Chinese girlfriend and enjoying being submissive to an ""Asian dragon lady.""

Holden: After fleeing Antolini's apartment, Holden revealed that similar ""perverty"" incident happened to him ""about twenty times since I was a kid."" Holden's flight made it obvious that Antolini's sexual advances set off a defensive trigger in Holden. This also made it obvious that Holden was molested, which explained both his affinity for fellow victims of molestation (Jane, Sunny) and his desire to be a ""catcher in the rye."" Later at the train station, he experienced a major freakout, developed diarrhea, and collapsed on the floor in a public bathroom. It seemed likely Antolini ""roofied"" Holden's coffee.

Phoebe: We now know most pedophiles were themselves molested as kids because it is ""learned behavior,"" which brings me to the most disturbing part of the novel. Holden's relationship with Phoebe was downright creepy and he was either desperately trying to suppress his incestous urges for her or already molesting her. He described Phoebe as ""nice skinny"" with ""nice, pretty little ears"" and ""really nice"" red hair. He later sneaked into her bedroom and found her sleeping in his bed. He asked the rhetorical question, ""What’s old Phoebe got to spread out?"" Note the sexual innuendo. She was asleep and ""she had her mouth way open."" Another sexual innuendo. After he woke her up, he noted that ""She’s very affectionate. I mean she’s quite affectionate, for a child. Sometimes she’s even TOO affectionate."" And then after she realized he was expelled again, she punched him with her fist, which came off as rather flirtatious and inappropriate for a ten-year-old. And then he pinched her ass. WTF!!!???

""Then, just for the hell of it, I gave her a pinch on the behind. It was sticking way out in the breeze, the way she was laying on her side. She has hardly any behind. I didn’t do it hard, but she tried to hit my hand anyway, but she missed.""

This passage really seals the deal for me that Holden Caulfield was not just a victim of pedophilia but had also become an incestous pedo himself. First of all, why would he be checking out his 10-year-old sister's butt at all? And why would he pinch it just ""for the hell of it""? It got even creepier.

""She was sitting way up in bed. She looked so pretty.""

And then they danced to four numbers. They got ""sweaty."" Phoebe asked Holden to feel her forehead to see if it felt feverish.

And then their parents got home and Holden hid in the closet. Phoebe lied to them to cover for Holden, which implied Holden had been grooming her for quite some time now. Phoebe offered Holden money and he cried. And then Phoebe said Holden ""could sleep with her if I wanted to,"" which implied they had slept together before.

Later, Phoebe wanted to run away with Holden, like how Holden wanted Sally Hayes to run away with him (Sally seemed like the only normal, albeit shallow, person in the book). And then an argument ensued and the subsequent interaction once again made Holden and her 10-year-old sister seemed more like boyfriend/girlfriend than 16-year-old brother with his 10-year-old sister.

It's also worth noting that JD Salinger had numerous relationships with much younger, barely legal women during his lifetime and that the veil of elite prep schools' pedophilia and sexual abuse have slowly been lifted in recent years.

5oeg5q,Links Between Heart of Darkness and The Brothers Karamazov,"I was reading BK for fun while I was reading HoD for a class, and I stumbled across a number of eerily similar passages in the two. Sure enough, I discovered that Conrad had actually read the French translation of BK a few years before HoD came out. All this ended up becoming my final essay for a class, and I thought you guys might enjoy seeing some of the passages in parallel. If you haven't read them, feel free to turn back now. (Note: These quotes are from the Pevear / Volokhonsky translation of BK.)

----

I argued that this passage from BK inspired Heart of Darkness outright.

[Dostoevsky, P. 303-304](#s ""No science or self-interest will ever enable people to share their property and their rights among themselves without offense. Each will always think his share too small, and they will keep murmuring they will envy and destroy one another. … For everyone now strives most of all to separate his person, wishing to experience the fullness of life within himself, and yet what comes of all his efforts is not the fullness of life but full suicide, for instead of the fullness of self-definition, they fall into complete isolation. For all men in our age are separated into units, each seeks seclusion in his own hole, each withdraws from the others, hides himself, and hides what he has, and ends by pushing himself away from people and pushing people away from himself. He accumulates wealth in solitude, thinking: how strong, how secure I am now; and does not see, madman as he is, that the more he accumulates, the more he sinks into suicidal impotence. For he is accustomed to relying only on himself, he has separated his unit from the whole, he has accustomed his soul to not believing in people’s help, in people or mankind, and now only trembles lest his money and his acquired privileges perish. Everywhere now the human mind has begun laughably not to understand that a man’s true security lies not in his own solitary effort, but in the general wholeness of humanity. But there must needs come a term to this horrible isolation, and everyone will all at once realize how unnaturally they have separated themselves from one another. Such will be the spirit of the time, and they will be astonished that they sat in darkness for so long, and did not see the light."")

These same ideas of isolation, wealth, absurdity, and an inevitable end were echoed in this passage from HoD:

[Conrad, P. 72](#s ""Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word ‘ivory’ rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I’ve never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion."")

----

[Conrad, P. 74](#s ""They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as everything else – as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had. They intrigued and slandered and hated each other on that account."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 313](#s ""For the world says: “You have needs, therefore satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the noblest and richest men. Do not be afraid to satisfy them but even increase them”—this is the current teaching of the world. And in this they see freedom. But what comes of this right to increase one’s needs? For the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; for the poor, envy and murder."")

The last line is actually embodied in Heart of Darkness. The poor are embodied in the lost pilgrims. Kurtz showcases the whole process, going through maniacal states of envy and murder to achieve his wealth and ending up isolated and spiritually dead.

---- 

The following passages don't need elaboration; the connections are pretty obvious.

----

[Conrad, P. 135](#s ""I wasn’t arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear – concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible intensity."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 69](#s ""Evildoing should not only be permitted but should even be acknowledged as the most necessary and most intelligent solution."")

----

[Conrad, P. 137](#s ""But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries [Kurtz] had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham distinction, of all the appearances of success and power."")

[Dostoevsky, P. 108](#s ""Can there be beauty in Sodom? Believe me, for the vast majority of people, that’s just where beauty lies—did you know that secret? The terrible thing is that beauty is not only fearful, but also mysterious. Here the devil is struggling with God, and the battlefield is the human heart."")

----

[Dostoevsky, P. 44](#s ""Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern a truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others. Not respecting anyone, he ceases to love, and having no love, he gives himself up to passions and coarse pleasures, in order to occupy and amuse himself, and in his vices reaches complete bestiality, and it all comes from lying continually to himself and others."")

[Conrad, P. 143](#s ""He had faith – don’t you see? – he had the faith. He could get himself to believe in anything."")

----

Overall, I thought Heart of Darkness sought to elaborate on and explore the philosophy from The Brothers Karamazov.

ehfhm1,Thoughts on Rubicon:The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic by Tom Holland,"\-First, I would be remiss if I failed to recommend Hardcore History, a podcast by Dan Carlin. This is where I first heard of Tom Holland with his texts constantly being referenced. I cannot advocate enough for Hardcore History, it's absolutely fantastic.

\- As far as snapshots into history go, Rubicon was phenomenal. Rome in the 100's-60's B.C. was a breeding ground for giants. Larger than life figures in the Senate, and the battlefield loomed and defended, or jeopardized, a sacred Republic really only glimpsed previously in Greece. Holland does an admirable job remaining unbiased, but I could not help but feel aligned with certain characters for either their courage, or their wit. Caesar is undeniably the lead, but the names of Cicero, Cato, Pompey, Sulla, Crassus, Caesar Augustus, Clodius, Gaius goddamn Marius, Mark Antony, the Sibyl, Cleopatra, Mithridates...and on and on.. so many fantastic figures and events to be analyzed and remembered. I encourage all lovers of stories to seek out ancient Rome, and read about these legends.

\-The Rubicon itself was a creek north of Rome, where it was said, generals had to relinquish their legions before crossing, as a symbol they would not march on Rome herself, ""the Mistress of the World"". I imagine what it was like for Sulla, but even more so Caesar, when that moment came in which each decided in their hearts to march on the Republic, and cross that river. I picture Caesar's gaze on the flowing waters, as the moonlight shone off its surface, reflecting on all that was at stake. Democracy vs. Dictatorship, Freedom vs. Power. For it was Caesar's march and subsequent tyranny that proved the death knell of the Republic, and a civil war that began to topple Rome. I can't imagine the magnitude of that moment on even a giant like Julius Caesar, and the perilousness of such a minor maneuver. Such a small moment with ramifications felt throughout the rest of world history. Awesome.

\-I often wonder the benefits of authoritarianism vs democracy as it relates to Rome. With the Republic, power was shared through dual consuls, a tribunate, praetors, questors, the Senate, priests and so on. A glory-thirsty people vied for power, and contentions, and rivalries were constant. Speeches and trials at the Senate House were public spectacles, as were elections. Rome had a very real class system, and the poor were still inferior in the Republic. But, every man had the opportunity to make a name for himself, and gain honors for his household. Yet, it was usually dictators who subdued a people into peace, such as the rule of Caesar Augustus. I guess, in the end, a contentious band of free men trump that of the peaceful slave. 

\- In reading Rubicon, I often desired just to be a face in the Roman crowd during some of these legendary times. To feel the fears upon defeats to Mithridates and Hannibal, to the jubilations of the triumphs of Pomey and Caesar. To see Gaius Marius deflect the Germans and steal consulship and command from Sulla. To see the horror of Sulla's march on Rome. To listen to the great Cicero orate in the Forum, or the steadfast Cato condemn the triumverate. To jeer with the prejudiced Romans as Cleopatra, the Queen of Macedonia and Egypt, and mistress to Caesar (and later Mark Antony), enters the sacred Republic. So many unbelievable moments. I'd love to have a taste of the emotions of the common, everyday Roman during these times.

\-Caesar was without peer in the end. His accomplishments were many, and all enormous. He pacified all of Gaul in a gallic holocaust. He was captured by pirates, released, and returned to hang them all. He sailed to England, previously a land of myth. He marched on Rome. He defeated the great Pompey. He subdued the east, specifically Alexandria. He ruined the Republic and became pretty much a god-like figure. The descendant of Venus amazes throughout Roman history, and it's honestly a tall task to find historical figures that match his life. The great Cato was his rival, yet I felt in the end, the fact that Cato could never wrestle power from Caesar, made him the loser in the feud over the Republic. I'd love to hear others thoughts on this.

\-Ultimately, if you are a fan of history at all as I am, Rubicon is excellent. Tom Holland writes in an easy to read manner, and the spirits of the figures from italy speak for themselves. I never felt a dull moment in this read, and he does a great job of giving you the flavors of the masses in these times. I'll be reading his texts on Persia soon, but for now it has been a great experience and honor delving into the Republic.

""Confident that he was among friends, Caesar dropped his guard. 'What is the sweetest kind of death?' he was asked. Back shot Caesar's response: 'The kind that comes without warning.' To be warned was to be fearful; to be fearful was to be emasculated. That night, when Caesar's wife suffered nightmares and begged him not to attend the Senate the next day, he laughed. In the morning, borne in his litter, he caught sight of the soothsayer who had told him to beware the Ides of March. 'The day of which you warned me against is here,' Caesar said smiling, 'and I am still alive.' 'Yes,' came the answer, swift and and inevitable. 'It is here- but it is not yet past.'

tj6agt,My thoughts on The Brothers Karamazov - A Mirror of Humanity,"Within three brothers are shown the breadth of humanity, the extremes it can go from either end, but more importantly, just how similar those extremes can end up being. An almost airy, breezy sort of writing carries this truth, recalled by a narrator who isn't anyone special, but just a local observer. His observations are straightforward and true, biting and unflinching, sometimes funny, and sometimes very hurtful in the raw nerve it exposes; a nerve that anyone can find in themselves if they look inwards. This is the deceptive simplicity of a master writer, and The Brothers Karamazov is certainly a masterwork done by such a writer.


Those three brothers and their abhorrent father make up the book. The eldest, Dmitri Fyodorovich Karamazov, is a neglected hotheaded man. The middle, Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, is an educated atheist who struggles with his own moral failings and human weakness. And the youngest, through whose sincere eyes we see this corrupted, tragic world, Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov. Our narrator begins by telling us Alexei is his protagonist. Alexei is a godly man who is eventually taken in by the Elder Zosima, and who struggles to see the good in the world while all around him seems resigned to tragedy.


Their father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, is one of the worst displays of humanity imaginable. He is a hedonistic swine, a rapist, and proud of his failings. With him, we see how disadvantaged his children enter the world; we see how easily the air of tragedy and misfortune that surrounds these characters, seems almost inevitable. The book's plot revolves around his murder, but the real catalyst of all it is concerned with, comes from him being an absent father and worthless human.


And so preceding his murder, is his affair with Grushenka, a woman whom both himself and his son, Dmitri, covets. Dmitri is accused of having killed his father for his money, so as to lure Grushenka away. The entire second half of the book is given to the investigation of the murder and Dmitri's trial. But to say that The Brothers Karamazov is only a murder mystery would be missing the point.


This is a book that balances between the immediate passions of humanity, and the philosophy and psychology behind it. Dostoevsky shows both brilliantly, going deeply into the emotions and psychology of his characters, and of Man in general, and also showing the very immediate conflict of the love triangle, which in turn shows the emotions and psychology in practice. This comes together to give a picture that becomes almost a mirror of Man. The biggest impression I had when reading this book was just how true it was. Every character is real. I cannot emphasize this enough. It felt like reading the chronicles of very real people who lived long ago. That this is a work of fiction is the most unbelievable thing about it. 


Surrounding the murder is the exploration of philosophy and psychology, the natures of men and society in general. At its heart, this is what The Brothers Karamazov is really concerned with. It begins with the discrete portraits of very different men: the three Karamazov brothers. Each, at first, represents a very different type of man, incongruent with the other. As we continue, we see that they are not so different, not so discrete. The gulf of difference, from morals to baseness, theism and disbelief, righteousness and fallen, are not so large. Each brother ends as merely a slightly different reflection of the other, not so far apart as to have been first expected.


Dmitri is base and impulsive. He is much like his father at first glance. He would compare himself to an insect in his sensuality; he has an evil insect nature. Though he has a sense of honor, also, his passion is what rules him, just as it rules his father. Dmitri is married to a noble, proud and yet tender-hearted woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He falls in love with the low born, manipulative Grushenka. His marriage is borne out of his own manipulation, his own baseness at needing to see someone he thinks is above him, humbled at his feet. And yet his honor kicks in and he cannot live with himself. He flies instead to a woman who uses him, who does the same as he had done to Katerina, and he finds escape in his suffering and endless love for her. Dmitri has no delusions about who or what he is. He and his father fight over Grushenka, and Grushenka couldn't care for either of them; she doesn't care until tragedy strikes her as well. It is because of her that Dmitri is accused of murder.


Ivan is well educated and at war with himself. He is an atheist, but not one who disbelieves in God's existence, but one who has lost belief in God the way one loses belief in one's parents. His musings on God are famous beyond this book. The Grand Inquisitor chapter, a chapter where he puts himself as an aged inquisitor who intends to sentence the returned Christ to death, is amazing. This chapter is up there with The Dead by Joyce, The Beggar Maid by Munro, all of Snow Country, and all the great things I've read. This chapter shows Ivan's philosophy, but also his turmoil and desperation to believe. The old inquisitor believes Christ is proud and that only a chosen few can live up to his ideals. The rest shall suffer and so it is up to the disbelieving church to shepherd these forgotten. In this we see Ivan's struggle as he believes he cannot live to Christ's standards; he is destined for ruin. And in the end, when Christ kisses the inquisitor and is freed by that man, we see a glimmer of Ivan's true self: he wishes he could be better. Adding to his struggle, he is also in love with Dmitri's fiancé, Katerina. He is tortured by her rejection and loyalty to his wanton brother.   


The youngest brother, Alexei, is a pious man of great fortitude. Compared with his brothers, he is free from scandal and outward conflict. He lives in a monastery with the Elder Zosima, a man who is like a father to him. When the elder dies, Alexei is instructed to sojourn the world. Through him do we see many of the book's happenings; his judgement is respected by all, and his understanding and blessing is often sought. Though outwardly calm, after Zosima's death we see his own personal turmoil and struggles. Alexei has moments of disbelief, just like Ivan, and he is passionate just like Dmitri. 


The three brothers begin apart in character but become closer as things go on. Dmitri's musing on his insect-like nature is not so different from Ivan's belief of being unable to live up to Christ's standards. And Alexei struggles himself to live up to those standards. All brothers are human and flawed; they simply bear their burdens differently.


The book goes into many of their conflicts and many other stories and examinations of other characters. There is a deeply poetic nature to its examination of humanity; everything comes round again, and things match and contrast in interesting ways. Alexei's childhood is defined by his memories of his mother praying for him. The book ends with him telling some children the importance of having and cherishing memories from one's parental home. 


Fatherhood is shown in all its spectrums and with all its consequences. Fyodor is contrasted with the peasant father, Snegiryov, who loves his son. Fyodor is murdered by his child; Snegiryov loses his son. Progress is shown slowly: Fyodor rapes a vulnerable Lizaveta while his son, Alexei, assists, and perhaps may even help find salvation, another young, vulnerable Lizaveta.


All this brings out the emotions and truth of the book more strongly. The murder then, which comes halfway through, only gives further excuse for deep personal examinations.


And what what examinations there are. Dmitri's trial and investigation is full of candid observations about life and people. We see psychology weaponized by prosecutor and defense. The defense calls it 'a stick with two ends' and shows how one can draw many conclusions from the same facts. We see this personified in how very different all three brothers are coming from the same place, and also how similar they are despite the gulfs between them.


That we know coming into the trial who the real murderer is, makes it even more impressive how persuasive either side can be. I saw where the prosecution was coming from and even agreed with them; then I turned coat when the defense had their chance to speak, proving without a doubt Dmitri's innocence.


The murder and trial end the book. We learn that it is Fyodor's bastard son who kills him and frames Dmitri. This son, Smerdyakov, represents a failed Russia, a failed society. The offspring of a rape victim being destined to serve his mother's rapist, his only chance at life was to steal the money Fyodor had in such abundance. But is he the only murderer? He plunged the blade but did he wield the knife? Ivan's guilt over his father's death wracks him. His father is killed by one who subscribes to a reductive understanding of his philosophy. Even worse, Ivan tacitly, and perhaps unconsciously, gives permission for the murder by going away and giving Smerdyakov the opportunity to kill. Ivan tries to exonerate Dmitri with his confession but he is too far gone with brain fever having carried this guilt. He wants to live up to Christ's ideals, but he is not strong enough.


At the end of the trial, Dmitri is found guilty. The book ends with a plan to escape with Grushenka to America, and then finally to return to Russia as Americans. Failed by his father and then his country, he hopes to return as someone else. But the outlook and future is not bright for him. The very last chapter is the funeral of the peasant father's son where we see Alexei inspire the children to be good and always hold in their hearts the good memories which will be their salvation. This ending shows that the base Karamazovian instinct can be overcome; that good can be sowed and reaped for a more hopeful future. It is a fine ending, but what really sticks with me is the chapter prior, the chapter of Dmitri's and Katerina's last meeting. Here, they confront each other honestly and tenderly. Here the truth of Dostoevsky's writing is synthesized so strongly, and I think that chapter speaks for the overal feeling of the book. They are melancholic and know they both will forever suffer, but they find comfort in the moment. Katya says to Dmitri:


“And you do not need my forgiveness, nor I yours; it’s all the same whether you forgive or not, all my life you will remain a wound in my soul, and I in yours - that’s how it should be…,”


A wound in the soul is perhaps the universal binds for each character in The Brothers Karamazov. Reading it, at times, also gave me one. But that is how it should be. There are many truths in this book, too many to touch on, but it never loses sight of the immediate nature of Man either. This isn't a book full of dense musings and academic philosophy, but of true life unfolding. Vibrant life; tragic life; love and yearning. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tj6agt/my_thoughts_on_the_brothers_karamazov_a_mirror_of/,2022-03-21 07:42:33,1,27,books
4z24wv,We the Living: Ayn Rand's not so provocative first novel,"*Spoilers Ahead* We the Living  was a somewhat surprising story in that it definitely had the style of Rand's later novels, but suffered storytelling-wise from its historical setting (meaning that her story was constrained by actual historical events). The novel centers around an adolescent girl named Kira, whose formerly wealthy family returns to St. Petersburg following the Russian Revolution. They find their estate confiscated and most of their belongings missing, and struggle to adapt to the Soviet structure of life. Kira is the only member of the family that doesn't seem openly distraught about the upheaval of their lives; she's adamantly opposed to the communist ideology, but she has enough self confidence to believe she can flourish in spite of the new political landscape.
The other two main characters (and ""points"" of the story's love triangle) are Andrei, a secret police agent that shares Kira's iron will, but with an opposing viewpoint, and Leo, the son of an executed aristocratic that shares Kira's opposition of the communists but lacks her resolve.
Throughout the novel, both young men (and nearly every other character besides Kira) are changed by the Soviet state; Andrei becomes increasingly disillusioned with his party, seeing the same corruption in it that the Tsarist empire exhibited, while Leo gets sucked into a black market scheme, which provides him with great wealth while destroying any ambition or hope he had for his life or future. Kira's constant goal is to escape Russia and into an idealized free Western world. Both of her lovers express a desire to flee with her, but through their own choices they meet different ends. There are no super-humans in this story, no John Galts or Howard Roarks to expose corruption and cleanse the world of it.
At the end of the novel, Kira attempts to illegally escape Soviet territory. After trudging for hours through the snow, a frontier guard fires on a sound he hears in the distance, hitting Kira in the chest. She does her best to continue on, but eventually realizes she is bleeding to death. At that moment, she feels content with her life and the act of living itself, not because of what she accomplished, but because of the potential for accomplishment. 
I think the novel succeeds best at being a Soviet ""slice of life"", similar to A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Lots of detail about Soviet life is displayed in the story, to the point where that new unfamiliar culture is almost a character itself. Through the myriad passages of Soviet speeches and propaganda, the importance of the living is marginalized while the ""fallen heroes"" are propped up as martyrs or saints. This is on full display during a funeral at the end of the novel, where a character that was hardly paid a second thought by society during their life was glorified by sycophantic mourners for hours on end. I believe this is the message presented in the title, that the Soviet Union was a nation that reveled in the flowery memories of the dead, and could not respect or provide for people focused on the lives ahead of them.

85bxre,Gore Vidal's The City and The Pillar,"Gore Vidal's The City and The Pillar 

Thoughts and a Request.

(Spoilers ahead)

I finished ""The City and The Pillar"" last night, and here's an analysis. (can't rightly be called so because it analyses only a certain aspect of the book)
starting with the author's (Gore Vidal) unabashed attraction toward his boyhood friend, baseball player, Jimmie Trimble.
To whom, The City and The Pillar is dedicated to (Mr. J. T.)
And, the Protagonist's relationship with his best friend. 

The book revolves around the life of Jimmy Willard and how after a brief summer encounter with his beautiful muscular friend Bob, he is all he can think about. Bob becomes his every thing, but particularly, his endgame.
 
Over the course of the book he finds sexual solace in many young men, however, the search for Bob remains his ultimate mission. (even calling him his ""terminal"" where his search for love would stop) 

Jim is infatuated with the thought of a reunion with Bob, of what might become of them if they rekindled their little summer romance. 

Bob is Jim's perfect fantasy,  his other half, ""his twin"", his brother, his obsession. There was nobody else he could commit to or fall in love with, but Bob, there was no way Jim could ever be whole without Bob. 
Jim, was insane. 

But it's this insanity that keeps him going.
and it's this insanity that makes this worth a read.
Which justifies the original end i.e Bob's demise at the hands of Jim, when on reconciliation, after years of seperation & dreaming of a perfect reunion, Bob doesn't return Jim's intense passion. 

Because in Jim's perfect world the alternative simply did not exist. His life revolved around Bob, without Bob, his life was pointless, an alternative where Jim lived knowing Bob would never feel the same way about him was unbearable. 

It's Jim's insanity, evident over the course of the book, that drives him to commit murder. he couldn't have Bob, his other half, so neither could anyone else. Jim was denied what he assumed, was entitled to him. 
Yes, Jim was insane. 

Jim's view on homosexuality is also warped, on sex & love, more so.  sexuality, sexual orientation and love are dealt with differently in this classic, based in the war torn mid 40s. societal pressure and the second world war play a pivotal role in the book. ""Every Person is bisexual in nature"" 

But despite of Jim's ridiculous attributes and borderline insanity every gay man can relate to him in at least one way.

two ways my 20 year old virgin ass (pun intended) could do so, were- 

clinging to an unattainable fantasy.
who hasn't fallen for a ridiculously handsome, straight boy perfect in every conceivable way. 
we read signs that aren't really there, believe the unbelievable. Only to find out this case of unrequited love was doomed from the start.
Jim was Bob's after-after-thought
Bob was Jim's only thought. 

Loneliness. Jim was extremely lonely. and melancholic. his relationships are little more than flings because eventually he would find Bob and then, his life would be perfect. 
Loneliness is his constant companion. 


Jimmie Trimble was Vidal's  inspiration. 
A set of essays released in 1996 
 reveal how infatuated he was with him. (even calling him his other male half) 

""So we simply came together, reconstituting the original male that Zeus had split in two. Yet ""sexual pleasure could hardly account for the huge delight we took in one another's company."" 

writes Vidal, about Trimble. 

Like Bob, Trimble also went to sea and Vidal was more than eager to find out what would happen on his return. But he never did. Jimmie Trimble died in the line of duty at Iwo Jima, 1945. 
Of what could have become of them, Vidal would never find out. 

This must have been when Gore Vidal penned The City and The Pillar, around 25, fulfilling a fantasy he could now only dream of. 

Then why should Jim get a happy ending when Vidal never would, he (Jim) had to live with an answer (ultimate rejection) Vidal was dying to find. 

No, Jim would suffer. 

The book that now circulates is the revised '65 version which lacks the unabashed narrative of a frustrated young man in love. the new ending was promising, as if Vidal regained composure and rewrote his adolescent whims. 

which is why the '48 version was a classic and the '65 one, less so. 

I happened to have read the revised one and the last two chapters of the '48 one. 

My Request- does anyone here own the ebook version of the 1948 edition of The City and The Pillar? feel free to Direct Message me if you've read either version.

ymi7wc,The Dark One by Nikki St Crowe (God I am so sick of booktok authors),"The Dark One is a continuation of The Never King, and it really should have been one longer book. Ending every book on a cliffhanger, especially when said books are 200 pages long, is lazy writing. It's a cheap tactic to piss off your readers, so they feel obligated to buy the next book to know what happens. If the author had taken the time to storyboard and plot, if she took the time to edit and get beta readers and IDK, maybe do some research, this could have been a lot better. Instead, we're given something that should be available for free on Wattpad....honestly, more like Literotica. Both books contain fragments, grammatical/spelling errors, repeating one-sentence paragraphs, stilted dialogue and plot holes. There are barely any descriptions of people, places and things. While The Dark One gets a little better at describing places, that's all we get. Imagining Neverland is very difficult--in fact, that's one of the big reasons I dislike this book so much. Nikki is borrowing the world of Peter Pan, yet she's expanded it to give us several more islands, but we know next to nothing about any of them. We know one is called Everland, and one is called Darkland. (How original.) There is next to no immersion. The plot makes no sense, and the sex comes at the most inopportune moments. All the boys ever think about is how bad they want to fuck Winnie. I find it a bummer that Nikki only cares about writing sex. I expected to read a book about Neverland. I expected to understand the world and its magic but nope.  


So in The Never King. Winnie Darling, a distant relative of Wendy Darling, gets kidnapped by Peter Pan. According to her mentally unstable mother, Merry (who is a prostitute), Peter Pan will come for her on her 18th birthday and 'break her'. Her mother never shares why Peter will come for her, and she never clarifies how he's going to break her. Peter has been doing this to all the women in the Darling family for generations. You would think Merry would tell her daughter what to expect. We later find out that Peter is kidnapping Darlings because the original Darling stole his shadow and hid it away. Why? Because Tinkerbell was jealous and convinced her to do it, somehow. Then, when she was finished, Tinkerbell killed her so he can't find his shadow and then Pan killed Tinkerbell in revenge. Peter spends the next however many years taking female Darlings from their homes when they turn 18 to extract memories from them...because apparently, they can retain their ancestor's memories.   


Why age 18? Was it simply so the story could have that sexual undertone? Because there was a huge emphasis on Winnie 'just turning 18' in the previous book and like...yet another reason why this book feels supremely icky. Also, why is it only the daughters that get taken? In the original story, the daughters of Wendy's line fly with Peter, but that's wholesome. This makes no sense. What about Darling sons? If the Darling women are already aware of their fate, why would they continue to have children willingly? Did no one ever take a male Darling to Neverland to see if he might also retain his ancestor's memories? What if that was the problem all along? What is it about the female mind that allows them to have this quirk?? If Nikki had actually plotted this book perhaps these are things she could've addressed and explained.   


When Peter takes Winnie to Neverland, he clarifies to all the Lost Boys that they're not allowed to touch her(in a sexual way, of course.) Peter says that fucking the Darlings is how they got into this mess in the first place. And it's later explained that Peter was in love with OD, so I assume this means they slept together. Naturally, that makes Tinkerbell jealous, and she goes about her shadow stealing. So Peter creates this rule that the Lost Boys can't touch the Darlings anymore even though the one who killed the OD in the first place is no longer alive. Then Winnie shows up, and it takes a grand total of two days for them to break the rule. And what happens? Nothing. There are no consequences at all. So what was the point?! Also, sex with the Lost Boys is so good that Winnie decides she wants to live in Neverland forever. She's known these boys a total of maybe 3 or 4 days at best, and she is ready to live with them FOREVER.   


And that's it. That's your summary of The Never King, pretty much. Now we're onto book two. Now, if this had been one longer book, Nikki could have spent time fleshing out the different islands of Neverland. She could have spent time creating actual personalities for her 97 POV characters so that they didn't all sound like one single entity.   


The Dark One begins where The Never King left off, which furthers my belief that it should have been ONE BOOK. Peter opens the box that contains his shadow and TWO pops out. WOW. So far, I've got no idea what a shadow does in this world. In Barrie's version, the shadow represents Pan's inability to age. And there are theories that it's supposed to mean that Pan is dead. But in this, we have both a life and a death shadow. So, who knows what that means? I know having a death shadow makes you Neverland's Dark One. Now, I was under the impression that Vane was Neverland's Dark One, but apparently, he is the Dark One on a different island. Can you guess which island? DARKLAND. Also, the Dark One makes me think of Once Upon a Time and Rumplestiltskin and how Peter Pan was his father. I'm convinced that's where Nikki got 95% of her Inspo for this.   


I wish there were more information on the faeries of this world. I'm far more interested in the mechanics of Neverland than anything else. I'm curious as to how Neverland is compared to the real world. They live in a giant tree but have a working stove and light switches. They somehow can brew coffee with an actual coffee machine. I know there's a magical lagoon, I know that they find Hook in a place called DARLINGTON(lmao, what?!). That's about all I know because Winnie spends the rest of her time fucking the Lost Boys or thinking about how she wants to fuck the Lost Boys. And don't give me that excuse of 'this is a fantasy. It doesn't need to be explained."" That's precisely WHY it needs to be explained. What's the point of writing a fantasy novel if you're not going to tell us about the world you've built? This book is only about fucking the Lost Boys(which, if you want to write all about sex, there is nothing wrong with that. Go for it. More power to you. But why choose a fairytale centered around children?) It's never explicitly stated if these things exist because of Neverland's magic, they're just there, and I'm supposed to accept it. When I read fantasy of any sort, I'm always wondering how things work. That's what happens when you read something, guys.   


Back on track. Now that Winnie is permanently staying in Neverland, Pan and the Lost Boys, except Vane, are no longer interested in the other girls in Neverland. Or as they're so kindly called 'lost pussy.' And this all has to do with Winnie. They don't want her to see them interact with other girls because it'll hurt her fee-fees. But again, they have known her for FOUR DAYS at this point. Maybe a bit more. What is so special about Winnie that it's changing the personality of every single boy she meets? (Not that they had much character, to begin with, that is.) Kas is even willing to forgo getting his wings back for her. The answer? Nothing. Winnie has absolutely nothing unique or special except that she doesn't care that she was kidnapped and gang-banged. They think of her as fuck doll basically--if I have to hear them call her 'our Darling' one more time, I'm going to vomit. I know Winnie acts like it's all cute and like a unique nickname, but they called every Darling that came to Neverland Darling. If you wanted to make it memorable, they would call her by her real name. Or like Vane did exactly one time 'Win'. And like it's OK, I guess if you want to write about a girl just there to get fucked(I don't get that as a kink but whatever), I still don't understand why these boys are so invested in Winnie. I don't get why Vane, the meanest and scariest out of all of them, rescued her from having her mind broken. What was the point of even GOING to the fae palace? He repeatedly rebuffs her advances, tells her no, and tells her to back off, but she doesn't listen because she's determined to have him. She even goes as far as to start trying to unbutton his pants, and then when he attacks her for it, everyone acts like he was in the wrong. But in reality, she was the one who assaulted him. She's a repeat assaulter. She even shoved her hand down Kas and Bash's pants when they told her they weren't in the mood to entice them to fuck her.   


We know nothing about Winnie except that she likes sex. We know that her prostitute neighbor was ""the best"" and taught her to use her body to get what she wanted from an extremely young age. Remember, by the end of this book, Winnie just turned 18 like a week ago, and she claims to have been having sex for years. So, she was groomed by this neighbor and nowhere is this depicted as evil. There's nothing wrong with enjoying sex, but THIS is not okay. I don't think there's anything wrong with having multiple partners, nor do I find experimenting as a teenager wrong. Winnie's behavior could be understandable if it were made clear that her neighbor groomed her, and it was not okay, but it's talked about if it's a great thing and only her insane mother was the problem. (Let's not mention that that was Pan's fault.) I understand that Stockholm syndrome happens, but it takes TIME to happen. Not two days. It's a gradual thing, ya'll. It's a psychological thing. If Winnie were trying to sleep with everyone as a way to one-up and escape, I'd understand that. But she's doing it because she is *desperate* for their attention, which I don't get. Like...Idk, man; I just don't get it. There's a point where Winnie feels literal envy for coffee steam because it's closer to Peter's face than she is????? She is so pathetic; I can't even.   


Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand the desire to write about sex with ""just-18-year-olds"". As a grown-ass woman, at least write about ADULTS having sex. Not freshly turned 18 girls. It's the same as a man obsessing over 'barely legal 18 years old!!!' porn. Winnie is infantilized constantly. When they talk about her appearance, they call her tiny and weak and skinny all the time(yet, she murdered a pirate without even breaking a sweat and super quickly, too??) and then they call her a little girl all the time. It's disgusting. There is a hefty emphasis on her age in The Never King and how the Lost Boys are meant to look like teenage boys who are all supposedly super hot. The line was, ""boys with the presence of men."" Like...Nikki, you are married with a child. What are you doing?  


EDIT: I deleted a paragraph because I thought the original Darling was Wendy, somehow, but it got lost in translation. I was mistaken. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ my b  


Cherry and Captain Hook also get POV chapters in this. And they're also apparently siblings. Cherry is another Winnie POV because the only thing she cares about is getting fucked by Vane. She dreads seeing her bro but has to make sure she looks cute since she's going to be with Vane. She wears a dress and no panties to trek through the fucking jUNGLE. She calls herself the only girl amongst the lost boys even though there are 'town girls' at the Never Tree ALL THE TIME. And since everyone on Neverland supposedly never ages, she would have seen all the past Darlings when they came to Neverland since Hook kidnapped Wendy at some point and used Cherry as a bartering chip when Peter retaliated by kidnapping Smee. Also, Hook says Cherry was a child when he lost his hand, but...we're told people don't age in Neverland...so does that mean Cherry is a child?? Did this book actually hit the pedophilia mark? She talks shit about Winnie 24/7, which is so pick me of her. ""Her boobs aren't as big as mine, and she's rail thin."" ""I'm bruised cuz he fucked me, Winnie is bruised cuz she assaulted him and made him mad, so he choked her."" \*smug grin\* OKAY? CHERRY? WHAT'S YOUR POINT?   


Winnie asks Pan how can she get Vane when he’s been rebuffing all her advances, and he tells her to stop trying so hard, and Winnie has an epiphany about it. OF COURSE, MAYBE I SHOULDN’T THROW MYSELF AT SOMEONE WHO HAS REPEATEDLY TOLD ME NO!? She’s so desperate to make sure all the Lost Boys are with only her that she’s willing to do whatever is possible to get the one who DOESN’T WANT HER. (yes, I know that he eventually gives in and claims he wanted her all along, but up until then, we didn't know that, and it reads as rapey af) I want to clarify that this is not a sexy thing to do. I don’t give a fuck if this is a dark romance and that it’s a woman pursuing the man. When you are repeatedly told no or ATTACKED because you don’t take no for an answer, then SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOU. IT’S NOT SEXY THAT WINNIE WON’T ACCEPT NO FOR AN ANSWER. IT’S GROSS. You have three other Lost Boys willing to fuck you, Winnie. Accept that and move on.   


Winnie learns at some point, her mom was pregnant with her while in Neverland. (I have SO many questions.) Peter explains that Merry was someone he and the Lost Boys were fond of, which contradicts every internal thought they have ever had but alrighty. Winnie acts shocked that her mom never told her when her mom never told her ANYTHING. Now that she knows this, suddenly she's like, omg, you're right, Neverland felt like home from day one(what? where?), and he says...he says...that because she was there when she was a FETUS...THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE'S IN HIS ARMS, IT FEELS LIKE HE'S COME HOME?!?!? I want to leave this place.   


Some stuff happens, Pan gets his shadow, and they all win--Winnie also gets a death shadow. THE BOOK ENDS. At least now, there won't be such a power imbalance between her and the Lost Boys. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   


Sex scenes...there's not much I can say without my head exploding, so I'm going to try to keep this short. Those of you who find this hot....are you okay? Do you need some help? Do you genuinely think getting your clit rubbed by a soapy rag feels terrific? (also, you shouldn't WASH YOUR VAGINA BRO. YER GONNA GET A YEAST INFECTION.) Do you orgasm in 30 seconds from a couple of thrusts and zero foreplay? Because I don't buy that for a minute. It feels like highway robbery that people had to pay for this.   


There are points when she’s writing from Kas’ perspective, and then literally, she forgets whose POV she’s supposed to be writing from and switches to Bash’s. If you need to look for yourself, one example is in chapter 15. and then once again in chapter 18 when Winnie forgets that it was Bash who tied her up TWO SECONDS ago but said it was Kas.   


Anywho...that's all I've got. With every booktok recommended book I read I am more and more inclined to not support authors who promote on booktok.

p01amp,Opinion: C.J. Tudor’s “The Other People” is full of plot holes (SPOILERS!!!),"Needless to say, massive spoilers for the whole story ahead.

&#x200B;

I recently finished the book “The Other People”, written by C. J. Tudor; I haven’t read any other review of this book - therefore, my apologies if what I am about to type has already been said -; I haven’t read any other book by that author, and I started that novel without knowing what to expect, save for the summary, which in the edition I got is:

>Driving home one night, Gabe sees the face of five-year-old Izzy in the rear window of the car in front. She mouths one word: ‘Daddy.’ He never sees his daughter again.  
>  
>Hardly anyone believes the truth - that Gabe saw his daughter the day she and his wife disappeared. The police believe they’re dead. But three years later, Gabe still drives the roads, searching for the car that took Izzy, never giving up hope. It’s hard for most people to understand. But Gabe has found some who do - in an online group set by those who have also lost loved ones. They call themselves “The Other People.”  
>  
>When the car that Gabe saw driving away that night is found in a lake with a body inside, Gabe is suddenly under suspicion and in danger. In desperation, he turns to the Other People for help. Because they are good people who know loss, pain, and death. There’s just one problem… they want other people to know it too.

Okay, so let’s first talk about how the summary does not completely match the story (though that may not be the author’s fault, I don’t know): Gabe did not turn to the Other People for help, it’s one of them that came for him, and Gabe did not seek any further service from that “organization”. Then, there’s pretty much no reason to suppose that those behind the group are “good people” - the opposite, in fact. It isn’t some weird vigilante justice thing - there is no question of justice in that at all. People can use the website to easily hire others to kill children. We also can’t really assume that they know loss and pain; death, yes, clearly, since they’re committing murders in exchange for other murders, but loss and pain? Not necessarily. They could be just greedy sociopaths like Miriam. That very last line make is sound like it’s about revenge... however, once again, not necessarily.

&#x200B;

Anyway, let’s move on to the actual story, and I’ll explain why I think it is absolutely full of plot holes - and I’m not talking about the odd, unexplained thing that happens with Isabelle near the end; I mean the very premises of the book. 

&#x200B;

Indeed, the whole investigation process described in the book seems off to me. I’m no expert - and if you think I’m wrong, feel free to tell me, naturally - however my comments are based on very common knowledge.

For example, the entire dilemma with Gabe‘s belief that the dead little girl is not his daughter (which is a major part of the novel‘s plot) could have been cleared up very quickly, right after the murder, through finger print comparison and DNA testing. I mean, why didn’t they just do that? Izzy‘s finger prints had to be all over the house; there’s absolutely no way Fran would’ve been able to get rid of all of them, and/or somehow get all of her own daughter’s finger prints all over the place. Finger prints would be a highly reliable way to find out that the child found dead is actually not Izzy, as every person, including identical twins (according to my short Google searches), has different finger prints. And even if, somehow, Fran had been able to wipe away every finger print of Izzy’s in the house (which is pretty much impossible in Fran’s situation), it would still be clear to the police that someone has tried to hide the dead little girl’s identity, as not finding any finger print of a kid in a house in which they have lived for years would have, I assume, immediately raised a red flag. Besides, what about the car that Gabe was driving that day? It is very likely - if not certain - that at some point Izzy was in that car and must have touched something with her fingers directly, and since Gabe was inside that car, Fran did not have any access to it.

And then, there’s the option of DNA testing; DNA can be found in hair - surely Izzy had a brush? And even if none of her DNA could be found in the house (which seems improbable to me), the police have Jenny’s cadaver, and Gabe would be there to provide his DNA as well; unless there’s a story of a baby switched at birth, when the test results would’ve shown that neither Jenny nor Gabe are the parents of the dead girl, I’m pretty sure the police would’ve figured out that Gabe was right when he insisted that it was not Izzy. 

In my opinion, that‘s a critical plot hole, as there’s no way to fix it without changing a lot of the story. I mean, from what I just looked up, fingerprinting was first used in criminal investigations in 1882 (and the first time a criminal was convicted thanks to DNA evidence was in 1987) so it’s not like a different timeline could’ve gotten rid of that huge plot hole. And anyway, Internet is necessary for the very concept of the group of “The Other People”. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, it seems to me that the police’s investigation as described in *The Other People* was incredibly sloppy and careless - at the end, it turned out that the person who’d sent a hitman to kill Jenny and Izzy was motivated purely by money, that she - Miriam - would get through inheritance. How did the police manage to miss that? (I’m not even going to talk about how little sense it makes for Charlotte Harris to give her whole fortune to the guy who’s responsible for her daughter being in a likely perpetual coma; I prefer to focus on the other type of plot holes) They were obviously aware of Gabe’s past, and had found out about his inheritance of an enormous amount of money… how could they not find out that Miriam would be the one to inherit, if Gabe was framed for the murders of his wife and his daughter? Shouldn’t the police be looking for who could benefit from the deaths of Jenny and Izzy? I mean, money is, after all, one of the most common motives for murder, right? And since they knew that Gabe had an alibi, they should’ve dug a little further into the chain of inheritance, and unavoidably they would’ve figured out that Miriam was next. Yet it sounds like they didn’t even consider her a suspect... how incompetent. 

Besides, it didn’t seem like the police in that book made a lot of efforts to track back that car which had allegedly been used to kidnap a little girl. In real life, such crimes happening to children are definitely the top priority for any police investigation, am I right? The novel does mention that the police asked for the driver to come forward - and they obviously didn’t - but come on, would they really just stop there? As Izzy had indeed been kidnapped (although she was thankfully unhurt), it’s hardly likely for the driver to come forward! In that case, shouldn’t the police try their best to find out where that car was first sold - and where one could find those weird, attraction-catching stickers - and thus trace back whoever bought it (or the stickers)? From the description, it’s a pretty noticeable car. I read a Scandinavian book (of fiction) written in the sixties in which the detectives were looking for a certain car, and in that novel they contacted every place where the car could’ve been sold - and that was happening nearly fifty years ago; with nowadays technology, that has to be much easier to do. Sure, the US is a far larger nation than any Scandinavian country, and much harder to comb through, but still... in *The Other People*, it‘s like the police didn’t even try. 

Also, how was the disappearance of both Fran and her daughter not noticed by anyone? Wouldn’t teachers be alarmed by the sudden, continuous absence of a five-years-old, and without obtaining any answer from the mother? I’m pretty sure any responsible teacher would soon alert the police if a five-years-old abruptly stopped showing up at school and they weren’t able to contact the parent(s) at all. 

It as well seems like a huge (hence unlikely) coincidence that Fran has a daughter that looks so much like Izzy that police officers would be able to mistake Emily (Fran’s daughter) for Izzy and that the two little girls go to the same school. 

&#x200B;

And then, there’s the fact that Miriam really should have known that Gabe would have an alibi for when his wife and daughters would be killed: Gabe was on his way to seeing Isabelle, and it was always the same hour of the same day of the week! How could Miriam possibly forget that? 

&#x200B;

At that point, one needs to talk about another element of the book that doesn’t make much sense: Gabe’s driving constantly around the place where he last saw his daughter in that other car, hoping to somehow find the car in question. 

To me, this appears incredibly stupid.

Would it not be, in fact, one of the places where he is the most unlikely to find Izzy? Why would the kidnapper go back there - especially considering that Gabe’s driving around is no secret? 

&#x200B;

Okay, presently let’s address the aspect of the book that gave it its title: the website on the Dark Web introduced in the story, named ”The Other People”. Now, that’s really not something I’m very knowledgeable about, so please correct me if you think I’m wrong. But seriously, how could such a website work for so long without the police ever stumbling across it? Among all the people who, like Katie, had been given the passwords, not one of them went to the police? I mean, technically it’s possible, nevertheless it appears quite unlikely. 

&#x200B;

Moreover, there are many parts of the story that remain completely unexplained - which I personally found pretty frustrating, particularly as I was intrigued by these elements. Like, what was up with Izzy/Alice’s habit to drag a bag of pebbles around? And why was she so scared of mirrors? At some point at the beginning of the book, Izzy goes to the bathroom, and faints, and when Fran comes to pick her up, she notices that it appears that one of the mirrors has been broken from the other side of the mirror, as there were no shards of glass in the sink, only around it. We never get an explanation regarding that either… what, did someone take the mirror off the wall, stood next to the sink, and, facing the back of the mirror, punched it hard enough for it to break, and all of this while Izzy was sleeping? Why? And what were Isabelle’s last words about? And who was the girl Izzy kept seeing in mirrors - aside from herself? It seems to be that it was Isabelle, but how on Earth would Izzy know about her? The accident happened like at least a decade before Izzy was even born. and I doubt that Gabe ever took her along to see Isabelle. 

&#x200B;

Finally, I just wanted to say that Lou is an absolutely terrible mother, and Katie should really find someone more trustworthy to leave her children with. You don’t let random men in your house when you have children there. You just don’t. Ever. 

&#x200B;

To conclude, I‘m not saying that *The Other People* by C. J. Tudor is necessarily an awful book, but it requires an enormous amount of suspension of disbelief - far more than what I am personally willing to give to any thriller. This can’t really be called a mystery novel, since there are so many things that don‘t make sense that it is impossible to guess what’s going on. I’ve never read anything else by this author, so I don’t know if that‘s her usual style, and if my expectations - I thought it would be a (more or less) realistic thriller - were plainly erroneous. That novel wasn’t that bad - it was rather enjoyable to read, and it did keep me reading and wanting to know what would happen next, as there was enough suspense; I was not bored while reading this book. However, as a thriller, I found it highly disappointing.

This review will be spoiler-free.

In the year 1981, Salman Rushdie's *Midnight's Children* was published. That novel won the Booker Prize and would be considered by many his greatest literary achievement. The year is now 2021; *Midnight's Children* enjoys its fortieth anniversary and Salman Rushdie, who still lives, enjoys a body of fiction that right now numbers at twelve novels. This pandemic era, while for many a tragic and irretrievable period, had its bright spots. 2021’s brightest spot for me was falling in love with literature all over again. Salman Rushdie saved me. That is hyperbole of course. Salman Rushdie never saved me. I have never met the man. Our acquaintance is limited to me reading his books. Alas, his work, when I discovered him, was a vivid flare that helped me fend off my own breed of personal darkness in these trying times. 

In the span of only a few months’ time, I read all twelve of his novels. This is both a review of each individual work and a comprehensive reading guide. I do not believe in arbitrary numerical scores when it comes to novels; you will not find them here. Instead I will just tell you what the novels were about, what I loved, what I did not love, and who I think each novel is for. Said novels will be categorized into three groups. The first group will be my personal favorites. This group represents the novels I am most infatuated with, advocate for, and would recommend to any literary friends in my personal life. While these novels are excellent, they may or may not be the optimal options for an entry point into Mr. Rushdie’s fiction. The second group is what I will dub the essentials. These are also novels I love but these also are, in my opinion, novels that must be read in order to capture his contribution to the world of literature. If any one person were to choose to read only a single novel from Rushdie, then they should choose one of the novels from this group. The last but not least group of books will be books, in my eyes, reserved only for the Rushdie enthusiast, for the Rushdie completionist. Make no mistake; these are in no way bad or worse novels than the ones aforementioned. These novels are good but if read by themselves, they could be very misleading and may make some readers form an incomplete picture of Rushdie as an author. You should be immediately skeptical of anyone recommending you start with any of the novels in this group. 

**1. First impressions…**

*Shalimar the Clown* (2005)

*Shalimar the Clown* gets its own section in this post and it will serve as an introduction. When this year began, I never heard of Rushdie. I picked up this novel on a recommendation. Despite *Midnight’s Children* being much beloved in many circles, I chose *Shalimar the Clown* because I usually prefer to choose my own entry point with new authors. Why this novel? I could not tell you why. I don’t remember in the slightest. I think now, without an inkling of a doubt, that I could not have chosen a better introduction to Rushdie. *Shalimar the Clown* splendidly performs two functions for me: its characterizes Rushdie as an author and establishes the motifs that permeate and construct his work. What is the novel about? The plot begins in California. A well-dressed, urbane man of no young age is murdered by his driver. We learn in time that the man murdered came to be a critical figure in the United State’s counter-terrorism apparatus. We learn in time that the murderer is a shameless terrorist, or was he more than that? We learn in time that the murderer was no more than an otherwise ordinary man, suffocating on the bitterness of a long, lost love. 

That’s the premise. You will see a version of that summary as a blurb most places you look. You heard the plot but what’s the story? Here, Rushdie displays his talent at simultaneously telling an intimate, individual, character-oriented plot and at the same time mobilizing large, complex ideas. This is one recurrent attribute in Rushdie’s novels: the fact that it is difficult to confine a description of them to a single sentence. *Shalimar the Clown* is a tragic love story, told against the backdrop of Kashmir and California. *Shalimar the Clown* is also a meditation on terrorism. Like nearly all of Rushdie’s novels, *Shalimar the Clown* is an examination of the nature of belief, religion, and religious fundamentalism. Like nearly all of Rushdie’s novels, *Shalimar the Clown* is also an excoriating look at Middle Eastern and Middle Asian geopolitics and history. I’d like to see you summarize all of that in one short sentence. The stories that Rushdie tell are never flat; they are faceted. They are dimensional. They are always more than what they first seem to be. Rushdie is unafraid to juggle multiple knives. He is unafraid to make us feel afraid, to feel foolish, to feel. Most of the time it works brilliantly and nothing is hurt; most of the time. These novels might be action packed sometimes but Rushdie does not produce pulpy page turners. These are slow, excruciating portraits of real people and real places. Speed demons, beware. These are dense, literary novels so rich with substance that they are being studied in classes today. I will be the first to confess that much of the nuance about what is said about this region of the world is perhaps being lost on me. I am woefully undereducated about countries such as Pakistan, Kashmir, and India; but Rushdie did successfully whet my interest in learning much more. 

Another important aspect of Rushdie’s novels is how they are unapologetically postmodern. It didn’t quite take one-thousand-and-one-nights to read all twelve of his books but that story is clearly one of his key inspirations. These novels are often non-linear, overlapping, parallel, layered Russian nesting dolls of narratives. They are filled with ever-changing perspectives, fluctuating pace, dream sequences, and often the all-colorful dream-logic magic realism that harkens to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. On the subject of magical realism, Rushdie was my first exposure to this movement. However, you will find little of it here. This twelve-novel escapade was a learning experience. I learned that magical realism exists on a spectrum. In novels such as here in *Shalimar the Clown*, and *The Golden House*, magical realism is merely a whisper, a suggestion. They are, for lack of a better word, more grounded. Then there are novels such as *Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty Eight Days* which almost disregards genre lines with devilish glee. 

Before this section ends, there are two specific things I would like to praise this novel for. The first being how Rushdie humanizes the people often called terrorists. I want to preface whatever I say next that I in no way condone the heinous atrocities committed by terrorists everyday in this modern world. I mean that Rushdie does not fall into the trap of reducing terrorists to faceless caricatures of hate and bigotry and fanaticism. Reducing any form of bigotry to a caricature solves nothing but widen the distance between people. I distinctly remember watching one documentary about a terrorist group in Afghanistan. A journalist was brave enough to enter their camp and interview them. They all stood around the journalist and cameraman, lounging with their rifles bared. There was one scene where the journalist was being shown one of the men’s home village, ravaged by American drone strikes. There they stood, in the rubble of their homes. I will ask you this: who is right? Is it the pilot who levels a village to kill one target? Is it the boy who grows up and takes revenge by driving a car bomb into a busy street? This question is not for me to answer. I don’t believe it can be. Terrorists, much like us, are people. They love, they long, they loathe, and they are capable of feeling and being wronged. 

Last, and a galactic distance from being least, is Rushdie’s prose. I will not be the first nor the last reader to ever draw comparisons between Vladimir Nabokov and Salman Rushdie. The extravagance of prose exists on a spectrum. Nabokov and Rushdie exist together at the very tips of opulence. They are both talented polyglots who render their imagination with intense beauty and erudition. There are many conversations about English language prose stylists. Any conversation that excludes Rushdie should quickly be enlightened. This is the universal truth about all of Rushdie novels: they are wrought with a decadent, maximalist, over-caffeinated prose. If you are tired of reading bland sentences, if you want to read an author who clearly loves the English language then you are doing yourself a massive disservice by not reading Rushdie. At some point in the plot, the novel takes a jarring change in perspective. We go from California to Kashmir. The sequences in Kashmir are some of the most wonderful, immersive pieces of fiction I have ever experienced. Kashmir, painted with such artistry, such delicacy, you would think was a magical place torn straight from the pages of *The Arabian Nights*. I would read the passages here and I would often close the book and close my eyes and picture myself there beneath sharp stars, absorbing like a sponge all the sights and smells of Kashmiri feasting and dancing. It was those passages alone that secured this novel a place in my Valhalla, as one of my personal favorites. Its also one that easily belongs in what are the essential Rushdie novels. This is *Shalimar the Clown*. It is gorgeous in some places. It is harrowing in others. You should read it. 

**2. My personal favorites…**

*The Moor’s Last Sigh* (1995)

Pepper. Salt. Cardamon. Cinnamon. Portraits that become moving pictures. A town where time does not pass. A mad artist with ice in his veins. A boy-man racing to his death. A criminal syndicate. Bombs, and some that are even nuclear. A family of spice merchants. This is *The Moor’s Last Sigh*. I have no idea whether Rushdie is a fan of the Russian classics. He probably is, given how well-studied he is. I imagine this is Rushdie's answer to *War and Peace*, and the lengthy, archetypal Russian epic. In a way, all of Rushdie’s novels are their own *War and Peace*. These are no short stories for the faint of heart or fleeting attention. These are magical realist stories as wide as they are deep, telling us the uncomfortable details of human lives from birth to death. *The Moor’s Last Sigh* is framed as the narrator, the last scion in a long line of Cochinese spice merchants, recounting to us the events including his family’s slow rise and meteoric decline. It is a story that spans across generations and across cities and across continents. Our Othello here is also a vehicle for exploring more of Indian history, Hindu Nationalism, the clash of beliefs in the subcontinent, and love. Love, love, love. The most potent spice of them all. Rushdie must be a romantic because love, like India, is a character in his books. Lovers in his books tend to have varying degrees of success as couples but love is unerringly portrayed as a potent and dangerous force. While reading this novel, I couldn’t help but notice the faint but irrepressible sensation of black pepper at the back of my throat. It must have been my imagination. After having years of life stolen from him by the fatwa, Rushdie returned to prove to the world that he was not at all creatively impoverished. 

Massive props to Rushdie for also conceiving the greatest sex scene in any novel ever. It might be the only competent sex scene ever written. You can’t convince me otherwise. Erotica authors and romance authors everywhere: read this book and take notes. Take notes. You’ll know it when you see it.

*The Ground Beneath Her Feet* (1999)

This is not quite a retelling of the Orpheus myths but more of a modern reframing of the Orpheus myths as a story of a fictional, legendary rock group from India. If *The Moor’s Last Sigh* was Rushdie’s homage to *War and Peace*, then this must be his homage to *Love in the Time of Cholera*. Another motif in Rushdie’s writing is the idea of duality, or rather an essential, Jungian “otherness.” Magical realism, as a device, is often deployed to make a statement about reality. In Rushdie’s own words, magical realism is best used to tell the truth in a new, creative way. I can say that he succeeded. Magical realism is used in Rushdie’s novels to highlight the faceted nature of human beings. There are no simple protagonists in these stories. Love, especially. Love returns as a character; this time, a more unrequited form of love. If you like Greek myths and tragedies, read this novel. If you like stories about sexy musicians, read this novel. If you like stories about unrequited love, this is definitely your novel too. 

Toni Morrison also loves this novel apparently, if that testimonial means anything. 

**3. The Rushdie essentials…**

*Midnight’s Children* (1981)

This was the novel I saved for last, on my reading list. I am hardly a scholar of literature. I doubt I could say anything approaching original about this timeless classic. I doubt I am saying anything original at all about any of these novels, as a matter of fact. Search the internet for any list-icle revolving around fiction rendered in the English language; you will find this novel on nearly all of them. I will never be on any awards committee. I will never truly understand the nuance required of awarding something as prestigious as the Booker Prize. This was not the first Booker I have read but after reading this, I started to see the very edge of understanding what actually is defined as a Booker Prize-worthy work. The best novels, written lovingly, are just portraits after all. What is *Midnight’s Children* a portrait of? Salman Rushdie is India and India is Salman Rushdie; this novel is a portrait of either or both. They are one and the same. *Midnight’s Children* is a portrait of a man and also a portrait of this many-limbed, ravenous, reasonless creature on Earth called a country. *Midnight’s Children* tells the story of the novel’s namesake, India’s midnight’s children, born at that hour when India gained its independence; each born with special powers. *Midnight’s Children* is also the perfect portrait of Rushdie as an author. It has, for good or ill, Rushdie’s signatures in their naked extremes: its genre-bending magical realism, its acrobatic prose, its self-satisfied narrator, its epic length,  its educational background, its personal pretense, its tragic lovers, its politics, its fairytale eroticism, and more. More and more and more. You do not need to devour the world to understand one person or one place; to come close, you would only need to read this novel. Then, and only then, might you come close to understanding because a world is encompassed in these less-than-one-thousand-and-one pages. You will either adore it or hate it. This novel is the gate. People are either turned away or encouraged to press on into the rest of Rushdie’s work. 

*Shame* (1983)

This is easy props to Salman Rushdie. He could have easily profited off himself and milked *Midnight’s Children* to death. Instead, he wrote a wholly original work that stands on its own. I loved *Shame* even more than I loved the aforementioned. In a way, they are each other’s companion piece. To tell a story about India, after all, is to also tell a story about Pakistan too eventually. Shame. By levelling an inquisitive gaze on the radicalized Not-Quite-Pakistan, Rushdie points an accusatory finger at the very soul of all hatred and bigotry: shame. The main character is an unlikeable, irreverent, skeptical physician born to three mothers; he is a gaping social and intellectual wound on the religious Pakistani society. *Shame* does nothing new or different than any other of Rushdie’s beloved novels but I must admit that out of all of them, this one has the most indulgent prose. 

**4. Novels for the Rushdie enthusiast only…**

*Grimus* (1975)

This is where it all started. This is Salman Rushdie’s debut novel. What is true of this novel is true to the rest of the novels in this group: one, that they are more difficult to rate, and two, that they include Rushdie’s more critically damned works. The sections on individual novels here will be shorter in this category for that reason.

*Grimus* reads like the novel I thought *The Satanic Verses* would be: its obtuse and somewhat inscrutable. Rushdie mentions in many of his interviews how he spent much of his youth infatuated with classic, pulpy science fiction literature. *Grimus* is Rushdie’s homage to those science fiction novels. This novel in particular is especially difficult because not only does it deploy esoteric ideas but its also draws heavily on, from what I could discern, Middle Eastern mythology and stories from obscure Sufi poetry. This combination of ideas, while interesting, is not always digestible. Hence why it is difficult to really conclude whether Rushdie is successful telling the story he wanted to tell. To me, I get the impression that this novel was Rushdie’s own personal experiment. This novel is just Rushdie proof to himself that he can be an author. Did I enjoy it and do I think its a good book? Yes, I did enjoy it. My time was not wasted but I found some parts of it unpalatable; I think it will be unpalatable to many other readers in general. 

*Grimus*: a long, prolix meditation on immortality. 

*The Satanic Verses* (1988)

Here it is: the infamous Satanic verses. The verdict? Its infamous for no good reason whatsoever but first, let me address the elephant in the room. This might be the most controversial part of my “review.” Yes, I am putting *The Satanic Verses* in the enthusiasts-only category. Why? Forget the notoriety for a moment. I personally do not think this novel does anything different than the novels nor better than the novels in my own favorites category or the essentials category. That’s not to say this is a bad novel. Its quite good and I loved it dearly. I just think that this is a horrible place to start if you want to try reading some of Rushdie’s work. 

So what is *The Satanic Verses* and what is so controversial about it? That is a loaded question but it gets easy if you think of the novel in parts. *The Satanic Verses* is one part novelization of the narrative of the Prophet Muhammed, told in dream or dream-like interludes. It is also one part magical realist parable about racism and  the immigration experience. It is one part, like all Rushdie’s novels ever written, also an exploration of religion and religious fundamentalism; although not quite the atheist parable it is often touted as often in lots of circles. That all sounds fine, right? So what was the “controversial” part? The “controversy” was generated from the first part I mentioned. In the “dream sequences” revolving around the prophet Muhammed, there are three essential things that upset the Muslim world. One: the suggestion that Muhammed, when receiving instructions from God or His archangels, was actually receiving instructions from the Devil. Two: the suggestion that Muhammed was told that Allah accepts several pagan deities of Mecca. Three: the suggestion that several Meccan prostitutes had taken the names of all of Muhammed’s harem. There is an unspoken fourth essential element that is perhaps the most damning: the suggestion that Muhammed was an ordinary man, flawed and fallible and possessing a capacity for as great ill as good; the suggestion that Muhammed could not hear gods nor archangels, and that he merely engineered his own instructions to use belief as a tool of control and manipulation. If I am being frank, the “present day” sections of the story were a little bit dry and definitely my least favorite stretches of the novel. They were by no means bad but I found myself far more enamored by the dream sequences. How much you enjoy *The Satanic Verses* depends on how much, or rather how little, you are already familiar with Islamic theology. I knew nothing. Which is why the sections taking place in the city of “Jahilia” were the most interesting to me. This point confounds me though. I don’t understand why this novel is so controversial among Muslims. From my rudimentary understanding of these complex subjects, *The Satanic Verses* does not make any original statements about the narrative of Muhammed. Perhaps someone more educated on this subject could enlighten me. 

So who is this novel for? I have no idea. It worked for me. The novel does make atheist suggestions but I wouldn’t call it the epitome of an atheist story. I wouldn’t exactly call this novel polemical either. I believe that this is one of Rushdie’s best books but at the same time, I do not think you will lose anything by skipping it. I often see this novel recommended as an entry point into the work of Rushdie. I said it before at the beginning of this review but I will say it again: I believe you should be immediately skeptical of anyone who first recommends any of the novels in this enthusiast category. That includes *The Satanic Verses*. To a serious devotee of English literature, I would only recommend this novel third. I am always going to recommend *Midnight’s Children* and *Shame* first. 

I will forever be exasperated by the fact the Rushdie had years of his life stolen from him over a novel so innocuous. 

Also, people are really overrating how hard this book is to read. Its really not that hard to read, people. Stop exaggerating that and trying to scare everyone. 

*Fury* (2001)

This is another novel that is hard to rate. This is, in my opinion, the closest thing Rushdie wrote to his weakest novel. At this point in my life, I have never read a single thing from Philip Roth. This novel reads like what I imagine a Philip Roth novel reads like. Rushdie says he is a massive fan of Philip Roth and that’s where I think this novel fails; *Fury* isn’t Rushdie writing at his best because here he is only writing in his best impression of another author. So what is *Fury* about? Like *The Satanic Verses*, *Fury* is a novel that can be described in parts. It is one part portrait of pre-9/11 United States. It is also one part satirization of the Philip Roth-esque, damaged artist-as-celebrity philanderer. I do not think this novel is as profound as it seems to be but at the same time, perhaps that is the point. Perhaps it is profound because its a story about shallowness. Perhaps that would be giving this novel to much credit. I would tell other people that they can skip this novel and not lose a wink of sleep. I don’t think my time was wasted reading this book but I don’t think I gained anything substantial either. 

*The Enchantress of Florence* (2008)

From what little discourse I have seen in online circles of Rushdie fanatics, there seems to be a prevailing sentiment that Rushdie’s weakest novels are the ones released after *Shalimar the Clown* but before *Quichotte*. I am going to have to take a stance here and wholly disagree. I absolutely adored all three of the novels published in this period of time. Do you like historical fiction? Do you admire the imagery and aesthetics of Renaissance Italy? You should definitely read this novel then. The reason why this is in the enthusiast category is because *The Enchantress of Florence* reads like a story told straight from the pages of *The Arabian Nights*. *The Arabian Nights*, much like the original and unsanitized fairytales compiled by the Brothers  Grimm and Andersen, are an acquired taste. Unless you have read and enjoyed *The Arabian Nights*, then you won’t enjoy this novel. *The Enchantress of Florence*, and the next novels Rushdie wrote, is the closest Rushdie will ever flirt with writing fantasy literature; fantasy in the vein of those old myths and folktales. This is the Rushdie sleeper-hit. 

*Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights* (2015)

This is another Rushdie sleeper-hit, where he flirts with fantasy. If you made it this far into the review, you will have seen that I do not think of *The Satanic Verses* as the premiere atheist novel. That title goes to this novel.

Earlier this year, I had the absolute pleasure of reading Ursula K. Le Guin’s *Earthsea Cycle* for the first time. I would describe that series as a feminist-flavored Taoist parable that criticizes the power structures often ideated by traditional fantasy literature. *Two Years, Eight Months, and Twenty-Eight Nights* (which I will now abbreviate as *TYEMTN*) is the *Earthsea Cycle*'s irreverent inverse. This novel I would describe as a magical realist, atheist parable that criticizes the power structures often ideated by religion.

Let’s get philosophical for a moment. Download this novel as a document you can edit. Search for and highlight every instance of the word Jinn or Jinni, then replace the word with either God or Allah. The effect? Nothing. Nothing would change. The story told is the same. If people are not responsible for their own actions, then who is? That is a central question posed constantly throughout the story. This central question and its exploration is the single most damning argument for atheism I have ever read. Forget Rushdie’s good friend Christopher Hitchens. Forget Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris or whatever flavor of famous atheist you choose to name. This novel is the premiere atheist novel, hiding shyly beneath the veneer of sheer fantasy. *TYEMTN* tells us the world we live in is fictional. In the real world, Jinn and Jinnis and their possession of us is the cause of human lust and greed and envy and hate and violence. Do you see the problem already? People on this planet already say that God compelled them to commit great or terrible deeds. A wealthy person gives half his fortune to charity; clearly it was a supernatural act. He must have been possessed by a good Jinn, or a Jinni in a good mood, so why should we bother recognizing his charity? A terrorist hijacks an aircraft and kills everyone aboard in a horrific suicide bombing; clearly he was possessed by an evil Jinni, or a Jinn in a bad mood. His actions clearly were not his own, so why should we punish him? The Jinn or Jinni told him to. This is the problem presented by the novel. This is the fissure, the gaping wound in all belief. To believe in God or Fate or astrology or what have you is to divorce human beings from blame, from agency. If you like your magical realism to suffocate you, read this novel. If you want to question all your beliefs, then read this novel; it is far more profound than it lets on. Don’t be fooled by all the magic bottles and sexy, wish-granting fairies. 

**5. A special section…**

*The Golden House* (2017) and *Quichotte* (2019)

These two novels deserve their own special section because they are both good and separate themselves from Rushdie’s *Fury*. I would firmly place *Quichotte* as one of the Rushdie essentials with the caveat that if you read *Quichotte*, I think you should also read *The Golden House* (which, individually, I would put *The Golden House* in the enthusiast column). The reason being is that these two novels represent an important period of Rushdie as an author. Rushdie, much like our king, Vladimir Nabokov, was eventually Americanized and his work was affected. These two novels, both in story and message, are uniquely American. Both novels are excoriating portraits of pre-Trump, Trump, and post-Trump America. All of America is naked; its ugliness, its bigotry, its anti-intellectualism, its pseudo-intellectualism, its hate, its violence, its detachment. Rushdie tells American stories with a distinct Hindu flavor and its brilliant. *The Golden House* being a satire about Trump-era America, vulnerable and full of humor. *Quichotte* is a hostile reprimand of America’s “trash culture:” its anti-vaxxers and flat-Earthers and reality TV stars and eccentric trillionaires and celebrated criminals. If you are American, definitely read these two novels. 

**6. Conclusions, Rushdie tropes, and Women…**

Earlier, in my discussion about *The Moor’s Last Sigh*, I praised Rushdie for conceiving the greatest sex scene ever seen in literature. I can happily praise Salman Rushdie for writing some of my favorite female characters too. *Shalimar the Clown* has the aptly named Californian named India and *The Moor’s Last Sigh* has the tiger-eating matriarch Isabelle de Gama. I love the female protagonists that Rushdie implemented. Despite all the sex and eroticism, you won’t ever find Rushdie on r/menwritingwomen; if you do, then I don’t think he belongs there. 

I am not saying Rushdie is faultless either. Rushdie’s body of work, like all authors, has its own idiosyncratic tropes: the young femme fatales, the nested storytelling, stories-as-homage, the cucks and cuckolds, the philanderers and playboys, the rich-have-problems-too, the seductresses, the lonely old men, et cetera, et cetera. However, in his defense, you probably won’t ever notice those tropes unless you read a lot of his novels like I did. 

I am not here to claim he is perfect. I am not here to be an apologist either. I only state that I think he writes female protagonists well and that his tropes, while not always amusing, are mostly forgivable. I included this section because I felt I must say this. There is a lot of discourse on this subject, especially in these online circles. 

Who is Rushdie for then? I think the novels of Salman Rushdie are there for all lovers of English literature. Those who have not been exposed to his work are missing an essential experience as a reader. If you love magical realism, if you crave prose style from a wordsmithing god, if you want post-colonial themes, if you want literature that will fuel your mind, then you should read Salman Rushdie. 

That concludes my review. Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, or want to let me know what you think, leave a comment. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p8xo73/i_read_all_twelve_of_salman_rushdies_novels/,2021-08-21 19:29:16,66,224,books
lij3xg,6 Things I learned from The War of Art by Steven Pressfield,"# 1) A mental force called resistance opposes all our endeavors, and affects everyone.

Have you ever had an ambitious dream but hesitated to act on it? Maybe you wanted to write a great novel or start an innovative new business, but a certain feeling held you back?

That feeling is called *resistance* – it's the force that forever keeps us from realizing our dreams and accomplishing what we were meant to do.

Anything new in our routine that takes us away from the habitual will be naturally accompanied by resistance. Resistance is negative, and it always opposes change or anything new. For example, if you feel a call to start a new business, resistance will be the voice that urges you to stay at your current job and not take a risk on a project that may fail. If you want to start a new diet, resistance will be the voice that tells you, “I can always start the diet tomorrow, even if I don’t today.”

This feeling of resistance is perfectly normal. It's impersonal and universal, and it affects anyone and everyone. Resistance also doesn't discriminate between interests – you'll feel resistance if you want to do something for yourself, like diet, or something to help others, like start a charity. We need to accept that resistance is natural and stop thinking that it targets us personally.

In fact, resistance even affects people who are experienced at what they do. For example, actor Henry Fonda, even in his late age, threw up before every theatrical performance. Being an accomplished actor didn't stop him from feeling fear each time he had to go on stage.

Resistance can manifest in many ways. Fear of failure, self-doubt or procrastination are different forms of resistance. We can learn how to defeat resistance by constantly refocusing on our dreams, committing to our craft and accepting that challenging resistance is a natural and necessary part of the journey. 

# 2) Resistance keeps us from becoming who we're meant to be, unless we use it to our advantage.

Is there something in life you feel you were meant to do? Maybe you want to write short stories, or design furniture? That's your *calling*: your greatest passion that satisfies your soul’s hunger.

We each have two separate lives, our *lived* and *unlived* lives. We live everyday in our regular life, but we have another *unlived* life where we have an unrealized dream.

Why are you waiting for the future to start working toward that dream? Probably because you feel fear and self-doubt, which are both forms of resistance. Resistance prevents us from realizing our unlived dreams. For example, if your dream is to write a great novel, you'll feel fear – maybe a fear of rejection by publishers, or of not meeting other people’s (or your own) expectations. That fear may stop you from even trying to write.

Instead of letting resistance stop you, use it to your advantage. It's okay to feel fear and self-doubt – these emotions mean that you truly care about your dream. You wouldn't be afraid of failing at something if you weren't deeply passionate about it. Fear can be a good indication that your dream is meaningful enough to pursue.

Even accomplished people still feel fear. This is illustrated by a sentiment often expressed by Hollywood actors. The host of *Inside* *the* *Actor’s* *Studio* often asks guests why they chose certain roles. Many professionals answer that they choose roles they're afraid of; they acknowledge that fear indicates their passion for those roles, so they should pursue them.

Like these actors, you can use fear to motivate yourself. Don’t be controlled by fear and self-doubt – instead recognize that these emotions can help you orient yourself toward the dreams that mean the most to you. 

# 3) The best way to fight resistance is to be a professional, and treat your dream like a full-time job.

How are you pursuing your dream? Do you try to work on it a few hours here and there? This is a mistake. Instead, try to think of yourself as constantly working on it – immersed in it, like a full-time job.

You can be quite creative in how you utilize your time for your dream, even if you still have a “regular” job. For example, Quentin Tarantino didn't go to film school but instead worked in a video rental store. He watched films at work and used his “free time” to direct small projects. Once, one of his projects was destroyed in a fire. Instead of feeling as if he had failed, Tarantino realized that even though he never got to finish the film, the project had still taught him more than any film school class could have.

A person like Tarantino who is dedicated and does not give up when faced with a setback is a ""professional."" His commitment to his craft proves it.

You can also transfer skills from your day job to your dream, even if your day job is very different. Do you go to work every day, on time? Do you keep working even when you have distractions in your personal life? You probably do. The self-discipline skills you hone at work can be applied as well toward your passion.

Like your regular job, working full-time toward your dream isn't always fun. But you often have the ability to power through your day job when you don't enjoy it, so you can also use that ability toward your dream.

Consider author Somerset Maugham, who was once asked if he wrote according to a schedule. ""I write only when inspiration strikes,"" he replied. ""Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine sharp.""

This is an important truth about professionals: they don’t sit around waiting for inspiration, but rather work hard, day in and day out. 

# 4) A professional defeats resistance by being organized, patient and boldly facing adversity.

Let's say your dream is to write a book, and you develop the self-discipline to sit down and write every day. You'll soon realize that resistance doesn't immediately go away. In fact, resistance may even increase as you keep writing, making you doubt your passions even more. However, you can weaken resistance by being persistent and organized.

To be a professional, you must be organized and patient. The author John Updike embodied this well in his writing process. He wrote every day, but focused on pacing himself evenly through the writing process. He didn't set unrealistic goals, such as speed-writing a novel in a week.

Like Updike, try to focus on the process of your work, rather than only imagining the end result. Focusing on the process instead of trying to achieve the goal as quickly as possible will help weaken resistance. It’s okay if the process is slow, as that's normal – you must be patient if you want the best results.

As part of focusing on the process, also learn to accept that you'll always face adversity along the way. Instead of quitting when you face a problem, train yourself to view new challenges as steps to overcome to reach your goal.

Oprah Winfrey is a great example of a professional who has overcome challenges. At the onset of her career, few people expected that a talk show hosted by a black woman could gain a following, as the field was dominated by white men. She also wanted to focus on her guests' personal lives and emotions, which was uncommon at the time.

However, Oprah remained dedicated to her vision. Within months of starting, she created the most-watched morning show in America, and helped bring to light many previously undiscussed issues, such as obesity and bullying. Instead of backing down against criticism, Oprah used it as motivation to work harder, as a true professional would. 

# 5) Professionals battle against hierarchies to achieve their goals.

Whether in the workplace, on Wall Street, in Hollywood or even in high school, everyone has had to face the structure of social hierarchies in their life. Hierarchies exist everywhere. The one thing hierarchies share is that they always oppose change, dictating a fixed place for every member of the hierarchy.

Most people define themselves in and are defined by hierarchies in their lives, and usually hierarchies are quite restrictive.

For example, many people struggle in workplaces that oppose giving creative freedom to employees. The work hierarchy instead keeps everyone in a particular role. In such environments, thinking “outside the box” is not tolerated.

When we're working within a hierarchy, we're forced to censor our actions by trying to guess what our audience (or customers) will want from us. We're forced to evaluate our success by our place in the hierarchy, and thus we're compelled to constantly try to climb within the hierarchy. Also, hierarchies encourage us to view other people as a means to achieving our goals, rather than as individuals.

Professionals do not define themselves by their place in a hierarchy. Rather, professionals battle hierarchies by remaining true to their craft, and working for themselves rather than for an audience.

For example, Steve Jobs, an exceptionally noteworthy professional, was a notorious perfectionist and steadfast believer in his vision. He insisted on deciding everything about the products he developed, from their design to how customers would interact with them. By working to realize his own vision, rather than trying to guess what others might like, he created the successful consumer electronics company, Apple.

Another example can be found with the German author Rainer Maria Rilke, who once told a young poet that he should write to please himself, not the critics. He spoke of an important truth regarding professionals: when your goal is to be proud of your own work, the work will be better. 

# 6) Professionals commit themselves to a certain territory where they work to achieve their goal.

Whether it's writing a hit song or directing an Oscar-winning film, each one of us has our own specific calling. And the place where professionals work on their calling is called their *territory.*

For example, in the case of former Mr. Universe Arnold Schwarzenegger, body-builder, actor and politician, his territory is the gym. So how do you know where your territory is?

First off, your territory is where you feel “sustenance.” In this place, you feel satisfied and challenged, as if you’re bettering yourself when you spend time and work there. You can bet every time Schwarzenegger went to the gym, he felt much better afterward than he did before!

Second, your territory is the place you lay claim to through hard work, and through hard work only. Of course many other people used the gym as well, but Schwarzenegger made the space his own by working out there, day after day after day.

Third, your territory is an endless resource. The only limit to how much your territory can give you back for your work is determined by how much you put into it. Consider Woody Allen, whose territory isn’t physical like Schwarzenegger’s, but rather is the realm of film. Allen has written over seventy screenplays and directed nearly fifty films! By working hard in his territory, he has received more and more opportunities to be creative and has been able to work in his territory even more – and even expand it.

Like Woody Allen, you can shape and claim your territory through hard work and dedication.

Professionals who successfully commit to their territory don’t only benefit themselves but also even change the larger field in which they work. For example, the early work of entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in their territory of computing completely changed the world. Personal computers went from being expensive, complex machines to user-friendly tools that anyone could own and operate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lij3xg/6_things_i_learned_from_the_war_of_art_by_steven/,2021-02-12 19:49:18,16,43,books

qcv9et,Anybody who is excited for sometime of apocalypse or major world ending event. Needs to read The Road,"I just finished listening to The Road and damn I have not had a book consume me like that in a long time! I literally started it during my morning workout, listened to it on my commute to work, and listened to it while at work, and finished it when I got home. I literally sat in silence for 30 minutes after. It is an amazing and depressing book about Hope.

Anyways back to my original post I live on a pretty conservative/rural area and I know a lot of preppers for the most part they are cool and genuine in their want to survive if society collapsed, but there are a few i talk to that I am like “damn bro you are messed up.” They literally say things about how they want the world to end so they can go back to their ancestral ways, they also say stuff about how it would be way more exciting then what they are doing now, and how their masculinity has been stifled and they need something to happen so they can bring that masculinity out. It is very strange (and the memes they share on Facebook wild stuff)

If you are one of those people please read The Road, nothing has made me more scared for the end of civil society than that. 

Great book, feel free to have a discussion about it below. Definitely an S tier book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qcv9et/anybody_who_is_excited_for_sometime_of_apocalypse/,2021-10-21 16:11:03,380,1356,books
11q9co,A collection of my Favorite Quotes by the criminally underrated author Steven Erikson (part 1),"""You must dismantle your sources, lest you do nothing but ape the prejudices of others"" -Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice
 “More than one philosopher has claimed that we ever remain children, far beneath the indurated layers that make up the armour of adulthood. Armour encumbers, restricts the body and soul within it. But it also protects. Blows are blunted. Feelings lose their edge, leaving us to suffer naught but a plague of bruises, and, after a time, bruises fade.” -Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice (pg 108)

 ""We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives we betray it. Yes, we know of it's worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely, in abundance"" –Steven Erikson

Form an opinion, say it often enough and pretty soon everyone’s saying it right back at you, and then it becomes a conviction, fed by unreasoning anger and defended with weapons of fear. At which point, words become useless and you’re left with a fight to the death –Steven Erikson

Could life not be called a mortals first Lover? –Steven Erikson

And therein resided the final truth. Anyone could become a killer. Anyone at all. –Steven Erikson

""Children are dying."" Lull nodded. ""That's a succinct summary of humankind, I'd say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words."" — Steven Erikson (Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #2))

""[T]he unnamed soldier is a gift. The named soldier-dead, melted wax-demands a response among the living...a response no-one can make. Names are no comfort, they're a call to answer the unanswerable. Why did she die, not him? Why do the survivors remain anonymous-as if cursed-while the dead are revered? Why do we cling to what we lose while we ignore what we still hold? Name none of the fallen, for they stood in our place, and stand there still in each moment of our lives. Let my death hold no glory, and let me die forgotten and unknown. Let it not be said that I was one among the dead to accuse the living. "" — Steven Erikson (Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #2))

""There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one's own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage alone a foul, tortured path...is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come."" — Steven Erikson (The Bonehunters (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #6))

""Wise words are like arrows flung at your forehead. What do you do? Why, you duck of course."" — Steven Erikson (House of Chains (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #4))

""Gods, I wish the world was full of passive women.He thougt for a moment longer, then scowled. On second thoughts, what a nightmare that'd be. It's the job of a man to fan the spark into flames, not quench it..."" — Steven Erikson (Memories of Ice (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #3))

""Ambition is not a dirty word. Piss on compromise. Go for the throat."" — Steven Erikson (Gardens of the Moon (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #1))

""Death cannot be struggled against, brother. It ever arrives, defiant of every hiding place, of every frantic attempt to escape. Death is every mortal's shadow, his true shadow, and time is its servant, spinning that shadow slowly round, until what stretched before one now stretched before him."" — Steven Erikson

""There is no struggle too vast, no odds too overwhelming, for even should we fail - should we fall - we will know that we have lived."" -Steven Erikson

""One day, perhaps, you will see for yourself that regrets are as nothing. The value lies in how they are answered."" — Steven Erikson (House of Chains (Malazan Book of the Fallen, #4))

""Survivors do not mourn together. They each mourn alone, even when in the same place. Grief is the most solitary of all feelings. Grief isolates, and every ritual, every gesture, every embrace, is a hopeless effort to break through that isolation. None of it works. The forms crumble and dissolve. To face death is to stand alone."" — Steven Erikson

""What matter the colour of the collar around a man's neck, if the chains linked to them were identical?"" — Steven Erikson

“Tell me, Tool, what dominates your thoughts?' The Imass shrugged before replying. 'I think of futility, Adjunct.' 'Do all Imass think about futility?' 'No. Few think at all.' 'Why is that?' The Imass leaned his head to one side and regarded her. 'Because Adjunct, it is futile.” ― Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon

“Whatever games the gods played, it was hard-working dirt-poor bastards like him who suffered for it” -Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice (pg 20)

“Not even the lichen of the tundra is at peace. All is struggle, all is war for dominance. Those who lose, vanish. -And we’re no different you’re saying- We are, soldier. We possess the privilege of choice. The gift of foresight. Though often we come too late in acknowledging responsibilities….” -Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice (pg 34)
“Detachment is a flaw, not a virtue-don’t you realize that?” -Steven Erikson, Memories of Ice (pg 151)
“What’s this human urge, he wondered, that brings us to each devestation” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 477)

“Morality was not relative, they claimed, nor even existing solely in the realm of human condition. No, they proclaimed morality was an imperative of all life, a natural law that was neither the brutal acts of beasts nor the lofty ambitions of humanity, but something other, something unassailable” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 467)

“Whiskeyjack’s gaze lost its focus. His mind had stepped into the gray, muddy tracks of his youth, where he walked the familiar path, lost and blinded by an unidentifiable sorrow.” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 404)

“Betrayal was the greatest of all crimes, for it took all that was human within a person and made it a thing of pain. In the face of that, murder itself was surcease: it was quick, and it ended the anguish and despair of a life without hope.” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 399)

“Bright were the memories of his childhood at these docks…the man slowed as he reached the foot of the stone pier. The years between him and that lad marched through his mind, a possession of martial images growing ever grimmer. If he searched out the many crossroads he had come to in the past, he saw their skies storm-warped, the lands ragged and wind-torn. The forces of age and experience worked on them now, and whatever choices he had made then seemed fated and almost desperate. Is it only the young who know desperation?” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 209)

“Blood,” she murmured, “ever flows downward.” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 136)

“The only death I fear is dying ignorant.” -Steven Erikson, Gardens of the Moon (pg. 125)

>Everyone knows Daisy Jones & The Six: The band's album *Aurora* came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy.

On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together.

2nd place: *On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, by Ocean Vuong*. Nominated by /u/coolyikes

>*On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

3rd place: *The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead*. Nominated by /u/archivistbuendia74

But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South in the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called The Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides ""physical, intellectual and moral training"" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become ""honorable and honest men.""In reality, The Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors, where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear ""out back."" Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr. King's ringing assertion ""Throw us in jail and we will still love you."" His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked and the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble.The tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at The Nickel Academy.Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, *The Nickel Boys* is a devastating, driven narrative

2nd place: *The Turn of the Key, by Ruth Ware*. Nominated by /u/Bjenkss

>When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.It was everything.She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means.

Beneath the town’s cheerful façade, however, Bleak Creek teens live in constant fear of being sent to The Whitewood School, a local reformatory with a record of putting unruly teens back on the straight and narrow—a record so impeccable that almost everyone is willing to ignore the mysterious deaths that have occurred there over the past decade.At first, high school freshmen Rex McClendon and Leif Nelson believe what they’ve been told—that the students’ strange demises were all tragic accidents. But when the shoot for their low-budget horror masterpiece, PolterDog, goes horribly awry—and their best friend, Candice Boykins, is sent to Whitewood as punishment—Rex and Leif are forced to question everything they know about their unassuming hometown and its cherished school for delinquents.Eager to rescue their friend, Rex and Leif pair up with recent NYU film school grad Janine Blitstein to begin piecing together the unsettling truth of the school and its mysterious founder, Wayne Whitewood. What they find, with Candice’s life hanging in the balance, will leave them battling an evil beyond their wildest teenage imaginations—one that will shake Bleak Creek to its core.

>Far beneath the surface of the earth, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. The entryways that lead to this sanctuary are often hidden, sometimes on forest floors, sometimes in private homes, sometimes in plain sight. But those who seek will find. Their doors have been waiting for them.Zachary Ezra Rawlins is searching for his door, though he does not know it. He follows a silent siren song, an inexplicable knowledge that he is meant for another place. When he discovers a mysterious book in the stacks of his campus library he begins to read, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, lost cities, and nameless acolytes. Suddenly a turn of the page brings Zachary to a story from his own childhood impossibly written in this book that is older than he is.A bee, a key, and a sword emblazoned on the book lead Zachary to two people who will change the course of his life: Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired painter, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances.

**Best Non-Fiction of 2019** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ebl4ov/best_nonfiction_of_2019_voting_thread/)

**Winner:** *Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Nothern Ireland, by Patrick Radden Keefe.* Nominated by /u/candlesandpretense

>In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville’s children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress–with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe’s mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past–*Say Nothing* conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.

2nd place: *Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, by Ronan Farrow.* Nominated by /u/candlesandpretense

>In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family.All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance they could not explain -- until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood to Washington and beyond.This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, *Catch and Kill* breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook our culture.

3rd place: *Permanent Record, by Edward Snowden.* Nominated by /u/spitfire8125

>In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, *Permanent Record* is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, *Permanent Record* is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.

**Winner**: *On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, by Ocean Vuong*. Nominated by /u/microcline

>*On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

2nd place: *Red, White & Royal Blue, by Casey McQuiston.* Nominated by /u/lunarav

>What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's *Red, White & Royal Blue* proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.

**Winner:** *Shout, by Laurie Halse Anderson*. Nominated by /u/CrazyCatLadyForLife

>Bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson is known for the unflinching way she writes about, and advocates for, survivors of sexual assault. Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel *Speak* was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Searing and soul-searching, this important memoir is a denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #metoo and #timesup, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts. *Shout* speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.

Like obviously IMO authors are free to write about whatever they want, but I’m not going to act like I personally think it’s “okay” to use the victimization of women as a cheap gratuitous thrill. I also feel like a lot of these scenes are very disempowering and it’s just…not right.

Do I need to stop reading the genre all together? I feel like I’ve been hit in the face with this over and over.

gjn55g,The most popular books in April 2020 according to Wikipedia,"Using pageview statistics from the most developed language versions  of Wikipedia we created ranking of the most popular books in April 2020.

## Briefly about the methodology

Wikipedia currently has over 53 million articles in over 300  languages. Despite the impressive number of articles, not all topics can  be written in this free encyclopedia. At the same time, the community  of each language version has the ability to decide which topic can be  described in the encyclopedia, and which is not (for example, article  must be [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability)).  In addition, each language version can describe the same topic in its  own way - it all depends on the quantity and quality of the authors  (Wikipedia users who edit articles).

Almost every Wikipedia article has an aligment to certain categories.  Additionally, based on the content, you can specify the subject of the  article - for this you can, for example, use semantic relations in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/). More details on the automatic article classification process can be found in various scientific works (e.g. for [articles](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/8/3/60) or [sources](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/5/263)).

This article selected the most-developed language versions of  Wikipedia with over 1 million articles, including English, German,  French, Spanish, Russian, Polish and other. After the classification of  articles, only those that are dedicated to individual books. As a result  for English Wikipedia 56591 articles about books were found, French -  24199 books, Italian - 15796 books, German - 13190 books, Spanish -  11783 books, Russian - 8126 books, Portuguese - 7189 books, Polish -  6925 books, Arabic - 6617 books, Japanese - 6099 books and Chinese -  5095 books.

As mentioned earlier, every Wikipedia article can have different  language versions, so we can find out different names of the same object  (book). Using [open data on Wikipedia article views](https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/)  we can find out how many times a given article has been viewed on  specific days. After collecting data for viewing all Wikipedia articles  on books in the appropriate language versions April 2020 ranking of the  most readable was made. First, the positions of books in the ranking are  shown, which were obtained by adding up the page views from different  language versions for a given book. Later, the most popular books are  shown for only one language version of Wikipedia.

Recently we [observed](https://blog.wikirank.net/2020/wikirank-upgrade-fair-popularity-and-new-features/)  that visitors number for some articles was “overclocked” in some  periods of time. Therefore, we decide to provide additional modification  of the pageview statistics for such cases and change this number  (usually by reduction). Fairness of statistics for each article in  selected language version in selected months can be assessed using such  indicators as: number of the edits and authors, page protection, the  rate of citation increasing of the article, popularity statistics of  related keywords (phrases) in Google Trends and others.

gtq62s,[Analysis] The Snail on the Slope by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky," Fiction by Strugatsky brothers is well known to contain myriad of allegories and hidden meanings concealed in the text. This style of writing serves double purpose – on one hand, they use figurative and symbolic meaning to express their artistic and philosophical vision while avoiding attention by the Soviet censorship, on the other hand, this way of constructing a story under a thick disguise becomes their signature literary style. In turn, reading of Strugatsky fiction becomes a process similar to cracking a code, while keys that are cleverly hidden throughout the text need to be discovered by a careful reader in order to truly understand the novel. *The Snail on the Slope* is no exception – rather, it proves to what extent Strugatsky brothers stretch this technique in order to exercise their creative freedom and avoid Soviet censors. 

On the surface, *The* *Snail on the Slope* appears to be a Kafkaesque satire aimed at depicting the absurdity of bureaucracy, akin to *The Trial*. However, after finishing the first two chapters of the book I realized that many of the aspects depicted make no logical sense. This prevented me from going further into the story, since I felt like I am missing an important piece of substance that the authors intended, but I am clearly not seeing. I slowly began to realize that there is a lot more to *The* *Snail on the Slope* than *The Trial* aimed at Soviet administrative monstrosity. I remembered *The Doomed City* – another novel by Strugatsky brothers, which similarly employs an allegory as the main storytelling technique. In the latter, the general narrative, although fantastical, is more or less consistent in its realm, respectful of the rules established and keeping them in tact throughout majority of the text. However, at some points throughout the story, it disintegrates into an illogical episode inconsistent with the rest of the narrative, by which Strugatsky brothers invite the reader doubt the legitimacy of the story and search for a hidden meaning which would explain these cracks in the narrative. These chaotic interludes offer clues to the underlying allegory of the text. If the reader is careful and possesses sufficient knowledge of the context, he is capable of identifying the clues and applying them to the rest of the story. *The Snail on the Slope* employs similar technique, however, these chaotic interludes are not segregated from the rest of the text as distinct episodes, but rather run parallel to the narrative, which makes finding these clues to the underlying allegory even more difficult to find. Only after carefully re-reading a particularly baffling part of Chapter 3 did I finally realize that there was not one, but a dozen of different allegories permeating the novel. 

One of the story\`s protagonists – Pepper (or Peretz, depending on the translation) – is a visiting employee at the administrative organ that is responsible for managing all things associated with the entity called The Forest, which, from the first glance, is exactly what the name implies – a massive forest. However, the reader soon realized that it has some mysterious, almost magical properties to it. In chapter 3, Pepper, during a particularly stressful night, speaks directly to The Forest. From previous hints about The Forest and Pepper’s monologue we can understand that it is an entity which is clearly of great importance to the humankind. The role of the Directorate – which is the administrative organ I mentioned above – it would seem, is to analyze and use The Forest to pursue progress. In his monologue in chapter 3, Pepper addresses The Forest almost as a divine entity in a prayer, where The Forest assumes a profile similar to the depiction of Christian God.

*‘I don\`t know what you are. Nor do those who are dead sure they know. You are what you are, but I can hope that you\`re what I\`ve wanted to see all my life: kind, intelligent, indulgent, and considerate, perhaps even grateful!’*

Rather than exact replica of Christian God, The Forest is viewed here more as a source of morality, which might be independent of religion. The question that torments Pepper is why does The Directorate, whose mission in regards to The Forest might not be clear, but can be assumed is to study the ontology of the forest, is only concerned with deconstruction, use and replacement of The Forest, without tapping into the meaning of it, which is, on the contrary, the quest that Pepper presumably undertakes. The absurdity of bureaucracy manifested in The Directorate and the aimlessness of its operations is a source of great frustration to Pepper. How can one understand it if one’s objective is to destroy and transform it?

This particular episode is one of the first instances of inconsistency within the storyline that I described above when talking about *The Doomed City*. To an ignorant and inattentive reader, Pepper’s lapse of sanity might be brushed off as schizophrenic outburst. Russian literature and art in general is full of these types of ‘secret entrances’ into proper meaning of the piece, which is normally concealed through necessity. In the case of Strugatsky brothers – to avoid the attention of Soviet censors, since topics of theological nature were forbidden in any form. 

Monologue of Pepper continues as a reference of Nietzschean death of God concept:

*‘I\`m afraid for myself, but I\`m afraid for you as well. You don\`t know them after all, yet. Even I don\`t know them at all well. All I know is they\`re capable of any extreme, the furthest extreme of stupidity and wisdom, cruelty and pity, fury and restraint.’*

Here, ‘them’ is a reference to the humankind in general. Word of Pepper carry an almost prophetic tone, predicting the possibility of the death of God – a complete abandonment of belief, which in turn would leave humans without any clear source of morality, forcing them to figure it out on their own by ever undulating from one extreme to the next.

Finally, Pepper announces that the main fault he sees in humankind is their unwillingness to understand, once again, echoing words of Nietzsche:

*‘There’s one thing they lack – understanding. They always substitute some sort of surrogate for understanding, be it faith, disbelief, indifference, or neglect. \[…\] Easier to believe than comprehend. Easier to become disenchanted than to comprehend.’*

Here Pepper describes the tendency of humankind to conceptualize reality in a way that is simplest in each given stage of history: faith (religion), disbelief (atheism), neglect (nihilism). Criticism of human tendency to adopt an already existing structure of morality, rather than undertake a burdensome task of developing it on their own and critically evaluating a given moral system is expressed here.

Another important detail in chapter 3 is Pepper\`s suitcase, which he leaves behind as he is traveling throughout the territory of The Directorate during the night after being forcefully expelled from the hotel he was staying in. The suitcase seems to symbolize material wealth and earthly belongings. It is interesting to note that Pepper was only capable of directly speaking to The Forest after abandoning the suitcase, which represents a shift from focus on materialism towards spiritualism/philosophy. Interestingly, Pepper is unable to find the suitcase after his conversation with The Forest, and does not seem to be distraught by that fact, reinforcing a shift in his disposition towards reality. 

Second part of Pepper’s lapse into another seemingly hallucinogenic trip and illogical conversation is carried out in the library, where Pepper has a conversation with a collective knowledge of humankind. Eventually, browsing through the books present in the library, he singles out a particular tome, which I\`m pretty sure represents The Bible:

*‘Quiet now, you there, what’s your name two-volume? How many people have read you? How many understood? I\`ve a lot of affection for you, old man, you\`re good, honest friend. You never bowled or boasted or beat your chest \[…\] Those who read you also become good and honest, at least for a time. At least for themselves.’*

The indication ‘two-volume’ gives the reader a clue a particular book that Pepper references here, and for readers that already picked up on the allegory – an affirmation. The Bible consists of Old and New Testament, making it essentially a two-volume. After that, another very important topic in this book is touched upon – the price and meaning of progress. One could assume from the previous chapters that the aim of the Directorate is one of progress. And in this regard, the part of underlying allegory that deals with Soviet structure becomes clear. ‘Progress’ was the word that echoed from the lips of many Communist Party members in the Soviet Union. At the same time, ‘progress’ is also one of the virtues in the capitalist structure as well, which allows Soviet artists to easily indicate capitalist world as the target of their criticism, while in truth, it is directed towards communism. Cold, unsympathetic and immoral progress – striving for which meant disregarding any consideration for human life and liberty, and which was rampant throughout the Soviet Union – is the object of criticism in the following section of the chapter. Stalin’s own ‘ends justify the means’ approach was used as an example:

*‘Progress can be perfectly indifferent to concepts of goodness and honor, as it has been indifferent up to now. The Directorate, for example, has no need of goodness or honor in order to function properly. Pleasant, desirable, but by no means essential.’*

Here, Pepper also distinguishes between two kinds of progress – materialistic and moral. It is clear that Pepper himself is concerned with the fact that The Directorate is obsessed with the former, which reflects the view of Strugatsky brothers on the Soviet system:

*‘It all depends on the definition of progress. You can define it so the famous ‘for all that’ appears: an alcoholic, but for all that – an outstanding specialist \[…\] You can also look on progress as a transformation of everyone into good and honest men. Then we\`ll live to hear people say: he’s a specialist \[…\] but he\`s a dirty type, he\`ll have to go.’*

Aside from the event in The Directorate, which follow Pepper as their centerpiece, the rest of the book concentrates on another story, involving another protagonist – Kandid (or Candid, depending on translation) – and a completely different setting – the depths of The Forest. The Forest chapters are more reminiscent of a classic science fiction story, without delving too deeply into philosophical, sociopolitical or moral discussion – at least in the beginning. Set up of The Forest complements the ideas expressed in The Directorate chapters. Despite a perceptibly less complex sub text, The Forest chapters do not offer an easy reading. The whole narrative is roughly presented as an adventure story, but the environment that surrounds the protagonist is strange and incomprehensible. In addition, there is no effort on the part of Kandid or any other characters to explain their environment in a concise scientific manner, as opposed to many other science fiction stories. There is also no perceptible effort on the part of the part of the protagonist to understand it. His only goal is to escape the forest, without asking too many questions. 

In this regard, The Forest chapters remind of another Strugatsky book which leans more towards a classical sci-fi end of their bibliography – *Roadside Picnic.* Both stories are set in an unexplained, strange environment (Zone and The Forest in *Roadside Picnic* and *The Snail on the Slope,* respectively), featuring protagonists that are not concerned with understanding them in a fundamental way. They are only interested in discerning the underlying mechanistic principle of said environment in order to survive, not because they are genuinely interested in how it works. Both of these environments are dangerous in a way that is not fully perceptible. And I think Strugatsky brothers consciously chose to leave the phenomenon like The Meat Grinder, Witches Jelly, White Moss, or the Deadlings – nebulous, while giving them qualities – based on the results when characters do encounter them – that signify a very real yet unexplained threat: Meat Grinder literally shreds anyone that steps close to it into pieces, Witches Jelly acts almost like a corroding agent that melts away flesh, White Moss is compared to an animal that devours you stay on it for too long, while the Deadlings severely burn the part of the person that touches them. The consequences of these anomalies are very real and perceptible, but the mechanism of their action is left unexplained. This element of unknown is what makes the environments of both *The Roadside Picnic* and The Forest chapters so menacing: we can clearly observe the consequences, but we do not understand the cause. In a lot of science fiction, the perceived danger – although not understood in scientific terms, can still be explained via analogy to another human experience. In addition, the convention of a classic sci-fi story is that the threat is eventually explained and understood, which usually provides a fighting chance for the protagonist. Take *Alien,* for example. Alien itself is an unknown entity, but at the very first encounter it is understood that it’s a biological entity, in addition to it being an amalgamation of predatory and parasitic animals that are found on earth. This gives it a dimension of information, from which a certain level of deterministic consistency can be drawn: it has teeth – similarly to a carnivorous predator – which in turn means that the way the alien could harm you is via a bite, similar to said predator. It has a long tail with a sharp pointy end – similarly to a spear – which in turn means that it could potentially impale you. In this case, the consequences of the Alien are understood, but so is the cause. That is not the case in the Strugatsky stories. And throughout the book, no epistemological respite is granted about the looming threat. The key difference between *The Roadside Picnic* and The Forest chapters is that in the latter, there exists a set of characters that try to understand the phenomena of the Zone via a scientific method, and some theories are purported, throughout the book, about the physical properties, mechanism and origin of some anomalies. No such effort is undertaken during The Forest chapters. Here, epistemology of The Forest is based on folklore and superstition. While *Roadside Picnic* is modern in its epistemological approach, The Forest chapters are primitive. 

Forest represents a seemingly unfathomable truth, manifesting as a general unknown – an entity that cannot yet be explained or understood. And for Kandid – it is overwhelming. He tries desperately to escape it. To get back to a comfortable state of order – The City. Only other option is lapsing into madness and becoming like the inhabitant of The Village, where Kandid currently resides. Inhabitants of The Village are depictions of primitive understanding, surviving with the help of mythologizing their surroundings. 

One of the main underlying allegories in *The Snail on the Slope* – absurdity of Soviet bureaucracy – starts to incrementally reveal itself throughout the later chapters via the method of inconsistency in the narrative mentioned above. Sudden change in tone and atmosphere offers a glimpse into the subtext. Once such sudden lapse is portrayed during the ride to The Forest. The Directorate employees that travel to the Forest together with Pepper in the back of a truck at first appear friendly and non-threatening. They, however, suddenly morph into a localized manifestation of a KGB interrogation personnel or a Soviet trial, the whole situation reflecting the façade that Soviet system tried to keep on the exterior – façade of functional society where all its citizens were happy and devoted to the communist cause. However, hidden underneath this artificially constructed picture lurked a horrible machine of terror. It was not uncommon to realize that a close buddy of yours is in fact a secret KGB conscript.

The critique of the Soviet system – and, to an extent, capitalist system as well – is only a part of a broader criticism directed towards materialism in general. In the subsequent section of the story that includes the same Directorate employees at the back of a truck, reveals a philosophical argument that was explored thoroughly by F. Dostoyevsky. In particular, *Notes form the Underground* has a very similar section, where the protagonist of the story states that solving all material problems of humankind – in essence by creating a utopian society, which was the goal of the historic materialism of Stalin and other communist leaders – will not make people more happy, content, or give meaning to their lives, resulting in a conscious destruction of the utopia by these same people. The spirit of Dostoyevsky is alive in the text, where its philosophy is more closely applied to the Soviet context. One of The Directorate employees proclaim:

*‘In the last speech addressed to me, the director revealed majestic prospects. I caught my breath from sheer admiration \[…\] If you want to know, everything’s going to be cleared, all these rocks, cottages… Instead, buildings of dazzling beauty will rise \[…\] crystal bars, and cafes. Stairways to the sky \[…\] Laboratories! Penetrated by sun and light! A free timetable!’*

Pepper remains skeptical, and expresses opinion similar to the protagonist of *Notes from the Underground*:

*‘You just think that. You won\`t do it* \[employee said he would take on woodworking and poetry is he did not have to work\] *You\`ll do a bit of fretwork then you\`ll join the ladies. Or get drunk. I know you all right \[…\] You\`ll shamble about from crystal bar to diamond cafeteria. Especially if work is optional.’*

The last chapter of The Forest part of the book even references environmental problems, although this was not an issue commonly discussed in Soviet Union. Through the lens of Kandid, Strugatsky brothers pondered the idea of how certain concepts and conditions were perceived differently depending on their relationship with the temporal realm. Moreover, it is discussed how these concepts and conditions eventually transform into myths and superstitions, if they are not studied properly:

*‘The trouble was that destruction was a concept linked with immediacy, right now, with some sort of catastrophe. They were unable and had no desire to generalize, couldn’t and wouldn’t think of the world outside their village \[…\] The forest was the more powerful, but then the forest had always been and always would be more powerful \[…\] What destruction do you mean? Now, when a tree crushes somebody, that’s destruction alright.’*

This is a clear depiction of the idea that something that is immediate and overwhelming to senses is always going to be interpreted as more threatening and harmful, compared to something that you cannot see, something that happens slowly, takes decades to generate a palpable effect. A starving white bear, walking aimlessly along the melting glacier will always have a stronger impact on people, compared to a graph that showing average temperature change by one degree in 10 years. A disease that kills a person in two days accompanied by hemorrhages, sever cough and abscesses will always be treated as more dangerous than the one that slowly kills a person, without any clear symptoms or defined expected termination date. This idea echoes quote that is wrongly attributed to Stalin: *‘Death of one person is a tragedy, death of a million is a statistic’.* 

At least compared to the books by Strugatsky brothers that I have read previously, *The Snail on the Slope* seems to be one of the densest and, arguably, one of the most complicated books from their oeuvre. It is also, doubtlessly, one of their most ambitious. Clearly, it tries to cram so much substance into its narrative that at times it becomes overwhelming at best and completely incomprehensible at worst. Like a music piece of a 20th century serialist tradition, where every instrumental part lives in independent life, creating a dissonant whole when in combined with other instruments and parts. This amalgamation of ideas, allegories and hidden meanings, cleverly concealed by various methods throughout the text allowed for *The Snail on the Slope* to be published despite the strict censorship policies of the Soviet Union. Considering that Soviet censors did not pick up on the themes I outlines in this analysis (since they were forbidden to be openly discussed and were deemed as subversive), it is certainly a challenging task for the reader to uncover them all. It is probably impossible to do it during the first reading. Some parts of the book still seemed like a chaotic mess to me, offering no piece of thread to grab on to. And although I can certainly appreciate the genius of Strugatsky brothers for their ability to cram so many ideas and outline simultaneously while at the same time concealing them from Soviet censors, the book edges on becoming a stream of consciousness novel. *The Doomed City* – a book by Strugatsky brothers I have referenced earlier – presents its allegory in a more concise and comprehensive manner. Every bout of inconsistency in the narrative can be traced to an underlying allegory. In the case of *The Snail on the Slope*, there are so many of these clues leading to different allegories, and some of them, arguably – to dead ends, that the book becomes a maze, rather than a riddle. The number of ideas expressed in the subtext is also limited in *The Doomed City*, where more time is spent on building and extrapolating on them, while in *The Snail on the Slope*, different ideas are emerging at different time points, briefly, and at the same time competing with other ideas and striving for the reader’s attention. However, this particular formula allowed for Strugatsky brothers to express their artistic and philosophical vision while under repressive policies of communist regime and successfully publish *The Snail on the Slope* upon completion, while publication of *The Doomed City* had to be postponed until the initial stages of the inevitable demise of the Soviet Union.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gtq62s/analysis_the_snail_on_the_slope_by_arkady_and/,2020-05-31 01:30:13,0,17,books

43d5oa,The books I read in 2015,"2015 Reading List

In this last year, 2015, I ended up with a grand total of over 34 books read.
The year before that, 2014, I read a total count of 44 books, and the year before that, 97 books, with 100 books the year before that, in 2012.   As I did last year, I have a rating system for the books I finished, my ""robot rating"", or R/R, and I have them in ranking from my favorites to my least favorite below.  I’m curious to know what type of reading you like or your recommendations.

1.   Abundance, by Peter H. Diamandis

Notes: This was my favorite book of the entire year, and I couldn’t stop thinking of all the implications of the bold concepts explored in this book. This made me learn very little about Diamandis, but lots about all the ways that we can now truly save the world and make lives better, in very creative ways.
RR: 5/5

2.       Rework, by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

Notes: A great read, with every turn finding more and more suggestions that are against the conventional wisdom. Written by the entrepreneurs that started the tech company 37 Signals, this book is really the anti-business book – iit’s a reminder that the corporate speak, meetings, and suggestions, productivity techniques, are all there to support work that means something or does something. Building the business, and your schedule, or your employee’s schedules, around that concept, and then refining the work, is simple, but powerful. Whether that works in other industries where the workload is already at capacity (that is, companies other than technology/silicon valley companies), remains, to me, to be seen, but there is no doubt that this is a well written book with powerful concepts all around one theme.

RR: 5/5

3.   Yes, Please, by Amy Poehler

Notes: This book, written (with help) by comedian and actress Amy Poehler, is an interesting and funny read. It's a very short read, to be certain.  I found her story about finding what you love to do fascinating, and touching, and her stories about improv training and becoming successful at what she loved to do anyway were well done.

RR: 5/5

4.       The Purple Cow, by Seth Godin

Notes: One of the current best sellers about marketing in the age of the internet, Seth Godin takes a simple concept – being so unique and different that you are automatically distinguishable from your competition – and goes into great detail on why that concept works. A simple idea, and a powerful, if short book.

RR: 5/5

5.       Speaking of Freedom, by George H.W. Bush

Notes:  I enjoyed this book much more than I expected I would. Bush was president at a crucial time in U.S. and world history. As the Soviet Union crumbled, the Berlin Wall fell, and the world seemed to scramble into new enemies and alliances, this is a fascinating exploration of exciting times for the planet. The real gem here is the commentary by Bush 21 years or so after his presidency. Yes, you can see the speeches on YouTube or CSpan. But I learned most from the commentary of the aged elder Bush, in his own words. He reveals in this book that he was not certain at all that he would win the presidency, or even the nomination, as all polls put him in third place. He would often read the speeches before speaking, and would sometimes cry, since they were often emotional (and reveals that the Navy Hymn always makes him cry). He had a deep fear that he wasn't as good a speaker as Reagan, his predecessor. He was hurt that many in the Republican Party criticized his Clean Air Act, as he considered himself an outdoorsman, thought the national parks was one of the best things the USA ever did, and wanted his party to be the one that protected the environment. And he had always thought that the Romanians were the eastern block country most opposed to the Soviet Union, and when Lech Walesa in Poland started a movement, U.S. Attention immediately changed to support polish interests, which surprised many in the State Dept and Council on Foreign Relations. All in all, very enjoyable. I learned a lot about this time in history.

RR: 5/5


6.       Wild Swans : Three Daughters of China, by Yung Chan.

Notes: I only learned at the end of this book, in the epilogue, that this book is still, to this day, banned in China. As an account of three generations of specific women in a specific region of China, it is a fascinating account of a culture that changed dramatically in 100 years. The book begins in the year 1911 with the grandmother of the author, who dictated her life’s history, including having her feet painfully bound for life, and being given to a Warlord General as a concubine when the family could not care for her, through World War II, Mao’s revolution and the country’s mass starvations and killings under Communism, and through the modernization of China from 1976 forward under Deng Xiaoping and up to 1992. An emotional, fully detailed look at three lives, what they suffered, what Chinese culture expected from them, and three women through amazing times in history. I learned much from this book.

RR: 5/5


7.     This Explains Everything, by John Brockman

Notes: John Brockman is a book agent, and highly intelligent individual, who focuses on science and society writers, and thus surrounds himself with other highly intelligent individuals. This book asks each of his clients one question, as he does every year. And it’s a big question: “What one thing explains everything?” The variety of answers, from a variety of people who are top in their field, including musicians, artists, tech company visionaries, psychologists, physicists, and scientists from all disciplines, is really a fun read, and even though all essays are short by design, many will make you think long after reading them.

RR: 5/5


8.     Brahms: His Life and Music, by Robert Greenberg

Notes: This look at the sad childhood of the composer, Brahms, and his eventual success and obsession with writing and rewriting music (none of which he ever thought was good enough, was amazingly well done. Much of the information contained here was well researched, gives a background that makes you feel as though you were there, or lived during those times, and has many anecdotes and examples of what made the music of Brahms great. Enjoyable and definitely worth the purchase.

RR: 5/5

9.     As a Man Thinketh, by James Allen

Notes: This book is a classic, originally published in 1902 (although not nearly by a couple of thousand years as old at the Marcus Aurelius book on this list). A collection of essays, each are short and well written, and goes into why most respond unconsciously to things, why your long term thinking affects your goals and your moment to moment thoughts either move you towards what you truly want, or away (or help define what you want). Short, but powerful, and recommended.

RR: 5/5


10.     Sum of Our Days, by Isabel Allende

Notes: This is more non-fiction than fiction, but not by much. Playing off the fantasy that the author’s deceased daughter would like a summary of family events since she passed away, this book follows the activities of a charming family, with the writing (translated from Spanish) following interesting conversations and all the events families go through, including birth, love, death, friendship, and enjoyment of life. Although Allende is a fiction author (I have not read her other books), and is a very good writer, this has the “realness” of describing real events, real successes and failures, to a real family, and is very very touching in many ways, including her travels around the world. A great read.

RR: 5/5


11.  The Politics of Diplomacy, by James Baker III

Notes: This book only covers the time period from 1988 to 1992, while Baker was secretary of State for the US Government. The saying, maybe apocryphal, that in Chinese the wish for good luck is “may you live in interesting times”, could not be more appropriate here. During that four year period, the US witnessed the fall of communist states all over the world, and then scrambled to assess whether the new states, some of which ended up in chaos, in war, or in the case of Russia, immediately having a coup and taking Gorbachev hostage, were amenable to diplomatic relations, joining existing treaties, and securing nuclear weapons. After that, the long buildup of diplomatic agreements, sanctions, and eventually a coalition war followed the years after Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied the country of Kuwait. While I was hoping for a more honest and frank assessment of his mistakes and what might have been done better, Baker is a good writer and examiner of this portion in history that he flew all over the world dealing with as it happened.

12.    Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

Notes: This famous book of meditations, written by a Roman Emperor to himself to remember the lessons of his life, is timeless. The edition I purchased had each essay edited by a different translator, which made for a strange and not cohesive whole, but the information in this short read is worth going over for everyone.

RR: 5/5

13.       Zero to One, by Peter Thiel

Notes: This book, by PayPal founder Peter Thiel, about founding companies, and bringing new concepts to change the world, through simple steps and actions, was well written. While recommended in the same vein as “Abundance”, above, the other book is very well written and is applicable to every human on the planet. The further away you are from the world of capital investing and silicon valley tech, the less you may find this book useful or interesting.

RR: 4.5/5


14.  Out of Your Mind, by Alan Watts

Notes: This book, which is really a transcript of the talks on meditation from the famous Alan Watts, was recommended to me, as I have always had an interest in meditation.  Watts philosophies on life and the mind are simple, and are discussed here. The overall message is to try to see the world as it really is, as difficult as that might be, and as much as your mind wants to impose constructs of what you want to have happen instead of the reality of just “what is”. With humor and discussions on the environment, technology, and information, this was an interesting book.

RR: 4.5/5


15.  Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the world of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation and Time Travel, by Michio Kaku

Notes: This is, as the title suggests, a book written for geeks. Less impossible, and more “can Star Trek and Back to the Future ever become real?”, this book is a little more simplified than some of his other books in an attempt to reach a more popular audience. The writing, as always, is excellent, and Kaku is great at fantastic speculation, which makes the book fun.  I wish there was exploration of other areas not covered by the book, but this is a book you may want to read twice if it is of interest of all.

RR: 4.5/5


16.  The Fabric of The Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality, by Brian Greene

Notes: One of the most famous books in science literature is The Elegant Universe, Greene’s discussion of his work (and collaborative work on) string theory. This builds on string theory, and discusses quantum mechanics, especially the Heisenberg Principle, and how that might affect the universe as a whole, but also speculates on how the universe might be different without either space or time, which the universe might not even need to exist. Written for the lay reader, which is great, for this high level physics discussion, Greene is always an easy writer to follow and has some fantastic mindblowing discussions of implications of string theory.

RR: 4.5/5


17.  Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics, by Henry Hazlitt

Notes: This famous best selling economics book is famous in certain political circles, but is also an easy read and are told in story form. Brilliant writing, in that the book explains the “one lesson” in chapter one, and then uses all other chapters to examine how that one lesson applies to a variety of situations, and how short sighted policies, or policies intended to address narrower and narrower situations, usually backfire and fail. This book originally came out in 1946, but is an interesting look at the economy as a whole, and what actions affect it.

RR: 4.5/5

18.  In the Ruins of Empire: The Japanese Surrender and the Battle for Postwar Asia, by Ronald H. Spector

Notes: This book takes a close look at the events starting in July, 1945 and onward, and documents how, for one, the Japanese surrender did not stop fighting – much of the military and the population believed that they should keep fighting despite the surrender. It also shows how much turmoil continued for decades in Manchuria, Korea, Indonesia, and China, leaving that state open to Mao’s deadly policies, that killed more than anyone else in history. The United States had not thought of any policies or playing any significant role in any country other than Japan, which led to Communism, war lords, and chaos to take place all over Asia. A very interesting look at the part of post WWII history that not many write about or discuss.

RR: 4/5


19.   In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson

Notes: This book has famous writer and humorist visiting, writing, and traveling all over Australia, to find out what makes it tick. You might feel you know Australia much better after reading this book, as I certainly did. While his look at Australia was very interesting, it seems to cover ground that has been well traveled by other observers. Plus, I don’t find Bill Bryson that witty or funny.

RR: 4/5


20.  Write It When I'm Gone, by Thomas De Frank.

Notes: This book is a unique look at president Gerald Ford, written by a journalist who traveled with him at the end of his presidency, and afterwards, and was told not to publish any of their conversations until Ford had died (hence the title). An interesting look at a reluctant president, and writing that makes him more interesting than he probably was in real life interactions.

RR: 4/5


21.     The 4% Universe, by Richard Panek

Notes: One of the most amazing things about our universe is that, with dark matter, and dark energy, which constitute 96% of what we know, can observe, and test. We know both are there, but don’t know exactly all the qualities of the majority of the universe. This book clarifies what that means and comes up with a comprehensive survey of what we do know about both, and what the leading theories on what it might mean are.

RR: 4/5


22.  The Eye Never Sleeps: Striking to the Heart of Zen, by Dennis Genpo Merzel

Notes: This book is a commentary and deep exploration of the meaning and lessons of a famous Zen poem by Sosan Zenji's. It is based upon lectures and as such, is a transcription of discussions of the opem. Exploring what it means to be conscious, to be self aware, and to be on a path of improvement, it was a fascinating look at a narrow text from one past writer, as analyzed by a modern writer and Buddhist. A very short read, and in some cases profound, in others illogical in its conclusions.

RR: 3.5/5


23.  Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life, by Henry Cloud and John Townsend.

Notes: As the title makes explicit, this book is a guide to determining what you can be responsible for, and what is beyond your resources, or your time, in an effort to make a balanced lifestyle the goal. Written very much from a biblical/Christian perspective, there is heavy bible quoting here, which is off-putting to most. This book could be streamlined to be an examination of the relationships with friends, family, and other commitments, and an instruction manual to take a close look at the time commitments and importance of each. For those that have no experience in time management, this may be a good start, but is not well written and is sidetracked in several notable instances.

RR: 3.5/5


24.  Black Holes and Baby Universes, by Stephen Hawking

Notes: This book is really a collection of essays, most over 25 years old. I am almost certain that the publisher wanted to get these in print to capitalize on Hawking’s position as the most famous scientist in the world. Because Hawking’s work as an astrophysicist that studies the physics of black holes is so narrow, however, and because this is a collection of essays, and not a unified whole, this book suffers from many redundancies, speaking to the same concepts again and again. There are essays exploring his personal life, which are worth much more than the other material, and which were fascinating and of interest to those who wish to know about his childhood and younger life, and his development of ALS, which is slowly killing him.

RR: 3.5/5


25.  How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Personal Success, by John Gray

Notes: As you would expect from the author of “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus”, this book is very much simplified. But some of the concepts, including that material things and external trappings don’t bring much happiness, that gratitude is one way to train yourself to be gradually more satisfied with your life, and that each of us have a “love tank” (corny name) that needs to be filled with things or people in our life, are good concepts. Unfortunately, a much longer book filled with fluff and filler are built around those simple concepts, many of which were treated better in other books on this subject.

RR: 3.5/5

26.  Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe, by Freeman Dyson

Notes: This book is amazingly well researched, and in brief, looks at the accomplishment in building the world’s first digital computer, in England, to solve the problem of the German Enigma Code machines, and what theories and practice of that event have brought since then. It was having the machine have both the data and the instructions in the same processing machine that made for a revolution. Unfortunately, the great amount of well documented research makes for a somewhat dry book. And, unlike what you might expect from the title, the life of Alan Turing, and his personal accomplishments and private life, are almost nonexistent in this book, although he is discussed along with other people and institutions of his time.

RR: 3.5/5


27.   The King of Taksim Square, by Emrah Serbes

Notes: This fiction novel is one of those “you feel like you are there” novels that have many scenes that are excellent and skillful in drawing you in as a reader. Taking place in Turkey, involving the events during the Arab Spring, there are discussions of Michael Jackson, childhood, living with the constant threat of bombs, and how family changes in times of war or stress. However, the strong opening of this book quickly fades, and goes on for many pages just trailing off and away, without a strong message, conclusion, or much of it is boring, and almost calculated to not be interesting.

RR: 3/5

28.      Debt: The First 5000 Years, by David Graeber

Notes: Being a history of debt throughout history, the concepts of debt, and how they arose in different societies and civilizations, and what they mean today. This should have been a more interesting read, as it is just as important and interesting as the rise of theories and practices of capital, but unfortunately, the book goes on for much too long, and is too dry to recommend, with a heavier writing style than is appropriate given the long historical perspective here.

RR: 3/5


29.  The Fault In Our Stars, by John Green

Notes: This book, by YouTube star John Green, became famous for being a major motion picture. I knew John Green for his charity work and science videos on his channel, and was eager to see his take on fiction (although this is based upon a true life girl). Unfortunately, the writing is fairly amateurish, and the story too predictable to recommend this quick read.

RR: 3/5


30.  Storming Heaven - LSD and the American Dream, by Jay Stevens

Notes: This is the first book I’ve read start to finish via Amazon Kindle (in this case through an iPad). And I find it hard to analyze why I took all year to read this book. Was it the reading on a screen experience? Part of it could have been because the book takes a deep look into an interesting time – the, at the time, unregulated drug culture and other counter culture of the 1960s, and the history of LSD, from it’s accidental discovery through it’s use by the United States CIA and military, and its use in psychology circles for therapy, and beyond. But, while the real life characters presented here are fascinating, the writing is dry and brings dullness to what should have been a more vivid subject. I picked up this book because the writer of the book that became the Bradley Cooper film “Limitless” cited this book as the inspiration to that story. However, Glynn definitely seems like he handled the basic material with much more skill than this book did.

RR: 3/5


31.  Tattoos on the Heart, by Father Greg Boyle

Notes: This book, written by the founder of “Home Boy Industries” in Los Angeles, which goes out of its way to employ gang members and give people in poverty and in gangs a way out of their cycle of life. With great humor (some of which is certainly honed through using the stories in the book in sermons), it can be interesting. It’s not all good stories – the story of the company burning down for employing someone from a rival gang, and their scandal in funneling money to the Mexican Mafia is explored and touched on lightly.

RR: 3/5


32. 2666: A Novel, by Roberto Bolano

Notes: This book had won many awards and was much talked about before I picked it up. Part of that, certainly, is because of the author’s death. At 898 pages, it’s not a short read, and is definitely not an easy read. It jumps around a fictional future planet Earth, with discussions and long tangents on a variety of things, and has characters that are out of novels from 50 years or longer ago. Definitely epic, but frustrating. It’s part fairy tale, and part a series of short stories, in a way, with much dialog and quotable sections. But overall more a book for other writers interested in epic novels, and for academics interested in fiction structure, than a recommended read. I almost was more confused after reading this book than when I started, and was glad when it was over.

RR: 3/5



33.    13 Things that Don't Make Sense: The Most Baffling Scientific Mysteries of Our Time, by Michael Brooks

Notes: I attended a lecture on dark energy and dark matter, and so purchased this book, and was curious to read all about both, along with other “mysteries”. Unfortunately, other than the discussion of dark energy and dark matter, there is a discussion of much pseudoscience that has been firmly debunked elsewhere, from one time alien signals, homeopathy (really?), free will, and cold fusion.  Not much mysterious in most of what the author tries to make otherwise.

RR: 3/5


34.  The Time Of Your Life, by Anthony Robbins

Notes: This several day program focuses on particular goals, and portions of your life, improving each one at a time. Unfortunately, as is the case in Robbin’s later works, the book rambles into side issues, bragging, personal stories, that may or may not be relevant, name dropping of people he has met, and would benefit greatly from an editor. It seems to be the policy of the Robbins company that “more is better”, and focusing the words or subject matter doesn’t seem to ever happen, as it did in his earlier books edited by a publishing house.

jbspqo,Second Discussion Thread for The Fisherman by John Langan - October Book Club,"Hello everyone,

For this week we started Part 2. The weird stuff definitely picked up in this part. You will find the discussion questions below, but feel free to talk about anything regarding the first part of Part 2.

* What do you think happened to Rainier in Germany that caused him to lose his position at his university? Who do you think Wilhelm is?

* Who do you think Dort's Guest is? Do you think he is a real *Schwarzkunstler*?

>A man who's newly lost his wife can expect a certain amount of sympathy, some leeway, but people's memories are short for any sorrow that isn't theirs, and his job has to be done.

* So far, a husband losing his wife (Abe, Dan, Dort and George) has been a important part of the motivation of some of the characters. What do you think Langan is trying to show/tell the reader? Do you think it would be the same if it was about a wife losing a husband?

* Why do you think ""Helen"" is so focused on getting her children back?

>""Whoever this man is,"" Clara says, ""surely he must be what you call a dabbler. What would an actual Schwarzkunstler want with this place?""

* What is it about small towns that make it such a popular setting for horror, as opposed to big cities?

1137ruh,Micro reviews (spoiler-free) of the 61 books I read in 2022,"I’m about six weeks late on this but wanted to post anyway. Format is a quick description of the book followed by my thoughts. If you’ve read any of these, I’d love to discuss them with you!

I had a really great reading year in 2022. Per Goodreads, my average rating was 4.0, I read 61 books (17,743 pages), and the average length was 290 pages. My main goals were to do more rereading and read more nonfiction and poetry, all being basically nonexistent in my reading lists of years past. I met those goals with varying levels of success: I reread 16 books, read 5 nonfiction books, and only read 3 poetry collections. I plan to continue all of this in 2023.

Italicized titles are in the public domain—I highly recommend [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) as the best source for public domain works, though [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) has a better selection.

Without further ado, in order read:

**Ella Enchanted** by Gail Carson Levine: Middle Grade Cinderella retelling with a twist. Reread of a childhood favorite, delightfully nostalgic but admittedly a bit thin for an adult audience. ★★★★★

**I Capture the Castle** by Dodie Smith: Coming-of-age story of an impoverished 17-year-old who falls in love with the son of the wealthy family who moves nextdoor to the dilapidated English castle in which she and her bohemian family live. Charming, cozy, with a precocious narrator who is somehow the most well-adjusted of the entire cast. Well-written if a bit twee and kooky. ★★★★☆

***The Blue Castle*** by LM Montgomery: Valancy is a 29-year-old “spinster” who is given a shocking medical diagnosis and finally decides to get out from under her overbearing family and take control of her life. In spite of soap-opera-esque coincidences and plot contrivances, this swoonworthy romance is a new all-time favorite with some of the most beautiful nature writing I’ve ever read. ★★★★★

***Frankenstein*** (the 1818 text) by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein, driven by unchecked ambition, constructs a monstrous creature who sets out to take revenge on his creator. Another new all-time favorite and undeniably brilliant: a riveting and fast-paced storyline, interesting narrative structure, unique and evocative settings, eloquent prose, and timeless, thought-provoking themes. Feels much more mythic and philosophic than science fiction or horror. ★★★★★

**An Experiment in Criticism** by CS Lewis: Essay collection on literary criticism: a contemplation of why people read, what it means to read well, what literature has to offer as art, and what makes a good book. Yet another new all-time favorite; prose is succinct and immensely readable. Lewis puts words to feelings that I hadn’t been able to articulate (and also presents some more challenging ideas that I continue to think about). ★★★★★

**Anna Karenina** by Leo Tolstoy (trans. Pevear & Volokhonsky): Anna Karenina, a Russian aristocrat, begins an extramarital affair with a handsome cavalry officer, Count Vronksy; meanwhile, a young landowner, Levin, contemplates whether life is worth living while managing his farmland and pining after Anna’s sister-in-law, Kitty, who expects to receive a proposal from Vronsky. One of the most subtle, psychologically real novels I’ve ever read. Almost everyone is awful (except for Kitty and Tolstoy’s self-insert, Levin) yet impossible not to empathize with. ★★★★★

**The Luzhin Defense** by Vladmir Nabokov (trans. Michael Scammell): Follows the career of (fictional) chess genius Grandmaster Luzhin. Structurally a mess. The main character feels like a mean-spirited caricature of mental illness and is uninteresting, unsympathetic, and incomprehensible, with the physical, emotional, and psychological appeal of a slug. I enjoyed the opening chapters and some of the prose, but that’s it. ★★☆☆☆

**Vita Nostra** by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko (trans. Julia Meitov Hersey): Sasha is unwillingly recruited for the mysterious and supernatural Institute of Special Technologies. Unputdownable and surreal but turned me into a ball of anxiety. Prose is excellent, genre is undefinable. Kudos to the translator, it must have been almost impossible. ★★★★★

**84, Charing Cross Road** by Helene Hanff: Nonfiction collection of letters between a New York writer and a London antiquarian bookstore. Read in one sitting to recover from *Vita Nostra* and it’s an instant all-time favorite. I laughed, I cried, I wished it was longer. Anyone who loves books will probably love this. ★★★★★

**The Night Circus** by Erin Morgenstern: Two magicians are locked in a secret competition, the venue being the titular circus. Reread. Atmospheric, beautifully written, with some of the most magical imagery I’ve ever encountered, but the characters feel two-dimensional and lack emotional resonance. ★★★★☆

**All Quiet on the Western Front** by Erich Maria Remarque (trans. A. W. Wheen): The story of a German soldier who is part of the invasion of France in WWI. Brutal, unflinching, powerful depiction of war. One of the most impactful books I read (technically a reread as it was assigned in high school), it challenges black-and-white thinking about the people who make up armies. ★★★★★

**The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street** by Helene Hanff: Nonfiction account of Helene’s visit to England after the success of *84, Charing Cross Road*; more of a travel diary than a love letter to books (which *84* was). Mildly interesting because of how much I love Helene, but a bit dull—travel diaries aren’t so much my thing. ★★☆☆☆

**The Abolition of Man** by CS Lewis: Nonfiction essay collection arguing for the inclusion of virtue in education…I think? A bit disjointed and hard to follow, most of it went over my head but some of the ideas were intriguing. Lewis is a compelling stylist. ★★★☆☆

***Middlemarch*** by George Eliot: Widely considered to be the greatest English novel ever written (and deservedly so, in my opinion), it recounts the intertwined lives and romances of several families in fictional Middlemarch. It took me about 250 pages to really fall in with Eliot’s writing style, but once I did I found the novel both beautiful and readable. Just as psychologically real and compelling as Anna Karenina, if a bit more sensational and also more hopeful. ★★★★★

**Perelandra** by CS Lewis: What if JRR Tolkein was sent to Venus as an Adam figure in an Edenic paradise where Satan himself has just recently arrived? Book 2 in the Space Trilogy but a perfectly solid standalone; reread. The best part is the nature writing delving into landscapes that are completely fantastic and (quite literally) out of this world; the worst part is the plot, which revolves around extended discussions of fictionalized theology and is just so so boring. ★★★★☆

**The Drowned World** by JG Ballard: A biologist and friends set up camp in a version of London that is almost entirely submerged in a tropical swamp and Triassic-era jungles that have overtaken most of the globe. Atmosphere and prose are truly fantastic, plot is off-the-wall bonkers and nonsensical and things get real Freudian real fast. Lots of sexism (and kind of racist?). Should have been a short story. ★★★☆☆

***The Yellow Wallpaper*** by Charlotte Perkins Gilman: Victorian short story about a married woman prescribed the cure of laying in bed all day in the upstairs nursery. Great idea, boring and repetitive execution, even though it was short. Shirley Jackson tackled similar themes much much better with *The Good Wife*. ★★☆☆☆

**The Sundial** by Shirley Jackson: Aunt Fanny has a vision that the world will soon end, and her dysfunctional extended family begins the requisite preparations. Extremely bizarre and a bit all over the place, but strangely compelling. Not the place I’d recommend starting with Jackson, though. ★★★★☆

**A Grief Observed** by CS Lewis: Nonfiction diary entries, originally published under a pseudonym, of Lewis struggling with his faith in the aftermath of the death of his wife. Moving and vulnerable, if very short. ★★★★★

**Dark Tales** by Shirley Jackson: Short story collection mainly centered around characters (usually women) experiencing some sort of mental instability and/or living in a version of midcentury American that’s just a bit “off.” Someone else said these stories have a kind of “nightmare dream logic” to them, and I wholeheartedly agree. Very compelling, but the endings are usually unsatisfying. ★★★★☆

**Rebecca** by Daphne du Maurier: An insecure, lonely young woman marries a wealthy older man and is whisked off to his ancestral estate, where she is unable to escape the lingering presence of his beautiful (and dead) first wife, Rebecca. Reread of my favorite novel. The prose is gorgeous, the narrator/heroine is drawn with startling complexity and realism, the plot is heavily psychological and totally engrossing, I could talk about the subtext and symbolism for eons. ★★★★★

**Excellent Woman** by Barbara Pym: Mildred is an unmarried 30-something whose life revolves around her church and jumble sales when a chaotic younger couple with marital problems move in as neighbors. Another new favorite, with Pym a new favorite author. A bit Austen-esque in terms of the dry wit and emphasis on manners and society, it’s equal parts very funny and deeply melancholic, if a bit plotless. ★★★★★

**Titus Groan** by Mervyn Peake: An heir to Castle Gormenghast, Titus Groan, has just been born, and…there isn’t really that much of a plot, just increasingly bizarre vignettes of grotesque characters doing their own thing. Peake was obviously a master of prose and accomplished exactly what he set out to, but the novel was just too weird and the style too (intentionally) repulsive. ★★☆☆☆

**And Then There Were None** by Agatha Christie: A group of strangers are invited to a secluded island, where they start being murdered one-by-one: who’s the killer? Very fun murder mystery that’s hard to put down. Her style isn’t the most flashy, but it’s effective. ★★★★★

**No Fond Return of Love** by Barbara Pym: Hard to describe, but basically a social comedy about the romantic entanglements of midcentury English academics. Feels like people-watching: ordinary people (often embarrassing, pathetic, and too caught up in themselves) do ordinary things, tied together only loosely by the barest semblance of a plot. Cozy, humorous, and a delight, if not quite as much so as *Excellent Women*. ★★★★★

**Journey to the Centre of the Earth** by Jules Verne (trans. Frank Wynne): A young man travels with his eccentric professor uncle on a quest to visit the theoretically hollow center of the Earth by way of an Icelandic volcano. Another new favorite, probably because I love rocks and geology and spelunking and dinosaurs and old-timey inventions and the sense of wonder and excitement with which Verne’s characters view the natural world and the fantastic things they discover. The characters are a bit flat and the plot structure is a mess, but it’s just so fun that I didn’t care. Translation is fantastic (and, more importantly when it comes to Verne, reputable). ★★★★★

**On Chesil Beach** by Ian McEwan: Young newlyweds have a disastrous honeymoon; the history of their relationship is examined. A pointless exercise in misery with characters who are completely unbelievable. Some of the prose was nice, though. ★★☆☆☆

**Chess Story** by Stefan Zweig (trans. Joel Rotenberg): A traveler aboard a passenger ship challenges the world chess champion. Short and moderately entertaining, but fairly predictable, unextraordinary, and laughably unbelievable for anyone who follows competitive chess. ★★★☆☆

**Annihilation** by Jeff VanderMeer: A biologist is one of a team of women sent to explore Area X, a section of the coast undergoing strange and inexplicable changes, where she is forced to confront her professional and personal failures, including the dissolution of her marriage. Reread of my favorite work of science fiction: I adore the atmosphere, the tension, the sense of *wrongness*, the nature writing, the narrative structure, and the character study that is the heart of the novel. ★★★★★

**Authority** by VanderMeer: The sequel to *Annihilation* follows a man nicknamed “Control” who is newly appointed as head of the Southern Reach, the governmental organization tasked with investigating Area X. Another reread, and oh no, it’s kind of bad. I think it’s trying to be a noir espionage thriller about bureaucracy, but it ends up being bland in terms of character and atmosphere with the thematic subtlety of being hit over the head. ★★☆☆☆

**Acceptance** by VanderMeer: The sequel to *Authority* follows the next expedition into Area X. At least we’re back in Area X with its beautiful, eerie setting; unfortunately, things get real weird and feel kind of pointless. ★★★☆☆☆

***Northanger Abbey*** by Jane Austen: Catherine Morland, young, naive, and an avid reader of novels, builds new friendships and falls in love in a lighthearted comic satire of Gothic romances. My favorite Austen novel so far, in part because Catherine herself is delightful and in part because of the unexpected metacommentary on novels and reading. ★★★★★

***Moby-Dick: or, the Whale*** by Herman Melville: Ishmael signs on to a whaling ship and Melville spends the next 500 pages talking about whales and the whaling industry. I loved the opening chapters, but once Ishmael sets out to sea the plot disappears and the book becomes a collection of essays and short character vignettes, deeply metaphoric and beautifully written. Undeniably a brilliant piece of writing, but not really a *novel*. Very postmodern feeling and one of the most unique things I’ve read, I just didn’t really care for it. ★★★☆☆

**The Lottery and Other Stories** by Shirley Jackson: A collection of short stories that are mainly “slice of life” vignettes centered around a theme or character study. Many lack a discernible story structure, or really any kind of narrative movement. There are some great ones, but many of them fell flat for me. ★★★☆☆

***The Complete Poems*** by Emily Brontë (ed. Janet Gezari): Emily Brontë complete body of poetry. My first foray into poetry, and a “complete works” was probably not a great place to start. I don’t know much about the form, but I liked it overall, I guess? ★★★☆☆

**Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea** by Jules Verne (trans. David Coward): A professor and friends on board a giant submarine travel beneath the seas, where they experience many manmade and natural wonders. Properly translated, the title should be “...under the Sea**s**”, and I can’t tell if I didn’t care for this translation specifically or the novel  itself. The plot is extremely thin (as are the characters, though I think that’s expected in a Verne novel), and I’m just not that interested in lists of fish. ★★★☆☆

**My Friend Flicka** by Mary O’Hara: Growing up on a ranch in Wyoming, all Ken—a daydreamer who never seems able to do anything right—wants is a horse of his own. Reread of a childhood favorite, and even though the main character is a child I don’t really think this is intended to be a children’s book at all, tackling themes of responsibility, facing reality, parenthood, and marriage. The nature writing is gorgeous and the characterization subtle; the plot is at times brutal with some real tear-jerking moments. Definitely a favorite. Surprisingly not available as an ebook, though. ★★★★★

***Far From the Madding Crowd*** by Thomas Hardy: Bathesheba Everdene inherits a farm and is courted by three very different men. Supposedly Hardy’s “happiest” novel, it’s still brutally sad. It’s also a total soap opera and quite the page-turner. The nature writing is beautiful as one would expect, but the characterization feels a bit hollow. ★★★★☆

**100 Best-Loved Poems** edited by Philip Smith: Slim collection of poetry from the Middle Ages through the 20th century. A better starting place. ★★★★☆

***Pride and Prejudice*** by Jane Austen: Elizabeth Bennet’s mother is obsessed with marrying her daughters off, and a wealthy family has just moved into the neighborhood. Might actually be a perfect novel: the characterization is superb, the plot has zero fat, the chemistry between the romantic leads is electric, and Austen is so *so* funny (though she definitely plays favorites). Technically a reread because I read it in high school, but I appreciated it much more this time around. Feels very modern. A favorite. ★★★★★

**Quartet in Autumn** by Barbara Pym: Follows four coworkers—two women, two men—in the autumn of their lives as two of them face retirement. Brutally bleak and an almost relentlessly depressing look at loneliness and aging; I cried my way through it. Not much plot and the opening chapters are a bit rough, but I find myself thinking about this all the time. ★★★★☆

**Black Wings Has My Angel** by Elliott Chaze: Noir novel about a convict who teams up with a prostitute for one more heist. Dark and violent, I don’t think the grittiness was quite my cup of tea but it was impossible to put down. The writing is superb and it would have been five stars, but Chaze fumbled the ending. ★★★★☆

**Piranesi** by Susanna Clarke: Piranesi lives in a House filled with thousands of statues, tides that thunder up staircases, clouds that move in slow procession through the upper halls, and a single other living person…until it seems that someone new has come to the House. Reread of my favorite fantasy novel and it was just as magical as the first time around. Surreal, beautiful, and utterly unique. ★★★★★

**The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe** by CS Lewis: Four siblings travel through the back of a wardrobe into Narnia, a fantasy world ruled by the wicked White Witch. Reread of a childhood favorite, and unfortunately this really doesn’t hold up for an adult audience: it’s heavily didactic and the writing is a bit bland (I mean, I think that was intentional as it’s written to be a sort of modern fairytale, but I didn’t really care for it). Five stars only because I loved it back when I was the target audience. ★★★★★

***Lady Audley’s Secret*** by Mary Elizabeth Braddon: Robert Audley is visiting his wealthy uncle, who has recently married the mysterious (and much younger) Lady Audley, when his good friend goes missing. The Victorian equivalent of a domestic thriller: some mysteries go unanswered until the end of the novel, but it is very much a game of cat-and-mouse between Robert and “my lady.” Some character choices feel a bit unbelievable, but very fun overall. The writing style may be a bit overblown, but I like flowery prose so it worked for me. ★★★★☆

***The Castle of Otranto*** by Horace Walpole: When a giant helmet falls from the sky and kills the heir of the Castle of Otranto, his father decides to have his marriage annulled and instead marry the young woman who would have been his daughter-in-law, very much against her will; hijinks and supernatural phenomena ensue. Often cited as the first Gothic novel, it purports to be a translation of a medieval manuscript discovered by Walpole. Hilariously bad on every level, and just short enough that it’s entertaining for that very reason. ★★★☆☆

**The Screaming Staircase** by Jonathan Stroud: The first in a Middle Grade series about Lucy Carlyle, a teen who joins a small Psychic Investigations Agency—one of many that have recently sprung up to rid houses of the dangerous ghosts that have infested the greater London area. No, I have not seen the Netflix show. The books are delightful: funny, thrilling, atmospheric, and just a bit spooky. Better-written than most adult genre fiction. Reread. ★★★★★

***The Picture of Dorian Gray*** by Oscar Wilde: Dorian Gray, a beautiful young man who falls under the influence of the perverse Lord Henry Wotton, wishes that a perfect portrait of himself would bear the signs of aging in his place. An instant favorite: some of the most beautiful prose I’ve ever read, and extended meditations on the nature of art, humanity, and sin. ★★★★★

**The Haunting of Hill House** by Shirley Jackson: Eleanor Vance—lonely and desperate to get out of the house of her overbearing sister—accepts an invitation to spend the summer at a supposedly haunted house as part of an academic investigation, but the inexplicable phenomena the group experience seem to single her out in unsettling ways. Reread of a favorite. Not as spooky this time around, but just as enjoyable. A brilliant character study and piece of psychological horror with prose that is equal parts gripping and beautiful. ★★★★★

**Pocket Book of Poetry** published by Barnes and Noble: A collection of English poetry spanning four centuries. The selection itself was very good, but there is a complete lack of any commentary—not even dates are given. (Unsurprising, it seems like B&N always phone it in.) ★★★★☆

***Mehalah*** by Sabine Baring-Gould: Forgotten Victorian novel about a young woman living in poverty on the isolated salt marshes of Essex who is relentlessly pursued/stalked by the sadistic and passionate Elijah Rebow. Bizarre, unsettling, and violent, centered around a toxic relationship, I understand the *Wuthering Heights* comparison, except nobody could mistake this for a romance and Mehalah herself is no Catherine Linton. A compelling read, if disturbing. ★★★★☆

***Three Men in a Boat*** by Jerome K. Jerome: Three bumbling Victorian gentlemen decide to take a vacation by boating up the Thames; hilarity ensues. It’s primarily a series of humorous vignettes and anecdotes strung together, and I found it very funny and charming, largely thanks to our narrator’s personality. I rarely laugh out loud when reading but this did it for me. ★★★★★

**The Borrowers** by Mary Norton: Arriety and her family are “borrowers,” tiny people who live under the floorboards and “borrow” what they need from the humans who live upstairs, with the fear of being “seen” constantly hanging over them. Reread of a childhood favorite, and it is just so whimsical and cozy! I’ve always loved small things, so I was delighted to read about dressers made from matchboxes and end tables made from pill boxes. The characters are exceptionally well-developed for a children’s book, and the illustrations are enchanting. ★★★★★

**The Borrowers Afield** by Mary Norton: In the sequel to *The Borrowers*, the little family now must try to survive outdoors, where they take refuge in an old leather boot. This was another reread, and while I didn’t love it as much as the first book due to the extended framing device, the description of the outdoors as seen through the eyes of tiny people was lovely and there’s a bit more adventure. ★★★★☆

***Villette*** by Charlotte Brontë: An English teacher in Belgium deals with depression and unrequited love. Reread of one of my favorite novels: beautifully written, psychologically profound, and quite moving. ★★★★★

**I Am Legend** by Richard Matheson: Robert Neville may be the last human alive, and he spends his days fighting vampires and drinking. Fun premise (sci-fi approach to zombies) and a quick read, but the characterization was atrocious (Robert is a walking cliche) and the sexism is gross. ★★★★☆

**In the Woods** by Tana French: An Irish detective investigates the murder of a young girl whose body is found in the same woods where he himself was discovered as a child, covered in blood and with no memory of what happened to his missing friends. I was expecting French to be the next Gillian Flynn: beautiful prose, incredible atmosphere, pointed commentary, crazy twists. Instead this felt like a kind of generic police procedural that was perfectly readable but unremarkable and too long. I think it’s intended to be a study of the relationship between Rob and his partner Cassie, but I just didn’t care about either of them. Oh, and one of the central questions of the book (specifically, >!what happened to Rob as a child!<) is left unanswered, which is infuriating. ★★★☆☆

**Roadside Picnic** by Arkady and Boris Sturgatsky (trans. Olena Bormashenko): Follows Red as he navigates the black market and bureaucracy that has sprung up around the strange and dangerous Zone, which he occasionally enters in search of valuable and mysterious alien artifacts. I enjoyed the roughly half of the novel that is set in the Zone; the other half was dull. Generally disjointed and too disturbing for me. Very little atmosphere. Comparisons to *Annihilation* don’t hold up beyond the surface-level similarities. ★★☆☆☆

**Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont** by Elizabeth Taylor: Elderly Mrs. Palfrey is the newest arrival at the Claremont, a hotel-turned-quasi-retirement-home, and convinces a young writer to pretend to be her grandson so she isn’t embarrassed by her lack of visitors. I laughed, I cried, I sometimes was a bit bored. There’s just not quite enough voice in Taylor’s writing, and the characters felt a bit too distant. It didn’t help that I kept thinking how much more I’d have enjoyed the novel if it was written by Barbara Pym. ★★★☆☆

**Nutcracker and Mouse King** by ETA Hoffmann (trans. Joachim Neugroschel): Christmas fairytale that explains the origin of nutcrackers and the phrase “That was a hard nut to crack.” It’s just really weird, really hard to follow, and really boring. ★★☆☆☆",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1137ruh/micro_reviews_spoilerfree_of_the_61_books_i_read/,2023-02-15 20:32:44,15,63,books
jhuca9,A spoiler-free review of The Dying Earth by Jack Vance,"Notions of apocalypse have gripped the human imagination for millennia, and apocalyptic fiction remains a familiar presence across all of pop culture. I've never felt particularly drawn towards the subgenre myself, but I was enamoured by the subtly different spin on it in Gene Wolfe's [Book of the New Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968868.The_Book_of_the_New_Sun). Instead of a specific cataclysmic event caused by the hubris of man or the unpredictable wrath of celestial forces, Wolfe's apocalypse is simply the natural, entropic conclusion of a tired world that has run its course. Reading Wolfe naturally led me to Jack Vance, and while Vance did not pioneer this flavour of apocalypse, he certainly popularised it such that his famous work has lent it a familiar name: The Dying Earth.

[*The Dying Earth*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/951749.The_Dying_Earth) is a collection of six short stories published in 1950. Each story is self-contained, but they take place on the same Earth of a distant future when the sun is a dim, red echo of itself, evoking a quiet but persistent sense of melancholy and nihilism. Reading this book is akin to falling into a painting (I imagine), and Vance depicts a dizzying range of fully realised landscapes by using a masterful economy of words. This is a truly vivid and surreal journey, taking readers from the lush forests of Ascolais and its bizarre inhabitants to the decaying magitech-powered city of Ampridatvir. 

Vance writes with a distinct style, blending starchy, ceremonious dialogue with fantasy and pulpy tropes. The end result is stories with a mythological bent but a definite down-to-earth, sword and sorcery feel. He is fond of archaic words, some of which I'm half-convinced are made up; as with Gene Wolfe, this often ends up determining whether you love it or hate it. To me, these words are a feature and not a bug, as they imbue the stories with a decadent, almost Tolkienesque atmosphere. In place of elves, dwarves, and orcs, Vance shows us some refreshingly original creatures, such as Twk-Men (tiny salt-loving men who ride on dragonflies) and pelgranes (bird-men who prey on unwitting travellers). 

Speaking of Tolkien, whose influence pervades so much of modern fantasy, Vance's legacy can be easily identified in many titans of SF/F. Besides the aforementioned Book of the New Sun, the D&D role-playing game owes its magic system to Vance's depiction of the use of spells. The city of Ampridatvir bears a striking resemblance to the twin cities of Besźel and Ul Qoma in China Miéville's [*The City and the City*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4703581-the-city-the-city). There are many more sources of inspiration like these that a reader more experienced than I would be able to identify. 

While there are nods to big ideas such as biotechnology, the stories lack thematic complexity, which is understandable given that they are among Vance's earliest publications. Where *The Dying Earth* excels is at pure storytelling, the ability of a good yarn to entertain strangers by the proverbial campfire, and Vance does a great job in combining elements of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror to bedazzle, thrill, and terrify (some of his creatures such as Blikdak, Chun the Unavoidable, and the oasts are very unsettling). I think they've aged well, and I'm curious to see how his writing matured over time. 

One thing you won't find in *The Dying Earth* is nuanced and meaningful character development, mainly because these are short stories in a shared setting, but also because the characters are rather superficial. It feels almost as if they are puppets on a stage that came straight out of myths and fairy-tales of our own world. I don't mind the weak characterisation, as Vance's style and imagination more than make up for it. Another pitfall is the invariable objectification of women, though I understand Vance's writing is much less overtly sexist than many of his contemporaries. Still, it's pretty damning that the male hero and female trophy archetype of the first story doesn't change much throughout *The Dying Earth*.

For readers interested in the classic roots of genre fiction, this is surely one that mustn't be missed. Many fans of Jack Vance suggest the later entries in the *Tales of the Dying Earth* collection - the Cugel stories, specifically - are a better introduction to Vance's works, but it takes no time at all to go through these six stories, and come away with an intricately detailed dreamscape of a dying earth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jhuca9/a_spoilerfree_review_of_the_dying_earth_by_jack/,2020-10-25 14:37:32,1,30,books

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the second discussion thread for the April selection, *The Vanishing Half* by Brit Bennett! We will be discussing up to (and including) **Part III - Heartlines (1968)**. Hopefully you have all managed to buy or check-out the book but if you haven't, you can still catch up and join in on a later discussion; however, this thread will be openly discussing through Part III. If you wish to talk about anything beyond this point, please use spoilers.

Below are some questions to help start conversation including prompts from the writer herself that are meant for book club discussion. Feel free to answer some or all of them, or post about whatever your thoughts on the material.

1. What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?
2. Do you think Stella ultimately regrets her choices? What about Desiree?
3. Consider the various forces that shape the twins into the people they become, and the forces that later shape their respective daughters. In the creation of an individual identity or sense of self, how much influence do you think comes from upbringing, geography, race, gender, class, education? Which of these are mutable and why? Have you ever taken on or discarded aspects of your own identity?
4. Kennedy is born with everything handed to her, Jude with comparatively little. What impact do their relative privileges have on the people they will become? How does it affect their relationships with their mothers and their understanding of home? 
5.  The town of Mallard is small in size but looms large in the personal histories of its residents. How does the history of this town and its values affect the twins; how does it affect “outsiders” like Early and later Jude? Do you understand why Desiree decides to return there as an adult? What does the depiction of Mallard say about who belongs to what communities, and how those communities are formed and enforced?
6. What are your predictions moving forward?

Reminder that next week we will be reading up to (and including) Part IV and the discussion will begin Friday, April 16th.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mndapl/book_club_the_vanishing_half_by_brit_bennett_week/,2021-04-09 09:12:02,6,14,books

2r39mo,The books I read of 2014,"Last year I read 97 books, and the year before, over 100.  This year - 44. 

(Happy to provide my reading lists back to 2008 for anyone that is interested).  

I love reading.  Reading, and books, has been part of my life for a long, long time, and I enjoy the things I have learned from books, and the joy of great writing.  Reading is part of my daily routine, and so many days  I have looked forward to getting back to a current book.  As I did last year, I have a rating system for the books I finished, and I have them in ranking from my favorites to my least favorite.  More books are already on deck for 2015, including many that I could not finish by year end in 2014.  Let me know your thoughts, please, and I’m always open for recommendations of good books you’ve enjoyed.

The books I read in 2014:

The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak
Notes: This fiction book was recommended to me, and I am glad I read it this year. Set in Nazi Germany during World War II, and narrated by Death, it was extremely touching.  I really resonated with the love of books and the printed word, and growing up and learning to become a family, made this one of my favorite books of the year.  Highly recommended.
RR: 5+/5 

Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality without Religion, by Sam Harris
Notes: This book is so well written, I couldn’t put it down until it was finished.  It’s also an important book, as it is written by an outspoken critic of religion, but outlines the importance of spirituality, and regarding meditation in particular, which has helped me in many ways.  Sam Harris has written many great books, but I think this one was my favorite, and I will likely re-read it. 
RR: 5/5 

Hallucinations, by Oliver Sacks
Notes: After listening to Oliver Sacks describe various medical conditions and outside influences that can trigger hallucinations, I knew I had to read this book.  And it was amazing, well written, and really shows how even small changes in brain structure or chemistry can create reality different from what one is used to.  Visual and auditory hallucinations, and hallucinations of time perception, are covered very thoroughly here. 
RR: 5/5 

The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, by John C. Bogle
Notes: This is solid investing advice from the master, and founder of Vanguard.  Nothing flashy here, but by looking at the market from a ratio perspective and using low cost investing funds/etfs, this strategy almost guarantees you will beat the overall market and most sectors.
RR: 5/5

No Excuses: The Power of Self Discipline, by Brian Tracy
Notes:  This book is first and foremost about self discipline.  The idea of this book seemed to me, at first, to contradict the premises of many of Tracy’s other works, regarding how structures can make discipline less important.  However, this book makes a compelling argument that using willpower, which is limited, in the right areas of your life can make drastic changes.
RR: 5/5

The Survivors Club: The Secrets and Science that Could Save Your Life, by Ben Sherwood
Notes:  This book has an analysis of practical strategies for a number of situations you may or may not ever find yourself in.  It’s also well written.  With interviews from survivors of plane crashes, sinking ships, and survivors of concentration camps, this also tells you how to survive a heart attack or having something impale your body.  Overall, the message is to have faith you will survive, be positive, and be on the lookout for lucky opportunities, which is good advice for life.
RR:  5/5

Drift:  The Unmooring of American Military Power, by Rachel Maddow
Notes: I am not that familiar with Rachel Maddow, but the title of this book appealed to me. Regardless of your politics, this, I feel is an important book to read.  So much of our identity as Americans, and our politics, is shaped by military policy, and in patch-working a national security policy, our system is opened to abuse and wasteful overspending, and leads us to military growth and suspicion, and thus almost perpetual military conflicts.
RR: 5/5

Great On The Job: What to Say, How to Say It, by Jodi Glickman
Notes: This book is really about communication in the workplace, and is meant for larger corporate environments, or people in the entertainment industry, but is a great read.  The author clearly put a lot of time into thinking what works best for various situations, and has the experience to communicate that well.
RR: 5/5

Command Authority, by Tom Clancy
Notes: This “Tom Clancy” novel was actually written by Mark Greaney, using the Tom Clancy name.  It starts during the Cold War 30 years ago, and covers the current Russian government, and many secrets that date back to the KGB era.  Well written.
RR: 5/5

Life Beyond Earth by Timothy Ferris
Notes:  I enjoy Timothy Ferris’ writing, although he does less of it these days, and this scientific look at the story of discovery of exo planets, outside our solar system, is thrilling.  This is a companion piece to a tv series that I did not view, but the book stands on its own very well.
RR: 5/5

Before Happiness, by Shawn Anchor
Notes: This book is the follow up to the successful Happiness Advantage (which made my earlier list for 2012).  For a Harvard professor, Shawn has a very casual and easygoing writing style, and his recommendations are all solidly rooted in science.  Focus and meaning (or anchors, in the language of this book), and a willingness to keep going to the finish, are all you need to accomplish almost anything in life. 
RR: 5/5

A Complaint Free World, by Will Bowen
Notes:  This book is all about the power of thinking positive.  Challenging the reader to do a “positivity challenge”, where you cease complaining about things, and look for the good in everything.  A short book, but good advice (even if repeated in other books here on this list).
RR: 4.5/5

The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want, by Sonya Lyubomirsky
Notes: This book is well written, and is full of practical advice for how to increase happiness.  I learned that hugging as much as possible increases happiness, and that the happier people are, the less they think or care about what other people think.  Marriage increases happiness only 2 years, and then happiness returns to normal.  A good easy read.
RR: 4.5/5

Home Court Advantage: Preparing Your Children to Be Winners in Life, by Dr. Kevin Leman
Notes: Making your home a safe haven for your child and his or her friends, and slowing down and doing less and concentrating on quality family life is the message of this book.  Not a long book, but as a parent, I got a lot out of it. 
RR: 4.5/5

Quiet:  The Power of Introverts In A World That Can’t Stop Talking, by Susan Cain
Notes: This book is a call to change the injustice that introverts, who very often change the world, working in private, are overshadowed by a society that prizes the loud and extravagant.   The author argues that introverts have a great deal to offer the world and that we are making a mistake by not accommodating and encouraging this important personality type.
This is a compelling and very well-written book, and the author is raising very important points and has done so in a well researched and thoughtful work.
RR: 4.5/5

The Art of Nonfiction, by Ayn Rand
Notes: A book for writers, to be sure, but it does give great practical advice from a best selling author on organizing thoughts and writing for clarity.  “On Writing” by Stephen King, from my 2011 list, is still the best in this arena, but this is a great book on writing. 
RR: 4.5/5

First, Break All The Rules: What the World’s Greatest Managers do Differently, by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman
Notes: If you manage people, this book really makes you think about all the different ways that people are motivated and how best to do reviews, and how to bring out talent based upon the individual strengths and weaknesses of each person. 
RR: 4.5/5

Death by Black Hole by Neil Degrasse Tyson
Notes: This is actually a collection of essays, published previously in a science magazine.  It’s an interesting look at knowledge, science, and some facts about the universe you may not know, and shows Tyson to be an engaging writer.  My only criticism is that it does sometimes change abruptly from essay to essay, and often repeats information.
