6dskp7,Don Quixote is so fucking funny,"Disclaimer: I'm only two-hundred pages into the book.

I knew it was gonna be humorous, but I didn't know I would be chortling mad with laughter almost every chapter! His wit and joke-sense transcends time and space, I swear. I don't want to spoil any particular jokes for you guys, but he really runs the gamut so I'll just share a few I really liked:

At one point, Don Quixote's squire, Sancho Panza, needs to take a massive shit, but he can't let Quixote leave his sight because he's scared he'll run off and do some dumb shit, so there's an extended description of Sancho surreptitiously dropping his pants and trying to take a dump right next to Quixote without him noticing. 

Too disgusting for you? Well, at one point, Sancho realizes that he actually knows Don Quixote's chosen lady love, Dulcinea of Toboso, and in recognizing her, describes her in a really brutally unflattering way, forcing Quixote to silently suffer through what is essentially a roast of the woman he loves. 

At another point, Cervantes basically invents the comedic montage of slowly designing a shitty armor set: Quixote spends a week binding a helmet, only to smack it with a sword and break it in half.

I don't know if I explained those well enough for you, but it gives you a good idea of the kind of humor we're dealing with here - it's varied, interesting, and shockingly timeless; it really makes me wonder if indeed humor is so universal that we just inherently *get* the jokes because we're human, or because his writing influenced the very foundations of our comedy today.

Oh, and another thing: I've read plenty of thousand-page books in the past, and they all share one common characteristic - they waste your goddamned time. Be it *The Count of Monte Cristo*, *Les Miserables*, *Cryptonomicon*. or *The Stand*, there's always some shit that really doesn't add much of anything to the work; I think that's pretty much undeniable, though we don't like to admit it because those novels are almost like our spoiled children here at /r/books, and mostly deserve their length.

I say all that because *Don Quixote* doesn't seem to waste your time much at all. It's just straight-up comedy scene to crazy shit to comedically crazy shit to interesting conversation to hilarious interlude to even more crazy shit. Throughout the two hundred pages of Edith Grossman's translation I've read in the past two days, I don't think I've been bored once. Even the immense monologues are engaging, well-constructed, and often hilarious in any number of ways. 

I can't wait to read the rest of it, and I suggest you do the same. It's not just an overblown outdated timesink: there's something definitely worthwhile here for every reader, and I shouldn't have brushed off the recommendation for so long. 

It's gonna be a long summer. Let's make it count.

**edit:** oh jeez, this became a thing

**edit 2:** Just got back from replying to a bunch of comments only to find that the thread doubled in size while I was working my way down. I'm sorry that I can't reply to all your comments, but I am going to try to read them all. 

Before that, though, I have a few points to go over:

Firstly, I am reading and recommending *Edith Grossman's* translation of the book. It keeps the soul of the prose alive while explaining the various archaic references and confusing textual nuances through footnotes. One thing, though, is that if you get the paperback version of her translation (with the red cover and the helmet), you have to be prepared for the cover to fall apart with use. Not the spine, but the cover. Therefore, I might suggest getting the e-book version.

Secondly, you guys are right: I definitely haven't read enough to make a judgment on whether this book wastes your time. Personally, I'm extremely entertained by it so far, but for some readers it might drag at points. I hear that the second part of the book goes a long way towards fixing this.

Thirdly, I fucking love all of the long books I mentioned, and wouldn't trade their length for the world; it's what makes them great. But you realistically just aren't gonna write a thousand-page book without including some unnecessary stuff, and without it being a drag in parts. That's all I'm saying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6dskp7/don_quixote_is_so_fucking_funny/,2017-05-28 07:12:11,661,7809,books
4f1tk5,Don Quixote is the first cosplayer,"As many people in Spanish-speaking countries, I read Don Quixote in high school. At the time, it seemed like a strikingly ""modern"" book for its time; but recently I have started thinking that may it is even more so than I originally credited it for. 

If you draw the parallels, Don Quixote is actually a description of an ultra-nerd who becomes the first cosplayer/LARPer. After all, he is so obsessed with his chivalry books (mangas/videogames) that he makes/buys an outfit to match that of a chivalry book protagonist (cosplaying) and then acts out the part with the battles, romance and all (LARPing).

Most of the comedy in the book comes from the fact that his obsession makes him turn it all up to 11, completely disrupting his daily/normal life as an hidalgo (ultra-nerd ditching his life for some convention) and even acquiring a wingman whose (real) purpose is to protect him from the harm that his madness would bring him. So you could also say that Don Quixote is a precedent of the stereotype of ""the socially-unadapted ultra-nerd"", and consequently of movies and shows like... The Big Bang Theory?

What do you think? Does my theory make sense, or would I better go ram some windmills and post this in /r/showerthoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4f1tk5/don_quixote_is_the_first_cosplayer/,2016-04-16 13:06:44,236,3122,books

evlzuu,Have anyone actually read Don Quixote from cover to cover?,"I'm currently reading it, with at least a quarter of the book being read. So far, it seems to me that every adventure Don Quixote roughly follows a general flow: he sees something that looks like an opportunity to show his knightly-ness, he and Sancho tries to resolve the issue that was never there, or is severely misunderstood by Don Quixote, and they either get punished or rewarded by the experience as a result. 

I get that the book's pretty significant historically. It basically talked shit on a whole genre during its time, right? But is it worth reading it in its entirety in contemporary times? Is there some sort of present relevance the book holds that I haven't realized? I really want to enjoy this book, but I'm wondering if I don't have the correct mindset, or if I'm overlooking something really important while reading this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/evlzuu/have_anyone_actually_read_don_quixote_from_cover/,2020-01-29 12:04:15,366,1411,books
1ax63vb,Don Quixote by Cervantes,"I've heard about this book a bunch of times but what made me finally pick it up was a Franz Kafka passage so I decided to get it and read it.

I'm almost upset I never picked it up before, I thought it would be a bit of a chore considering how long ago it was written but literally the first paragraph sucked me in and made me enjoy my time.  I think it might be my favorite opening passage to a book I've read so far, the whole preface I could just tell Cervantes was in a good mood.  And the whole book he managed to keep things so intriguing and charming, not even one second did I feel like I was just trudging along, I just wanted to keep reading.  As well as the ending, one of the most satisfying endings I can think of, I have no idea how Cervantes managed it, I just feel better for having read it.

ppdrky,Currently reading Don Quixote and I can't get enough of his (mis)adventures.,"I kept noticing Don Quixote being referred as ""the guy who fought the windmills"" way too many times, but never really thought about giving it a try until recently, a friend of mine recommended it to me. And honestly, it keeps exceeded my expectations.

I was dubious about reading it because bulky books seem daunting to me, I can't commit to read them. But Don Quixote turned out to be different, it's so much interesting that it's hard to put it down. I don't know if it's just me but the humour appears way ahead of it's time, I definitely didn't expected that. I am currently at the beginning and I still found it funny enough to give me bellyaches. Especially, since the introduction of Sanzo, he's complementary to Don Quixote's buffoonery.

I guess I just wanted to ask how was your experience reading it and does it get better or worse from here? Also, while we're on that subject, I wanted to ask why is it that Miguel de Cervantes made it appear as if Don Quixote was a real person and not just a fictional one, is it to emphasize the theme of parody of books about chivalrous knights at that time or is there a different reason for it?

(Just wanted to add that I have John Ormsby's translation, so let me know if I should continue or avoid reading it).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ppdrky/currently_reading_don_quixote_and_i_cant_get/,2021-09-16 13:55:14,119,664,books

For info I'm reading the John Rutherford translation which includes a bit of background of the views and state of chivalry novels at the time of writing, it also provides a bit of background to Cervantes and references in the novel to know where certain legends, Ballard's and stories come from, which on reflection is probably necessary to get the most out of this book.

16q7iti,So im reading Don Quixote.,"Translated by P.A. Motteux.

Anyway im a on and off reader. What that means you ask is that today on Saturday im reading a few pages and i might resume in the next 2 week or next month when i feel like reading Donquixote again. 

Im in no hurry to complete the book.

But one thing i like about Donquixote (among many other) are the titles before each chapters? 

Right now i have stopped reading on ""what passed between Donquixote and the Goatherd"".

So I have a few theories on what will pass...

1. Either he's going to fight some goats?

2. Swear his allegiance to one?

3. Marry one?

4. Or get nearly kills by them? 

5. Or he might eat one of them?

I think i love the titles because now I can't wait to get back to thee book and find out what will happen with the Goats? 

Anyway thanks for reading I just wanted to talk about Donquixote and well a book.

P.s Lol i just found out that a Goatherd is the shepherd? So its not an altercation with Goats but with a shepherd. All my theories are wrong already 🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16q7iti/so_im_reading_don_quixote/,2023-09-23 15:34:40,15,19,books
szs2kf,Don Quixote might be the most inappropriately romanticized character in any book.,"I just finished Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.  It is easily one of the funniest books I've ever read.  But I was surprised to find that Don Quixote is not a hero.  He is a dangerously delusional imbecile and an abject coward.  Based on popular cultural references I assumed he was a noble if misguided soul that had been born in the wrong century.  Maybe confused but ultimately good-hearted.  And the whole concept of chivalry is savagely mocked throughout the book.

I've been trying to think of other characters and events from classic stories that are generally misrepresented in popular culture.  The most obvious is Romeo and Juliet, which is usually portrayed as the ultimate love story.  Any serious reader of Romeo and Juliet knows it's more of a cautionary tale about foolish teenagers doing stupid things because they think they're in love.

Are there other examples of this, where the meaning of a story is generally lost or unrecognizable because so few people actually bother to read the story?

EDIT:  Apparently I don't remember Romeo and Juliet as well as I thought I did, or didn't understand it as well as I thought I did.  I appreciate the feedback, but I do think my point stands; thinking of Romeo and Juliet as a great love story is missing some much larger, much darker themes, both of their relationship and the overall story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/szs2kf/don_quixote_might_be_the_most_inappropriately/,2022-02-23 21:09:33,115,103,books

It's a long work, or really, it's two 400-page novels, but so amazing!  The Edith Grossman translation is very evenly done and consistent.

I particularly love the many, many ways in which the novel, or characters within it, question reality.

I'm only a literal handful of pages in - and looking forward to the next 600. 

Aside from almost continual terribly long run-on sentences, I can't get over how modern the text seems. Granted, I'm sure a lot of that has to do with the translation. (I want to say Charles Jarvis?)

And Robinson Crusoe? only a half of the book is about Robinson being stranded on the island and then saved, the other is about him wanting to and eventually returning to the island of his own volition.

nmxgjp,Don Quixote and modern teaching of classics,"(sorry for poor formatting, I’m on mobile)
I’ll start with my anecdote:


I grew up in the US school system with classics shoved down my throat every step of the way without ever being told the merit in reading them. I’ve read Dickens, Bronte, heck even Vonnegut and Homer and managed to get through 13 years of public schooling without learning anything beyond “old books are harder to read and reading them makes you a better reader.” All “theme” discussions went in one ear and out the other. 


Fast forward to college, it’s the night before my big math final and I’m nervous as can be. No amount of peppermint or chamomile tea was putting me to sleep before that thing. I make a midnight run to the library, planning to study all night because sleep is evading me. In the library entrance, a “free book” section catches my eye and I decide that I’ll change my plan and pick a book to hopefully put me to sleep instead of resigning myself to none as intended. I pick up Don Quixote and go back to my room, knowing classics reliably make me snooze.


I get back to my room, start reading, and realize—this book is the funniest thing I’ve ever read! I got so, so much more from this book reading it from a perspective of leisure: not only was it funny, but I actually understood more of what the book was trying to say than all of the other books I couldn’t care less about in public school. I began my reading journey anew, picking up all the classics I studied in school and reading them from a perspective of enjoyment and finally understanding the significance of the themes I was forced to memorize. 


I feel that if english departments approached these classic works as something to be genuinely enjoyed rather than a necessity, then the rigorous analysis would have felt less tedious and more impressive. On the other hand, though, I can’t think of a way to imbue high-schoolers with a passion for reading in the same way that one could spontaneously develop (as I luckily experienced.) 


Does anyone have ideas for teaching classics in a way that will actually influence school-aged kids to take them to heart? As my experience is entirely anecdotal I’m sure what I experienced is not entirely universal— but I’d also love to hear other people’s “wake up” books and stories, or the book that changed their opinion on not only classics but reading in general.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nmxgjp/don_quixote_and_modern_teaching_of_classics/,2021-05-28 13:07:47,26,50,books
noaumt,"Don Quixote: does it get better, or am I perhaps missing something?","I recently started reading Don Quixote for the first time on a recommendation from my local library, who said that it was ""widely considered one of the funniest and also most tragic books ever written."" So I found a copy of it from Project Gutenberg - if it matters, it is the John Ormsby translation - and I'm currently on chapter XVII and wondering if I'm perhaps missing something about this book, because I really, really do not see the humour in it. I just read the part where he killed seven sheep because he thought he was participating in a war between two great armies - is there supposed to be something funny about that, or about any of the other scenes where people get injured or worse because of Don's actions? So far, the overwhelming impression I get is that Don is very mentally ill and has no grasp at all on reality, and he has been causing a lot of harm wherever he has gone, and I find very little of it funny.

Possibly relevant here is the fact that I haven't read a whole lot of ""classics"" so far - most of my reading has been genre fiction (e.g. Stephen King, Douglas Adams, H.P. Lovecraft, and when I was younger a crap ton of Star Wars and science fiction books), and I've only recently started reading more widely regarded books. The other books that came with the librarian's recommendation were ""Frankenstein"" (which I loved, especially the way the monster was actually depicted as intelligent and not just the pop culture version of a moaning green guy with bolts on his neck), ""Middlemarch"" (which took me a while to get through but is quite possibly the best written book I have ever read), ""Infinite Jest"" (which I found enjoyable but quite confusing, and which I plan to reread in the near future), and ""Fahrenheit 451"" (which I thought was incredible). Based on that track record, I figured I would love ""Don Quixote"", but now I find myself writing a Reddit post asking what I'm missing about it instead of actually reading it.

So - AM I missing something about it that would help me enjoy it better? Does it get better in the approximately 1400 pages still to go (this is according to Google Books - right now I'm on page 233 of 1669)? Would I perhaps find another translation of the book more enjoyable? I'd really like to enjoy this book, but right now the thought of sticking it out just seems rather daunting, and I never like to think of books that way.

Question two has been bugging me since I started reading because out of everyone I have talked to about the book, none of them have read it.

m10i5u,Don Quixote Feels so Relevant!,"I been reading more classics lately, something just pulled me towards that direction.

The last classic I read was Don Quixote. I was really shocked how relevent it is for our time. People usually describe it as a book about a old man who reads too many books and goes crazy. But that isn't really how I saw it. In my humble opinion, it is a book about how new technology can dissociate people from the real world. I think mass produced books were still pretty new back then. Reading about all the illusions Don Quixote creates, about all the way he distorts reality to make it fit a certain frame that the new techonology/media made him think were true, I simply couldn't stop comparing it to all the bad things social media has done to our global culture. If Don Quixote was alive today he would probably be a consipracy theorist or a QAnon person. Or he would be heads over heals into Instagram, posting a billion selfies with even more filters and would definitely star in the documentary Fake Famous.

Has any else felt that a classic described where our current era well?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m10i5u/don_quixote_feels_so_relevant/,2021-03-09 06:21:31,14,22,books
pc3xd8,Don Quixote's Ending Broke Me,"I truly didn't expect that bittersweet ending. Glad that Don Quixote acknowledged his friendship with Sancho Panza once he was sane.

&#x200B;

I loved this. I have frequent discussions with friends on which medium of storytelling between long-form television or books/book series are better. I still can't answer that question, but let me tell you that investing days/weeks into a story or group of characters increases your enjoyment of them immensely.

Don Quixote has been my favourite piece of classic literature I've ever read. My favourite moments are the conversations between Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, I truly expected that sweet ending of both our heroes riding out into the sun and for us to imagine more adventures they might have in the future indefinitely.

Instead, we have Don Quixote awaking from his madness, he seems glad to have had the adventures with his simple friend Sancho Panza but content to finish his life out of the dream. 

It felt **too real**, it felt like now I had to go on and return back to live my boring uneventful life. It is bittersweet to be sure and one that I'll keep on thinking about for the foreseeable future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pc3xd8/don_quixotes_ending_broke_me/,2021-08-26 17:12:21,11,40,books

I feel like the moment the Duke and Duchess are introduced, the book loses a very important charm. All this while we got to see Don Quixote react to a world that was real in a quite unique way thanks to his madness. Like seeing windmills and giants. We also saw a lot of normal people who were completely unaware of Quixotes' madness react to him and interact with him. Which was the charm of the book I feel. When the duchess and Duke arc starts we find that they both already know all about Don Quixote. They then create fake scenarios to trick him. They lie to him, knowing very well his problems. And at this point, it just feels like bullying. And nothing is really funny even though the book still seems to believe it is.

I'm yet to finish the very end of the book but this annoying me a lot. As the tone of the book doesn't feel right.

hxvbys,Don Quixote,"Don Quixote was written in two parts by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, a soldier who was captured during the battle of Lepanto by the Ottomans, reached fame and died in poverty leaving behind the crown of Spanish literature.

Don Quixote is widely recognized to be one of or the best book in the world, practically everyone knows the story of the mad hidalgo Don Quijote and his companion Sancho Panza and their tragi-comedic adventures through Spain, the novel is constructed around the contrast between the idealism of Don Quijote and the simplicity of the world he lives in, the scene of the windmills amd giants is the best example of this, a history of illusion and disillusion, however Don Quijote remains firm to his pourpose, in an oddly inspiring way

But Don Quijote is much more than a set of comedic adventures, but an outstanding literary revolution never seen again. In contrast with the novels previous to Cervantes the common everyday aspects of life are showed time and again during the book, inaugurating the realism genre.

But perhaps the most amazing thing of the book is Meta-fiction, present mostly in volume 2 as the characters are aware of the publication of the first part, Cervantes uses the second part to point at a fake second part written by Avellaneda, to do so he uses meta-fiction in the cleverest way possible. After all the wit, the comedy and Meta-fiction come the serious issues, the expulsion of the moriscos portrayed in the second volume was shocking for everyone in Spain. At the end the idealism shatters and Don Quixote dies in one of the saddest passages of literature, we are left with tears on our eyes and an unforgettable book",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hxvbys/don_quixote/,2020-07-25 22:13:49,5,23,books

9mgguj,Don Quixote is very flippin' funny!,"I am currently reading my own paperback copy of Edith Grossman's translation of Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, also known (originally) as The Ingenious Gentleman (or Hidalgo originally) Don Quixote de (or of) La Mancha when it was published in 1605 for the 1st part, then 1615 for the sequel.

This translation was published in 2003 and it is now 15 years after it was published by HarperCollins imprint, Ecco, and it has been featured in PBS's series, The Great American Read.

Now, for a 400 year old book, let me tell you this fact, it is so interesting and very flippin' funny at the same time.

I am now on Chapter 20 of the first part, and i can tell that there are very funny parts throughout this book.

>!For example, on Chapter 18, the officer of the Holy Brotherhood in the inn hits Don Quixote with a blow, on the head with a oil lamp, then later in the same chapter, Don Quixote creates a healing potion that would heal him from the injuries that he received from the soulless Yanguesans, when both Quixote and Sancho tried to attack after Rocinante, his horse, got attacked, but upon drinking the potion that he created, he vomits violently.!<

>!That is when Sancho drinks it and he, somehow, has a laxative effect upon him, as well as suffering from nausea at the same time.!<

>!The next chapter after that, Don Quixote started fighting 2 flocks of sheep (thinking they are 2 army of knights and kings), and the guys that were taking care of the sheep started throwing and sling shotting rocks at Don Quixote, which one of the rocks smashed the potion (the same one that he made in the last chapter, which shatters as he was drinking the potion,)  breaks 3 or 4 of his teeth, and crushed 2 of his fingers very violently, which made me LOL like crazy.!<

>!Then after that, just as Sancho checks inside Don Quixote's mouth to inspect his broken teeth, he vomits violently onto Sancho's face, which he responded by saying Mother of God!, then Sancho checks the vomit, because he thought it was blood, then it wasn't and it was just the potion he took, and then he vomited back at Don Quixote.!<

The humor is a precursor of Looney Tunes, and the use of gross humor is actually crazier that what it uses today, even though it can be disgusting for either readers or viewers who witness moments like that, but it is so funny.

Imagine if you watched Trolls or Turner and Hooch, while reading Don Quixote, and you noticed the differences between the humor that it was used back then and what it is using today.

Trolls and Turner & Hooch uses humorous lines and dialogue, and adventures on their own, but Don Quixote uses physical humor (Bodily humor that is), satire that Cervantes uses to make fun of classic Spanish chivalric books, and even epic fails that the main character involves in, especially Sancho as well.

There are many dozen translations, and Edith's is one of them. Of course, i also have Tom Lathrop's translation as well, since it said it is based on the original 1605 and 1615 editions of both parts, but Edith is just as promising and good as Tom's translation.

There are a couple of moments i would like to mention, because they are so funny (spoiler alert):

* >!The windmill scene (it is so ridiculous, but ingenious for a idea in a book like this).!<
* >!The scene in Chapter 17, where Sancho, Don Quixote, the innkeeper's daughter, and the innkeeper himself were fighting, thinking that she did something wrong, when in reality - the bed where the muledriver was sleeping, broke.!<
* >!Don Quixote saving the boy from being whipped on a tree.!<
* >!The uses of the word ""jackass"", the original meaning of donkeys.!<
* >!Also, the use of the b\*\*\*\* word, since it was surprising to see that in a 400 year old book.,same with the word ""whore"". which was also surprisingly used in Chapter 17.!<

>!Another interesting thing is the library scene back at Chapter 6. The mentions of classic chivalry books are very cool, especially Miguel de Cervantes's older book La Galatia, which did not get a sequel at all, and even if it was written, it would be entirely lost indeed, according to the footnotes on that chapter. Classics i heard (for example, Amadis de Gaula, Orlando Furioso, and even the Knight of Phoebus) is mentioned a lot in this book.!<

Overall, it is very funny for a 400 year old book, and i am really glad to read this great humorous book!

Now, what are your favorite humorous moments in the book?

EDIT:  Now i am on Chapter 24 on the same translation. It gets hysterically funny even more, just like a couple of chapters before.

On Chapter 22, >!both Don Quixote and Sancho saw, then set all the galley slaves free, but then they get hit by them from stones that they were throwing at.!<

Then in Chapter 23, >!Don Quixote saw a man (who was almost naked, had a beard, and his skin is seen from the ruined thighs, with incredible speed.) Then Quixote talks to a goatherd about it, and that is where that guy had a long talk about how he, and two other guys saw that same men, about their experience (including the description about how the bearded man punches one of the guys and steals food like a thief, when he is in his madness state, while he would ask for food in God's name when he in is right mind), and it might be the cause from a guy who made him go in that state of mind.!<

But long before that, in Chapter 20, >!Sancho makes fun of Don Quixote because they found about the noise that was making in the night (which made them terrified), then Don Quixote hits Sancho twice on the back with his lance for mocking his master.!<

It is so funny, i did not expect it to be this hysterical!

Still enjoying it so far! ;)

EDIT 2: On Chapter 24, >!the naked man (which its name is Cardenio) tells the story about himself and how did he end up here, only to be interrupted by Don Quixote himself, about when Cardenio talked about a book he received, which was Amadis de Gaul. Then Cardenio falsely claims that the queen in that book was in love with the surgeon, but Don Quixote proved it wrong to him. That is when fits of madness came to Cardenio, when he picked up a rock, and smacked Don Quixote first. then Sancho and finally the goatherd before leaving. Then Sancho blames it on the goatherd, which both ended up grabbing each other's beard and punching each other.!<

fgka71,Finally Finished Don Quixote and it was something that I will remember forever. A must read,"It is regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature ever and there's a reason for it. If you read the proper full version of it without any cuts or anything, then you will see the deep philosophy of Don Quixote.
He wasn't just a madman or crazy person, the words he used, the knowledge he had, his view of the world and his ideologies which he shared with others made makes him one of the most well written characters. 
Miguel de Cervantes has written an epic story of a man who become so delusional with something he loves that he isn't able to tell difference between reality and fantasy of his mind, but is a most sensible person in his illness and how some people who try to amuse themselves with him act more crazy than him. Each and every interaction that he had was a memorable one, from being beaten and pelted with stones to saving convicts and eating with dukes.
But most admirable part of Don Quixote is his philosophy and thinking process which is rare to find even in these days. In the entirety of the novel all are suprised of how at one moment he talks like a madman and at others a great priest or preacher.
I know that I might be able to tell whats so good about Don Quixote but those who are looking for a good read that keeps them satisfied for a long time this is a must. You will earn a new respect for yourself if you read it completely.

5oip3q,Finished: Don Quixote,"This was quite the challenging read for me, it took several weeks (I read at night on my Kindle) but I finished last evening and am sad that the story is over.  I will miss Don Quixote and his rueful countenance and Sancho Panza with his droll proverbs.  The book is divided into two parts that, from my understanding, were written 10 years apart.  It chronicles the many adventures that befall Don Quixote and Sancho Panza as they traverse Spain in the early 1600s.  Don Quixote has read too many books of chivalry and decided that he is a knight-errant and must right wrongs, succor those in distress and win the love of his beloved Dulcinea.  His willing accomplice is his neighbor Sancho Panza who is promised governorship of an island if he acts as squire to Don Quixote's knight.  Major themes in the book are illusion, enchantment, satire, individualism and parody.  The dialogue is interesting because Don Quixote speaks in the flowery prose of the books of chivalry that have driven him mad while those around him speak in the modern version of Spanish.  My recommendation for finishing this book is to start and don't stop (if you get hung up on a word or phrase just skip it) to absorb what Cervantes was trying to say. I will definitely be reading this again in a few years to pick up on what I may have missed.

sa7r27,"Opinions concerning Cervantes depiction of Moors/Muslims, Africans, class, and women in the book Don Quixote? (potential spoilers)","I am currently reading Don Quixote, and I am finished with Vol. 1 of the book. 

While I found lots of analysis online/on reddit concerning the humor within the book, whether people enjoyed or didn't enjoy the book, the analysis of two main characters of Sancho and Don Quixote, and LOTS of references to the windmill scene (it's a very small part of the story), there isn't much analysis concerning the depiction of Moors/Muslims, Africans, class, or women. 

I think the book has a complicated relationship with regards to those aspects, except with regards to Africans, which is purely racist (I'm thinking of the scene where Sancho is disappointed in getting a kingdom in Africa by Don Quixote of black people, and then being okay with it since he can sell people into slavery). That's not particularly funny, to say the least, especially given the time that the book is written, where Spain was heavily engaged in a slave trade. 

With regards to Moors/Muslims, I've read online that Cervantes himself was captured by Muslim pirates in his 20's and held for ransom? I'm not sure the veracity of this claim, but if it's true, that experience can certainly inform sections of the book concerning depictions of Muslims. Also, Spain was conquered by Muslims and re-conquered by Christians, and was subject to religious wars prior to the writing of this book, which can explain the negative depictions of Muslims. That said, I'm not sure if there is an element of satire present here, as perhaps the books of ""Knights erranty"" which this book is spoofing, may perhaps have had the title characters as Christian knights and perhaps as crusaders. 

That's without going to depictions of class and women, but which I think a discussion is a warranted. 

But that said, it's hard for me to accept the claim that Sancho is the ""straight man"" in comparison to Don Quixote's craziness, when Sancho clearly has his own faults.

ar98kt,Just finished Don Quixote,"I finished Don Quixote (English translation) the other night after reading about 10 pages in bed every night for three months. The novel is captivating and amusing, and made me laugh in at least 20 places, it seems that the book could have been written by a genius modern author just as it could have been written by a genius author who lived 400 years ago.

Over all what did I get out of the book? I honestly felt that was reading about the two main characters, Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho Panza, finding themselves. Sancho certainly found the double edged nature of power and responsibility, and in the end realised that his life as he lived it was the one for him. I am still torn as to how to view what befell Quixote or Quixano. I like to think that the story was about Quixote, he was not mad, he had simply found purpose and worked towards a potentially unobtainable goal despite the efforts of others. Or potentially he was mad, but his purpose of knight errantry was not the madness in itself. On the other hand >!the illusion is shattered in the last 10 pages with the apparent regaining of his original state or sanity. Was it sanity? Or was Don Quixote sent insane through defeat combined with the signs he witnessed concerning Dulcinea? I have a very mixed view towards the ending, maybe I should not have read it or maybe it reminds the reader that Don Quixote was in fact the product of insanity and Cervantes meant the story as written and not to be interpreted in any other way.!<

Other than the theme of purpose, the inclusion of the *histories* themselves within the book surprised me, it was not something I expected from an author that lived over 400 years ago. I assumed that such an idea of breaking the fourth wall was modern, evidently people do not change. Their inclusion is also strange to me because all other events could have happened in our own universe, but the appearance of the first part of the history in the second leads me to believe that Cervantes wanted to indicate that the seemingly impossible occurrences that were apparently a product of the madness of Quixote may have actually occurred as well. The events of the book are seen from the eyes of the (as Quixote says) enchanted, so the reader is provided with the enchanted view and with the explanation that the events were actually the madness of Quixote, when they were the products of the enchanters all along.

Don Q. causes distress but elevates the mundane reality; Sancho buys into all the fantasy motivated by the promise of land; the barber and the priest have to live through a fantasy in order to lure Don Q.

Don Q. twists the world to fit in his idealistic delusions, but by doing so he greatly affects reality, turning life into a play. He makes a point on how the only reality is the one in our minds.

You could say that everybody plays fictions (interpersonal, religious, ideological) accommodating life to preconceived notions.

hnol6o,Defending/explaining Don Quixote's rough edges,"Okay, so the book is mostly known for the delusions of the titular Don Quixote and how it always lands him in trouble. And a lot of people don't like it because they think it's just repetitious or doesn't makes any sense or doesn't build up on any narrative.

And to that I argue that that's the point! At first I had the same trouble and thought, thinking of how flashy or exciting these exploits were, but in the end, inconsequential. And to that I say that's the point!

In the beginning of the book, Don Quixote's friends and family attributed all his madness to the books he was reading, books that were immensely popular at the time, books on chivalry, where good and great knights slew foes with a single swing, swings that would also destroy mountains and split the seas. And where they would do good deeds of rescuing princesses and dealing courageous punishment of the wicked. 

And once I thought about it, I realized what the book was doing. It's a critique on the popular knight fiction of the time! How it's ultimately hollow because of the big strong man and rescuing princess and punishing evil stuff that was popular at the time! SOUND FAMILIAR TO ANYONE!?

Cervantis obviously hated the modern fiction of his time and wanted to write something that proved to be of quality, and without any super human feats or damsels in distress, or evil villains.

When Don Quixote tries to vanquish a giant in one fell swoop, he ends up getting his ass kicked by a windmill. When Don Quixote meets a supposed damsel in distress, the girl is just tired of all the unwanted attention she's getting, like a real person. When Don Quixote tries to help someone who's getting whipped, he ends up making that guy's punishment worse by interfering like an idiot outsider who has no knowledge of what's going on or why it's happening.

So much of the book is just critiquing why popular knight fiction was shit. But that's not all there is, there is true quality in it, unlike all of the books Cervantis hated. That though Don Quixote did commit foolish acts, his heart and intentions were that of a truly chivalrous knight. And that it is not the deeds we do, but the reasons for our actions that matter.

gw8jpi,"I just finished Don Quixote, and want to talk about it. Spoilers","First off, I loved it and have one one to talk about it with. I loved the unreliability of the narration, the meta and complex world of the second half. There were many points thought out the book where I was convinced it was real, and the strange felling of mistrust and love for the story was unique. I loved the complicated and romantic story lines where you fell into the side story just to have Sancho say something silly and pull you out. Some of my highlights being:

* >!The complicated and interesting stories/run ins in the mountains of the first book, where all of the characters so happen to run into the others involved. Then they so happen to run into the solution at the inn with no help from our valiant knight. (even thought it would not have been resolved if the priest and barber did not come to find him).!<
* >!The part were Don Quixote throws up on Sancho after fighting the sheep and taking the healing potion. Every chapter leading up to that joke just made it such a hilarious payoff, all the way form the inn that was really a castle. !<
* >!I loved how the first book I just finished was addressed in the first two chapters of the second. I was not expecting it and it really made me fell like I was a member in that world.!<
* >!I really enjoyed how Sancho made up that our Dulcinea lady of Tabasco was enchanted to be a peasant, and then believed it later on. !<
* >!I did not enjoy the duke and duchess as much, but the part where Merlin shows up in this grand ceremony, I couldn't help but think ""what amazing quest are they going to send Don Quixote on?!"" only to say Sancho give yourselves 3300 spankings on each butt check.!< 

&#x200B;

My only complaint was it did drag on in the first half and I almost stopped reading. But it was so worth every speech, stupid detail and endless inn encounters. Overall what I took away from it was that he was a hopeless idealist who was willing to create the world he wanted no matter how silly it seemed to others. By the end of the book all of the adventures he had was ""real"" because everyone played into it as well. In my opinion he succeeded in creating a world he wanted. I would like to have some Don Quixote spirit with Sancho's surprising wisdom and silly proverbs.

    Very funny humor
    The main character, Don Quixote of La Mancha
    The uses of ideas and literary devices that would be used in old and new novels.

    The translation.

6y2mfn,Just Started Don Quixote,"So I recently read the daunting Count of Monte Cristo a few months back, and I was so taken aback by the quality and sort of 'ease of access' in the translation. I had always heard about the Count but never picked it up, often due to it's sheer size and figuring due to it's period of writing, that it would be a pretty tough nut to crack. Well needless to say I was pleasantly surprised as it has sky rocketed to one of my favorite books. (it does indeed have it's flaws but I really enjoyed it). 

Anyway, I'm back for round two of another book that I've heard of but never really found my way to. This one is Cervantes' Don Quixote. Also an intimidating sized tome, but I was more confident in my tackling of this, and I found that the 2003 translation by Edith Grossman had nothing but praise for her work. So, I downloaded the Audiobook and swung by my friendly neighborhood B&N and picked up the corresponding edition. 

I started it last week, and wow, so far this looks like it's going to be a really fun read. Now I know that technically it's sort of common consensus that the book is more satirical in it's humor in that it's supposed to use the humor as a way to show the tradegy of parody of the character Don Quixote... That being said, minus the more *childish* prat fall type humor, the translation REALLY makes this book out to be chuckle inducing. Couple that with the great narration, I was at the gym (where I do 90%) of my book ""reading"" smiling to myself at Don's antics. 

I ask you folks who read it, is the humor in Don Quixote originally this funny? I'm really surprised about how a book written so long ago manages to be read in such a modern light. I mean I know it's a translated work, so Mrs. Grossman made it possible for that ease of access, but still the work is amazingly understandable.

Now this leaves me with my favorite aspect of the novel. The relationship between the author, and story. I have a sort of fascination of self referencing, loops and things that reference themselves. Recursion. So the fact that Cervantes not only makes note of himself in the book, but also references the work of Don Quixote itself was captivating! It's so 4th wall breaking and more, it really boggles my mind, again, how such a book written so early on, manages to hit like every ""troupe"" and style...And I'm only about 100 pages into it! 

I've been babbling long enough, I just wanted to get everyone's opinion on the book itself, hopefully it's not viewed too much of a cliche.

Just a parody? both? neither? I would love to hear your thoughts, reasonings, and insights.

Spoilers below!

Within the first quarter of the book there is a scene where the local bishop and barber burn most of Don Quixote's books of chivalry. My initial reaction was to view these men as the intended villains. But I guess I don't know how book burnings were perceived in Spain in 1605. 

In the book it is believed by most that the books were responsible for Don Quixote's madness, and by the end of the book even Don Quixote himself has come to the same conclusion. It is sort of a silly Idea to believe that books have driven Don Quixote to such a state of madness. On the other hand, today we worry about how other forms of media effect peoples mental state, like video games, television and movies. 
 
Furthermore, at the end of the book, the narrator offers several ways books of chivalry could be improved on. Although the narrator is also kind of silly character, who is writing the book from prison. So, I am unsure how seriously his views are to be taken.

9b6a57,Don Quixote is like the medieval version of I Love Lucy.,"Don Quixote is one of the greatest novels of all time, and i want to read it big time indeed!

It is just like the equivelent of a fan who reads too many books (thrillers, fantasy, science fiction, comic, or even Shakespearian works), and becomes anyone he wants to do, just like Don Quixote. These examples of who would they become would include:

\- Becoming a detective or a professor but in reality, it is impossible to proof it to the police, nor they would allow you to teach history, or even investigate a crime scene.

\- Becoming a wizard or a sorcerer, but in reality, there is no magic in the real world and he would not be like Harry Potter, or Lord Voldemort.

\- Becoming a jedi warrior or a space captain, but, again in reality, the fans of Star Wars and Star Trek would call him crazy if he is imagining a spaceship in the sky.

\- Becoming a comical woman like in most 50s shows, but in reality (why do i keep saying it over and over again?), There is no way to become one unless you are hired by the three or four networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, or The CW, in order to be part of a show (alas a sitcom).

\- Or even becoming each or one of the characters from William Shakespeare, those include Romeo and Juilet and Hamlet (which they are the most famous works from him).

Those are the examples of a big fan that would become those that i have pointed out to you.

Speaking of the 4th example, i will say this, Don Quixote is the medieval version of the sitcom I Love Lucy, the reason?

Well, because DQ is episodic, some people read every chapter of this book as a episode (either as a sitcom or a satrical series), and they would take a break for now and come back for after, later, or even tomorrow, so that they can treat it as a series.

Also, just like DQ, I Love Lucy has humor as well (which those notable examples include Lucy testing Vitametavegamin in the first season's well known episode, Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory fiasco in Season 2's Job Switching, and so on and etc.).

I can also compare between Lucy and Ricky Riccardo and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, but with differences. Ricky does the drums while Sancho rides the ass (which is technically a donkey) and worked for the goverment in the second part, and Lucy works as his housewife, wanting to become a star, while Don Quixote becomes a madman, trying and wanting to right the wrongs of the world.

That is why DQ is the medieval equivelent of I Love Lucy, and i wonder if you can compare Miguel De Cervantes's novel with anything that you remembered or watched in recent years.

I loved how at the beginning you question a lot of the decisions the main character does and he comes off as kind of a loon. However as the story progresses I really started to believe in the illusion he had created for himself.

 Both main characters were just so likable and Quixotes response and reaction to the world was just so fascinating, as he was very detached and eccentric but at the same time very well read, intelligent and most of all totally dedicated to helping people (which is a bit of fresh air, when compared to modern day misanthropic anti-heroes).

2l7ync,Question about the narrator in Don Quixote,"So for one of my classes this semester we read *Don Quixote*, and one thing that jumped out/confused me was the narrator. I know the whole issue with the translator and the found manuscripts and everything is a significant part of what makes *Don Quixote* what it is, but the very beginning, in the prologue, the narrator identifies himself as Don Quixote's stepfather (at least, that's how it reads in my translation).

He will still fight windmills in a modern design, and he will fight a herd of sheep that he imagined as a huge army.

247ngh,What would different literary characters think of Don Quixote?,"The book *Don Quixote* has been called the greatest of all novels by many scholars and writers, and it's probably been discussed a million times here. But all that's because it's open to many different interpretations, and I'm under the belief that the book has as many ways to read it as there are readers.

So now I'm curious, and I ask because it could be a fun and interesting way to discuss this text: how might different characters from throughout literature view the actions of its protagonists? What would, for example, Charles Schulz's comic-strip star Charlie Brown think of this perpetual loser who always keeps trying and never stops seeing himself as great? Might Josef K. from Kafka's *The Trial* hate Quixote for the way he punishes innocent peasants for made-up crimes, or envy him for the way he tries to break out of the system while K. can only protest in vain? What about Palahnuik's Tyler Durden, Rick Riordan's Annabeth Chase, Lisbeth Salander of *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo*?

2b54e0,Does anyone want to talk about Don Quixote?,"I recently finished the book after about four weeks of sustained readings. While I am already reading something new -- Dostoevsky's *The Idiot* --, *Don Quixote* has stayed with me more than I expected it would. The book had almost no imagery, and prior to the last two hundred pages, there was no character development. Of course, the lack of character development was the source of much of the comedy and tragedy: neither Don Quixote nor Sancho ever change (again, until the last two hundred pages) much. Don Quixote continues to attribute every apparent failure to enchantment, and Sancho spits out as many proverbs as he can. Furthermore, I felt that it was weird that a book that has some of the most famous characters in world literature had such a small cast. The priest and the barber are present at the beginnings and ends of both parts of the book, but even then, they are absent from most of the tale (especially in the second part). The effort Cervantes made to introduce Sanson in the second part was appreciated by me, and I was glad to see him playing the role he ended up with.

1ixyqp,Don Quixote fans? What did you like? What did you learn?,"That book still influences how I see my life.  I realized that, out of infinite possibilities, we all choose a certain narrative to define ourselves and express it to others.  And, in a certain way, because they don't capture all of reality, they are false.  But, in another way, because we live them and they shape our reality and affect the realities of others, they are true.  Sorry if I'm drifting into a weird place here, but it seems like I'm just a story I tell myself, which I'm constantly updating and revising.  And I think in Don Quixote we see that to take someone's story away from them is to strip them of their identity and drive them insane.

iategt,What makes Cervantes 'Don Quijote' world literature?,"It took me three of four months to finish my edition of Don Quijote (book one and two). The reading has been a challenge at times (German translation, though one from the nineteenth century) and a delight in some moments. 

The basic premise is known to most readers, I guess: A fifty year old noble man in 17th century Spain gets crazy by reading too many knight novels, calls himself Don Quijote and takes his lazy neighbor Sancho and his old horse Rosinante to live by the code of the wayfaring knights and experience adventure. He meets a plethora of people from all classes of society and what starts as a comedy gets more and more serious and self reflected eventually.

As this book has a high reputation in 'world literature', with the back text even calling Don Quijote ""belonging to the mythical self-consciousness of Europe"" I was a bit puzzled after finally putting it down today. The story is not that complex or even epic, it more seems like a commentary on the society Cervantes lived in. The prose was very 'swole' - if that's how I can put it - and most dialogues not believable to the 21st century reader (meaning that every illiterate sheepherder talks like a poet).

I am sure the fellow readers here on r/books are able to share their perspectives on why 'Don Quijote' is considered a classic and whether that status is still deserved 400 years later.

8yme49,Don Quixtoe: Am I reading a poor translation or Is this book just not for me?,"As of writing this, I am on page 210 of this behemoth of a novel. And I cannot for the life of me find much enjoyment in it, the idea of a schizophrenic old man and his dim witted squire riding around spain getting into misadventures is amusing, but only when I read these tales without actually reading the book itself, as it's dry, cumbersome and rather bland despite the content and context.  


But I didn't come here to complain...entirely. I wanted to know if I'm just not right for this book, or if this translation is bad. I'm currently reading the motteux (1712) translation from wordsworth classics, and i've been slowly munching through these pages the past month. 

The whole story is amusing when looked at from a more...distant, perspective, but the actual scanning of the pages is proving to be as much of a choir as my reading of lord of the rings and a text book on the history of wheat. I get a chuckle out of it sometimes, but regularly I just find myself glazing over entire pages, just trying to get to the next one to repeat the process so i can finish the book and move on to one of my other books. I shouldn't be doing that though, I need to know if I should keep going in the hopes it gets better, or get a better translation, or just give up entirely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8yme49/don_quixtoe_am_i_reading_a_poor_translation_or_is/,2018-07-13 18:19:48,18,8,books
