6dskp7,"I agree, Don Quixote is hilarious. I think my favourite part is where Don Quixote's teeth are all broken from taking a rock to the face, so he asks Sancho to have a look at his back molars to check out the damage - only to vomit the balm he drunk all over Sancho's face, which makes Sancho vomit in turn... Cervantes does it a bit more justice than I do, of course. 

There is *some* time wasting in the first volume, though - specifically when they're all at the inn and read 'The Curious Impertinent.' It's basically a story within a story, and when they're finished reading the book-within-a-book, the main story continues on as if nothing ever happened. That part is pretty strange for a modern reading, but interestingly enough Cervantes addressed this point in his preface to the second volume.

My favorite time, besides when he though that a prostitute was a princess, was when he tried to fight a lion. I was expecting Don Quixote to get absolutely mauled, but instead, the lion just sat there, laying around like a lazy housecat, completely defying the reader's expectations. 

Or the time when Don Quixote tries to create a healing potion, but it just makes people vomit. He vomits on Sancho, who then ingests some of the vomit, making him vomit all over, and so they're both vomiting everywhere. Not something you'd expect to find in a book so old. ",,2017-05-28 14:50:38

6dskp7,"I've never read that translation. I like Ormsby's translation. In Spanish, I love reading it with Francisco Rico's annotations, which explain a lot of the ""in-jokes"" that would be obvious to a 16th century Spaniard immersed in the pop culture of its time that I was unaware of. Puns, allusions, and so forth. I had read it before, but I understood so much more with those annotations.

Don Quixote is one of those books that should be read at several points in your life. You laugh when you're young and you wisely nod in agreement when you're older. My god, the fool was right all along, you'll think. You have to realise that Cervantes had much to say about the world. For example, when he says that not even the King himself has the right to enslave convicts, he has to say it through the mouth of a madman. It was the only way to circumvent the Spanish Inquisition's censorship.

'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman' by Laurence Sterne. Both are written by geniuses about idiots, though Tristram Shandy does a well job at having the narrator, Shandy himself, lie to you blatantly and contradict himself pages later.

Though I'm a reader, and a writer, big books really intimidate me. It's hard to sit down with a 700+ page book and read it over a period of time without trying to read two or three things at once.
I get utterly disappointed when I do get 300 pages in and put it down. The first go around with Ulysses was like that. Read it all the way through and there was an immediate sense of accomplishment. Similar to 'Infinite Jest', and another long but gloriously hilarious book worth reading called 'The Sot-Weed Factor'.

It's great when an a book from the 1600's, even through the 1800's, make you laugh harder than humorists these days.

6dskp7,"What's funny to me, at least of note, is that the most iconic scenes from Don Quixote to make it to pop culture come from the first half of the story. The first half does sideline the main characters and introduces others nobody really cares about (I'll address this)* in order to shoehorn a story that never made it into the public consciousness—with good reason—the same as ""tilting at windmills"" did. Cervantes did an Inception and included a completely dull and forgettable novella into his novel (the first proper novel, he killed two birds with one stone in the innovation dept.). There are a number of stories within stories that go on for chapters where Don Quixote and Sancho are just ""present"", the bare minimum.  I don't know how many translations drop these as I don't see non-native speakers ever pointing these, quite frankly, boring asides that do nothing to further the story of your flawed heroes.

After the publication's success among both ""common folk"" and Royalty, Cervantes was urged to write more about their favorite characters. What I think drove Cervantes over the edge, and you can tell in the preface to the second half of the story, is the unauthorized publication of a Quixote story not penned by Cervantes. In the preface he acknowledges even contemporary audiences found the secondary characters taking center stage a bore, so he stuck it out with Sancho and El Caballero de la Triste Figure but not before parodying himself later in the book adding the famous phrase ""Nunca segundas partes fueron buenas""; the original ""sequels are bound to suck"". Ironic, considering I find the second half, or Vol. 2, the better of the two because of its tight focus on its two protagonists and their very human characterizations, as when they first encounter the sea. Such a beautiful scene, but never makes it in the usual literary circles. It's always the windmills, which gets taken out of context many times by people who clearly haven't read the books or gets acknowledged in pop culture (same with Sancho's brief gubernatorial stint) but don't get me started on that one.

People today dismiss the characters as either crazy (Quixote) or witty/simple (Sancho). What's funny is that while the author would certainly not dispute that characterization, Don Quixote is well read and at one point gives a great, eloquent speech about matters of war that goes over the heads of his hosts in Vol. 1 and Sancho's witticisms oftentimes reveal great wisdoms (in a way, he was the Karl Pilkington of the saga).

Very much like Candide, which someone else mentioned, and I don't find at all funny in a modern context. The repetitive nature of the ""main joke"" make it not funny.

What I like best is the nested narratives, and the monologues from characters that don't involve Don Quixote or Sancho.

In my literary translation seminars we'd have about 10 students translate the same page from a novel and compare, and you'd immediately be able to tell that some people's translations were better at preserving the humour of the original, some were better at preserving the poetry of the language, some felt more old-fashioned, some more modern etc. Ultimately, since there's no one-to-one correspondence between literary styles and genres between different languages, you're inevitably going to be getting a certain amount of the translator's own personality and preferences when you read a work in translation.

I was amazed at how reading a book that was so old, so respected, and in translation, was still so funny. Of course there's a reason it's a classic and some humor is eternal, but it's a lovely feeling to have words reach out across centuries and move you like that. I remember laughing out loud when Don Quixote rises to his feet and yells ""You shall be avenged!"" to the young servant who has been beaten by his master, a situation caused by Don Quixote trying to help the servant out in the first place. It was exactly the sort of comic misunderstanding and overreaction beloved by Seinfeld or Larry David.

When those books were first translated into Spanish, Death was written as a female, since doing so in a completely gender-neutral way sounds artificial in Spanish.

Much of the humor lies in Don Quixote acting mentally ill and dumb which I don't find too funny. More to my interest, and it seems like it was inspired by DQ, is *The Nonexistant Knight* by Italo Calvino, which is also a parody of knighthood and ridicules an uptight knight figure but doesn't make him unintelligent or insane, and the humor is more witty and tragic.",seasofsorrow,2022-01-06 00:48:30

The reading of Don Quixote by the German Romantics and those who followed enshrined it as this hallmark of idealistic literature, but in truth it was meant to be –in 1605– a rather quick and funny read that poked fun at the whole concept of courtly love and knightly deeds. It was very popular and not at all what was considered ""serious literature"" at the time. Then, the ""highest of the highest"" was poetry, then drama. If you haven't got there yet, wait till you read chapter XX. 

For further, funny reading, look at Lope de Vega's comedies, El perro del hortelano and El caballero del milagro are hilarious. He was Cervantes' bitter writer rival, who did succeed at the ""important"" genres. Cervantes was not really that popular a poet or dramatist in his time, but Lope was.

I was deeply saddened every time someone told him he was crazy because at several points in the book he explains what he’s doing, even saying that it only has to be true in his own mind for it to make him happy. It takes some inner strength to see a unicorn where everyone else sees a donkey. Long live the Don Quixotes of the world. They make it a better place to be.",3_Eyed_Ravenclaw,2020-01-29 15:29:18
evlzuu,"Here's why the book is relevant: 

1. It's one of the earliest examples (if not *the* earliest example) of the modern novel, a genre that is relatively recent and really took off during the Enlightenment. According to Wikipedia (a thoroughly academic source, wink wink) ""the European novel is often said to have begun with [*Don Quixote*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote) in 1605.""
2. It is very timely for its date of publication; the institution of feudalism was slowly crumbling and giving way to the cultural advancements brought about by the printing press and the Renaissance. It's a satire of chivalric romances like the tales of King Arthur, showing that this pomp and circumstance is all a meaningless construct.

Now, just because it's relevant, does that mean it's good? That's up to you. If you're not particularly interested in the history of this era, or the history of the novel as a literary study, you might not get much out of it. If you find it boring, put it down. It probably is boring.",kahnwiley,2020-01-29 14:20:14
evlzuu,"Okay so *Don Quixote* is a really complex book about a very complex time in Spanish history. Part 1 was published in 1605. This is only \~100 years after the conclusion of the Reconquista, which had been a long and bloody war between the Christian kingdoms of northeast Iberia (Aragon, Catalonia, Navarre, etc) and the Muslim al-Andalus in the south. This long war radicalized both sides, and once the Iberian peninsula was fully conquered by the Christians, they imposed draconian theocracy across the peninsula, expelling or forcibly-converting religious minorities (the Alhambra Declaration in 1492 expelled the Jews, and the expulsion of the Moriscos was undertaken through brutal ethnic cleansing and family separations in the period from 1609 to 1614) and enforcing this with religious secret police and brutal public executions, an institution called the Spanish Inquisition. This includes the destruction of major international centers of learning such as Cordoba, banning of languages, etc. Immediately after that, Spain became embroiled in a series of wars in North Africa and throughout the Mediterranean against the Turks (including brief conquest of southern Italy and of the Netherlands) and then led a series of wars of conquest in the Americas, in West Africa, in Southeast Asia, etc, leading to the rise of global colonialism. 

&#x200B;

So *Don Quixote* is written and published in this environment, where Spain is suffering this very deep historical wound and trying to figure out what it means to be Spanish while brutally suppressing anyone who might have a different view of what that might mean. The role of chivalrous literature in that society was not ""oh these are droll stories"" so much as active propaganda for the Catholic monarchy. This is definitely the case for epics such as Cantar de Mio Cid (El Cid) and, frankly, a lot of the other chivalrous literature. Remember that most of this literature is not about roaming the countryside and fighting monsters; it is mostly about fighting wars against the Muslims. So this really isn't about Cervantes thinking that fantasy literature is childish and brain-rotting.

&#x200B;

It also helps to understand a little about Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra as well. He himself had fought in Spain's wars in North Africa, had many Moorish friends, and had close enough relations with a number of families (including his own) who were suspected of being crypto-Jews. He had himself personally lost an arm while in war and had spent some time in captivity as a prisoner of Berber pirates. So, you can kind of see how Cervantes would be opposed to aspects of Spanish imperialism and theocracy, and how that might translate into certain forms of satire in his work, but also why he might go to some lengths to hide that within a more ambiguous storyline.

&#x200B;

If you read the novel in that historical context, you might then get a different understanding of what it is Cervantes is saying. He's not saying ""fantasy literature rots your brain"" nor is he saying the shitty Terry-Gilliam-Man-of-La-Mancha bullshit of ""dream your big dreams and live them."" When Don Quixote and Sancho Panza sit on the sidelines and criticize their portrayal in the first part (which is exceptionally modern in style) they are in fact criticizing that sort of superficial reading of the novel. Don Quixote is a satire of militant Spain gone awry. It is a story of loss of history and identity, and an attempt to fill the void with war.

&#x200B;

It's a really fantastic novel, and one which is complex and which rewards multiple readings. However, I feel like many of its biggest fans simply do not get the satire, and that's a huge part of what puts a lot of people off of it.",tchomptchomp,2020-01-29 16:56:31

At some point in time someone (my father, I think) told me the book could be summarized as ""Sancho sees the world as it really is, but Don Quixote sees it *as it should be*.""

I finally understood what that truly meant when I read the book (unabridged Everyman's Library edition) from cover to cover, sometime after I graduated college.

It was fascinating because, for all that Don Quixote is an absurd character, he in his madness sometimes felt more principled than the world around him. And all the many digressions (especially later on) fleshed out that world, with stories of misfortune and deception. 

While a lot of details have faded, some stick with me, like the story of a man so obsessive about the faithfulness of his wife that he tempts her after several fidelity tests to cheat on him, or the part where Don Quixote confronts someone who has read his book to prove that he, and not someone else, is the real Don Quixote.

evlzuu,"Salman Rushdie recently published a modern retelling called Quichotte that finds its extreme contemporary relevance. Of course Don Quixote is a classic and relevant for being so early in its play with artistic elements similar to the novel (while Cervantes was writing as an unknown contemporary to Shakespeare and what we know as the novel with psychologically real characters wouldn’t truly emerge and evolve until the 17-19th centuries), but its elements for today are how influenced Quixote is by the media he surrounds himself. To use Rushdie’s words at a book session I attended, Quixote’s brain is rot with the fairy tales and cheap fiction he has been reading. The idea that someone can consume so much reading they become mad isn’t as relevant today because we don’t read, so Rushdie made the modern version a man consumed by reality tv. The relevant today rings truer than ever—when reality is blurred by madness, what you see, what you hear, and you no longer know what is truth, what power over the world does truth still have? What claim does truth have over our lives if such persons are so swayed and overcome by the alternative facts? And that question of truth is everything today.",Cambro88,2020-01-29 16:01:50

That said, I really had to force myself to get through it. Overall I would say it's worth pushing yourself to reading the whole thing, because so many people give up and assume it's just about the windmill scene. It's a huge road trip, and even Sancho and Don Quixote get frustrated with each other along the way. The kind of aimlessness is important, I think, and the second half is definitely better than the first. So, yeah it's a difficult and boring read at times, but you're on the journey with the characters and I'd highly encourage you to see it through unto the end.

evlzuu,"I have. And in fact last night I was revisiting a passage that I really enjoyed, the one about the talking head. But that's much later in the book. 

You are right about the general flow, although the second part of the book seems to me deeper and more complex. By that time, most of the people Don Quixote encounters already know who he is, having read the first part of the book and a false second part which another Spanish writer had published when Cervantes took too long to finish his - it's all quite meta. Anyway, this cast of new characters tends to go along with Don Quixote's schtick, which causes a whole different set of problems for him. No longer does he have to convince people of who he is; he has become the famous knight he claimed to be in the first part. However, with his fame comes mock and ridicule, and the Don has to maintain his bearings under circumstances which a friend of mine described as ""psychological warfare."" Cervantes himself became famous as a result of the first part, adding another layer of complexity to the second part.

This book is so deep and complex and you can draw an endless amount of subject matter and theme from it. You can also approach the reading with any philosophical perspective you choose, and the stories and characters will take on a whole new meaning. I believe this is why the critic Harold Bloom says - to paraphrase - that we can never get in front of Cervantes, and that wherever we go, he is already there. The story never ends, so to speak, and neither does the journey to understand this man who is at once so intelligent and so crazy.

Lately I've been learning about Kierkegaard and his thoughts on a person's identity and what it means to be you. What a wonderful perspective to bring to a reading of Don Quixote! Identity is huge in this book. Not only because the title character is so conflicted in this regard, but because nearly everyone in the story so explicitly behaves based on their self-perception . Countless of the transient characters that he meets - you may have come across a few already - introduce themselves to him and to the reader by stating their name and their business and perhaps a little about their past. 

And if you're still struggling to get through it, I recommend having a glass of wine and reading the dialogue out loud in as animated a voice as possible - especially when reading Sancho. Remember that Cervantes had always wanted to be a playwright, and in fact wrote something like thirty of them although they all failed and none are still extant. But anyway, it seems like the dialogue is written for actors on a stage, who project their voices and gesticulate in order to be seen and heard. And don't great actors struggle with identity? And don't they often become victims of their own fame?",elgoriladogmatico,2020-01-29 19:42:07

evlzuu,"I read the whole thing. I definitely get where you are coming from. The book can seem mundane at times, but it is an entertaining read. It's easy to fall into the mindset that this book isn't as great as it's made out to be. It seems like an alright read at best, but it's deceptive in how much of an impact it will have on you.

Don Quixote is, at its core, a meme. It is (as far as we know) the original meme of it's type, which is one reason it is so fascinating. It *will* affect your way of thinking; you may find yourself years later using concepts or phrases you learned from Quixote without even realizing it. Once you have read it, you will always be capable of ""getting the joke"" that it presents, and that can present itself outside the scope of the book in interesting and rewarding ways. 

The book was so original, the meme so infectious, that a new word was created in English to convey the concept: [Quixotry](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/quixotry)

evlzuu,"> He’s like a fanboy who’s gone mad. An otaku who actually goes outside.

This is exactly how I read it. Books of “Knight-Errantry” were the comic books/pulp novels of their time. It’s amazing how often, just by changing a few words around, it feels like they are talking about modern pop culture.

One part that hit me hard was when Don Quixote meets a group of young men heading to their friend’s funeral. One thing that sometimes gets lost in discussion is that Quixote isn’t the only character Cervantes used to comment on pop culture. He often uses him as a foil to reflect on how the stories we consume shape our world-view.

In this case, the men are bitterly complaining about how their friend was driven to what is implied to be suicide by a shepherdess. They talk about how she cruelly led him along, toying with his heart until he couldn’t take it anymore. Quixote initially backs them up, and cites tales of knights who were driven mad by their spurned love.

The funeral starts and, lo and behold, the young women shows up. After taking a few barbed insults from the man’s friends, she calmly explained that not once did she ever show any interest in him. That she repeatedly asked him to stop pining after her.

Don Quixote immediately switches over to the woman’s side and declares that her case is better. It’s one of the few times where Quixote declaring himself someone’s protector does not end in disaster.

It’s spooky how relevant it feels. It’s basically a group of proto-Nice Guys complaining about how they are entitled to a woman’s affection if they try hard enough, with Cervantes implying it is at least partially because media has taught them this, only for a cold smack of reality to make it clear that life doesn’t work that way, and no one “owes” you love based on effort alone.",Rusty_Shakalford,2020-01-29 17:27:52
evlzuu,"> It’s definitely a little endless and repetitious, but I’m trying to enjoy it as a weekly TV show rather than a typical novel. “In this week’s installment we find....”

This. Don Quixote was the first ""modern novel"", in reality unlike modern novels (whose chapters were released one by one due to the serial nature of magazines on which they were publish) Quixote tried to capture the idea of a collection of stories of knights.

Quijote has some challenging things. Quixote has a flat arc, he barely changes, but instead the world changes due to him. This can make the whole thing seem boring to people who expect characters to grow. Instead try to see everything around Quixote, how it changes and transforms due to his actions. Sancho is more relatable because he actually grows as a character, transformed by Quixote himself.

A lot of the jokes are lost nowadays, even on modern Spanish readers. Quixote spoke an old version of Spanish that wasn't well understood then, the joke is that most people don't understand him because of his weird and archaic accent. Even his name plays with this, the x has changed pronunciation three times in Spanish recentlish (last 300 years). Nowadays it's more like the English X sound, but it used to be much of of an h (in contemporary Spanish h is mute, the h English sound is j), you can see this in things like Mexico being pronounced more like Mehico in Spanish, this is why in spanish it's written Quijote a lot. But the word it derives from is the Meshica tribe, which was written with the older sound of X which was a sh. So the whole joke is that he would pronounced it Quishote, but other people would pronounce it wrong, or have no idea how to write it (the sh sound disappeared from Spanish). So there's a lot of puns and misunderstandings that are lost, because nowadays everyone speaks an old version of castillian Spanish.",lookmeat,2020-01-29 17:36:14

Sometimes. There’s a part near the beginning where two of Don Quixote’s friends are going through his collection and debating what to keep and what to throw away. It’s like watching two nerds go through a box of obscure Golden Age comics; I was completely lost as to what they were talking about.

With that being said, the parody still works because we all have an idea of what a “knight in shining armor” looks like. It’s similar to Austin Powers.

Take tales of King Arthur or any of the more grand of kings and their knights and we can see all of these chivalrous tropes.

The tradition of knights and values in stories probably stems even further back to military leaders before knights were a thing.

Malory's Le Mort d'Arthur was a great followup (another huge book, thought I'd never get done with Sir Tristram's long section).

One thing to note is that Don Quixote is actually two books written ten years apart. The first book, which is what most people are familiar with, is a purely medieval book that focuses on adventure and virtue. The second book is where it gets REALLY interesting because it's much more a product of the Renaissance. Don Quixote is now famous and people recognize him, and the book gets incredibly meta with how it treats heroes, explores power and authority, and puts both Don Quixote and Sancho into some really unique situations.

Chivalrous tales and Westerns continued to be made after these works, but the genres never regained the prominence they once had after the abundant flaws were laid bare in such a hilarious and enjoyable fashion.

The sequel to Don Quixote (or the second half of the book, depending on your book version) is great on another level too, once you know the history of it. The original Don Quixote was so popular that tons of derivative sequels popped up, many claiming to be by the same author or at least pretending to be. Cervantes was so annoyed that people were profiting off his work and often producing stories that ignored the undercutting of chivalrous knightly themes that he published an official sequel where he tears apart the story of one of the most popular copycats and ends by metaphorically >!killing chivalry dead, by having Don Quixote die after being freed from his delusion.!<

It is also exceptionally timely in how the Don interprets his experiences in the context of his belief systems. Evil enchanters trick him, rather than objects actually being what they appear to be. Every time you think, ""Ah, this will show him the truth!"" he finds ways to have it reinforce his beliefs. 

To answer your questions: I think Don Quixote gets better as the novel progresses.

In writing a book about how reality is experienced by people (especially by consensus), he may have wanted to give the novel a very realistic beginning. We agree that there is a La Mancha in which lives an older gentleman who has become addicted to books of chivalry. As opposed to the consensus that the books of chivalry are entirely fictitious, in which the Don does not partake.

Don Quixote had read Amadis as a part of his (burned up) library in the text.  Everything from the poem to the horse at the beginning to finding the helmet of mambrino (the barber's basin) was meant to be a parody of a knighthood book.  Even his ""penance"" when he meets the young woman running from her love problems is a reference!

There is also a lot of that time's anti-moor (anti Muslim) and hidden Jewish references in quite. Cervantes is suspected to have been from a historically Jewish convert family, and given that he was denied the right to go to the New World, it seems probable. 

I enjoyed the quijote, but there were definitely parts that made me really sad.  Sometimes I could only see an elderly man with dementia, and people kept making fun of him, using him, and he was just a confused old man.  Over all was great, but little parts hurt to read when I think of family that went through dementia before their deaths.

All three readings are perfectly acceptable. 

Don Quixote mocks both chivalric romances and what came after. The first part criticizes basing one's ideals and identity on a romanticized nostalgia and the harm it causes.  However the second part is a reaction to the first, showing that the new world ideology is hostile and mean. At the end of the second part when we see Don Quixote give up his ways, being beaten by society to no longer hold up his own sense of morality. It is here that the narrator shows remorse at what good parts were lost in the wholesale rejection of this culture, wonderment, or higher ideals.

Ayn Rand's books are an example where people who say they love them may or may not have read them but definitely do not understand the historical context in which they were written. Rand, like many other middle class and wealthy Russians, lost her family fortune due to the Bolshevik Revolution. Her books are revenge fantasies. That said, she does have some valid insights about the failings of Communism. But the very important context that modern readers miss is that at the time she lived _there were no social democracies_, and equally importantly, _social democracy is not socialism_. I.e. she worshipped unfettered capitalism because it made her feel good, not because it works well in practice--we now know that social democracy (which includes regulated capitalism) works much better.",urania_argus,2022-02-23 22:51:41

Don Quixote is just such a frustrated man. He hasn't got a job because he's nobility, but he's too poor and too low on the ladder to have any kind of social and political influence.

3hc061,"I was amused to see this, because I'm Spanish and one of the books I'm reading right now is Trapiello's ""translation"" of Don Quixote. I had of course read several excerpts at school, and I once tried to start it (the original version) but I stopped because I was not enjoying it. It's true that it's not that hard to read, with the help of footnotes for old fashioned phrases or expressions, but those interruptions prevented a smooth reading experience, and it felt like a chore rather than a pleasure.

On the other hand, I am enjoying the translated version a lot. To be fair, I tried to read the original version years ago, so maybe I have changed as a reader. 

It's true that in any translation things are lost, but because modern Spanish is very close to Cervantes' Spanish, this translated version is very close to Cervantes', certainly much more so than the translation to any other language. Don Quixote is not just a parody of medieval chivalry tales. Cervantes has an extremely piercing way of looking at things. Nothing is free from his satirical but fond look, and he is very ingenious when criticizing. His use of language is beautiful and quite readable.

So, all in all, I'm grateful for this ""translation"". By all means, you should read the original version if you feel up to it, but I think that for many Spanish readers this can make the difference between not enjoying and therefore not reading the Quixote, and enjoying it.

Then we can question: why does a book exists? To be read by the most people possible and to transmit an idea to most people possible or to be a work for the admiration and study of few people who can understand it as a whole?

Knighthood and chivalry were already quite dead in Cervantes' time; Don Quixote is a parody of the bygone era of idealism (which never really happened, but was told of in the romanticized novels he deluded himself with). His armor is a rusty heap of scraps he found in the attic, last worn by an ancestor he barely remembers. The adventures he goes on satirize both that idealism and the era in which he lived.

Of course their approaches were different. Marx used more direct analysis and reasoning to criticize society and recommend another way, Cervantes used comedy to point out the flaws both in the way things are and nostalgia for the way things used to be.

ldbzg6,"Oh boy, you're in for a treat! Here is a brief spoiler-free introduction to Don Quixote I share with friends. Hope it helps.A few helpful things to know when reading *Don Quixote* (with no spoilers)

&#x200B;

> The novel that is commonly referred to as *Don Quixote* is actually two books. The first was published in 1605, and the second in 1615. This time period was an important moment in Spanish history, part of what, for various reasons, has come to be known as Spain’s Golden Age (spanning the 16th to 17th centuries). First, the nation was enjoying unprecedented wealth form the New World as its empire expanded, and second, it was one of Spain’s richest periods of literary production. In many ways, however, Spain at the time can be compared to the United States in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Much of the wealth it was gaining as an imperial power was being spent in foreign wars. So while a select few of the Spanish society benefited from this wealth, the great majority was not helping the economy within the country. A certain sense of pessimism prevails during the period with regard to the colonial project and the impending decline of Spanish power (especially considering the defeat of the “invincible armada”).  
>  
>In terms of literature, the novel as a literary genre as we understand it today was just beginning to emerge. The most popular fictional narrative preceding *Don Quixote* was the chivalric romance. These were tales of knighthood including such works as *Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table* in England, *The Song of Roland* in France, and *Amadís de Gaula* in Spain. The narratives presented simple, static characters, and were often criticized by humanist educators of the time as purely providing entertainment with no moral or educational value.  
>  
>Despite the popularity of these books, such codes of chivalry did not exist in Spain. For some years, the political landscape of Spain had been changing and evolving from the purely feudal medieval period. The government was beginning to provide the first forms of state justice. In *Don Quixote* reference is made to the Holy Brotherhood. This was a form of police that watched over the rural countryside to enforce laws. So the mission of Don Quixote as a knight is both anachronistic and, in a sense, institutionally subversive.  
>  
>The man who becomes Don Quixote was not, however, even supposed to have the title “Don” which is a sign of nobility. He was, however, an “hidalgo.” The title comes from the Spanish phrase “hijo de algo” or “son of something.” This meant that he had some important bloodline, but was not part of the upper crust of nobility. In the book, however, he does seem to have an important social role within his rural village, and does own land. In most likelihood, someone like him would have owned land on which tenant farmers worked, collecting rent from them as his only source of income.  
>  
>The political climate of the period was also highly restrictive. In 1492, Spain had given its Jewish population the option of leaving, converting to Christianity, or being killed. This mandate, however, caused certain problems, as some people became suspicious of false converts secretly practicing Judaism. By the time Cervantes writes, there is a widespread obsession with proving one’s “purity of blood.” It was no longer enough to be a Christian, one must be an Old Christian, as opposed to a New Christians whose family may have been converts (even several generations removed). Many believe that Cervantes himself may have been a New Christian, since he was denied passage to the Americas earlier in his life, something commonly done to those suspected of having “unclean” blood. His father’s profession as a type of doctor, (a position typically held by Jews then) is also a clue that this may be the case. Cervantes also wrote a short theatrical piece very similar to the story of “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” The notable difference in Cervantes’s piece, however, is that the swindle perpetrated by some travelers to a town is based on the idea that in order to see a marvelous show one must have pure blood. Although there is no such show, many in the town admit to having seen great wonders.   
>  
>The same ethnic concerns involved the Muslim population in Spain as well. From 711 to 1492, Arabs were present throughout Spain. Although Spanish Kings had conquered the territory, many people and customs remained. Between the writing of Book 1 and Book 2, the Muslims were expulsed from Spain. They were seen as an ethnic and economic threat, since their success as merchants was threatening to disrupt the Spanish system of the time. People were often self-aware and attempted to outwardly show that they were neither Jewish nor Muslim. They did so, at times, by openly eating pork, drinking wine, or working on a Saturday. Those who failed to do such things consistently could easily be suspected of heresy and accused before the Inquisition.  
>  
>Cervantes, himself, had an interesting life. He participated in a great Spanish victory over the Ottoman Empire. Although the Spanish won, Cervantes lost the use of his left hand and was captured. He was later held captive in Algiers where he was ransomed by a group of Spanish friars (a common practice in that time). His knowledge of Arabic culture is extensive and reflected in the novel as well. He later held various small government posts and attempted several times to become a successful playwright. While his works on that end is not bad, he was writing at the same time as Lope de Vega, perhaps the greatest playwright of all time (in Spain or abroad). Lope represented a new form of theater that had a wildly successful commercial appeal. Cervantes, however, was still writing in an older style more closely associated with Greek classical drama, and never could achieve success in the theater. He wrote several other works, but none, of course, as successful as *Don Quixote*.  
>  
>Between Parts 1 and 2 of *Don Quixote*, another author published a “false” second part under the pseudonym Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda. In the prologue, the author ridicules Cervantes. His Don Quixote travels with Sancho to Barcelona before eventually being condemned to an insane asylum.

u11c0g,"The real answer is that both books are known for what stands out in them.

Don Quixote is about a nobleman who's so out of touch with reality, he thinks the windmils are giants, and he fights them.

THAT is the most notable characteristic of the book.

&#x200B;

The parts where he does something to upset the townspeople, or the clergy, or whoever else, are fun, but nobody would know what book you were talking about if you described it as ""that one where the main character does some dumb stuf that makes some people angry""

&#x200B;

Robinson Crusoe, same thing.

It's the book about the guy who's stranded on an island alone.

it's the recognisable part. the thing that makes the book stand out.

&#x200B;

And of course this has also caused a lot of people to know ABOUT these stories, without having actually read them.

Popular culture has taken the best known aspects of the stories and recycled them through all sorts of media.

&#x200B;

I would disagree that popular perception doesnt match the original stories though.

&#x200B;

Don Quixote IS about a nobleman who's gone mad and who's doing things like charging windmils.

The book has more, but that IS the basis.

&#x200B;

And Robinson Crusoe IS the story of a man who becomes stranded on an island and who's having to deal with those circumstances.

Don Quixote to me I feel you need to read the whole first book to get why its relevant. Hes crazy and Sancho is his ground so to speak. Who knew a crazy guy asking after Mambrinos helm could inspire a simple person to be such an effective governor? This is what makes the whole experience worth it. 

Robinson Crusoe reminds me of Into the Wild except he's actually capable. The problem was that he didn't know he liked it until he got away from it.

The second part of Don Quixote, where he dies at the end, is worth reading, and is in some ways better than the first part.

nmxgjp,"First of all, I love don Quixote. The humor in it is a great reminder for me that humans have and always will be essentially the same. The language and formality usually seen in older texts can sort of give this impression that people in the ""olden times"" were not the same as us, but seeing the humanity of Don Quixote and Pancho and other characters through a humourous lens reveals the same anxieties, awkwardness, internal monologues, etc. I have only read part one, but I may read part two soon.

Secondly, it really is too bad how many people have such a bad reading experience in school. Personally I liked most of what I was assigned to read in school. I look fondly back on almost everything assigned.

Surprisingly, the only book I can remember not really liking was Treasure Island which was one of about 20 books we could read for an assignment. Kind of funny since that was the one and only time we ever had the option to choose.

noaumt,"Yes, you're missing kind of a shit ton. But that's not your fault, it's over 400 years old. Humour is cultural, and there's aspects of other cultures comedy that doesn't translate, and parts that make reference to things you might be completely unaware of.

I couldn't stop laughing from the first chapter, when he makes himself a visor out of fucking pasteboard, which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

Further, there's lots of jokes where the Don is being an idiot, but a modern reader might not notice. I don't remember the specifics but he says things like ""I have the wits of Solomon, the oratory of Cicero and the humility of Caligula"" which might not sound funny to you, but to update the references would be a bit like if I said I had ""The wits of Albert Einstein, the oratory of Martin Luther King and the humility of Donald Trump"". 

Further, yeah a lot of the humour is unfortunately rooted in the fact that the Don has some severe mental health issues. He's essentially a 17th century Brony who becomes so obsessed with the show he starts dressing like a pony and going around neighing at people. He can be really annoying, constantly fucking up other people's lives because he's so deluded, but I still found myself caring about him.

It's not for everyone, it's so goddamn old and verbose that it can be quite hard to get through for modern readers, but if you can get an annotated version, or just casually do a history degree, you'll probably enjoy it a lot more, and it seriously worth it.

However, what makes Don Quixote truly incredible is that it was written so long ago, with very little material of the same literary style in existence prior to it, meaning that Cervantes wrote Don Quixote with little material to base its style off of. In fact, many great novelists, including the likes of Dickens and Faulkner, are known to have valued Don Quixote very highly and to have based their own works off of it.

You have to remember that Cervantes was writing roughly at the same time as Shakespeare, and his Don Quixote was revolutionary in its style, similar to how Shakespeare's works were revolutionary in their style when it came to theatre, hence Don Quixote being termed ""the first modern novel"".",TheXrasengan,2021-05-31 23:31:04
noaumt,"As others have said, the Grossman translation is generally considered as one of the better ones. That said, a lot of the humor is pretty low-brow and simplistic: ""Don Quixote is delusional, DQ fell in poop, etc""
Sometimes this is ironic or a commentary on literature of the time, but it's generally not that deep (unless you have a deep knowledge of Spanish politics and literary traditions.) Most of the book is interleaved between DQ's adventures and chapters of another story told by a person DQ encounters, and those tales are the best of the book.

It's often called ""The First Modern Novel"" and it's important to remember that. We often equate ""old"" with ""good"" - and it is impressive that Don Quixote has held up to the degree that it has - but the novel as an art form has been refined since Cervantes' time.

He did write another book called ""Exemplary Stories,"" so I'm sure that the scenario you mention is more illustration than it is a moral justification of what he wrote.  Twain is often associated with the phrase, ""Comedy equals tragedy plus time,"" meaning, sometimes humor can be derived from even the most horrible experiences imaginable.  Again, I'm not saying horrible things like rape or sexism or racism in themselves are funny or justifiable, but Don Quixote is a comedy and like Monty Python sketches uses controversial subject material as the basis for the comedy.",Classic-Positive3291,2021-09-21 13:50:17

And yeah, like you I preferred Part I over Part II. Unless I'm not mistaken the reason for Part II being a bit lacklustre (in my opinion at least) compared to the first part is that it was released in a bit of a hurry because an anonymous author published an unauthorised sequel to part I forcing Cervantes to release Part II in a bit of a hurry.

pf65qb,"It’s long because a work of art should have no bearing on length. It is a masterpiece and one of the best novels to come out of its age. Don Quixote, the character, is an embodiment of the psyche of the time and reformatted into a symbol of the futility, madness, and inanity of the era- particularly in Spain (leaders, ideology, royalty.) The hourglass of time does not judge, but Cervantes definitely did.

HOWEVER, I did not know there were other versions. Indeed, how many versions are there and what are the differences in the manuscripts (and even lengths) of the others. I wonder what the first unpublished manuscript really looked like (and that would be a prestigious find for the museum archives) and what it was.

Cervantes was involved in The Battle of Lepano and lost movement in his left hand. Later, he was captured by Ottoman forces and ransomed (spending his captivity in Istanbul.) He spent five years and four months in captivity. To say that is a long time is an understatement. He struggled to find work upon returning to Madrid until 1587 and received support by the Count of Lemos and joined the Third Order Franciscans, suffered from untreated diabetes, and published Don Quixote in 1615. He died a year afterwards.

He was an incredible person and Don Quixote is a masterpiece.

m10i5u,"I didn’t really glean that from Don Quixote but i’ll take your word for it. But as for other classics, Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein definitely fits the bill. 

It’s ultimately a parable of the reckless advancement of technology and the implications it has on society. Shelly wrote it at the height of the industrial age, where Europe had almost completely moved on from an agrarian age into one dominated by factories and billowing smokestacks. 

She argues that embracing technology is ultimately self-destructive (Viktor’s spiral into madness) while nature is the cure: capable of both giving life (the lightning which created the monster) *and* rejuvenating it (Viktor’s gradual mental clarity in the idyllic Swiss Alps and his conviction to confront the monster).

I would point out, also, that Don Quixote is written as a false indictment. It claims that it is about the danger of Romances, but then the book apes the shape and form and joys of Romances. Quixote begins as a sad sack, disillusioned and harmful to himself, but becomes a comic (and nearly Romantic) hero. This becomes even more noticeable and important in Part 2, where the events of the first book have been published SIMULTANEOUSLY to the things occurring, and, on top of that, a ""false"" book has been published that Quixote refutes. The reader, in the form of the Duke and Duchess, are invited in: the fun is in the knowing play of things, the claiming of seriousness that is not taken seriously. Not only this, but Quixote acknowledges that his true love, Dulcinea, is actually just some woman, but he quickly turns things back to insisting that she is actually the loveliest. 

So yes, if we are to read Don Quixote literally, it is about a delusional character, but the framing of the story, and patent ridiculousness of it (Don Quixote is convinced that he is being followed and chronicled for the ages--which is insane...except he, apparently, is), forces us to understand the novel as a book that is inherently a metafiction (the ridiculous preface, with its real and made up epigraphs!) that is working in irony, generally meaning the exact opposite of a literal interpretation.",dragonfliet,2021-03-11 16:53:39

hl221z,"While Don Quixote comes nowadays in a single volume they are actually two different books written 10 years apart. The first one as you noticed is quite episodic and Cervantes takes some liberties which some people are not very fond of, namely having a few stories which feel like different books altogether and have almost nothing to do with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. In the second book Cervantes changes many of these tropes and the story feels more linear and has a more modern feel to it. You will probably keep having a tough time until you finish the first part/book. The second one will be an easier read. I encourage you to continue until you get a taste of the second half of the book. It's quite worth it in my opinion.",violatorin,2020-07-04 12:32:36

If you do decide to finish, though, consider breaking it into sections and reading it over a longer time frame as you feel like diving back into it. To further support this, keep in mind that the book was originally published in two parts, which are now often compiled into one book, so it wasn't even originally the hefty single volume you are trying to power through. Also, the settings/themes within the story make it pretty easy to break the story down further into sections of a few chapters each. There are plenty of users on here who can give you a good idea how to divide the story into manageable chunks.

If you are looking for something to help add context to things as you read, the Overdue podcast is currently running a Don Quixote miniseries called Jagged Little Mill that drops every couple months on their main feed that recaps their thoughts on the story a few chapters at a time.

Don Quixote himself is also entirely insulated from the consequences of his actions, whilst the people who try to convince him of the error of his ways and to live in the ""real world"" come to nothing but failure until the very end, whereas Sancho, who l>!oyally sticks with the madman despite being aware of his insanity ends up being rewarded with (amongst other things)  the ""island"" he wanted!!<

It was interesting to draw comparisons between them, and especially to see the shift from forbidden, clandestine marriages to approved unions in AdG and to look at the visuals presented of characters to demonstrate their virtues, which was so opposed to how Cervantes wrote DQ.

While he was writing it, some other dude published his own *Second Part of Don Quixote*. This infuriated him. When you get to the end, you'll see what I mean. The practice of writing a sequel to someone else's work was common, though. Look at *Orlando Furioso*.

2) It's episodic. Feel free to read a chapter or two at a time. Cervantes doesn't inflict too many cliffhangers on readers.

3) Notice how often the narrator keeps contradicting himself. Names and places change for no reason. This is arguably a parody of novels about knights errant.

j3rzp,"It's a matter for debate. The edition I have argues that it was a parody. Cervantes, in *Don Quixote* and elsewhere, cites so many myths, legends, and historical episodes, and so many of them correctly, that the mistakes must belong either to the characters or to the text, not to Cervantes himself. The editor argued this, at least.

Further, at least one famous mistake was intentional. Sancho's donkey disappears without explanation midway through Part One. It reappears without explanation a few chapters later. The printers noticed this error in the first edition and corrected it. This is noticeable because the printers use a particular phrase that Cervantes never uses. Most people would have read the corrected version. 

Ten years later, Part Two came out. Somewhere near the beginning, a list of Part One's flaws includes the disappearing donkey. If the correction had belonged to Cervantes, he wouldn't have mentioned such an event. He meant for the donkey to vanish.

9mgguj,"> ...Don Quixote uses physical humor (Bodily humor that is), *satire that Cervantes uses* to make fun of classic Spanish chivalric books, and even epic fails that the main character involves in, especially Sancho as well.

Crucially, DQ doesn't 'use satire'; it **is** a prose satire: that is literally its genre. The physical humour and ""epic fails"" are used as satiric devices, not things distinct from satire.

What changes, over the course of the episodes, is the object of the satire.

Initially, Cervantes is satirising shitty pulp chivalric romances (not ""classics"" -- the Early Modern Spanish equivalent of airport books and bodice rippers) in the same way (that is, encyclopedically) that *Gulliver's Travels* begins as an 18th century version of Lucian's *True Story [Bro]*, cutting up dubious and even outright fraudulent travel narratives like George Psalmanazar's.

sa7r27,"I have no idea why your post is getting such a negative response. This is a normal question with a decent amount  of scholarship that attempts to answer it. 

The book is very self aware when it comes to Muslims in Spain. As part of the metafiction framing device, Cervantes claims the book was originally written in Arabic. According to the book, the entire thing is literally coming from an Arabian perspective. The absence of Muslims and presence of Moriscos is a major theme explored throughout the entire book. 

For additional reading, about translation,* In Good Faith: Arabic Translation and Translators in Early Modern Spain* is a monograph that explores how Arabic translation worked in Spain during the time of Cervantes. 

For Don Quixote and Islam more broadly, the articles “Why You Can/’t Believe the Arabian Historian Cide Hamete Benengeli: Islam and the Arabian Cultural Heritage in Don Quixote”; “Islamic Influence on Spanish Literature: Benengeli's Pen in ‘Don Quixote’”; and “When an Arab Laughs in Toledo: Cervantes's Interpellation of Early Modern Spanish Orientalism” will give you some good ideas to chew upon.

sa7r27,"No worries, thank you for the follow up. I am reading the book at the moment, and started and finished volume one in the last 2-3 days. 

My question essentially, with the above, is how people interpreted these aspects. Like you wrote, it could potentially be satire? The book is absolutely a spoof and a satire, so maybe there were elements of satire present. Or it could be the author’s own voice or it’s lacking an element of satire. 

I think this is something that’s worth exploring. 

I’m coming into this book, from having first read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, then Chinua’s Achebe’s critique of that book on the ground that it’s a racist book, which I agreed with; in the last month or so. I just didn’t know if a similar thing has been done, not so much as deeming the book racist or not racist, but moreso evaluating race and how it factors into the story of Don Quixote. I think a solid 10 page paper or so can be written about the topic, that would hopefully be more thorough, and I guess I was trying to use the Reddit collective mind of trying to find those serious academic analysis on how race factors within the book. It’s just that not everyone is as perceptive as Chinua Achebe on this topic, and even if the book does have racist elements, that doesn’t mean the book is without artistic merit or even moral merit outside of that one aspect. I’m moreso asking about the context of it, since there’s a lot going on concerning race within the book (1. It’s a spoof, so knowing when something is satire or is meant to be taken directly is tricky, 2. There’s a tricky history, both personally and nationally to take into account, and the political climate in which it’s written, 3. It could be based off of the books it’s spoofing, and those books themselves could’ve had negative perceptions about black people/Moors/Muslims, or 4. It could be that the author may have agreed with those negative perceptions, or that the author doesn’t care enough about the point to fight against it at a time when it was a politically popular position and “went with the flow”, so to speak, 5. The book features multiple characters who frequently get caught up in their own fantasies and lose touch with reality, and this issue could also feature into that?). It’s a tricky aspect of the book, so I figured it’s one worth exploring more into. 

I personally think the book has artistic merit overall, it’s pretty funny in certain aspects, the characters of Sancho and Don Quixote are iconic, it’s a bit wordy and gets a bit repetitive with some of the gags but is good overall, and deals with an important theme regarding mental illness, what to do with people who persistently believe in wrong beliefs despite the evidence around them (for example, the book mentions flat-earthers at one point as being an ignorant bunch who clutch to their false beliefs, which still exist today, albeit in smaller numbers, and so on). I just didn’t think these other evaluations of mine were as relevant to the above, because I wasn’t trying to pass negative or positive judgment on the book, but understand how the author approaches race, class, and women better (which are often standard approaches to analyzing literature based off race, class, and feminism). 

I’ll try to look into more academic sources on the subject. I figured someone else may have had a similar question and already explored this topic, since it’s a pretty popular book, and the above methods of analyzing are often done with texts.",NicolasName,2022-01-22 22:48:32

However, Wikipedia says: ""The second part of Cervantes' Don Quixote, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, ..."".  

Surprisingly to myself, since I just opined the opposite, it continues ""... has come to be regarded by some literary critics[18] as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes' Segunda Parte, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda's Second Part being printed there, in an early example of metafiction.[19].

Don Quixote and Sancho were going on adventures got a bit repetitive after a while, it didn't feel like a single plot but more like a collection of short stories; but I imagine that is part of the satirical aspect of the novel. The long side stories of some of the characters were also hit or miss with me. 

     

I'm aware of the whole story of how it was published in two volumes 10 years apart (and the second volume more as a reaction to others writing unauthorized sequels). That was in the preface and was interesting as well. Honestly, though, taken as a whole I think it could have used some editing.

It's also amazing to me how many tropes associated with modern literature (post-modernism, in particular) can be found in the book. It makes and breaks as many narrative rules as it can. And it's just wonderfully written, with a compelling story.

The relationship between Arthur and the Tick is so similar to the relationship between Sancho Panza and Don Quixote. They both have these strict moral codes that they lose themselves in, the Don with his Chivalry, and the Tick with his deranged dedication to ""Justice!"". And they're both send-ups of their respective genres.

Heck, that whole section with the priest pouring over the Don's collection of tales of knight-erranty (""Trash"" ""Trash"" - ""Oh wait keep this one, I like this one"") - he could've easily been talking about comic books. 

Don Quixote is about a comic-book nerd that goes off the deep end and decides to become a masked vigilante. :)

mha1ki,"This struck me as a key moment in Cervantes' criticism of chivalric romance. Marcela didn't ask Grisostomo to give up his scholarly life and follow her into the countryside where she was, ironically, trying to get away from suitors like Grisostomo. She shows up at the funeral and is mad as hell that she's essentially being blamed for his death when she did everything to prevent something like that from happening. It's also a role reversal as women in chivalric romances are written as these swooning simpletons just waiting to give their favor to the heroic knights. Instead, Marcela is acting rationally and Grisostomo is the swooning one.

Think of the parallels with Don Quixote and Dulcinea del Toboso, as well as the ladies and knights in the chivalric romances that Cervantes is criticizing. Dulcinea didn't ask Don Quixote to go out and do all these things so we don't know her perspective at this point in the story and readers may be under the false impression that she'd be like the ladies from chivalric romances. Cervantes is reminding the reader that women aren't the simplistic characters from chivalric romances, that if they were written as actual human beings they might have something to say about all this and those things might not be very nice. They likely wouldn't consent to have all these violent actions done in their name, or even consent to putting knights in danger in their name.

hnol6o,"Around the end of the first part Cervantes is still an advocate of chivalry and its literature (1605). At the end of the second part (1615), Quixote goes on a ramble to denounce these works as foolish (the original spanish says ""disparates""). Cervantes was complex and often contradictory: he served as a soldier and yet he saw spain as corrupt and decadent. When compared to Lope de Vega, Gongora and Quevedo he was severely underestimated due to his minor reputation as a poet and playwright. On another note, before Part II was published some anonyous author (Avellaneda) plagiarized Don Quixote, this could be what propelled him to off the main character in the second tome. He created Don Quixote, and he would kill Don Quixote.

If we understand Cervantes's world view: one in which Spain stands to lose its power on a global scale, one where the House of Austria is more preocuppied with pomp and luxury than with caring for a highly illiterate country, and one in which mock heroes (such as the titular knight) are doomed to failure, then some of its underlying meaning can come to surface.

I agree with most that Alonso Quijano was foolish, but i don't think he was insane,  he wholehartedly believed that knight errants were the only ones who could bring order back into the world. Madness, like chivalry, was a necessary fiction.

Edit: to answer your original question, the work is jaded and most people won't like it because it stands on a high difficulty curve. The characters became more important than the work and ingrained themselves in popular culture. It's custommary for hispanic people, particularly intelectuals to have a Quixotesque reference at home (paintings, statues, drawings, etc.) even if most haven't read it.",Artwaffles,2020-07-09 15:11:55

Like you, one of my favourite chapters is the part where Don Quixote and Sancho vomit on each other after drinking the potion, it was like something you'd see in a modern day comedy film.

The book's themes of madness are really interesting and it's thought provoking how something can sort of be real if a person truly believes it is. Don Quixote may not be a real knight, but he carries himself with more faith and virtue than many real knights ever have, even if he often didn't get things quite right. I also really like how Sancho says such profound things without even realising it.

I agree about the ending,>! I think I would've preferred it had Don Quixote died believing he was a knight, but I seem to recall reading the ending was influenced by real life pressures Cevantes was experiencing at the time, though my memory is hazy so don't quote me on that.!< It seems funny marking spoilers for a 405 year old book but I'll mark them just in case!

There are many things special about *Don Quixote*.  It was one of the first western novels, revolutionary in its literary structure, and revolutionary for its sardonic approach to chivalry.  Cervantes conceived the novel while in prison in Seville, a low-point of his life.  Like Cervantes, Quixote is an idealist who wanted to improve the world and was instead beaten by it.

I don’t know why, but it just seemed to make sense to read each chapter as an episode and take a break, either coming back to it later that day or the next.  This really eliminated a lot of monotony for me.

I think Don Quixote means a lot of different things to a lot of people, and it’s important to recognize the author’s intent but also take into account what it means to YOU.  To me, the first book of Don Quixote was brilliant and hilarious.  It was airy – the charge on the sheep as well as the windmill are just classically epic humor.  Don Quixote’s consistent use of deus ex machina to explain his failures and the mishaps that befall him get bigger and bigger as they get more and more idiotic Spoiler:  They’re all enchanters.  

The second book of Don Quixote hit me a lot deeper.  It was definitely more philosophical and probably the saddest thing I’ve read in a long time.  People’s amazement with Don Quixote has disappeared over years with his fame and confusion is replaced by deceit for jest.   Even well meaning and good natured people deter and cause him injury in the name of their amusement.

1kjo4b,"""desocupado lector"" or ""unconcerned reader"" are the first two words of DQ. It's a warning from Cervantes that what you see on the surface in this book is not what it seems or that something much more subtly and brilliantly thought out is at play if you read with great attention. The idea of the nature of truth is the most important part of this book for me. Cervantes, in such incredibly clever fashion, makes a mockery of the idea of an honest and straightforward truth, showing its intangibility and precariousness. 

In the book, Cervantes speaks to the reader as the narrator, but also states that the story comes from an account by a moorish historian Cide Hamete Belengeli which was translated by a bilingual man he found on the street in Toledo. In this way, there are three individuals involved in the narration. This relates to this theme of the truth, the idea being that the information in the book comes filtered through three levels of bias which should tell the reader that constant references to the ""absolute infallible truth"" of the story is ironic and a complex commentary on the nature of 'the truth'.

At every turn Cervantes toys with the reader, it seems almost like as soon as you are convinced of something in the story something comes up to make you doubt yourself on that point. Looking beyond the surface level in Don Quixote can be very difficult, but between the lines you will find the unbelievable brilliance of it if you can manage not to be a 'desocupado lector'. There's a reason it is so loved 500 years on.

I could go on and on about the dynamics of what makes this book like no other I've ever read, it is always so engaged and always contains something greater beneath the fabric of the silly adventures it recounts.

""...as soon as Sancho saw [the peace officer] walking into the room, in his shirt and nightcap, carrying the lamp and with an ugly look on his face, he asked his master:

'Sir, do you think this might be that enchanted Moor come to punish us again, with some extra punches he forgot to throw the first time?'

'It cannot be the Moor,' replied Don Quixote, 'because those who are enchanted do not allow anyone to see them.'

'Maybe they don't let anyone see them, but they let them feel them all right,' said Sancho. 'And if you don't believe me, just ask my ribs.'""

It's hilarious.

That being said, the romantic in me was drawn to Don Quixote's struggle for virtue in an sinful world. I found myself trying to justify his actions despite Cervantes' clearly satirical views of the matter. Don Quixote was changing the world through his adventures and, while some people suffered horribly because of him, most of their lives improved, however slightly, after their encounters with the dynamic duo. In my admittedly biased eyes, Don Quixote's adventures provided justification ""to dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe, to bear with unbearable sorrow"" and generally attempt to be a good and virtuous person despite the challenges and temptations of everyday life.

The first ~300 or so pages are great, I guarantee if that Terry Gilliam Don Quixote movie ever gets off the ground it will be almost entirely based on that section of the book as that's where all the classic don quixote moments take place (fighting the windmills, etc.,).  
  
Unfortunately the next 700 pages turn the focus away from Quixote and towards a series of travellers who recount their stories.  These stories are largely boring, repetitive and predictable which makes the book really grind to a halt.  I personally couldn't get through it and threw in the towel at page 600 or so.

Don Quixote is written in an early form of Spanish, and while it is close enough to modern Spanish to be readable, there are terms and idioms that may be confusing and make the reading experience less smooth.

I would actually advise you to read the translation to modern Spanish that Andres Trapiello did recently:

(link edited because it was a direct sales link, now it links to a news piece about the translation):
http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/11/opinion/1434035664_817192.html

Since modern Spanish is close to Cervante's Spanish, this translation loses much less than foreign language translations, and it should be much easier for someone ""kinda-decent in Spanish"". Even I, as a native speaker, ended up reading this version and enjoying it a lot. 

Purists would of course disagree and insist that you have to read Don Quixote as Cervantes wrote it, but... I don't know, in the end I prefer to be practical.

I'll try to help you judge by yourself. 

This is one famous passage:

--------------------------------------------------Original version:

En esto, descubrieron treinta o cuarenta molinos de viento que hay en aquel campo; y, así como don Quijote los vio, dijo a su escudero:

— La ventura va guiando nuestras cosas mejor de lo que acertáramos a desear, porque ves allí, amigo Sancho Panza, donde se descubren treinta, o pocos más, desaforados gigantes, con quien pienso hacer batalla y quitarles a todos las vidas, con cuyos despojos comenzaremos a enriquecer; que ésta es buena guerra, y es gran servicio de Dios quitar tan mala simiente de sobre la faz de la tierra.

— ¿Qué gigantes? —dijo Sancho Panza.

— Aquellos que allí ves —respondió su amo— de los brazos largos, que los suelen tener algunos de casi dos leguas.

— Mire vuestra merced —respondió Sancho— que aquellos que allí se parecen no son gigantes, sino molinos de viento, y lo que en ellos parecen brazos son las aspas, que, volteadas del viento, hacen andar la piedra del molino.

— Bien parece —respondió don Quijote— que no estás cursado en esto de las aventuras: ellos son gigantes; y si tienes miedo, quítate de ahí, y ponte en oración en el espacio que yo voy a entrar con ellos en fiera y desigual batalla.

Y, diciendo esto, dio de espuelas a su caballo Rocinante, sin atender a las voces que su escudero Sancho le daba, advirtiéndole que, sin duda alguna, eran molinos de viento, y no gigantes, aquellos que iba a acometer. Pero él iba tan puesto en que eran gigantes, que ni oía las voces de su escudero Sancho ni echaba de ver, aunque estaba ya bien cerca, lo que eran; antes, iba diciendo en voces altas:

— Non fuyades, cobardes y viles criaturas, que un solo caballero es el que os acomete.

Levantóse en esto un poco de viento y las grandes aspas comenzaron a moverse, lo cual visto por don Quijote, dijo:

— Pues, aunque mováis más brazos que los del gigante Briareo, me lo habéis de pagar.

Y, en diciendo esto, y encomendándose de todo corazón a su señora Dulcinea, pidiéndole que en tal trance le socorriese, bien cubierto de su rodela, con la lanza en el ristre, arremetió a todo el galope de Rocinante y embistió con el primero molino que estaba delante; y, dándole una lanzada en el aspa, la volvió el viento con tanta furia que hizo la lanza pedazos, llevándose tras sí al caballo y al caballero, que fue rodando muy maltrecho por el campo. Acudió Sancho Panza a socorrerle, a todo el correr de su asno, y cuando llegó halló que no se podía menear: tal fue el golpe que dio con él Rocinante.

— ¡Válame Dios! —dijo Sancho—. ¿No le dije yo a vuestra merced que mirase bien lo que hacía, que no eran sino molinos de viento, y no lo podía ignorar sino quien llevase otros tales en la cabeza?

— Calla, amigo Sancho —respondió don Quijote—, que las cosas de la guerra, más que otras, están sujetas a continua mudanza; cuanto más, que yo pienso, y es así verdad, que aquel sabio Frestón que me robó el aposento y los libros ha vuelto estos gigantes en molinos por quitarme la gloria de su vencimiento: tal es la enemistad que me tiene; mas, al cabo al cabo, han de poder poco sus malas artes contra la bondad de mi espada.

— Dios lo haga como puede —respondió Sancho Panza.

Y, ayudándole a levantar, tornó a subir sobre Rocinante, que medio despaldado estaba.

But I think nihilism can also mean that there is no one True world, no culture, religion or belief-system that is better or more true than any other, and this is because life is without inherent meaning.

Don Quixote doesn't fit into the first interpretation, but it works with the second because he - Quixote - believes he's in the medieval fantasy world of knights errand and damsels in distress. Sancho Panza cares enough to try and keep him from too much harm, and even though he gets beaten up a lot, there are some villagers and peasants who understand Don Quixote is acting how he is because he's unwell. All the characters in the book behave in accordance to what they believe, while being further influenced by personal loyalties, economic reasons and the class system.

Personally, I think the book is more about mental illness than anything else. I was also surprised when I read it how fucking funny it was - you don't expect books from the 500 year old books to be funny.

2jpvdx,"If I remember correctly, the author (Cervantes) has a bit of a habit of doubting the authenticity of the story - he laments that some things are really weird, or that there are things he doesn't know (such as the actual name of Don Quixote, which he just ""guesses""), and so on. He could have invented the ""moorish author"" in order to be allowed to reflect on what he's writing, indeed- a way to say ""the moorish author seems to be quite convinced of this, and I still think it's an absurd claim, but I have to write it"".

However, the ""author publishes a book that, he claims, is a reviewed copy of somebody else's manuscript"" trope is somewhat common. One of the most important Italian books, ""The Bethroted"", is a notorious example: Manzoni, the author, claims that he merely found an old story that he had liked and re-written. He did it to be able to claim that the story, 200 years old, was in some way ""a true story"".

Or Mary Shelley: in ""The Last Man"", the unnamed author (a woman who might be Mary Shelley herself) stumbles upon an ancient temple in a hidden cave in Italy and finds the original narration of a Sybil (an ancient Roman prophet who spoke only in riddles). The author reads what the Sybil had to say and writes the book: notice that the book is set in the year ~2050, and Mary Shelley uses this construction to say ""I'm not making stuff up, I'm just telling you the actual predictions of a prophet.""

Or even more convoluted: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for example, has Dr Frankenstein tell his story to a British sea captain, who writes down everything to his sister in letters, and the book is supposedly a copy of these (fake) letters where a guy tells us what he has been told.

7futwq,"I think Cervantes is trying to point out that Chivalric novels are, first and foremost, powerful fictions. The resurgence of chivalric novels in the Spanish Renaissance were a result of a sort of counter Renaissance worldview; that is to say, authors of chivalric novels saw the advances in technologies and society beginning to turn away from classical Christian chivalry, and in response presented fictions, disguised as history, which reveal an idealized past.
So Cervantes is responding to these chivalric novels which present an ideal past. But is this response parody? Yes, but in an oblique way. In many ways Don Quixote is a thought experiment: what if someone actually did what these chivalric novels suggest is a proper ""classical"" worldview? Don Quixote is the result, and as you know from reading the book, is he is ridiculed, embarrassed, and he himself in the end repents of the actions he made during his madness. This is because Don Quixote doesn't take these books as fictions, he takes them as history and examples of ethics and morality. However, notice that Don Quixote's family, the barber, and the priest (and later Carrasco) dispel the power of fiction. While they don't see chivalric novels as histories, they dismiss them as childish and throw them away. Thus they too are denying the power of fiction.
So, Don Quixote also does this within its own text. It parodies the format and style of chivalric novels, including a detailed fictional textual history (who is the real author of Don Quixote?) and digressions that feature novellas. This is certainly parody. However, Cervantes' use of parody is less centered on making fun of chivalric novels for the sake of making fun of them. Rather, Cervantes' uses parody to demonstrate both the hidden power of fictions, and the absurdities of anyone trying to implement a fictional, classical worldview in the modern age. The narrator, who you aren't exactly sure how to interpret, is another fiction; should we trust him? Ultimately, we don't know, and that's the fun part of the book. Every time you read it your views of characters change. Don Quixote is a pitiable character, and next he is a modern hero. Sancho is a fool but on another reading he may be the ideal innocent blind follower.

7futwq,"I think you're hitting something important here, but I'm worried that you're dismissing the value of those ideal fictions. Quixote is, despite being pitiable, a strong example of the virtues of the chivalric age. He's a good person. And the coldly realist people that manipulate him (like the Duchess) are super fucking cruel. The fantasy of chivalry is laughable when set against a real-world context, hence book 1, but it's also beautiful and good, and its opposition is awful, like in book 2. That's why the ending is such a heartbreaker. Don Quixote's innocence is predicated on belief in an impossible world. It's sad to let that end, and its monstrous to abuse it.

A novel like *Don Quixote* is a different matter. It would be hard for even high intermediate and low advanced. I mean, Shakespeare was still alive when it was published. And last year, in Spain, they published a modernized version, so it's even tough for Spanish readers.  

Still, if you want to get it to motivate you, or to just dabble in it now and then, or in the hopes that, like you say, you might one day be able to read it, sure! Or maybe you could get that modernized version I mentioned. ",dauthie,2016-01-19 00:33:15
41lx68,"I spent some concentrated time studying another language, and I would say that there's a huge difference between learning to read and learning to converse, especially when what you're reading isn't remotely contemporary. That may seem counter-intuitive, but reading and speaking in another language are very different skills. Everyone learns differently, so it may be different for you, but comprehending words on a page is *so much different* than understanding someone's real life accent and formulating the words to respond.

That's not so say that reading a book in the language you want to learn is a bad idea. It might actually be pretty fun. But for the sake of learning colloquial speech, you will definitely want to actively study vocabulary and grammar, and I always found that watching tv/movies and listening to audio were much more effective than reading. 

Also, you might consider reading children's literature before something as ambitious as Don Quixote. Children's books are going to contain a lot of basic vocabulary and it's often possible to find books with parallel English and Spanish.

41lx68,I would not suggest reading Don Quixote in its original Spanish as part of learning the language. It makes use of future subjunctive tense which is not part of the language currently. It's a fantastic book that I would recommend reading. Perhaps reading more recent novels such as 100 years of solitude would be better suited. ,poopcorn_kernel,2016-01-19 04:27:14
41lx68,"I definitely wouldn't start with Don Quixote. Start with a Spanish language version of Harry Potter or something similar. Don Quixote uses an archaic form of modern Spanish, so you're not doing yourself any favors. There are also some nice dual-language books that have both languages side-by-side for comparison.",pfunest,2016-01-19 14:46:13
41lx68,"When I was years into learning French, I would read short stories (like Maupassant), their comic books, and a French magazine about video games that was written very slang-ily.  I also really liked to read translations of Agatha Christie books, because I wanted to solve the mysteries and that made me less inclined to skip passages that had unfamiliar vocabulary and I would be motivated to read very closely.  I also think Don Quixote is written in a (relatively?) obscure dialect of Spanish, instead of the ""standard"".  

The thing with learning through literature, is that it's beautiful and nice to read something in it's original language, but the prose novelists use (I eventually got to the point where I was reading Proust) is nowhere near what people use to speak to one another, and if you don't have familiarity with the language you'll start peppering you conversation with really bizarre turns of phrase because that's how something was described in literature, and you won't be able to sense how jarring it is for native listeners.

ALSO, not sure what exactly you're hoping to do with the language, but reading it is a whole different animal than being able to hear it spoken to you, let alone be able to speak it back.  When I lived in France I relied on the ""books and bars"" method, studying grammar books, reading actual books, and going to bars to have casual conversations.",tanya_gohardington,2016-01-19 15:43:38
41lx68,"Wow, I hadn't realized it was such an old book. I figured it was written in the 1800s at the earliest. That's what I get for not doing my research; I picked Don Quixote because it's the most famous Spanish-language book I could think of. If it's too advanced maybe I'll look for another Spanish-language book that would be more accessible to me.

All I know is that I want the book to have been written originally in Spanish.",NudeWithSocks,2016-01-19 00:45:18

41lx68,"Keep in mind that *Don Quixote* is over 1,000 pages long. I doubt there is a parallel text edition of it. 

Also, to comprehend anything in an unknown language as an adult as opposed to when one is immersed as a child, you need to know the grammar first. The grammar won't just come to you on your own if you stare at it a lot. So, you need to make sure that whatever language-teaching app you are using clearly presents the grammar to you.

14ir2v,"The Edith Grossman edition is excellent--I first tried to read Don Quixote in one of the older translations and could barely get through the first few chapters, but Grossman's translation is very clear and beautiful and captures much of the humor of the novel, it's a far more readable and engaging version.

Also, her translation of Love in the Time of Cholera is GORGEOUS. Just saying.",kisarra,2012-12-09 00:18:58

Now, if you were to redo DQ from Sancho Panza's POV, that I might want to read. Or if you went for a scifi-style update - like Don Quixote with a sentient robot Sancho Panza, tilting at giant air scrubbers in an alien landscape :)

Good luck, I don't think I'm your target audience.",serralinda73,2017-09-30 20:49:01

73h03n,"Thank you for appreciating the original like i did, because i am already a huge fan of the book! 

I know you are not interested in modern re-imaginings of the original tales in the book, i respect your opinion.

I am just making the sequel because i want to make new adventures of Don Quixote, so i hope i can make the fans happy. :)",DamianJoy99,2017-09-30 20:53:47
73h03n,"Hmm... Interesting about that opinion in which Cervantes killed off Quixote, pretty interesting. But i do want to make sure that this sequel i am creating that would follow the original tale, and not the one that made Cervantes him make fun of the unauthorized author of the fake second volume.


I don't think i could plan to address the author's rebuke of fanfiction. But i would make the resurrected Quixote turning delusional again. I also would like him to fight windmills again because it is the most memorable part of the first book, and i would like to re-tell that moment in the modern day Spain, i would seem to make it funnier with a modern design of the windmills.

Yes, you are right. It is the first modern novel ever made and the first to use modern Spanish language.

I like your opinions and such. I hope you help contribute on my sequel project on Don Quixote. Thank you for this good comment. :)",DamianJoy99,2017-09-30 21:12:10

2b54e0,"Oh, sorry! I read the Tom Lathrop translation. I have no means of comparing that translation to any other, although I thoroughly enjoyed Lathrop's translation. I found the footnotes profoundly helpful. The only thing I disliked was how clear he made his agenda: he had published some articles insisting that some of the mistakes (such as Don Quixote getting a character's name wrong) were not to be attributed to Cervantes' error, but instead were Don Quixote's own mix-ups. Now, while I can appreciate that point, I felt that it was an observation that should have been relegated to the translator's introduction and, at most, one footnote in the text (say, at the first instance of a mistake). However, it appeared way too often in footnotes. This heavy-handed approach was the only downside of the translation, although it didn't bother me too much.


Edit: It seems that merely identifying my translation as Tom Lathrop's isn't sufficient. I've now ran some searches on that translation and found that there are many editions of his translation, some of which differ greatly from the one I have. Here's mine: http://www.amazon.ca/Don-Quixote-Miguel-Cervantes-Saavedra/dp/0451531817/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1405802405&sr=8-5&keywords=Don+Quixote 
In contrast, there seem to be other editions of his translation that are aimed at ""students,"" and they include, on each page, a summary of the goings-on of each page. I didn't have such an edition of the book, and I didn't even know one existed until this moment.",voltimand,2014-07-19 20:36:08
1ixyqp,"Yeah, one of my favorites as well. Don Quixote is inspirational in a twisted kind of way... He truly stops at nothing to attempt to create the identity that he desires for himself.

ramkxh,"Because the core of its humor is not jokes. Jokes are highly dependent on idiomatic knowledge of culture; you don’t get jokes if you don’t connect with the culture.

The core of Don Quixote, like all great comedy, is tragedy. It gives timeless laughs because it’s not a simple twist of language, or a clever punchline, but the utter ridiculousness of Don Quixote.",,2021-12-07 01:30:38

ramkxh,"Because at the time that it was written, there was a economic depression and people were very sad. Similar to today, but without a pandemic. Cervantes wrote about an anti-hero, a dreamer who wanted to live in a fantasy world. He's funny and endearing and sad, a tradgedy. Don Quixote del la Mancha is a classic. It's a story not unlike the stories of the comics about heros.",echolm1407,2021-12-07 11:20:02

ramkxh,"Pretty sure Cervantes meant DQ as a direct meta critique of the cliche representations of romance in literature at the time. He was the embodiment of how stupid chivalry is. Have you read part two? It is the authors awareness of the exact opinions you expressed that make Don Quixote so historically relevant, as it is one of the first novels that breaks the fourth wall and criticizes it’s genre",SnowyNW,2021-12-07 01:46:42
iategt,"Other people will give you more complex answers, but one aspect that makes Don Quixote meaningful to me and to literature in general is that it may have been the first novel about the role fiction and storytelling in general plays in our lives. There are the more obvious metafictional elements, but what makes it stand out is that Don Quixote and other characters have mindsets shaped by fictional stories, similar to many people today building their lives and values around the fiction the consume, whether they know it or not. Cervantes seems to be conflicted about this. There are passages where DQ is simply a fool, and others in which he's articulate and intelligent.    

I may be wrong about this, but I think the overall theme of ""personal fantasy v crushing reality"" started with Don Quixote and it's something you see running through the history of the novel ever since, through Austen, Flaubert, and Proust among other writers, and that's one of the reasons it's considered the first modern novel, I think.",,2020-08-16 15:22:29

So, regardless of what you meant to say, you presented a pretentiously foolish thought. And, frankly, many people say the same thing about Dante's Divine Comedy. They only regard it as worthless because they don't understand it. So if anything is baseless, it's your claim that Don Quixote is useless or worthless.

8yme49,"I recently read a more modern translation (Burton Rafael) and thought it was great. I will say, however, that I did have a hard time sympathizing with Don Quixote during most of the first book. Honestly, he was kind of a jerk, picking fights with innocent people and causing people more harm than good. Where it came together for me was the second book. It is interesting because Don Quixote becomes more of a victim then. If you are getting burnt out, I recommend you read it in small chunks over a longer period of time, rather than just reading it straight through in one shot. I got burnt out after the first book, so I read it slower over the second part and enjoyed it much more. Good luck!",littleseaotter,2018-07-14 19:02:24
