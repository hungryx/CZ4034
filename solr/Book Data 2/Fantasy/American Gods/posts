z4tggv,American Gods is incredible!,"I just finished reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Of his work, I've only read the Sandman comics before this.

Based on media about the television show, I was expecting this book to be a raunchy, flashy confrontation between gods, with backstabbing and conflict in every chapter.

First, I was surprised to realize just how much of the book is about the American experience itself. Immigration, cultural preservation, and religious practice all make sense as side themes. But I thought that the book was also a great exploration of noncentral/left-behind America through Shadow and Wednesday's road trips, visits to out-of-the-way places, and Lakeside. In a lot of ways, this book felt like a more grounded way of discussing drug addiction, rural decay, grief, and petty conflicts over small things than many books in the subgenre of post-2016 nonfiction that purports to give educated, urban readers a look into what ""real"" America is like between the coasts.

Second, this book made me feel a weighty sadness that I haven't picked up from many other pieces of fiction. By the end of each character's storyline - Shadow, Laura, Wednesday, the Egyptians, Hintzelmann - I felt weary. Gaiman brings up many characters' thoughts of suicide (and many characters commit suicidal actions), and the oppressive existence that the gods and humans of the book labor under was so well-constructed that it felt earned every time. And somehow, at the end, I felt hopeful. Shadow's post-climax journey - laying Laura to rest, singing with Anansi, helping Mulligan shepherd Lakeside into an uncertain future, resolving his bet with Czernobog, and meeting Odin - made me feel so much joy for him. I think it's one of the more well-done endings of any standalone that I've read (and changes the nature of the book in a way that seems comparable to The Scouring of the Shire).

Finally, Gaiman's prose is so diverse. The sheer number of perspectives that he's able to give a unique voice to; the shifting from dream to reality; the use of multiple styles of dialogue from traditional ""he said"" to more narrative, Cormac McCarthy-esque interactions.

In sum, this was one of my favorite fiction books of all time. I've read about ~200 books over the last couple of years and this is easily in my top five, if not right there at #1. I'm looking forward to reading more of Gaiman.

Edit: thank you all for the recommendations and thoughts on the book!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/z4tggv/american_gods_is_incredible/,2022-11-26 00:48:27,339,4490,books
mwquw6,I recently read Gaiman's American Gods,"While it was a good read it didn't live up to the hype that was promised. 

It is an interesting concept about gods having to feed off of our interests in them or else they get weak, and how our new interests are giving rise to new gods.

What was I supposed to get out of this book? After reading it  I didn't have the urge to see/read more from that world. I also didn't have any major feelings/reactions in me. It was all just meh....cool story.  


I haven't watched the TV show, and now have no desire to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mwquw6/i_recently_read_gaimans_american_gods/,2021-04-23 08:43:15,886,4048,books
oa7rjp,Neil Gaimans omission of Jesus in American Gods was so interesting.,"When 'American Gods' was first recommended to me, I was told it was a cultural war. The sides waging war being the idols we used to worship vs the idols we actually worship now. Maybe in an effort to save me from spoilers they never mentioned that the gods in question would be lesser known Gods. In my mind I thought that Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Chebbeniathan, and other prominent modern Gods would be the main characters warring against internet, and media. 


I was taken aback by the inclusion of much older lesser known Gods. I loved the native American and ancient tribal God segments. I never imagined Odin would play such a focal point in a story like this. I was blown away by my inability to see that the United States that I know is only a few hundred years old. Being that most of it's current citizens have relatively recent immigrated from somewhere else, the gods are foreign and far beyond my scope. So characters like Czernobog and Mr. Nancy were awesome. Midway through the book I accepted what I was reading and really enjoyed it.


It wasn't until the end where Gaiman addressed his omission of Jesus specifically. He said that it was because he didn't write a prominent role for him, and that only lightly including such a larger than life character wouldn't be the proper way to go about it. 


I'm curious what the rest of you think about it. I know that often what we say to explain our actions often veils intentions that we not only keep from others, but ourselves. He seems to be someone with a clear history of some denomination of Jesus based worship. 


Fear doesn't necessarily seem to be the right word I'd use. But speaking as someone who formally used to partake in Christian and catholic worship, publicly representing Jesus in a way that doesn't align with the Bible isn't something I don't mind seeing when tasteful. But it's definitely not something I'd do publicly or professionally myself. 


I loved the bit that he wrote for him visiting shadow on the tree. That whole vigil for Odin as well as shadow himself ran some not so subtle parallel with the crucifixion. 

Overall I thought the book was great, I'm sad to hear that the show had so many problems.






Edit: I thought this would be an interesting subject to talk about between a few people. Responding to some of the strong opinions is a bit much.

But to all of you saying that Jesus isn't a God, I agree with you that he is depicted as a prophet and the son of God. But you all need to convince the ""Jesus is Lord"" people. And Neil Gaiman himself considered adding him as one of the gods. AND apparently the show included him as a God. 


On top of all of that, one of the God's in the book is a leprechaun, so, there's that.

Wear boxing gloves please.



2nd Edit: I'm not a Bible thumper, I was hoping for a Jesus either jaded by American culture or radicalized by the mega churches. Maybe even a gun crazed Jesus. His character is not sacred to me personally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/oa7rjp/neil_gaimans_omission_of_jesus_in_american_gods/,2021-06-29 12:58:40,932,5433,books
14p45oh,American God's was a breath of fresh air.,I recently read American God's by Neil Gaiman and it was so refreshing!  I knew nothing about it going in and I was rewarded with a completely original tale.  I kept telling people how it was so weird in the best possible way.  It was casual in its outlandish statements and eventually you just end up going with it and accepting whatever the author is telling you.  The story meanders a bit taking its time to develop but to me that was part of its charm.  I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it! Has anyone else on here read the book?

9bfuvv,American Gods Discussion,"I can almost guarantee that I'm late to this party but I just finished American Gods. I personally thought it started off really well, but I think somewhere between Shadow's interaction with the Zorya sisters and his arrival in Lakeside I got a little bored and felt like it was dragging until the very end. I'm considering re-reading the book but in general, I was sort of hoping Shadow would end up being a reincarnation of one of the old gods in some sense, but they make no real mention of it (unless I was just skimming and missed it, I do that sometimes.)

lqshuv,Just finished “American Gods“ by Neil Gaiman,"This book is awesome although, I got a little discouraged or frustrated with the way it was written. Sentences never seemed to end and Gaiman kept on adding details over details but in a weird twist, I think this is also one of the books strongest aspects because the world felt that more real and the atmosphere definitely wouldn’t have been as captivating if it weren’t for those almost never ending descriptions. 
Another aspect that bothered me, is that not much had happened when I reached the halfway point. Come on man, throw me a frickin bone here. Weird dream sequence followed by weird conversations followed by new weird characters being introduced... I just wanted some answers...

AND OH BOY, the last two hundred or two hundred fifty pages are packed with satisfying answers, conclusions and reveals. I never thought that a book could make me go “Oh shit...” as things slowly started to unravel. Can we just talk about the reveal with what’s inside the car trunk?  Or how the narrator kept describing Shadows coin tricks, just later on to reveal that this whole war between gods has been some sort of coin trick played by Odin, I loved that!

I think, revelations like that saved the book in my opinion because the build-up did really pay off and I’m glad I kept reading till the end. 

As a side note I’m really proud of myself to have finished a book that long. I’m not the best reader and tend to be rather slow but finishing it gave me a little confidence boost and the courage to tackle other longer books.

Happy reading:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lqshuv/just_finished_american_gods_by_neil_gaiman/,2021-02-23 20:42:19,120,450,books
197lcsp,American Gods left me feeling different from nearly any novel I've ever read.,"I impulse-bought *American Gods* while visiting a bookstore a while back because I recognized the novel by name. I knew basically nothing about it other than knowing that Neil Gaiman is a well-known author (and I had read *Coraline* probably close to 17 years ago), so I figured I'd give it a shot.

I read the first 240ish pages over the course of a few weeks, and promptly forgot about reading it for nearly 2 months (while reading nothing else during this down time). The amount of world-building in that first 240 pages was staggering, with what felt like not a lot of plot progression. 

About a week and a half ago, I picked it back up, and read the entire rest of the novel including the epilogue and mini-novella between then and this last Sunday. I can't quite describe the draw this story had on me, because it wasn't the same as a ""can't put it down"" type of draw. It was grueling to read, but in a way that was fiendish and confounding.

It feels like the kind of novel I need to read again in order to fully grasp, but at the same time I basically want nothing to do with re-reading it. At least for the time being anyway. It was exhausting and left me feeling simultaneously empty and satisfied. 

The imagery and the prose were phenomenal, I liked the plotline as a whole but felt like it could have done more to tie in some of the odds and ends (the Ifrit cab driver comes to mind) to the rest of the novel. 

I'll certainly make an effort to read more Gaiman, as I've seen praise for his work from people who both enjoyed and disliked *American Gods*. I've simply never felt like this upon finishing a novel and I feel like it's going to take me another couple of weeks to fully integrate the enjoyable clusterfuck of an experience I just went through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/197lcsp/american_gods_left_me_feeling_different_from/,2024-01-15 22:01:00,49,218,books

103robo,American Gods by Neil Gaiman," Yesterday, I finished the “American Gods” by Neil Gaiman. I love the book but still there are some parts that I didn’t get, so I got on the internet to check for some reviews, explanations and others’ opinion. And to my surprise, I found that a lot of people dislike the book, especially the ending and Lakeside part.

For me, I really like this book. At first the characters don’t attract me, but later I found out that I feel a lot for them.

>""You're not dead,"" she said. ""But I'm not sure that you're alive, either. Not really.""

This part when Laura was having a conversation with Shadow and later compared him to Robbie, it hurt him and also hurt me a lot. This conversation helped me understand much more about Shadow as a human. And it also made me realize that I do actually care for the characters and I just didn’t know it.

For the ending, I find that many people hate it because of how disappointed it is. And this is something I can understand, although I love this ending. I think the main reason I love this ending is that I am used to books that have unexpected ending with the build-up climax to actually crumble at the end and subvert my expectation (“House of Chains” by Steven Erikson came to my mind). It also maybe because I kind of predicted this ending the moment Shadow met Low Key/Loki, and was 90% sure when Mr. Town confirmed that Mr. World is Loki. Beside I think Neil Gaiman gave out many hints during the book that lead to this ending.

On the other note, I really enjoy some (philosophical?) passages in the book, especially the “There was a girl, and her uncle sold her” opening. I love that whole page/part of the book. Also the sentence “Outside the wind howled and wailed as if it, too, was seeking a lost child” hit me really hard and it still stuck with me till the end of the book.

For the downside, I did feel a little bit frustrated when I read this book. And the main reason is that I don’t know much about mythology and America culture. This made me always feels like I missed something about the Gods, the culture, the music reference, … It’s why I had to get on the internet to check for reviews, explanation,... for I felt like there are some part of the book that I didn’t get.

To sum it up, I like this book, I like the characters, I love the ending, I love the traveling around, meeting new people and exploring new places… But still I feel like I missed something due to my ignorance in mythology and America culture.

Finally, I had a question that I’ve been wondering since I was half way through the book. Why did Wednesday swear in Christian like “Christ” or “Jesus”? This always weird me out, did he simply do it because he was affected by the modern way of talking in America?

hm054j,American Gods by Neil Gaiman was woefully underwhelming.,"I was looking forward to this book as I’ve been a fan of Gaiman’s intellectual writing and imagination.  However, I found American Gods to be very underwhelming. 

Was I missing some underlying meaning or figurative language that was meant to evolve the piece that I didn’t understand?  The novel built up a unique view of old gods and new gods and aspects of Norse mythology that I found intriguing, but I felt as though the storyline never truly evolved.  

Shadow was a character that seemed rather devoid of significant development, and as a reader it was difficult to connect with him. I almost connected with Laura’s character more than his. His bloodline and Wednesday’s betrayal was predictable to me and the major war that was epitomized throughout the book just fizzled without any real detail.

136shf8,"""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman. (Repost)","Several days ago I finally got to reading Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" and as of today I have finished it. And I am here to tell you now that this book did not disappoint.

Shadow, an ex-con who was released from prison just days after his wife and friend had died in an accident. Soon he would find himself employed by a strange, enigmatic man and trickster named simply as Mr. Wednesday, and acts as his bodyguard, driver and errand boy.

Soon Shadow is taken on a road trip with his employer that introduces him to other eccentric characters whose own lives seem to be entwined with his in a mysterious way. What Shadow doesn't realize is that underneath the surface of everyday life a storm is coming. A war for the very soul of America itself. And Shadow is directly in it's path.

This is one of Gaiman's best known novels in his repertoire and also most talked about. The story combines fantasy with horror, mythology and a little bit of sci-fi as well. Plenty of twists and turns that can take you by surprise as you go along and right up to the end.

I've been very glad to have read this and also the two collections of the author's short fiction. I never read anything by  Neil Gaiman for much of my life but now that I have, I came to really appreciate him. Wonderful writer!

One last thing: I do believe ""American Gods"" has been adapted into a series that began in 2017.

4vzkxn,Why I Dropped American Gods,"There are some spoilers here, though not too much, as I never finished the book.

So I have been listening to the tenth anniversary edition of American Gods, by Neil Gaiman, which, from what the introduction had stated was the extended and uncut edition, and it had a full cast. I listened to about 8 hours out of 19 hours and 40 minutes, on chapter 8 of 24. I picked it up, because I had an unused credit, and the show was coming, not to mention I heard a lot of good things about it, and was interested by the premise. So I decided to give it listen.

I have buyer's remorse.

I'm going to tell the exact reason I dropped it. All throughout the story, the main character, Shadow, has met Odin and several other gods, met with several of them in a magical hall which they got by riding on the world's largest carousel, meet 4 of the American gods, talking to one of them through the T.V. and is being watched over by his undead wife, who he talked to a couple of times, and killed for him. Yet despite all of that, this guy was amazed, *amazed*, that a man that had directly told he was a leprechaun, who had died, and was attending his own wake somehow, was pulling gold coins out of thin air.

What?

That's what he was awestruck by?! Are you kidding me?! That was my problem with the book. I was never struck by this sense of awe, I don't even think there was any. 

Let me talk about the main character, Shadow. I don't like him, I find him annoying. Did prison take away his emotions? His sense of wonder and awe? This guy was meeting old gods who were living amongst us, and he's like 'yeah, that's cool.' His wife is dead? Sucks. She was having a 'not' affair with his best friend? She explained herself, so it's cool. He just had dream sex with a cat person thing? Neat, his wounds are healed.

Jesus Christ, I don't even think I heard the guy change his tone, though I don't know if that's the narrative's fault, or the voice actor's. Even then, I hate how he's just taking everything in stride, and, like the reason I stated in why I dropped the book, hated how he dismissed that things the gods do, especially with coins, as nothin more than parlor tricks. Like the silver dollar a Russian goddess gave him, it wasn't really the moon at one point, that be *silly.* It's annoying. Also, it is super obvious about his demigod nature. No dad, silver eyes, unknown heritage, all probably going to lead up to some 'I'm your father reveal.' I somehow doubt it would be all that surprising.

The gods were incredibly underwhelming and odd. I never would have pictured Odin, war god, granter of berserker rage, who trading his eye for knowledge of everything ever, being a con artist and hustler, or charm women into bed. I would expected this from Zeus, but I wouldn't have guessed Odin, I was willing to forgive that, thinking there was something I didn't know about Odin. There was the problem of the gods never seeming godly, which seemed like part of the point. That even gods can be beaten and weathered by the world. However, if you never told me these sulking, old people were gods, I never would have guessed. Magical and old, sure, but not the gods people worshiped in the thousands years.

Then there are the American gods. In all that time I spent listening, I only know four. Two of which I have no idea what they do, except... Represent government types, I suppose? I don't know anything about these new gods. I don't know who they are, how many of them there are, or what they do, how they came to be, anything. Am I suppose to be against them? Just because the first three were dicks to Shadow, who they knew was under the employ of Odin, their enemy? Why should I be against these gods?

I didn't like how the book constantly use the term 'there's a storm coming.' They say that, yet there never seems to be a sense of urgency. Nobody looks to be in any hurry, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, nobody. Where I stopped, they still say that phrase, and yet, Shadow is working in a funeral parlor. Then there's the times characters just... Ramble. Rambling on about how things are in America.

This is the book I'm reading? This is the award winning, praised book? A book without any awe, without wonder, that seems to me drab and colorless? I haven't felt this way about a book before. I, myself, am befuddled by this book that seems disinterested by its own premise.

I think that is the million dollar word. Disinterested. Shadow is disinterested, the gods, old and American, are disinterested, the setting is disinterested. Listening to this book just felt tiring. After that one point, I couldn't continue reading.

I do not like Neil Gaiman's American Gods. That is my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4vzkxn/why_i_dropped_american_gods/,2016-08-03 17:09:23,78,26,books
5xvt0r,American Gods by Neil Gaiman (No SPOILERS),"Finished reading this and I don't know what to say. This book was a journey; felt like it took me through actual places. There's a lot that's going on here. The whole old gods vs. new gods is a very deep and strong plot to begin with.

hafhd,"Just read ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman, anyone else have an opinion on it?","I would say that my favorite aspect of the book was cast.  There was something magical about seeing all these different incarnations of Gods and Heroes.  I loved when the characters would meet a new ""God"" and their story would be revealed.

That being said, I was not blown away by this book.  It felt more like I was reading a comic book without the pictures than an actual novel.  I never really identified with the main character, and it seems like a lot of the plot was left unexplained.  The climax was particularly disappointing to me.

It came highly recommended by some friends, and it was very entertaining to me.  It was also a very easy read.  I would give it a middle of the road rating and recommend it for anyone looking for a quick and fun read.

9xkbdi,"In Neil Gaiman's American Gods, who is the man no one can remember?","I recently finished American Gods and the most intriguing character was the man with whom several characters interact, but no one can remember.  I am referring to the character who  Wednesday visits in Las Vegas.  He is a minor side character, but his enigmatic nature and how he affects the narrative in a sort of self-referential way make him stand out. 

One of my favorite parts of the book takes place in Vegas. Wednesday and this man have a discussion. The discussion and how it goes is described, but the characters' dialogue is itself absent.  This man gives a speech elsewhere in the book and, again, how he speaks and how others react to his speech are described, but not what he says. 

Others of the gods are named or are identifiable, except him.  Who or what does he represent? Chance? Did Gaiman mean for him to be enigmatic not just for the other characters, but also for the reader?

lehjmb,American Gods kind of... boob focussed?,"I’m reading Neil Gaiman’s American Gods due to a bunch of recommendations, many from here! I’m not really a fantasy reader but was keen to give it a go... but am 150 pages in and am really put off by female characters constantly being described by their breasts? Without having the book in front of me, I would say this has happened for at least four female characters. Something about cheese and goosebumps immediately comes to mind. This combined with a real lack of developed female characters is kind of putting me off.

jcbxn1,Finished American Gods in conjunction with starting The Bible,"\- I finished American Gods this morning after reading Genesis and Exodus this past week, and I was surprised to find it seemed to...bridge... the books I have been reading, with thoughts (questions) I have had these last several weeks. I have began somewhat of a spiritual journey between religion and nature, and desired to begin the holy books, and books of wisdom, starting with the Bible. By chance, I had started American Gods some time ago, and just got around to finishing it. And, I am glad I have read these books in the order that I did.

\-Neil Gaiman has known passions rooted in Norse mythology, of which I know really nothing about save that which I have observed in the Marvel movies. Don't pretend like some of you aren't in that boat with me. I see you. So, it was no surprise to see Odin, the All-Father, play a prominent role in the story. What was a surprise were the stark similarities between what plays out in the book, and the Hebrew/Christian stories. And, this makes me wonder even further if most religions have more or less the same belief systems, wrapped up in different characters and with the narratives tweaked a bit here or there. Blood sacrifice to cover sin, or to overcome death is brought up, especially so with Shadow turning out to be a son of Odin. Shadow hangs from a wooden altar (tree vs. cross) and has his side pierced like Christ. There is the old good versus evil, and even brings up Resurrection (Laura). I know this is the American Gods story, and maybe not the legends of the Norse, but is Gaiman positing this scene for an American audience? Or to show parrallels in the Norse and Christian legends? I found that interesting, and another reason I want to go through all of the holy books.

\- This book was a  stunningly wonderful read, vivid with imagery of the American landscape, sidebar often heartbreaking stories of the old gods introduction to America (oh my god the African slave scene, ugh), and a page turning central narrative. Often, it made me wonder how God, or the gods, exist outside our scope today. Gaiman is magnificent in explaining how these gods fade, and become decrepit, as belief is lost and faith collapses. I really found this a profound idea thinking even about our own history. I could shamefully not name a god of the Native American cultures, and yet they once ruled over these lands. Most could tell you SOME of the main stories from the Qu'ran or the Bible, and yet even the lessons from those books are often lost in the new age. That's fascinating. And, kind of sad, as when the gods, and the myths, and the legends, and the magic disappear...the world loses its mystery and becomes quite ordinary in my eyes.

\-I do a lot of fishing and am an amateur naturalist. So, I appreciate and often find sacred many environments I trudge through and explore. I also am military which has afforded me the opportunity to travel many lands, and know many countries have their own sacred altars to both the gods and nature. In Greece, I looked out over the Aegean sea engulfed by craggy bluffs, and I could almost witness Poseidon rising from its depths to sink the Persian fleet, and to aid the Athenians. Or in Japan, wandering the tombs and temples, quiet as death, but calmed by the peaceful prayers, lanterns, candles and incense maintained by mourners and believers. There is a connection with our gods that make us distinctly....us.  I really thought Gaiman did an outstanding job bringing some of those far away gods to life in this book. 

\- As the rain trickles down the window to the second floor balcony of my apartment, I'll say this. I want faith. I want to believe. Gaiman says faith is like a cup of soma to the Gods, and every drop of it strengthens them. Through Mr. Ibis, acting as the boatman in the underworld to Shadow, we learn that even when we don't believe in them, they believe in us. With the way our situations in the current world are unfolding, maybe we could use some faith in God or the old gods. The new gods- Media, Technology, etc.- often bring me nothing but distraction, lust, want, propaganda, and so forth. Read the holy books, all of them. This isn't a strictly Christian advertisement. Believe again. I want this world to become colorful once more. 

\-Oh, and Fuck Wednesday! Odin and Loki are awful (yet really creative gods). Good luck trying not to picture Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston as their characters. Don't even fucking pretend, some of you out there. You are in the same boat as me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jcbxn1/finished_american_gods_in_conjunction_with/,2020-10-16 15:31:28,36,24,books

dmsgju,I don't like american gods,"God this book sucks. I heard so many good things about it and Neil Gaiman and so decided to read it. No matter how mind-numbingly boring it got I held on trying to finish the book because so many people liked it there had to be something of value. But no, the story is about as dull as it can get Our main character is a nothing character. You can't even say he's a flat character, he is a block of wood with the ability to be where the important stuff happens. He gives no shits about anything. He's not an interesting character on the inside or out. He works for literal gods and his reaction is nothing more than the barest an acknowledgment that it is happening. His reaction is akin to finding out your fish is a different species than you thought. Sure, that's nice to know but who really cares. I'm not asking for an psycological breakdown just be a little bit interested, ask a few questions at the very least. And there is nothing interesting about the gods. the point of the story is that the gods from all the mythologies exist. Wow, that's cool, how does this affect the world in any significant way. Can we look forward to something interesting about them like lives that are even the slightest bit different from your average human? NO. They are all just depressed people. Odin is basically just a scam artist. Nothing else not even incorporating the mythology, like making him need to know stuff which was an important part of him in Norse culture. No, just some scam artist dude. The book has nothing compelling about it. The main character does not want anything. Even finding out his wife cheated on him elicits like a, I felt bad for a bit, then it was immediately cleared up, wow so much for that subplot. The gods are unlikeable to with Odin robbing people but not in a fun anti-hero way and sleeps with underage women. Then the twist at the end is treated like a big surprise. Nothing even happens for half the book.-Shadow gets hired, Loki is recruited, Shadow is kidnapped and ends up in a frozen wasteland which he easily escapes. Also, the story makes no sense. Odin and Kali and Loki are all gods of things like violence wisdom and trickery. There is no reason they should be weak because people still are violent, tricky and smart. Sure they aren't worshiped but neither is TV, people just use it a lot so they shouldn't be weak. There would just be more gods.

amip37,Finished 'American Gods' This Morning,"I decided to read this one because it is often mentioned here and this has lead me to many great reads I would not have picked up elsewise. Again r/books didn't lead me down. I do know there is a TV show to this, but I haven't seen it (and I am not so keen to do that as I read that it will have five seasons which is a far stretch for a mid-length book). American Gods was a really interesting read. The idea that beliefs of people take shape and wander through the world (and conning people) was a first time for me. This brings a lot of depth and fantasy to immigrant societies. Especially the notion that America has been 'Grand Central Station' for thousands of years was unheard of for this European reader. Lastly I must admit that I really could identify with Shadow as he was such a calm and strong character even in the most spectacular situations. In my edition there was an included short story named ""The Monarch of The Glenn"" which I greatly enjoyed as it played in Scotland, which I have visited myself a few years ago. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly to anyone interested in culture, migration and mythology. Is there a sequel to this?

dhjeow,American Gods... Did I miss something? (Spoiler),"Based off some comments on here I picked this book up and read it over vacation; finishing it today. Overall, the book was good but I was left scratching my head about two segments that seem pointless. To preface my question, I did buy the 10th Anniversary Edition by mistake not realizing it was extended. My thought is maybe these are from that extension but maybe I missed something.

First segment I dont get is the female diety that consumes the man with her vagina while he ""worships"" her. I am assuming this is the same woman that was killed by the Fat Kid after he picks her up off the street but I dont understand what the purpose of this segment is. I dont feel it adds anything or ties into the story well at all.

The second segment is the Trinket salesman from the middle east that meets the taxi driving Ifrit. I understand that they switch places after having intercourse and spending time together so the man can escape his brother in law but what is its place in the story? Is it really just to add the sentence about the taxi driver being killed by falling scaffolding? 

It feels like a decent chunk of real estate in the book is given to these two segments for them to feel out of place. I fail to see what they add to the overall story. All the other little side stories and tidbits fit in and are laborously if not beautifully tied back in. These two feel out of place though; am I missing something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dhjeow/american_gods_did_i_miss_something_spoiler/,2019-10-14 01:08:50,31,28,books

95s8qe,So I finally finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman,"Hey y'all,

So a little bit of background for this novel, recently I got into literature and by far the man who did it for me was Neil Gaiman. After I finished The Graveyard Book, I wanted more!! I picked up American Gods at my local Barnes and Noble with excitement but only read about 2-3 chapters. It wasn't grabbing me as much as The Graveyard Book and then I went to serve an LDS mission in Mexico. I came back and I decided to read it again from the beginning. WOW, just absolutely wow!! This is book was amazing. I just love how vivid Gaiman paints an image and I'd never image a ""war among Gods"" could be so exciting. Plus I never really studied Norse Mythology so it was pretty cool to see Gaiman really play with these character in the modern day.  I adored the book for how addicting it was, normally I read a book for maybe a chapter or two and I put it down no problem. Here wasn't the case, it felt like it hurt if I stopped reading, something in the back of my mind kept saying ""I GOTTA READ MORE!"" And the ending, oh my goodness, no spoilers here but I want to know, is it normal if a story or book's ending hurts you? Like, I felt sad when I finished the story. I'm going to revisit it next year but legit I felt like I finished a journey and was saying goodbye to all the characters I met.

I guess this is just me, now I got a stack of Gaiman books in my personal library. I have Norse Mythology, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere and Good Omens. I'm probably going to read Norse Mythology next since I'm on a Norse high (if that makes any sense). And I can't wait for him to come visit SLC in November! And I'm probably going to watch the Star Series adaptation since Gaiman himself wrote a few episodes.

c8zod9,Recently completed 'American Gods' by Niel Gaiman,"It was an interesting read. I'm not really sure how to put into words what I felt about it. It was good, I think. I did have some trouble following what was going on re:travelling since I haven't been in the US before, so I have no frame of reference for where the states and towns are. I think it took me getting about halfway through the book before I really started enjoying it. The Gods seem very real, at least in the sense that they couldnhave arisen from real myths, so I think they were well researched. I can't speak to their accuracy but they did seem to follow this strange mash of theming and mundane humanity, which I liked. Added to the feeling of the states being a ""bad land for Gods"" like they were weakened and just trying to get by.

The points where Shadow is proactive were my favourite, since for most of the story he was kinda just following along, which was his arc I suppose. Even Laura drew attention to it, which inspires him to change. I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing. I think the book on the whole is well-written, and it feels almost sacrilegious to try and 'rate' it. I can't say it's the best ever, but it almost feels like history, so it exists outside the bounds of regular rating.

* I did not like Shadow's arc at all. I mean he is not bad I just feel like he lacked character development in a HUGE book. From beginning to end, there was only little difference.
* I was almost halfway through this huge book and I still have no idea what is Shadow's journey about. I know these mysteries are really good tools to make reader hold on to books but this time it took too long to reveal things that it bored you out to not too care anymore.
* Ok, it was really a long time before they revealed major stuffs maybe it will really have big things in the end that will compensate for it. But again, I was wrong. I really think all that build up did not hold up.

7dle94,I just finally read American Gods. Thoughts on it.,"I just finally got around to reading American Gods after having it recommended to me numerous times.  There were things I liked about it and things I didn't.  Overall it was middle of the road for me.  

One thing I loved about it was the originality of it.  I've never read anything like it, and I definitely didn't find it forgettable.  I really enjoyed how the story did end up playing out.  I liked the lore of the gods and the stories of how they all came to America.  I liked the surrealism around it.  Some of the writing was pretty clever too and I enjoyed it. 

Now, that being said there's a lot I didn't love about it.  That exposition.  Woof.  I thought that it was rough to get through.  I don't know if I'd call the pacing slow or confusing.  There were numerous times during the first 350 pages where I thought the story would finally arrive at a climax and things would get rolling.  And then the next chapter it would go back to Shadow not really doing much and meeting a bunch of new people.  The story felt like ""meet the characters"" during that time, and a lot of them, I didn't feel had much of a point.  

The way women were written was pretty flat.  The way sex and relationships were written seemed a bit strange to me, but a lot of these characters clearly had mental issues.  So maybe that was intentional. 

I didn't understand the motivations of some characters either.  Shadow at the beginning seemed numb and apathetic to everything going on around him.  He seemed depressed/stuck and like he really didn't care about much else besides surviving.  I didn't understand where the switch happened to him becoming invested to the point where he would [Spoilers about American Gods] (#s ""sacrifice himself for Wednesday rather than taking an easy way out offered to him by Media."")

I thought it should've been edited a bit different too.  At some points I didn't understand why some pieces of information were being revealed when they were when they didn't have any context yet.  For example, about 20 pages or so we're introduced to a scene where [Spoilers about American Gods] (#s ""a woman eats a man with her vagina"").  That left me with a sense of ""WTF was that"". 
 And then she isn't even mentioned again until page 350 or so and is [Spoilers about American Gods] (#s  ""killed off immediately and unimportant to the story"").   Some of the ""Coming to America"" stories felt this way to me too.  They were at an odd place in the book that would've made sense if they were put in later on.  But maybe that's just a preference of mine. 

Overall I enjoyed it, but the first 3/4 of the book were hard to crawl through.  I thought the pacing was off and some of the character's motives didn't make sense, but were changed for convenience for the overall story.

bgpip2,Did any other readers hate the American Gods TV show?,"My apologies if this doesn't belong here but I am a long time Gaiman fan and finally tried to watch the American Gods show and couldn't get past the first fifteen minutes.

Now I love that Gaiman never just puts his writen work on the screen. It is is always an adaptation and I think that's great but American Gods was just so different in every way from the book I read and envisioned in my brain. I mean the story seemed to be their (from what I saw) but everything else was wrong. The colors, the texture, the tone. I guess I wanted something that looked and felt like Game of Thrones with a more dirty feel and muted realism, where a god just happens to pop up every now and then. Instead I got Brian Fuller does the Marvel universe with bright colours and silly violence. And, to be fair, these are not things I'm opposed to but it just doesn't feel like American Gods.

la2gz3,How is American Gods high-rated? (no spoilers related to the storyline),"I started American Gods a week ago and was excited to begin this journey. I’m an avid reader of Fantasy/Sci-Fi (of course favorites include A Song of Ice and Fire, Dune, The Witcher, The Lord of the Rings etc.) and I must say, AG was an utter DISAPPOINTMENT. 

I have NEVER left a book half-finished, nor have I struggled to get myself to read. But this book accomplished that. Now, I believe I realized why *I* hate AG:

Firstly, the language is very colloquial and vulgar. *hear me out*: I enjoy informal writing and lewd jokes such as GRRM’s work. However, a fantasy novel, no matter how “contemporary” requires a bit of sophistication and a sense archaism. Frank Herbert accomplishes this perfectly by embedding philosophical ideas and interpretations into the character’s dialogues. Similarly GRRM uses a more contemporary vocabulary to emphasize relevant political ideas not only to the people of Westeros, but the real world as well.

Secondly, THE CHARACTERS ARE SHALLOW AF. I have never seen a attempting-to-be a fantasy novel where the characters have only a single determining characteristic that doesn’t change. *Dude sees his dead wife? Ok. No problem. He accepts that she’s a zombie* This nonchalant attitude from the protagonist is horrible and makes the whole narrative irrelevant and monotone. 

Thirdly, I am not a fan of long descriptions, but HOLY S**T YOU COULD AT LEAST VERBALLY DEPICT THE SURROUNDINGS. This happens throughout the whole book. A person literally *sees the GODS* and it is described in the same manner as someone taking a sh*t. Moreover, when attempting to write about the character’s psychology Gaiman sounds like robot programmed to utter 3 words: “happy”, “sad”, “scared”.

I apologize for the lengthy post, you can sense my anger building up :))",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/la2gz3/how_is_american_gods_highrated_no_spoilers/,2021-02-01 12:58:04,28,1,books
5mgwnw,So what's the deal with American Gods?,"American Gods is one of only 2 books that I found so uninteresting I had  to put down halfway through to move on to another book.

Other people however seem to love this book. It's won awards, and everyone I talk to it about seem to love it. But why?

It seems like nothing happens. The plot (I read up to part 3 and ""finished"" the rest on Wikipedia), seems pointless. ""Hey shadow, help me recruit old gods to fight the new, cause your wife is dead and you have nothing better to do. We need to fight the new gods for some reason."" And from there, nothing happens, they dick around talking to some gods, Shadow lives in a funeral parlour and then a small town (for far to long, nothing fucking happens in the town), and then shadow dies, comes back and stops the war (which as far as I could tell had to reason to occur), by just telling everyone its pointless.

This isn't even mentioning the pointless side stories, of random gods that never seem to go any where, or add anything. 

So whats the deal about this novel, do I just not ""get"" it, or did I completely miss what made it good by giving up before it got interesting?

ml5axg,I just finished American Gods and it was amazing.,"I will admit, reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman took a lot longer than I would've liked. I usually rip through books in the span of days, sometimes day, singular, but starting up the book felt very hard. I initially picked it up as a way to help assuage some of that Covid listlessness, but never really sat down and read it because of the aforementioned reason. I finally started it and was amazed by how much time it made me take to consider what the implications were in-book when certain events happened. My favorite piece of the book is the fact that the ending is hinted at throughout the book, almost directly, and you don't realize it fully until you re-read it. And some pieces truly describes America at its finest, which I appreciate, being an American myself. But even if you are not American or have no real connection to it, this book is still a great read, as it goes into the depths of gods, deities, and why they're there. Sometimes the book feels like a religious experience, all because it's going so deep into the theory of why.

So short story short; it's a great book and you'll find that Neil Gaimen is a god at writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ml5axg/i_just_finished_american_gods_and_it_was_amazing/,2021-04-06 06:27:26,12,32,books

ah6wma,All the Old Gods mentioned in American Gods,"Hello folks,
I have just finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman and frankly, I did not enjoy it as much as I hope. The storyline is good, Gaiman's writing is brilliant but the plot can be slow and plodding at times, especially all the odd occurrences that seem come out of nowhere while the ending does not live up to the build. 
But that's not the point of this post. One of the main reason kept me reading till the end was all the odd references to the old gods mentioned in the book (especially at the battle in the Backstage near the end). I did some research online but most of them only explain the origins of the main characters (Odin, Ibis, Nancy, Czernobog etc) and I want to know about the minor ones too.
I would appreciate if someone could explain even some of them to me or point me to a source which I can look them up.

6ypucj,American Gods - Like/dislike? (Spoilers),"I don't know how I feel about this book since finishing it. It started great and built up great (except Lakeside. I found that part tremendously boring and of no use to the plot, other than Sam, Hinzelmaan, and the cop.) 

Going into the third act was amazing. Wednesday dying was unexpected and quite epic. Then the build-up to follow was also inticing. Shadow dying, going through the underworld, then coming back and the twist with Laura coming back to kill herself and Mr. World were all great points. Also, when you found out Shadow is Baldur, that was great although a little predictable. However, then we got to THE BATTLE... the epic bloodbath to be for the whole novel. Which Gods were going to come out? Please be Anansi and Czernobog! Then, it literally didn't happen. There was a peaceful ending. It was realistic, but quite possibly one of, if not the, absolute worst ending I have ever read. Especially for a book that was so enthralling up to that point. 

I'll read the sequel, because I expect it to build on what was left off, but seriously? 

Tell me I'm not the only one who hated it.

In the book the whole concept is that gods are powerful only when people believe in them and gods that are forgotten become weak and die off. 

So since Jesus is actively worshipped by billions wouldn’t he be absurdly powerful in this story? Far beyond Odin or anyone else? Why is he a lonely hitchhiker?

8qxub9,"(spoilers kind of) ""American gods"" by Neil gaiman discussion. I didn't love this book","It was one of those books I almost couldn't stand the entire time I was reading it until the very end and then I begrudgingly liked it. I am so conflicted about how I felt. I also felt like maybe somehow Neil gaiman was  much smarter and more sly then me, like he was writing about something I just didn't really get or see. And I am a decently intelligent guy for the most part with some basic tenuous grasp of mythology.


Almost the entire book I kept wondering... What the hell is really going on and when is it... Or anything at all... going to happen? Or is a whole lot happening and I am just completely missing it? 


Furthermore even when things did happen it felt like nothing really happened? That's hard to explain but there was no gravitas to certain events. Even when there was there wasn't. Until the end where it wrapped it up pretty neatly I suppose. 



His writing style also irked me a bit. It was very plain with brief moments of beauty in it here and there. But for the most part I felt it lacking depth and warmth, wit and and sardonicism. The writing almost never seemed to fully enrapture me or make me wallow in empathy save just a few brief moments. 



I always love mythology and especially mythology personified, so that genre is something I love. I felt like there were moments where I was getting strong jitterbug perfume vibes (it's an old trope I know) where the gods sustain themselves on belief and I loved how that was brought about into American culture where the new gods are commandeering all of the prayer, rendering the old gods feeling worthless. Their attempts to stay relevant and noteworthy are somewhat tragic and of concern. I like that concept so much to be honest, I just felt I was completely missing a really good writers perspective on it, like Tom Robbins makes you almost jump with a certain excitement in his sentences. They are an artforms in and of itself. Even Bill Bryson can talk about the most boring American towns in such a way that it makes me almost want to go there. Yet Neil gaiman just... Didn't. 

The ending was very good though, and made me glad I made it though the book. I could definitely never recommend this book to anyone... Yet, it won the nebula and Hugo awards and is considered a modern masterpiece, but I don't know anyone who would actually enjoy such a long slog.

1qrq0i,"Just read American Gods, have some questions","1. What were the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim gods up to during this whole affair? It's said that American Jesus was hitchhiking across Afghanistan, but there should be some legitimately powerful incarnations of popular gods hanging about, and they must have known what was going down between the old and new ones. Even if the millions of Christians, Muslims, and Jews each day were only paying lip service to their deities - and instead funneling most of their power to the new media gods - Easter proves that even that lip service sends some juice through the religious wires.

2. How powerful would Odin have become if the sacrifice worked? It wasn't really clear why this plan needed to be stopped in the first place. He and Loki stay teamed up and start creating world wars in his name? Odin grows to the size of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and starts razing cities? 

3. Does Shadow become a god because other gods believed in him?

gcy6be,"[SPOILER] Interpretation of the novel ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman","The novel “American gods” is masterpiece work by Neil Gaiman, he has very beautifully “assembled” and crafted a storyline with intricate climax and simpler conclusion in the end.He has handpicked characters from various worldwide myths and folklore and has also given them in his novel specific role, character and even jobs suited to them for eg Ibis owns a funeral parlor and Hinzelmann is a “Kobold” of the Lakeside, these tasks are similar in nature to what these gods does in myths and folklore.

But the story is not what it apparently seems there are two ways how I decipher the plot:

1. The story is not just that of Shadow moon rather of today's people who are so immerged in materialistic world that they don't have time or a thought to spare for spiritualism and when one suffers some personal loss( like death as Shadow Suffers the death of his wife for example) People tend to seek refuse in spiritualism. However due to “lack of spiritual quotient” people find their heart torn in between material world and spiritual world - as if a war is ongoing.

So Shadow is a convicted felon on the verge of release, his life’s sole love and aim is his wife.But misfortune struck and his wife as well as friend on whom he was counting for job upon his subsequent release from jail, are dead. Shadow sees his whole world crumble down, so he is devastated. He befriends a stranger- a God who tells him “ not to ask questions but to follow as He says”. God becomes his co- traveller as He drives around the country. He feels he is driving as per Odin the god’s instructions but it is he himself who aimless and devastated from within loiter from one part of the country to other, doing odd jobs such as working in funeral parlour. Shadow has resigned from the world and he hides himself in a small town of Lakeside with clear instruction form the Odin “ stay low and stay out of any trouble”.Shadow receives this instructions from Odin over a phone in his room which in reality was a disconnected phone line. Shadow learns that a war is about to come between new gods and old gods.This war is nothing else but war within his soul - war between physical materialistic world having components such as Gluttony,lust,name,fame etc against spiritualism,beliefs, ethics etc. So he undergoes some sort of self penance “ symbolised” by Shadow being tied to tree. Finally he is awaken, he stops the war which was shearing him. He now understands “ we just keep going anyhow,its what we do” , “....rock- solid belief that makes things happen”. So he moves on and let go of his “dead wife”. He goes to Iceland - land of his mother and again meets Odin who unlike the previous one met is not a trickster. These two different versions of God of opposite nature actually shows the state of his mind which was earlier confused,conflicting but now calmer and clear.

Coming to Laura- Shadow’s wife. Shadow's only love and entire life revolved around Laura so much that it he even commits bank robbery and goes to prison for her but never reveals her name to police. He spends his time in prison dreaming of her.But she betrays him and die tragically in an accident. But Shadow can't digest this fact that she is gone.He was her “puppy”, her pet. So Shadow starts seeing her as revenant.She is alive for him, whenever he finds himself in some problems she appears and helps and redeem him. But he doesn't stays with her because deep down he has not forgiven her for cheating him with Robbie. Shadow “thinks” it's Laura who is protecting him from Mr Stone, Mr Wood and finally Laura kills Mr world too.

feq9sn,American Gods... a super brief review of my first Neil Gaiman novel,"I recently posted [this review to Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3184745218). I wanted it to be spoiler-free while communicating something of my enjoyment of the book along with my reservations (but still a 4-star read in my opinion).

American Gods is an odd book that grabbed me in places and pushed me away in others. It came across to me as a mythic story built around an extended episode of *Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives* that went horribly wrong. In places, that mythic story is brilliant, yet Gaiman remains fixated on the seediness of American beliefs, customs, and history to a degree that I sometimes felt detracted from the story. Reading the novel was like eating at Waffle House.

94puf2,"Just finished American Gods and I don't like it. At all (maybe mostly my fault, but still) [Spoilers!]","Heard a lot about this book and thought I'd check it out.  I'm not familiar with Gaiman's Sandman series, but knew of them so this was the first thing of his that I've ever actually read.  I don't know if he was drawing inspiration from Sandman, but I found the book odd in a lot of ways, and unexpected in bad ways.  

I'll be blunt, I had some expectations of this book.  I knew the gist of it was about the old pagan gods coming into conflict with the modern world and our new gods.  That was the hook that drew me in.  People may laugh, but I was expecting it to be a little more *comic book-y*, given the author.  Like overt manifestations of gods in odd getups using powers fitting for their mythologies.  But what I got was a boring travel story where most fights were offscreen and anything magical was only hinted at.  I expected Odin to ride into battle on Sleipnir with his 6 legs, spearing Buddha in his stomach while Thor hurled lightning bolts from his hammer.  I expected Shiva to charge into the fray with a thousand palms of death, slapping aside cross-shaped swords flying in from a mountain-sized Jesus.  Even when I was way into the book and knew this was not that kind of story, I at least expected the magic to happen like in Lord of the Rings, where Gandalf can breath light into a staff to shine his way through Moria, or hobbits were described as having a kind of natural magic that lets them hide among the large folks.  But gods died from bullets, one was ran over by a car, another stabbed.  I was really disappointed with how this whole conflict turned out.  

That was my general impression of the book, the atmosphere was completely off from my expectations.  But I can still enjoy something if the plot is well paced and interesting, but this book lacked that as well.  In fact, it is sooooooo slow, it took like 100 pages for it to even get to any other gods.  The first quarter of the book was just two guys driving and talking, with one guy not saying much and the other guy not really that interesting to begin with.  Then we spend about 200 pages where Odin just tells Shadow to accompany him everywhere while he recruits other gods, before anything really substantial happen and Odin finally gets shot and dies and the plot finally kicks into gear.

When I said that this book seems to take too much inspiration from Sandman, I mean that the writing tries to create this almost dream-like quality to the narrative.  Things happen and stop happening without acknowledgement from the characters, like a dream where you move from one thing to another without really knowing why or how.  *There's no solid transition.*  This scene jump also makes characters say things they really have no business knowing because it was never established that they're supposed to know it.  Where's my Chekhov's Gun?  Why should I accept that a character can do this if this was never set up?  I'll give a specific example of this type of writing:

When Mad Sweeney dies, somehow, because Shadow got his special gold coin, they find him dead in town.  After he's picked up by Shadow in the hearse, the 3 men in the funeral parlor talk about him over dinner, sharing stories.  This is ONLY the 3 men sharing stories, that's the physical scene.  Then you have this: 

> ""All this and more Mr. Ibis told them in the kitchen that night.  His shadow on the wall was stretched and birdlike, and as the whiskey flowed Shadow imagined it the head of a huge waterfowl, beak long and curved, and it was somewhere in the middle of the second glass that Mad Sweeney himself began to throw both details and irrelevancies in to Ibis's narrative (""...such a girl she was....)""  

The fuck?  The guy just shows up in the middle, and that's it?  That's how the transition goes?  I would have expected at least SOME exposition, like ""a flash of light appeared in the doorway, and through it stepped Mad Sweeney, talking over Mr. Ibis's story"", or something like ""They heard a sound coming from the morgue downstairs, and Mad Sweeney, still partially frozen and drunk, stumbled into the kitchen and took a seat.""  Writing like that helps the read to see the scene in their mind's eye.  The way Gaiman wrote it, either Sweeney was always there, or he just appeared and nobody batted an eye (and yes, I know that these are all supernatural creatures, but the reader is not, we expect some notification from the writer if the scene suddenly contains a 4th person)

When I said the writing was too dreamlike, this is what I'm talking about.  Things just happen and the reader is taken along for a ride, like being pulled by a river rushing downhill at a breakneck pace.  I would be reading a scene, trying to imagine it, then Gaiman throws something into it and I have to adjust whether its always been there, it just appeared, or is in everyone's imagination.  That kind of adjustment is tiring, and I wanted something more concrete and less dreamy.

By far the biggest problem I have with the book is the abundance of pointless backstory that has little payoff.  I get you have to set up a lot of these gods, tell their stories, even the minor ones.  But make it mean something later.  In the middle of the book we get this graphic description of a djinn cumming into the mouth of an Arab taxi driver.  The payoff?  These two little sentences on page 290: ""A falling girder in Manhattan closed a street for two days.  It killed two pedestrians, an Arab taxi driver and the taxi driver's passenger.""  That's it.  We never again hear about the djinn with hot semen, and the Arab taxi driver was never mentioned outside of that sentence and when he first had sex with the apparition.  

There is also a too long interlude about a couple of slaves, the story of Wututu and Agasu.  The point was to show how old beliefs migrated to America, how it changed, and how it settled into the new country, I get that part.  But it was way too long.  It spent an unnecessary 13 pages detailing the slave trade, talking about the brother who, by the narrator's own admission, was kind of pointless and only mentioned again at death.  It gave us a history lesson of the Haitian slave uprising, and how little Wututu went from master to master.  And the god she believed in?  Never mentioned outside of that chapter.  Why?  Why didn't Gaiman spend more time expanding on the main god of the book, Odin, and how he came?  I remember he talked about it, talked about the whole ceremony of lashing up nine people on trees.  That made sense because that came up later when Shadow had to do the same thing.  So spend pages talking about that, not Wututu and Agasu!  

The exact same criticism can be had of the whole segment on Nunyunnini, a god that came to America 16000 years before the events of the story and, like Wututu's god, faded out.  Why spend 2 such segments talking about pointless gods that would never impact the story?  It just made the book unnecessarily drag on and on.  And there was no payoff at all.  

And finally, my last criticism of the style of the book can be summed up in the intro of Chapter 18: 

> ""None of this can actually be happening.  If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as a metaphor.  Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you - even perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make  sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumps over all opposition.""

> ""Religions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world.""

> ""So none of this is happening.  Such things could not occur.  Never a word of it is literally true.  Even so, the next thing that happened, happened like this:""

Like, WTF was the point of that?  He just undermined his own book.  Its like a movie starting out with the actors saying, in a PSA, ""None of what you are about to see is real.""  Sure, we know that already, but why was this written in the book?  It just doesn't make any sense that he would take away the impact of what was about to be the climax of the book from the reader.  Its like asking us to put away the book because it will be forgotten.

Those are my main problems with the book's writing style, the Meta stuff, if you prefer.  There is one more major criticism I have.  For those who have read the book, I think maybe it is very very obvious that there is a plot hole the side of Czernobog's hammer smack right dab in the middle of the book that is never explained, addressed, or hinted at but which is so obvious to anyone who knows even a passing hint of what the book is about.  And that thing is:

Jesus Fucking Christ, where the hell is he??

You mean to tell me a story that tries to get me to believe that the old pagan gods are real, that the likes of Odin, Horus, and Easter are alive in some form roaming the world, drinking wine, eating cookies, having sex with mortals, and that the crux of the book depends on the conflict between these forgotten pagan gods whose worshippers probably number in the few thousands, who no longer sacrifice and chant their names, who are plotting a defense against the likes of the ""new"" gods of Media and the internet, with names like ""the fat kid"" and Mr. World, Mr. Town, Mr. Wood, and Mr. Stone....you mean to tell me that nowhere is Jesus Christ a character????

Why are the old gods real and the ""new"" ones of the internet and TV?  Why isn't this a battle between Zeus and Odin against the likes of Jesus Christ?  Talk about belief, Christianity is the the world's biggest religion.  Jesus should have been front and center as the representative of these ""new"" gods.  So should gods like Allah (technically the same character), Buddha, and the Hindu gods all be part of the new order who have grown fat and powerful on their billion population followers.  But no, Odin is real, the media god is real, but Jesus isn't?  I was prepared for Mr. World to be Jesus, in a 3 piece suit calling down commandments from the sky, recreating the 10 plague of Egypt onto the sorry djinns and kobolds, but I got none of that.  It makes zero sense.  A book where gods are real and battle each other should have the top 4 major religions represented as characters, so strong they are that they should be shooting lasers out of their eyes like an X-Men.  Buddha should have been like Luffy's Gear Fourth and zipping around the sky raining down punches, leveling mountains, and no-selling Odin's Gungnir in the gut.  Those absences, and the lack of explanation of that absence, do a greater disservice to this book than the style can ever be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/94puf2/just_finished_american_gods_and_i_dont_like_it_at/,2018-08-05 06:08:33,35,16,books

blf8pf,"American gods was good, but needs serious work if it were to ever get a sequel","I just finished it. Ive never seen the tv show, so I went in blind. This is also my first gaiman book.

A couple of problems. First off I find it hard to believe that shadow can discover God's exist and not basically demand answers to basic questions. He weakly tries once or twice, but never pushes. I find that hard to believe, and leads me to why a sequel would need a lot of background work.

I feel that gaiman had to do that with shadow because he refused to explain his magic system despite it being what I would consider middle stage.

Shadow/Wednesday weren't throwing down destructive in your face magic much, but it wasn't nearly as background as say lotr magic, which in can get a pass on explanation because of its background nature. 

People seem to really want a sequel to American gods, but without some serious world building around magic it's go g to fall apart like Harry Potter did later in the series, where I'm the weak world building around the magic system made it worse.

Overall a good one off because I do t need serious world building in a one off because there are fewer concepts to explain but add even just one sequel and that no longer applies imo",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/blf8pf/american_gods_was_good_but_needs_serious_work_if/,2019-05-06 17:44:50,25,0,books
8so5ea,I am glad I didn't swear off Neil Gaiman after reading American Gods. Here are thoughts on giving authors a second chance.,"I read *American Gods* a few years ago and came to the conclusion that Neil Gaiman is not a very good storyteller. It had a lot of interesting elements, some pretty fantastic scenes, but overall I felt that it fell flat as a story.

This year I decided to give him another chance and read *Stardust*. That was a really fun book, and it was a fantasy more in the vein of classic fairy tales and fables, which is not what I had expected. It kind of had a similar meandering vibe to it like *American Gods* did, but the overall execution was significantly better. I also liked how it ended, as opposed to *American Gods*.

I then decided to read *Fortunately, the Milk* to see how his children's writing was. I have decided I **have** to read this to my future children. It was such a whimsically nonsensical extravaganza of joy and adventure. It's a story about a story, and I finished it feeling convinced I had gotten Gaiman all wrong.

So I decided to go ahead and read *Coraline*, which seemed to be aimed at children older than *Fortunately, the Milk*. This is one of, if not the most, terrifically creepy things I've ever read. It officially solidified in my mind that Gaiman is indeed a terrific storyteller. The ups and downs of the story, the well-executed resolution, and the wonderful atmosphere throughout left me wanting to read whatever of Gaiman's I've yet to consume.

I probably won't reread *American Gods* any time soon if ever again, but I learned a lot about judging authors by a single work. Some authors I fall in love with immediately and find above average enjoyment from basically anything they write. Now I know authors can have (a) flukes and/or (b) works that simply don't strike a chord with me and that it can be worthwhile to read at least one other thing before permanently swearing off an author. Unless it's really, really bad. No one has time for pure garbage.

Have any of you ever given an author a second chance to impress you? How did it go? Is there an author you keep giving chances to yet still can't seem to understand what all the hubbub is about?

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you were able to relate or be inspired to give some author a second chance.

3bu3rx,"(Spoilers) Finished American Gods, trying to figure out how to interpret Laura","I have two main ideas about what kind of person Laura is, and I thought I'd try to start a discussion about them. I want to start out by saying that this was a tremendously emotional book for me. I started reading it at my girlfriend's house, and we've had a running joke for over a year now about me being her puppy. Right off the bat, their relationship reminded me of myself and her, and I loved them for it. I was absolutely devastated minutes later when I read that she died, and I was... more than devastated when I read how. From then on, the book was all about Shadow and Laura to me. It's not that I didn't care or pay attention to the rest of it, just that like Shadow, nothing surprised me after that, and it was always in the back of my mind. 

What bothered me most about Laura was that she never even once apologized to Shadow. She acted very matter-of-factly when describing how she cheated on him, as if it should be okay because she still loves him. At times she came across as totally oblivious, other times simply manipulative, and other times totally dissonant as a character. So I have two basic ideas: either the affair was orchestrated by Odin and Loki, or she really was manipulating him the whole time.

**Why the affair could have been orchestrated by Odin and Loki**

There was, of course, the obvious quote, when Mr. Wednesday said ""If it could have been any other way,"" both at the beginning and at the end. It was referring to the semi-remorse he felt for using Laura to pull Shadow's strings. Obviously, Laura was integral to their plot for the following reasons: she and Robbie had to be gone in order for Shadow to have no place left to go to, and she had to indirectly convince Shadow to hold Odin's vigil. However, I think not only was her death necessary, but the affair was too. Being cheated on was Shadow's diversion - it kept him from being able to figure out what Odin's plan was. It also was where all of the sting came from when she told him that he wasn't really alive. It is of course possible that she cheated on him and then the gods capitalized on it, but there don't seem to be any other coincidences in their entire plan, even down to the detail of Loki getting Shadow into coin tricks.

The graveyard ""you aren't really alive"" scene really stuck out to me for a few reasons. They briefly discussed who called her - it wasn't Shadow, and then immediately, she brought up how he wasn't really alive. So she had to have been called there for that purpose with that timing. Later, we caught a glimpse of how she felt about it. Laura hoped that she hadn't hurt Shadow, that he'd understood what she meant, and that he'd forgiven her. This makes it seem like the way that the gods can manipulate her don't turn her into a robot like Chad Mulligan (the police chief who was going to kill himself) did at the end. It was as if they gave her a desire to make Shadow have that burst of raw emotion at a certain time, and they made her rationalize it by relating it to Robbie. This was really what makes the case for her having cheated on him by Odin/Loki's influence.

If it had been the gods' influence that made her cheat, she would have ended up with the kind of bizarre attitude towards it that she displayed. She thought she was really Shadow's all along and that it shouldn't be a big deal to him. She also didn't feel remorse for it, despite how it obviously would have and did hurt shadow, even while she otherwise remained totally devoted to him.

The thing that I like about this interpretation (besides getting to not feel like Laura is a heartless bitch) is that when you separate out everything Laura did that was necessary to Odin's plan, literally everything else she did was for Shadow's benefit. She killed Wood and House, she killed Town and Loki, she visited him on the tree and encouraged him, and she always said she loved him. Also, after their first conversation since her death, Shadow resolved to never say he loved her again. And he didn't throughout the whole book until the very end, after he figured out the plot. Either he just didn't have the heart to let her die without saying it, or he believed that she wouldn't have cheated on him and recognized that she truly did love him.

Miscellaneous bits that I found to support it are that Low Key was in jail during Shadow's first year, and the affair did not start until 12-13 months into his jail time, so the timing lines up. Also, when Laura was talking to him the night after her funeral, something almost imperceptible changed in her voice, and Shadow couldn't figure out what it was: possibly due to the dissonant rationalization that she got from the gods to justify her affair to herself. Lastly, she said that she wanted to be brought back to life, but changed her mind in the end, possibly because she only said it in the first place to give Shadow the hope he needed to get through the storm.

**Why she could have just been manipulating Shadow the whole time (or any other scenario in which she voluntarily had the affair with Robbie)**

Laura's semi-dissonant attitude could be explained in the following way: she really believed that Shadow wasn't ""alive"", and that it wouldn't bother him or wouldn't matter that she cheated on him. Just like a god, she liked him for the wholehearted devotion he had for her (moreso because it was his biggest defining feature), so she kind of played along and kept him attached. She wanted to tell him he wasn't alive and compare him to Robbie to sort of rub it in, and she knew that it would make him do something crazy to show how much he resented that. She really did like him in a sense, enough to kill for him, but she didn't really respect him as a spouse.

I'm definitely partial to the other interpretation, and I haven't dug around for as many clues to support this one. However, I think everything I have that indicates the former is a kind of big picture interpretation that doesn't contain any hard facts. It certainly seems like we aren't supposed to know for sure; Shadow's love life is not the focus of the book anyway. 

To me, the biggest problem with her having been influenced to cheat on him is that she should have recognized how much it hurt him and tried to apologize. It feels like some shaky mental gymnastics to say that she was not allowed to apologize because Odin needed her words to sting him enough to hold the vigil, and her unwillingness to apologize certainly supports the idea that she's just being manipulative.

fcqqx,Tall Tales From American Gods [mostly found],"So, I got my hands on the e-text of the book and was able to look up some of the tall tales that way.  I imagine that I missed a few, but I was pretty happy with them and I figured I would share.


* Hinzelmann told them a story about his grandfather's trumpet, and how he tried playing it during a cold snap, and the weather was so cold outside by the barn, where his grandfather had gone to practice, that no music came out.
“Then after he came inside he put the trumpet down by the woodstove to thaw. Well, the family're all in bed that night and suddenly the unfrozen tunes start coming out of that trumpet. Scared my grandmother so much she nearly had kittens.”

* “Just Hinzelmann, Mike. We were so poor that we couldn't afford a fire. Come New Year's Eve my father would suck on a peppermint, and us kids, we'd stand around with our hands outstretched, basking in the glow.”

* “Well, yah, it was the only way the settlers survived back then. Weren't enough food for everyone, and you couldn't just go down to Dave's and fill up your shopping cart in the old days, no sir. So my grampaw, he got to figgerin', and when a really cold day like this come along he'd take my grarnmaw, and the kids, my uncle and my aunt and my daddy-he was the youngest-and the serving girl and the hired man, and he'd go down with them to the creek, give 'em a little drink of rum and herbs, it was a recipe he'd got from the old country, then he'd pour creek water over them. Course they'd freeze in seconds, stiff and blue as so many Popsicles. He'd haul them to a trench they'd already dug and filled with straw, and he'd stack 'em down there, one by one, like so much cordwood in the trench, and he'd pack straw around them, then he'd cover the top of the trench with two-b'-fours to keep the critters out-in those days there were wolves and bears and all sorts you never see anymore around here, no hodags though, that's just a story about the hodags and I wouldn't ever stretch your credulity by telling you no stories, no sir-he'd cover the trench with two-b'-fours and the next snowfall would cover it up completely, save for the flag he'd planted to show him where the trench was.
“Then my grampaw would ride through the winter in comfort and never have to worry about running out of food or out of fuel. And when he saw that the true spring was coming he'd go to the flag, and he'd dig his way down through the snow, and he'd move the two-by-fours, and he'd carry them in one by one and set the family in front of the fire to thaw. Nobody ever minded except one of the hired men who lost half an ear to a family of mice who nibbled it off one time my grampaw didn't push those two-by-fours all the way closed. Of course, in those days we had real winters. You could do that back then. These pussy winters we get nowadays it don't hardly get cold enough.”

* “You can walk on it. Drive on it too, but I wouldn't want to risk it yet. It's been cold up here for six weeks,” said Hinzelmann. “But you also got to allow that things freeze harder and faster up here in northern Wisconsin than they do most anyplace else there is. I was out hunting once-hunting for deer, and this was oh, thirty, forty years back, and I shot at a buck, missed him, and sent him running off through the woods-this was over acrost the north end of the lake, up near where you'll be living, Mike. Now he was the finest buck I ever did see, twenty point, big as a small horse, no lie. Now, I'm younger and feistier back then than I am now, and though it had started snowing before Halloween that year, now it was Thanksgiving and there was clean snow on the ground, fresh as anything, and I could see the buck's footprints. It looked to me like the big fellow was heading for the lake in a panic.
“Well, only a damn fool tries to run down a buck, but there am I, a damn fool, running after him, and there he is, standing in the lake, in oh, eight, nine inches of water, and he's just looking at me. That very moment, the sun goes behind a cloud, and the freeze comes-temperature must have fallen thirty degrees in ten minutes, not a word of a lie. And that old stag, he gets ready to run, and he can't move! He's frozen into the ice.
“Me, I just walk over to him slowly. You can see he wants to run, but he's iced in and it just isn't going to happen. But there's no way I can bring myself to shoot a defenseless critter when he can't get away-what kind of man would I be if I done that, heh? So I takes my shotgun and I fires off one shell, straight up into the air.
“Well, the noise and the shock is enough to make that buck just about jump out of his skin, and seein' that his legs are iced in, that's just what he proceeds to do. He leaves his hide and his antlers stuck to the ice, while he charges back into the woods, pink as a newborn mouse and shivering fit to bust.
“I felt bad enough for that old buck that I talked the Lakeside Ladies' Knitting Circle into making him something warm to wear all the winter, and they knitted him an all-over one-piece woolen suit, so he wouldn't freeze to death. 'Course, the joke was on us, because they knitted him a suit of bright orange wool, so no hunter ever shot at it. Hunters in these parts wear orange at hunting season,” he added, helpfully. “And if you think there's a word of a lie in that, I can prove it to you. I've got the antlers up on my rec room wall to this day.”

* “Maybe you should get Hinzelmann to write your editorial for you. Let's see. 'On the Rezoning of the Land by the Old Cemetery. It so happens that in the winter of ought-three my grampaw shot a stag down by the old cemetery by the lake. He was out of bullets, so he used a cherry-stone from the lunch my grandmama had packed for him. Creased the skull of the stag and it shot off like a bat out of heck. Two years later he was down that way and he sees this mighty buck with a spreading cherry tree growing between its antlers. Well, he shot it, and grandmama made cherry pies enough that they were still eating them come the next fourth of July...'“ And they both laughed, then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcqqx/tall_tales_from_american_gods_mostly_found/,2011-02-01 00:39:07,0,9,books

4y7rn2,"American Gods audiobook as prose-candy, and whether dialogue + imagery is enough to make a story ""good"".","As an initial disclosure, I'm only getting back into literature as of late and my primary narrative media consumption comes in the form of videogames and film/tv, though audiobooks have swayed me as of late. I just came off of Ready Player One and had a handful of thoughts provoked by the settings, the futuristic considerations, and many of the complex concepts inherent in multi-bodily existence and VR. I rather enjoyed the discussion around it, and am excited for its movie due out next year. 


I transitioned to American Gods, which all in all I found to be quite a different sort of story. A book that one would read for different reasons - mostly for the character interactions as opposed to the plot. RPO felt very plot driven, which in turn may make the progressive nature of completing that novel a ""page-turner"". 

**Overarching questions**

Do you read books for different reasons? Do you think that some genres are inherently more rich for providing thought-provoking discussion? Does a plot vs. character driven story matter more for you? 

*American Gods was mostly prose-candy to me.* It was written in a very descriptive, dialogue heavy focus, with the plot mostly taking a backseat to the interactions between characters. This novel is mostly about discovering new and old American Gods and having our protagonist, Shadow, discover his purpose on earth after losing his only love... all while having just been released from prison. 

**General notes and opinions as I went through the novel**

* The voice acting is excellent. Read by a full cast, this made the production a treat. 


* This includes the vignettes that appear throughout, and often break up the main story with little side-stories (which are read by the author himself, Neil Gaiman). These are good, but often don't relate much to the actual story, and end up kinda padding the story a bit. 

* There isn't a clear cut storyline or problem that is laid out directly, so for a while we're not sure where the story is going. Eventually, a civil war story arc becomes the main centerpoint, but I think that it plays out in a fairly cop-out kind of way at the end. Not the biggest fan of the arc execution, but as a concept, it actually is pretty cool. Should have had more of an actual finale though, instead of how it played out. 

* Shadow is a pretty cool character. Wednesday is cool too. Their dialogue and interactions are awesome. Much of the supporting cast is pretty good, even if some of the Gods appear primarily as filler characters (Easter, for instance), IMO. 

* Shadow on the tree, near the 70% mark of the story was probably the best written part of the whole thing. Great stuff. 

* Not too much to chew on mentally. There wasn't much that made me consider my own life, the future, or people's interactions. Maybe this is partly due to the lack of relatability that exists between the Gods, but so be it. There was rarely a time where I attempted to place myself in any of the characters' shoes and consider what I might do, and this is mostly because much of the occurrences are so between supernatural, or otherwise otherworldly folk. Some definitely have human traits (arrogance, greed, fear, etc), but they most often are presented as the other. 


* Some of the best details get brought up around Shadow and Wednesday, IMO. The discussions around Wednesday's twentyish powers was a real treat, but it was sad that he really only utilized his ability to make anyone love him in the story. Otherwise it wasn't ever very clear how powerful he truly was. This often goes for many of the other Gods.

 
* It was nice to see that modern Gods come about from worshipping technology (a theme mirrored in many different stories and often a basis for humanities downfall, like the Witch's motivations in Suicide Squad), but I didn't get a great connection to the Gods' personalities and what they symbolized. Maybe except the technology/hacker kid. Unfortunately it seemed his traits were tropes as his God symbolism of technology was represented by a pudgy, arrogant little shit. 


* The story itself was fairly fun to read through (despite the occasional vignette or two that felt like a hurdle to get over, but honestly, most of them are quite entertaining), and it was a nicely written story that had great language. A little bummed that it didn't get me pondering much about my own life, the deities or concepts I devote my attention to, or how fragile the connection to our humanity might be (as a I might expect a story about Gods and humans might play out). It's all good though, cuz the dialogue and prose often sailed the story nearly where it needed to be.

s2li1,"I just finished reading American Gods, have a few questions to people who have read it. Contains spoilers!","It took me about three weeks to finish this book - these last two weeks have been incredibly demanding and I didn't get a chance to read at all. I guess the reason I didn't quite *get* the answers to some of these questions could be attributed to that time lapse.

First of all, I love it. When I first heard about it I expected it to be quite different and the way it turned out was a pleasant surprise. I'll probably read it again sometime.

As for my questions;

1) A recurring idea in the book is that America is not a good place for gods. I feel like I understand what Gaiman means by this and I feel like it fits in with the rest of the story line, like its just a logical conclusion. However when I try to put into words exactly *why* America is a bad place for gods, I find myself puzzled and unable to be satisfied with any answer that I can articulate. Why would you say that America is a bad place for gods? The way I see it is, people from all kinds of backgrounds went there, leaving most of their memories and heritage behind and only bringing with them a mere shadow of their belief and their gods because America was kind of like a mixing pot of all races and it was ""a new beginning"". That and the fact that its fast paced lifestyle in which the constant creation of new gods renders the old gods obsolete (but this could be said about a lot of other countries as well) are the only reasons I can actually put into words. What is your opinion?

2) Why did Wednesday need Shadow? Near the end, where it all becomes clear that it was just a two-man scheme, Wednesday says that he needed Shadow to divert attention. Why was Shadow considered a distraction for anyone but the reader? Is it because the death of Wednesday maybe would not have enough of an impact were it not for his son vowing to defeat the new gods?

3) Shadow's days at the tree - I feel like he was going to be sacrificed to Odin to bring Odin back from the dead or to create a new image of Odin or something. But at the end we learn that, like Odin, he sacrificed himself to himself. Is this what happened? By sacrificing himself to himself did Shadow gain the near godlike abilities he exercises in the end of the book? Wasn't his days at the tree Wednesday's vigil?

4) Again, why is the center of America ""the opposite of holy""?

5) The fat kid - is he the internet/video games god? What is he a god of exactly? This has been driving me mad. Why did he freak out and first try to sleep in Shadow's room and then bang his head against the walls when they were at the motel to claim Wednesday's body?

Thanks to anyone who at least tries to answer my questions, I really appreciate it seeing as how I'm kind of puzzled now that the book is over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s2li1/i_just_finished_reading_american_gods_have_a_few/,2012-04-10 14:57:39,8,5,books
3t95ps,"I just started American Gods, and am thoroughly enjoying it. Is it a coincidence it's similar in theme to another recent read of mine - Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency?","I was a big fan of HHGG in high school, so when I decided to start actively reading fiction again, one of the first series I tried was Dirk Gently.  I liked it, it was weirder than HHGG, more fantastical, but still fun (for someone normally not too into modern era fantasy).  Then, just this past weekend, I picked up American Gods on a whim, knowing nothing about it other than I liked Coraline (the movie) and Black Orchid (graphic novel) - both also by Gaiman.

So now I'm sitting here, realizing that in the past few months I've encountered two novels written by Englishmen that revolve around Norse gods living in the modern world.

2hr3k3,[Possible spoilers] Just finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman... I want to like the book more but I felt disappointed. Anyone else feel the same way?,"First off, I feel like I am totally late to the Neil Gaiman party.  Last summer I read the Sandman comic and loved them.  I heard so many other great things about NG that I wanted to try him out a little more.  Around the time of finishing Sandman, I coincidently saw, by the demand of a friend, Stardust and thought it was pretty cool (I'm obviously a sci/fi fan so I took the bait).  So I was really pumped to start American Gods. I read a lot of great reviews about the novel and saw all the awards it won. Sounded pretty cool. 

Now I am not saying I didn't like the book. Shadow was great. The twist was great. I enjoyed reading Gaiman in the novel format.  It was cool, clever and very intricate.  I guess I felt let down because I wish I saw more of the gods interacting with humans.  The whole war seemed to fall flat. Am I missing something? I feel like the idea of gods coming to America and being stuck here could have been done so much better but just saying that feels like I am missing something about this novel.

vilt8l,"""The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Rape of New York"" by Robert A. Caro is a must read about the most powerful American you don't know.","A Pulitzer Prize winner that redefined political biography. Moses told  Mayors, Governors, Presidents, and the Robber  Barons what to do and how he wanted it done. In short, he was a merciless genius who used and abused those around him to change forever New York, and subsequently the country through the adoption of his methods. 

Fun fact: Robert Moses personally spent 1/3 of all WPA money during the Depression. 1/3. He can arguably be called the nost powerful individual American ever, in addition to being a Woodrow Wilson level racist that created what we call ghettos. 

It's a doorstop but highly topical, a great summer read, and will grow anyone's understanding of America and their relationship to it.

1ju6yd,"American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Reading it for the first time and this quote that gave me the chills, thought I'd share","
“I can believe things that are true and things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not.

I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen - I believe that people are perfectable, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkled lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women.

I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state.

I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste.

I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds.

I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman.

I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself.

I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck.

I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too.

I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system.

I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.”

lecva6,The Genre “American Dark Fantasy”,"I’ve found a few books that all have similar themes and “vibes” to each other, so much so that I’m my opinion they could be grouped into a category I’ve began referring to as “american dark fantasy”. There are 3 I’ve found to be prime examples:

The Stand - Stephen King

American Gods - Neil Gaiman

The Blood Meridian - Cormac McCarthy

All of these books:

- are specifically set in The United States of America and immediate locations close to the United States of America’s (not including the scene in Iceland in American Gods, but including the scenes in Mexico in Blood Meridian)

- feature prominent characters with supernatural powers (Mr. Wednesday, Randell Flagg, Judge Holden)

- feature an overall atmosphere with a looming supernatural presence

- feature intense violence (thus, ‘dark’ fantasy) and sex scenes

tqzr7h,American Psycho is a perfect example of a great concept executed in a very poor way,"Conceptually the novel is great, and I think that's why people give the actual quality of the piece a lot of leeway. But after finally reading it, I cant say the execution is anything but botched - self-indulgent to the point of being borderline unreadable.

For instance, when the novel just stops to have a chapter where Patrick details the history and artistic vision of ""Huey Lewis and the News"" - its great. Its both funny while also outlining how deeply engrossed Bateman is in consumerism culture. But doing it multiple times has diminishing returns. It doesn't get funnier when Ellis repeats it throughout the book, nor is it making a point the first time didn't already make.

Likewise, 80-90% of this book ***really is just Batemen and his friends sitting down talking about ""hard bodies"" and the rules of what socks to wear with ties***. While I get and appreciate the point in establishing the repetition, shallowness, and monotony of the lifestyle before juxtaposing it with the dichotic extreme mundane violence - I really think Ellis just took it way too far.

Takes a hundred pages before Patrick kills someone, a third of the book. While slow burn before it happens is definitely the right way to go about the narrative, my god is it excessive. I couldn't bear the 100th page describing what Bateman was wearing. At a certain point an author needs to ask themselves whether they've made the point they're trying to make, and whether labouring it more is helping or hurting.

Similarly the violence is a bit over the line. While, again, I get that's the point. The repetition of extreme imagery (such as a scene where Batman eats human waste out of a woman's intestine) has made its point and doing it again and again the exact same way isn't adding anything.

I didn't even get the supposed sense of Bateman slowly losing his mind more and more as the novel progresses - a common defense of the book I'd see.   
Maybe up until the first murder, but after that it's not a decline, its spontaneously up and down. The big shoot out climax happens way too early, and the story instead peters off limply with a scene of Bateman getting mugged.

The films is pretty blatantly superior in every way imo. It ***heavily*** rearranges the order of events so you ***do*** get that steady decline in sanity, and it has a much better pace - balancing the banal lives of the yuppies with the surprising violence in a way that stresses the point in an actual engaging manner.

As a novel? I'd have probably said to edit it and make it a novella. What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tqzr7h/american_psycho_is_a_perfect_example_of_a_great/,2022-03-29 13:28:39,68,0,books
ywkd88,American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.,"First off I am surprised the author is gay and secondly how did he even come up with this story line.

Hannibal, Grenouille and etc etc serial killers compared to Patrick Bateman are just eh mid(?). Because Patrick Bateman could be someone who we know in real life. The way he hides his fervor for torture, death, murder, sadism with the façade of a charming young man is really scary and interesting. The fact that he doesn’t get caught and just keeps getting away after all this is much more scary. 

I love how Ellis has him portrayed. How after each and every chapters he just keeps spiraling to insanity. From a guy who stands against his friend’s racist jokes to someone who is a racist blood lusting maniac.

The movie really doesn’t do Justice to the Character Patrick Bateman. The movie downplays him so much people have made him an icon for Sigma male. Yes, I am talking about the memes. Oh boy!!! If only they read the novel they’d realize how wrong they are. I think this would have made a good mini series (sad it wasn’t a trend at that time) and focus each episodes on how Patrick Bateman goes from this nice ‘boy next door’ to a ‘I king bloodthirsty lunatic’.

Some scenes of torture I wasn’t even able to read it without feeling repugnant. Kudos for Ellis for writing it so detailed that everyone (or me) felt repulsive just by reading and visualizing what a shitfest Patrick Bateman is. Though some sex scenes are of course a bit over detailed and more like unbelievable. 

Oh God, how I hate Patrick Bateman no words can describe that. 

Easton Ellis portraying how materialistic the yuppies were with his narrations is engaging too. Learnt more high end brands reading this book. And the other thing is where most of them confuse Patrick Bateman with someone else I think it’s a nod by Ellis saying that most yuppies are unrecognizable from each other, living the same identical life, and making the yuppie lifestyle their whole identity (just my guess btw).

Another theory I read was that whenever the fictional Patty Winters show deals on strange and quirky stuff it’s a nod that Patrick Bateman is spiraling more towards his insanity. The more weirder things the show talks about the more delirious Patrick Bateman becomes. Reading it with this notion it does check out. 

Another one brief narration style I really loved was when Patrick Bateman goes on a killing spree Ellis decides to go for a third person narrative which is really interesting considering that Patrick Bateman wouldn’t be able to narrate it because he isn’t on the right mindset to narrate the events himself considering the fuckfest he was involved in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ywkd88/american_psycho_by_bret_easton_ellis/,2022-11-16 05:02:13,13,21,books

gyhhrn,So I've finished American Psycho by Brett Easton Ellis,"I've been reading the Harry Potter series but after Book 5, I wanted to take a break from the series. And I picked up this book as I love psychological horrors.

I must admit, no book I've read up until this point has ever mentally scarred me more than this book did. I have a great deal of aversion towards violence or blood and generally avoid watching extremely violent and gory movies. But this trait of mine doesn't apply to books because imagination can only go so far, right? But a big fat NO is in order. I've underestimated my imagination, I realized. Everytime I read a gory scene, I was so into the book that I could more than vividly picture it and had to put down my mobile (was reading the ebook in Kindle app coz deliveries were stopped due to lockdown) for a while. I couldn't go on because it was extremely disturbing to read all the details in their magnifying intensity. Yet somehow, these little details are what made the book so powerful, I suppose.

The people in the book were so goddamn materialistic that it frustrated me to no end! I felt extremely grateful for once in my life that I haven't got the greed which may have turned me into a person like Patrick Bateman or any of his high class friends. Really, how can you look at a person and ONLY see the brands they carry upon them?! How can women be nothing more than OBJECTS OF PLEASURE?! Oh God, and not to forget the rampant Homophobia and Racism. I was frustrated to tears quite literally.

Brett Ellis did a marvellous work of portraying his then mindset in the form of Patrick. After the book ends, we get to read a few paragraphs from the author and he gives us some information regarding why he penned down this book and he said that he related to Patrick on a personal level. The book in its entirety was supposed to be boring because that was how he had felt during his dark days. And yes, I must agree with the author. The book was downright boring and mundane. But in a very good way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gyhhrn/so_ive_finished_american_psycho_by_brett_easton/,2020-06-07 18:25:27,22,39,books
j1v0a8,Is American pulp fiction on its last legs?,"I feel like I should start this off with 10-step confession about being addicted to science fiction and fantasy, but really I just want to lay out a problem that was bugging me and see what others thought.  Forgive me if your genre of choice is different, but facing similar problems.

I noticed over a decade ago that new content was getting harder and harder to find.  Everything is so stagnant in America, book wise.  More and more, publishers seem to be reprinting older authors, or bringing poorly-edited teen fiction or vampire/werewolf fanfic rewrites to market.   And absent were new genre's that evolved out of the pulps.

It is stagnant, over-exploited now.  More and more of what I was reading was coming from other countries. It seems like today, American publishers have closed the doors to authors otherwise.   (I know I am passing over a few exceptions, like comics)

It is incredibly frustrating to me, I just spent most of the quarantine discovering Japanese light novels and Oh.My.God.  It is like a fix for a junkie who was forced to go cold turkey.   And all I can do is wonder why American publishing companies have their heads so far up their rear.   I mean, I just spent more than two entire decades of my typical book budget on just half a year.  Why is Kadokawa getting that money and not one of the big 5?

It isn't like there aren't American authors that don't want to write this stuff.  Everything from high end space opera to really hard science fiction, down to isekai and silly restaurants between worlds...   there are.   I see bits of them on story sites, all they clearly need is editors and publishers to platform them.  But all they can do is self-publish, and usually skimp on desperately needed editing.  It doesn't take a marketing genius to realize that isekai, for example, is a market just begging for product in the states.

I should be able to go to amazon's kindle store and see a ton of $3-4 books every month in every genre, all from well known publishing houses.   Instead, half of every page is filled with releases from decades ago and bunch of very repetitive bleh.  If they can't charge more than $15 for a bunch of bits, they don't seem to think it is worth the effort.

I wasn't sure about posting this, but then I saw the billionth 'I just discovered Steven King' post and figured what the heck.  Do you feel there is a problem too?  Are you tired of bad young-adult books flooding the markets and displacing both serious and lite fiction?  Could you let me know your thoughts, cause I feel this is so obvious it is driving me crazy.
