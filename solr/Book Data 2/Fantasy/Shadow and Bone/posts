p9nc76,Shadow and bone series is crap compared to TV show,"Edit: I just rewatched it like 3 times! Hehehe Netflix pay attention give them a great season 2!

Ok I'm usually on the side of ""the book is better than the movie!"" Because... it is..... like by a lot. BUT.
BUT 
BUT.

I watched the show and decided to read the book - it's not usually a problem for me bc my own imagination will take over despite already having a visual in my head- and, to put it politely, the first book sucks. 

Firstly, it puts the y in ya, writing style wise. 5 years ago I might have not minded but now it kinda prevents me from full immersion.

Second, the relationship between Mal and Alina is borderline toxic. In the show they really go more into developing the deep profound friendship but in the books it's immediately aline secretly in love with him. Also they made the dynamic too hunger games gale and katniss. ALSO in the show Mal is so much fuller? It takes a secure and humble man to be able to step back and realize he isn't the main person, to not be insecure by his much more important and powerful counterpart, which from only one book and some spoilers I can tell is gonna be a problem for book Mal.

Three, the backstory and development of the relationship of the darling is sooo much more believable in the show. 

It's such a  well written show based off a sub par book with great world building. There is so much more but I'm already in love with the show and despite being fully ready to buy the whole world series, like six of crows, I'm done after book one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p9nc76/shadow_and_bone_series_is_crap_compared_to_tv_show/,2021-08-22 23:17:45,155,814,books
18oqlo5,The Shadow and Bone Trilogy... I liked it.,"I just finished the 3rd book. Not much happened plot wise.  
She goes above ground.  
She goes to the mountain base and trains.  
Darkling attacks and she escapes.  
She looks for and finds the 3rd amplifier.  
She kills the Darkling.  
She lives happily ever after.  
On the mountain she had no chance against the Darkling. 3 books of training and she doesn't even kill the Darkling with her power; she sneak attacks him with a knife in the heart. 

So the plot was simple, and maybe even anticlimactic.  
But everything else was better. The banter was fun. Nicholai shines so bright and steals the show every page he's on. A lot of characters were funny and had entertaining quips and one liners, making it a fun story.  
The Darkling was a sympathetic villain. Hundreds of years old he just wants Alina so he's no longer lonely, and he wants Geisha to be thought of as equal. He massacres innocent civilians which makes him a horrible monster, but other than that he is sympathetic.  
Alina's growth from confused nobody to someone who's willing to put in the hard work and make difficult choices to save the country is nice to see.

Cool world. I'm excited to start the Six of Crows duology because I heard it's a lot better. Hopefully it lives up to the hype.  
Tldr: the plot was paperthin but character interactions were a lot of fun. And I'm happy with the ending.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18oqlo5/the_shadow_and_bone_trilogy_i_liked_it/,2023-12-22 22:24:02,8,22,books
n0e5vn,Shadow And Bone Was Amazing,"So recently I decided to read *Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo* because of all the hype with the new Netflix adaptation coming on and how popular it got. So, Tuesday night, I got the book, sat down and expected to read one or two chapters and go to bed right? Nope. I somehow read all 22 chapters all in one go.

Just something about the writing style and story kept me so engaged throughout the entire novel. From the worldbuilding to amazing characters to such dynamic writing, I think Shadow and Bone has got to be one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. 

The only nickpickety thing I would say is that the plot was a pretty standard as a fantasy novel, but its the first book, so I'd still say it did a wonderful job. I also wanted to see a bit more backstory for the Darkling, but I get that it adds to his mysterious character and maybe they'll go more into it next book, idk. 

What do you guys think of the book? I'd definitely recommend it and its a high 9/10 for me. I'm super excited to continue the trilogy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n0e5vn/shadow_and_bone_was_amazing/,2021-04-28 12:54:53,44,42,books
11ve8cy,I finished Shadow and Bone series book 2 few days. I’m not liking it.,"I was planning to finish Shadow and Bone trilogy before the series came out. I finished Siege and Storm. I’m starting to hate this. Now I don’t even want to watch series. Can’t even think about book 3. Alina n Mal is just annoying. I don’t know if it’s because this is YA,I just can’t get past them being very immature. Author’s writing also felt flat and immature. Book 1 was ok for me. I feel like i should have sticked to the show. Show won’t be this detailed. Is this author’s Six of Crows any better?. Does any feel like this or is it just me??",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11ve8cy/i_finished_shadow_and_bone_series_book_2_few_days/,2023-03-19 07:06:40,48,48,books
136te2y,Reading Shadow and Bone after watching it's netflix series.,"I have recently watched the first season of Shadow and Bone and in that it was pretty clear that Mal was the one who like Alena and now that I am reading the book it's the other way around and I don't like it. (Probably because no girl ever harboured secret feeling for me and even if they did how would I know?"")

The book is good, so far I am living the way it is written. Be it First Person Narration or a Third Person Narration, it doesn't really matter to me till I am entertained and even though I know the story, I still want to keep reading it. The only problem is that I won't be able to buy the remaining 2 books in the trilogy as I have no money to spare and that is making me want to stop reading it.

It's a battle against my desires and my wallet and my wallet is probably going to win.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/136te2y/reading_shadow_and_bone_after_watching_its/,2023-05-03 17:13:52,10,1,books
ofw2d3,Shadow and Bone Frustrations,"I have never ever dropped a book so fast. I KNEW I would hate it because I (usually) hate books I've had too much exposure to before I've gotten a chance to read it. But I was going to give it a chance because I'm in Discord servers and do edit collabs on Instagram with people who love it. But the first few pages had ADULTS mention how the main female character is ugly and I kind of just don't want to deal with that right now. Characters who are set up to be ugly and know it are worse than the pretty who don't know they're beautiful.  For me, maybe unintentionally, it set the whole tone for the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ofw2d3/shadow_and_bone_frustrations/,2021-07-08 00:37:42,15,0,books

ykp7uo,Review of Kings of Shadow and Stone by Anastasia King,"The author chose the pen name Anastasia King because she claimed she wanted to honor a woman with the same name. The real Anastasia King was a mail-order bride strangled by one of her tenants whiles her husband pinned her down and then buried her in a shallow grave. All you have to do is google her name, and several [articles](https://victimsupportservices.org/memorial/anastasia-king/) about it will pop up. Now, explain how a dark romance with a woman who is repeatedly abused and sexually assaulted by men honors her--not to mention the number of times these men choke her. The author has changed her website biography several times—I assume because she realized how tactless it was to profit off this woman’s name. But rather than admit any fault in what she did, she continues to twist the narrative and lie about it. Now it says that Anastasia King sounds like a 'porn star's alias'...so that's unbelievably disrespectful.

\--

The last half of this book was an absolute struggle to get through. I wanted to give up repeatedly, but I have this problem where I have to complete any book I start, whether I like it or not. Reading Kings of Shadow and Stone was like running up a steep hill with exercise-induced asthma. Not easy. Classifying this as a ‘dark romance where the villain gets the girl’ is severely understating things. This is the story of a psychopath who kidnaps two women, enslaves one of them, strips the other entirely of power and breaks her hand. He curses her and her sister and has her sister whipped repeatedly so that she “doesn’t have to do hard labor”….??? He murders other women that he’s coerced with like…sex magic? It’s weird, and there’s a lot of gratuitous lesbian kissing for seemingly no reason. He’s also killed children and pregnant women in his rise to power, so that’s cute.   


By the end of the book, Keres has convinced herself that she’s *changed* him and that they’re in a real romantic relationship. The author claims to have a vast understanding of psychology, but while reading this book, it doesn’t reflect. Nor does her supposed nursing degree. (Bone breaking free after 22 lashes? I thought she compared these books to Outlander. This is yet another example of how, when advertising one’s book, one should compare it to things they have actually read. Legit, Jamie Fraser’s back is a testament that bone would not break free from 22 lashes.)   


Keres continued to be the most unlikable main character I’ve ever read about. She is so weak-willed, I can’t stand it. She can’t stick to her guns about a single thing, and it’s pathetic at this point. In the last book, we’re told how not wearing shoes is one of her core values, but it took her two seconds to put on some shoes, and she doesn’t even feel bad about it. Another of her “core values” is that she doesn’t eat ‘animals of the earth’, yet her elf tribe/clan hunt and kill animals to skin their pelts…which makes no sense. It’s so wasteful. It would make more sense to take every part of the animal, but they’re just tossing the meat carcass in some ditch and letting it rot away. Anyway, Keres breaks her super important ‘core code’ to eat VEAL of all things. The most inhumane meat available. I’m sick of hearing her whine and cry about everything and then doing it two seconds later like it wasn’t a huge deal five seconds ago. “Oh wah, I have to marry Silas” \*marries Silas\* “I’ll never ever cheat on my husband!!” \*cheats on her husband with Darius.\* Like girl….can you stick to a single thing you say?   


Speaking of Silas and Darius, Keres has forgotten about them entirely since being kidnapped by King BERLIUM(barf). Like you would think, she had never spent the last book crying over which one of them she liked more. Now she’s all about the man abusing her and her sister. Nice. And after Berlium has kidnapped Keres, he strips all her powers away, so she’s basically entirely useless, which is hilarious as all hell to me. All along, Mrithyn, the death god who turned her into his servant, was guiding her arrows, so she has absolutely no skill of her own. She’s been depending on someone else to do it for her this whole time. No wonder she never dropped her bow and arrow before.   


There continues to be minimal detail on scenery or anything pertinent to an actual plot. It’s once more drunken info dumps about every historical fact the author has thought of. It’s, unfortunately, incredibly dull, however. Honestly, I don’t think I could tell you a single thing about this world’s mechanics. I still don’t know why all these Godling creatures adopt the same characteristics as one another. Why wouldn’t they look like the god that they serve? Does every god in this pantheon have wings, fangs, claws, and horns?   


I’ll admit this is a weird thing to complain about, but it stuck out to me like a sore thumb. We are given hardly any sensory detail in this book. We’re constantly told about the characters eating roast meat and veggies(which reminds me of ACOTAR so much because I feel like that’s all they ate too, where are the fantasy foods??!!), and they drink all this wine and eat these unnamed pastries. Still, we’re never told how anything tastes or smells. Except for the inside of Berlium’s mouth, that is. It tastes like honey. It’s hysterical to me that the author thought of all this tumultuous nonsensical history for her made-up fantasy world; she came up with all of these gods and did all of this supposed research on greek mythology. Still, she can’t come up with a meal tastier than roast meat and veggies. We’re never told what kind of trees are in this world or what kind of stone things are made out of. The weather is once again told solely through Keres’ nipples. The anachronisms continue to pile up. (Cold tea, lace panties, button-down shirts???) The author even writes from the perspective of a blind person, and it reads like every other perspective.   


Once again, the POVs are not remotely consistent. Keres has a million chapters, and then there are random other POVS interspersed for seemingly no reason. Not a single character has a distinct voice that might make their narratives feel unique. None of them has any personality.   


Like I said in my review of The Sunderlands, this is an excellent example of why having one’s friends be your beta reader is a bad idea. Another writer would’ve been able to point out all of these flaws. There were numerous typos, anachronistic phrasing belonging to modern-day instead of this medieval setting, unnecessary hyphenated words, words turned into proper nouns for no reason, SO MANY FRAGMENTS(I don't care what her team of editors say, it's not good writing), etc. There will be these serious conversations where someone is saying something profound and prophetic, and the response they get will be a ‘whoa’ or ‘yeah’ or ‘yup’, and I’m…what is happening here??  


I find it very confusing trying to figure out the order of magic in this world. Are all elves gifted with elemental powers? I mentioned above how I want to know why all Godlings look the same and seem to have the same abilities. So why do Thane and Berlium also have these traits when they're not Godlings? Also, why isn't Berlium a bear? HUH? WHY ISN'T HE A BEAR SHAPESHIFTER? Why is he called The Grizzly King? Why do they call him grizzly bear? It makes NO SENSE. Why is a half-elf/half-fire daemon stronger than a full-blooded Ashan? Why is every character so uwu special? Nobody in this book ever earns their stripes, as it were, and if they did, we never got to see it.  


Now regarding the love interest. I get it; okay, this is a dark romance. The main girl isn't a good person, and she falls for the bad guy. I get it. What I don't get is *why*. Because he apologized for breaking her hand? That means nothing. He'll probably break the other one sometime later. This book is a Stockholm syndrome scenario at best. I don't care that he didn't use magic on her to warp her mind. He can warp her mind without magic. Any man can do that. The thing about writing a dark romance between a villain and an anti-heroine is that you're supposed to make us root for them to be together. He is always cruel to her. Even in his moments of softness, even when he seems kind, there will always be the knowledge that he broke her hand so severely that the bone broke free.   


I have to say that this book essentially followed the same skeleton as the previous book—no straightforward plot. Two brothers are fighting over Keres, though, in this book, it's like four dudes. And then, at the end of the book, she's kidnapped by *another* dude(Geraltain, lmao) she'll probably bone at the end of the next book. Unoriginal, uncreative and boring book.   


Geraltain is such a blatant rip-off of Geralt of Rivia that I can't handle it. He fights with two swords and is a renowned monster hunter with long white hair. Come on, girl.

umgeqr,Finished The Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne,"After reading Robin Hobb’s ‘The Liveship Trilogy’, I was searching for other book series to read and John’s ‘The Bloodsworn Saga’ piqued my interest. 

In his acknowledgements, he said that he was inspired by Norse mythology and Beowulf. I could definitely tell about the former one. There were similarities between the gods in the book and the ones in Norse mythology, mostly just a name change; similar stories between gods. 

Recently after watching Viking shows like Vikings, The Last Kingdom, and Norsemen, I read the book description and thought it would be for me. Some of the terms from those shows are used in the book, so I understood what they were; which was a plus. 

If you enjoy Norse mythology, gore, Vikings, multiple POV’s, than this book series is for you. I’m looking forward to reading the second book in this series. ‘The Hunger of the Gods’. 

Here’s the description for those that are interested:

“Set in a brand-new, Norse-inspired world, and packed with myth, magic and bloody vengeance, The Shadow of the Gods begins an epic new fantasy saga from bestselling author John Gwynne. After the gods warred and drove themselves to extinction, the cataclysm of their fall shattered the land of Vigriò. Now a new world is rising, where power-hungry jarls feud and monsters stalk the woods and mountains. A world where the bones of the dead gods still hold great power for those brave - or desperate - enough to seek them out. Now, as whispers of war echo across the mountains and fjords,
fate follows in the footsteps of three people: a huntress on a dangerous quest, a noblewoman who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame, and a thrall who seeks vengeance among the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn. All three will shape the fate of the world as it once more falls under the shadow of the gods.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/umgeqr/finished_the_shadow_of_the_gods_by_john_gwynne/,2022-05-10 11:22:27,2,10,books
9nonoz,"In his own Divine Comedy, Dante gets less lines than his dead girlfriend and a shadow.","I was interested in how many lines each character in the *Divine Comedy* had, so I tried to look it up. No one had any answers online, so I counted. For context, the whole poem is 14,233 lines, divided into 100 cantos of around 142 lines each.

&#x200B;

1. Virgil's Shade: 1619 (*Inf.*: 1010, *Purg.*: 609)
2. Beatrice: 1114 (*Inf.*: 47, *Purg.*: 180, *Par.*: 887)
3. Dante: 1089 (*Inf.*: 432, *Purg.*: 305, *Par.*: 352)
4. Cacciaguida Alighieri: 298 (*Paradiso*)
5. St. Thomas d'Aquino: 288 (*Paradiso*)
6. Statius: 207 (*Purgatorio*)
7. The Eagle: 200 (*Paradiso*)
8. St. Bernard: 185 (*Paradiso*)
9. Emperor Justinian: 152 (*Paradiso*)
10. St. Bonaventure: 116 (*Paradiso*)

&#x200B;

I'm counting whatever a character is quoted as saying. EX: Virgil says, ""And she began to say, gentle and low, / With voice angelical, in her own language: / ‘O spirit courteous of Mantua\[.\]'"" The last line is counted for both Virgil and Beatrice, since Virgil is speaking it as her. I also decided to throw Dante a bone and counted his internal thoughts as lines whenever they're put in quotation marks. It isn't a stretch, since a good chunk of the characters read his mind.

&#x200B;

*Inferno* isn't well-represented mostly because its more environmentally-focused. For those interested, *Inferno*'s top 10 is Virgil, Dante, Guido del Montelfro (82), Count Ugolino (72), Master Adam (64), Brunetto Latini (55), Ulysses (53), Beatrice, Pier della Vigna (46), and Francesca da Rimini (38).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9nonoz/in_his_own_divine_comedy_dante_gets_less_lines/,2018-10-12 22:08:44,11,45,books
