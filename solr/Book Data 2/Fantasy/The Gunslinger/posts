wabe7o,"Just Finished Stephen King's ""The Gunslinger"" For the First Time [SPOILERS]","I literally only sat the book down a moment ago. It is the first book by King that I've read and now I see the hype. His prose, satisfyingly strange dialogue (""What should I call you? Star slut? Whore of the winds?"" lol), and constant intrigue made this book hard to put down. There's so much to unpack that I want to talk about but can't because nobody I know reads for pleasure. Here's a rapid fire of my thoughts: I can't believe Roland let Jake die! I loved that character. Is he really dead? Who is Walter? What worlds come next (if any at all)? Is this a story of getting back home? Rising to divinity? (**rhetorical**) It has such a huge premise and so many directions it could go.


It took me years to read it. I know King has a reputation for unsatisfying endings and I've heard others say this book was one you ""just get through"" because the second one was great. I found neither to be the case a loved it! I can't wait to watch the movie then read the next book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wabe7o/just_finished_stephen_kings_the_gunslinger_for/,2022-07-28 14:27:13,395,573,books
kpyw9k,Stephen King - The Gunslinger series,"You guys. I just (today) finished the last book. What an incredible journey. This is not at all what I thought of when I pictured Steven King (Carrie, It, Misery, The Shining). Uff. I laughed, I cried, I loved and lost. Holy crap. If you haven’t read it and are looking for a new book or series, just start with book one. Granted, it begins slow, but there’s a lot of stage to set for what ends up being 7 books I will never forget. Wow.

15z6jkb,"The Gunslinger (Book 1 of The Dark Tower) - first read, first thoughts, no spoilers.","No spoilers.

Pretty good for 11 quid! This wasn't the original version, it was the one with King's later revisions. It's the first King book I've actually enjoyed (I read *The Stand*, *Dreamcatcher*, and *Tommyknockers*, and didn't like them)- and I REALLY enjoyed it- but why is King allergic to good female characters?

**Judging books by their covers**

The one I got had a shitty ""cinematic"" digital art cover (no offence to the artist, but it wasn't great, and I didn't get the impression they read the book), with a permanent sticker telling me to go and watch the Major Motion Picture. I believe there is a circle in hell for the person who decides to put these things on covers. Let me know if I should watch the movie.

**Prose**

I've just ended a string of books by Cormac McCarthy, and I've come to love some nice, sparse prose, so The Gunslinger's prose was a nice palate-cleanser- crisp without endless adverbs. Very nice.

**King-isms**

The unnecessary sexualisation of every woman who appears throughout the story was so over-the-top it felt like self-parody. I understand King's sentiment that the original version was written by his less capable adolescent self, but this is the revised version- couldn't he have changed any of this? This was what I hated the most in a book I otherwise found it easy and enjoyable to get through. Ugh.

It seems even more of a shame when you look at how well-explored every other character was. I understood why Roland acted the way he did at every point, no matter the morality of it. The page or so describing Jake's backstory didn't feel like info-dumping even given how compressed it was, which is mildly impressive.

**Worldbuilding**

My favourite part. I loved the bizarre, decaying American fantasy world of The Gunslinger- it doesn't show much of it, but the hints you get make your imagination run wild. It felt like the bad trip it probably was, knowing King. 10/10 for worldbuilding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15z6jkb/the_gunslinger_book_1_of_the_dark_tower_first/,2023-08-23 15:07:49,23,5,books
n9y7gv,How do you enjoy The Gunslinger?,"I've read a few King books, they were always ok, entertaining enough and easy to read.  I have had so so so many people over the years tell me to read the Dark Tower series.  I generally read a lot of fantasy, and when I mention it, that's when people usually tell me I should read the Dark Tower.  So I just read the Gunslinger, good God, how does anyone enjoy this?  I can't believe this ever got published, let alone made into a movie.  There is 0 depth to any of the characters or the barely existent plot.  The plot makes no sense is very confusing/almost non existent.  The story jumps around so much and introduces characters, again with no depth, with no explanation, it makes it extremely difficult to figure out who anyone is and what their purpose is in the overall story.  I so thoroughly did not enjoy this book, it was actively making me angry while forcing myself to keep going.  It just makes no sense.  I obviously will not be continuing this series. 

I'm honestly asking the people who enjoyed it, how? And why?  What did you see in it that I didn't?  Did I miss some big major thing that ties it all together?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n9y7gv/how_do_you_enjoy_the_gunslinger/,2021-05-11 14:26:00,36,2,books

fun2bl,I've never read a book that was saved so hard by it's ending [The Gunsligner],"**EDIT**: *Contains Spoilers* (I thought that would be obvious considering I'm talking about the ending of a book but people complained lol)

I recently finished The Gunslinger and wooooow. I've been a Stephen King fan for a long time. I've always admired how -while he may not be the best writer- he's one of the best story-tellers of all time. But The Gunslinger was mostly fucking trash. After reading it, I found out that it was originally multiple short stories that ended up getting stitched together and that makes sense. Because the pacing of it all was so jerky and odd and nothing was explained.

Characters floated in and out of the spotlight and, unlike many books, it was really hard to tell if they were significant. I mean, I thought Allie was significant (btw that ""land of 19"" schtick was one of King's best horror-inducing premises I've read). But no -she was gone 30 pages later. And Jake? What the fuck? I thought he was going to be the Gunslinger's companion throughout the entire series when they finally caught the man in black. But to be fair, I'm only on book two now so I might eat these words.

The whole chase after after the man in black went like:

>""oooOOOooOOO we're never gonna catch him""

>""oh wait -he's right over those mountains""

>""Let's go into this cave and spend 50 boring pages in darkness with a bunch of unexplained zombie mutants""

>""Aight Jake, gotta sacrifice you bro, srry. XOXO cya l8r lol <3""

>""Ah finally, the man in black""

But god damn. That ""palaver"" between Roland and the man in black was so fucking good. The imagery and anxiety inducing grandness of Roland's mission single-handedly saved that book. I honestly believe King did a better job explaining the mind-crushing vastness of existence better than any physicist out there ever could.

When Jake died I was about ready to give up on the series. But that scene single-handedly somehow made me eager to pick up book two and now I'm loving the series. The whole ""door into people's mind's"" thing is fucking great.

I guess that's my drunken rant. It's a really good book but only because of its badass ending. Anyway, thanks for coming to my tedtalk.

9abbtu,Am I missing something about The Gunslinger?,"I’m a pretty big Stephen King fan and have read several of his books and always really enjoyed them. So whenever I say that, the Dark Tower series always gets brought up and how if I like Stephen King, I need to read this series, it’s his magnum opus, etc. After a million recommendations and hearing they were making it into a movie, I decided to collect the books. 

Since then I started grad school and didn’t have much time for them and kept putting them aside but finally started and finished the gunslinger a month or two ago and.....I feel like I don’t get it. It feels like there should be a prequel to it. There’s so much random stuff that seems like I should already know it but I don’t so it seems out of place. The overall story doesn’t really make sense and the justification for the world seems convoluted (even by King standards). And it’s really short in a way that I’d never expect from King. 

I forced myself through it, telling myself that it’ll get better but once it ended, I felt like it was a fantasy waiting for godot. Nothing happened and nothing was explained. It totally killed any excitement I had for the rest of the series since all I’ve heard is that it goes downhill from there. 

So my question is, am I missing something here or is my favorite author’s magnum opus just not for me? I hope it’s the former because the latter would just be really dissatisfying.

f4s7tw,Do the Dark Tower books start to make sense eventually?,My feelings on The Gunslinger are mixed. On one hand the world is so intriguing and interesting along with Roland's past home. A lot of that interest though comes from the mystery of it.

gaujix,"The Dark Tower Series: I’ve read The Gunslinger, should I bother to keep reading?","I’m not gonna lie I’m pretty disappointed with this book - it was honestly just a boring story. I guess I was thinking that the concept of a cowboy in a post apocalyptic world chasing a mysteriously magical “man in black” would be exciting and action packed. However, with the exception of 1 or 2 scenes, I really felt like I had to slog through the book. At the end of it I was left with a feeling of “that’s it?”. 

I get that it’s a long series, so it’s probably laying groundwork for the rest of the series, but shit I don’t want to waste my time if the other 7 books are just as dull as this one was. Or even if it “doesn’t get good” until like book 5 or something.

I am a High School Math Teacher at an At-Risk school. This is my first year at this particular school district and I'm not from this state. Going into this job, I did not know about the school's reputation. There is a lot of gang violence, drop-outs, attempted suicides, and you get the idea.


Anyway, everyday during lunch I walk past this student (who isn't in any of my classes) who's been slowly reading Stephen King's *Bag of Bones* before she goes and eats with friends. I decided to start striking up conversation with her most days about her working on the book.

I decided last week that it would be kind of cool if I bought her another book if she wanted to read it. So I promised her that when she finished this book, I would bring her a copy of *The Gunslinger* so that she can start the *Dark Tower* Series.


Part of me wants to write something in it, but I'm not sure what or if that would be a nice touch. It's on the way because I ordered it off of Amazon. I think I have, at most, until next Monday. I've never done something like this, but I'm curious if Reddit had any suggestions.

fw09vn,Question about the Dark Tower [The Gunslinger Spoilers],"Warning: Spoilers for The Gunslinger

I stopped reading the Dark Tower series after the first book when I reached the end last year. I could simply not sympathize in any way, shape, or form with a protagonist who kills a child. 

However, I thought it was worth asking: 

(1) Is he not meant to be the protagonist?

(2) Is there some greater goal which is truly worth the death of a child, liking saving a great number of lives?

(3) Does the gunslinger ever face just torment and punishment for his terrible deeds?

I am considering continuing on to the second book; after all, it is a sign of the incredible quality of the series that the ending gave me such a repulsive, emotional response.

I just finished The Gunslinger and I've gotta say I was primarily disappointed. Regaled as Stephen King' s magnum opus, the Dark Tower Series was highly recommended to me and I went in with high hopes.

However, whether because it was written 30 years ago when King was a budding author or it's the first in its series, I felt the entire novel was difficult to complete (even though it was a short 251 pages). It was slow, confusing, contained overly flowery writing, and disparate at times.

8q6e71,Why do people think The Gunslinger / Dark Tower series is good?,"I am a massive science fiction & fantasy book fan, reading everything from the classics like Jules Verne, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov to modern urban fantasy like Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden books.

In comparison to things I listed above that I would call ""good"" fiction, The Gunslinger stands out as really badly written. It has some good world ideas splashed around (like the Gunslingers themselves), but is generally very poorly executed.
I will try to give some examples, without digging up specific passages.

1. King is too verbose in his description of mundane things. The barkeepers physical traits and the hardpan in the desert, among *many* other things

2. Horribly out of place psycho sexual scenes. Being aroused by the obese preacher and the predictably bad encounter with the forest demon.

3. Whatever passes for conflict/action/resolution in the book is frankly confusing. The entire encounter with the underground mine-cart mutants was supposed to be suspenseful I think? I was only motivated to flip past it as quickly as possible because that entire section was awful to read.

For people who hold The Dark Tower series, and The Gunslinger specifically, in high regards I have two questions.

A. Why do you like The Gunslinger?

B. What exposure do you have to other sci-fi and fantasy books?

So, I the book has arrived and I added the inscription. Clearly, I am an expert calligrapher, but I'm really excited. I haven't given it to her yet, but as soon as she finishes the book I will get it to her. Hopefully, this Tuesday or Wednesday based on where she was last week.

I got the revised first book, but I think that's no major issue. As far as my research shows, it's close to the original with slight pushes on stronger characters and less-than-subtle hints at future plot points.

I also have the second book ready to get to her when she finishes! I don't think I need to add another inscription for any other books. My goal is to finish her out on the series and get her through the entire Dark Tower series!


Also, I think it might be weird to have her take pictures for karma. So don't expect any other Updates like that. Maybe one when she finishes the series!

6mjszs,The Dark Tower series is adrenalized garbage. (not counting the non-revised Gunslinger.),"As someone who read every book, the only ones worth a damn are the original Gunslinger novel (Non-revised edition) and the Drawing of the Three, which still committed character assassination on Roland in order to make him vulnerable for no real reason. The original was roughly written in parts but by God it was a good read with a protagonist I enjoyed and world building that was fun and adventurous.

The   sequels gave me cities filled with syphilitic hobos, mentally unstable trains, fucking talking raccoons, psychic junkies, and schizophrenia and autism as super powers. And don't get mes tarted on the bullshit Harry Potter Tie-in with the Heat-seeking exploding golden snitches, Steven King writing himself into the book as a character who is writing the books from WITHIN the books: a trope so played out my high school D&D game included it, and enough made up nonsense words to make Robert Jordan roll in his gigantic grave.  

P.S. Seriously, try reading the first chapter of the final book without a glossary at hand, it's 50% made up gibberish: He held up the skolpada and the Taheen whispered ""Oh sai, what a lovely bauble."" I mean even in context of the scene that contains this sentence that makes no fucking sense without reading the glossary, and believe me I had to flip to the back of the book to find out wtf I'd just read. No really, tell me what Skolpada, Sai, and Taheen mean without access to the goddamn glossary. And the ending is garbage,the author even warns you to stop reading the epilogue. It's not high concept, it's fucking lazy writing! 

 And anyone who tries to tell me Steven King isn't capable of publishing lazy trash for an easy payday hasn't read Desperation and the Regulators; in order examples of both great writing and a lazy cash grab that insults the readers intelligence while simultaneously showcasing Kings ability to ingest his body weight in mescaline and still slam his fingers onto a typewriter.

It’s been a really long time since I’ve read a book all the way through for pleasure, and I was away all weekend and just randomly thought I’d give a crack at The Dark Tower series. The book is unlike anything I’ve ever read, such a crazy mix of genres I’ve never seen before! I can’t tell if I really liked it, but I think I did? Anyways, here’s some of my questions:

1) Do I have to have read King’s other books to enjoy this series? I’ve read that it ties together a lot of his other stories, but truth be told the only other King book I’ve read other than The Gunslinger is Cujo. Should I read some of his other classic horror novels before reading the rest of The Dark Tower?

2) Does the series get any easier to understand? I enjoyed The Gunslinger but it was pretty hard to follow at times.

I’m pretty excited at the idea of getting into a new book series but I’m wondering if this one is too daunting or not. Feedback would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9305te/just_finished_reading_stephen_kings_the/,2018-07-30 02:10:44,19,16,books

8elno6,Just finished The Dark Tower series a couple of days ago and it’s taken me this long to think about and wrap my head around the ending.,"I was hesitant to start this series; I’m a huge fan of King and I’ve read lots of his novels and I knew these books were going to hold something different. I quickly began to love the characters and the premise (I think after the town shootout in “The Gunslinger”, I knew I wouldn’t be able to put these books down) and swept through the series. 

Reaching the end of “The Dark Tower”, I knew there had to be a twist. King ended the epilogue with Susannah, Jake, and Eddie reuniting, albeit without the memories of Mid-World (this made me sad but happy too?). King warns that reading any more after this may “ruin the experience” for some readers but of course, we read on. Roland walking into the final room and realizing with a shock at what he had found made be yell out loud. 

How many times has Roland gone through this? What has he changed, if anything? I feel like I have so many questions yet this was the only way Roland’s story could end (?). 

I would love to see an HBO adaptation or a good movie series (haven’t seen the actual movie and don’t plan too!). 

Just thought I’d share some of my thoughts. I loved this series and love how King ties his other works into the story. 

Edit: Thanks for all of the comments! I wasn’t expecting this much feedback but I’m glad I’m not alone in my thoughts on the ending and the series in general. Sounds like Amazon has a series on the way at some point so I’ll be waiting for that! And it sounds like the movie may be worth watching if I go into with the right mindset (if it doesn’t have Oy dual-wielding revolvers, I’m gonna be pissed).

King continues to use names of characters as nouns instead of proper names. Oh and the conversations typically do not end in ""Gunslinger said"" ""Zoltan said"". They're simply quotes and they're kinda hard to follow.


That's it. The man in Black, I get it. But when there's other men/man in the world, why does he refer to them as ""man"" as well. I'm at the Shebs scene and it's unclear whether the man he encountered with green teeth is the man in black or just a man.

4dvj5j,"Stephen King was among the authors that rekindled my love for reading 2 years ago, but the more I read the worse I find his works","First of all, let me say that I enjoyed King's books. I read ""It"", ""The Gunslinger"", ""The Long Walk"" and ""The Green Mile"". The Gunslinger wasn't the greatest read but the other three were definitely solid or good and particularly ""It"" got me back into reading. However, the more books I read the less fond I grow of King's books. Granted, it's only been 4 books and possibly not the very best of the bunch but I have to admit that his insane popularity does surprise me a bit as his books tend to have pretty big flaws.
I find his rambling to be a huge turn off. His books could be shorter without losing out on anything worthwhile and oftentimes I feel like he follows up with a long boring chapter after a tense cliff hanger just to not blow his load too quickly. I can see why one would approve of that method of keeping the tension up but particularly in ""It"" I just got frustrated by that way too often. 
Then, he clearly just starts writing with a vague but possibly cool idea in mind without considering how exactly he can conclude the story. He seems very enthusiastic about the idea he came up with and at some point comes to realization that he has to wrap all the stuff he wrote. King is the exact opposite of a write like Brandon Sanderson for instance who plans his twists 2 books ahead. And frankly, I appreciate Sanderson's approach A LOT more.

So yeah, thanks for getting me back into reading. I was told I should get into King's short stories which I might do at some point. The 4 books I read were good but not extraordinary and the more writers I get to know, the more apparent King's flaws become.

I’m Doug Engstrom, and I write science fiction. My debut release is Corporate Gunslinger, a near-future SF thriller released in June. It’s the story of Kira Clark, a young woman who took on large debts to pursue an MFA in acting. Her debts are secured by a “lifetime services contract” that obligates her to give her creditors complete control over her life if she fails to make her payments. When her finances go sideways and she finds herself facing foreclosure, she takes what seems to be the only way out—becoming a gunfighter for an insurance company, representing her employer on the high-tech dueling fields that have become the last, fatal stop in the American judicial system.
It’s a story about the broken promise of work, the crushing burden of debt, and how to live with impossible choices. But it’s not entirely dark—the line “Either take this thing or admit you haven’t got the ovaries to handle it.” is in there.

I got The Gunslinger, read it all in a few days, and... I was severely disappointed. Maybe I had too high expectations, but the book was confusing, not engaging, and felt like something written without a plot. 

Just like Alice in Wonderland, it feels like things just happen randomly and the story isn't building up to an actual end. I've also read the Witcher series, and the main character also falls so short when compared with Geralt, who is far more interesting, has a much stronger moral compass, and clear motivations for his actions. Roland, on the other hand, seems 1-dimensional, just after the man in black for whatever reason.

wcrux1,"The Dark Tower kinda sucks, no?","I was gifted a free (old, 1st ed) Kindle w/ the Dark Tower series on it, so I read the 1st book. It felt surprisingly amateurish, I honestly couldn't believe how disappointed I was in it all-around:

* the meager character development,
* thin plot that relies almost entirely on mystery the readers' intrigue,
* an inevitable and trite confrontation at the end of an overall predictable odyssey.
* The fictional world development, again, just felt anemic.
* And I ***hate*** (and am insulted by!) the way he wrote the female ""characters"", oh my god - and why does the gunslinger feel so many of his (nonsexual) feelings in his loins??
* Even the language, again it's borderline amateurish, just a lot of dull sentences reinforced with wholly unnecessary colorful adjectives, and way too much description of landscape that's done *much* better by other writers (Jean M Auel comes to mind).
* Dialogue is built riddle upon riddle, as though he trusts the reader to follow the breadcrumb trail, and then - agonizingly - the reader is patronized *over and over again* with reminders: ""Allie, you know, the girl with the scar I fucked and then killed? The one from the town. The murder spree, remember? With all the people? After all the sex? That Allie."" JFC YES WE REMEMBER, would you care to clarify *anything else in this goddamn plot?!*

The Afterword was the most well-written part of the entire book, and that was written in the form of a letter from King to the reader (EDIT - though he did compare himself to *fucking Chaucer, the nerve!*). I will say there were chunks of prose, few and far between, where I admired the writing, and tiny sprinkles of other well-utilized language here and there.

I know people (men/boys mostly) who have been totally enamored with this series and there is not a single thing I find appealing about it. I can only imagine that their interest is in identifying, somehow, with the pallid stoicism of the gunslinger whose emotions are Oedipal and un-evolved. I truly believe if this wasn't written by King it would have been passed over as some creative writing exercise by a neckbeard wannabe.

Shall not be reading the rest of them. Ugh. **UGH I SAY.**

**EDIT:** Downvoted a bunch so far but no substantive arguments to the contrary. If you disagree, *why do you disagree?* I need some explanation from an alternate viewpoint.

fwi1xx,It bothers me when authors reuse the same rare word shortly after using it the first time.,"At some point in my life, the idea was put in my head that using the same words in relatively quick succession was bad writing. Usually excluding common words, especially articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, but  ""he/she said"" can get old if it occurs after each character speaks. 

I didn't even think it was an opinion for most of my life, it was a truth that governed how I wrote and that I used to judge other people's writing. I sometimes feel like I get a glimpse into the author's creative process, perhaps they had a word on their mind that they wanted to use so subconsciously they created opportunities to use it several times. 

I wish I could think of more examples, but all I've got right now is ""stertorous"" which means ""adj. (Of breathing) noisy and labored"" and which has occurred only pages apart for a second time in Dracula, by Bram Stoker, inspired this post. It hasn't happened in this book many times, but I remember observing it in pretty much every chapter of The Gunslinger, by Stephen King. 

The words aren't being used wrong, it's just that if I were writing, I would have found another way to express the thought. 

Really the point in posting, as I've considered posting about it many times, is that I'm curious to know if anyone else notices it.

5h1hik,Stephen King's The Stand... WOW!,"I just finished reading The Stand, well listening to it. I got it as my free book on Audible and have been listening to it in the car. I drive around a lot for work so I could listen for good long stretches at a time. 

Anyway, I found this book incredibly engrossing. There were many evenings when I found myself continuing the book once I'd got home from work. I started the book after reading 11/22/63 and The Shining and, I thought The Stand was so much better than the other King books and short stories I've read this year. It was just so epic. I enjoyed the references to Tolkien, it really fit. I'm happy I experienced this story. The characters and setting were so believable. [When characters died](/spoiler) I was always nearly holding back tears. AND THE ENDING! [It was a happy ending only bittersweet knowing the sacrifices the survivors endured. I wish I could keep knowing these people and learn what happens to them and the rest of the world after Flagg is defeated(?). I suppose I can read the other books Flagg is in? Are they just as good? I'll find out.](/spoiler)

There is one thing that's bothering me, the reason I decided to stop lurking and make a reddit account, [what happened to Joe/Leo? That child had been through so much but, the ending doesn't really explain what happens to him. Does he stay with Lucy in Boulder? Fran and Stu head back to Maine with baby Peter, staying only long enough to see Lucy birth twins. So is Joe/Leo ok?](/spoiler) 

Please excuse me if The Stand has been discussed to death here, I just wanted to share how much I enjoyed it. 

BRAVO STEPHEN, THE STAND WAS A GREAT BOOK!

One last question: Baby can you dig your man? 

Edit -  I'm enjoying the short stories in King's [Bazaar of Bad Dreams](http://i.imgur.com/urWutsS.jpg) but, I think I'm in need of something a bit more lighthearted.

And I decided it was finally time to jump into the Dark Tower series since it always seemed really appealing to me. I had it recommended to me quite a few times and was really excited to start it. However so far Gunslinger has me feeling like I missed something. Granted I'm only about half way through but I feel like I've picked up a book that's already a ways into a series rather then the first of one. Now I had heard this series was a bit on the strange side so I guess I'm just asking if, or when, does the plot start to make a little more sense.

16658px,Has a screen adaptation of a book ever put you off the actual source material entirely?,"Books that seemed  hilarious/epic/transcendant on paper but just flopped. Maybe didn't translate well enough onto celluloid and actually just put you off the book/series entirely.  I'm not talking about the ones that were blockbusters and made millions and millions even though fans still pointed out where the adaptation went wrong but it still managed to bring in new readers .ie: The Potterverse. I'm talking about the adaptations that failed to hit the mark almost entirely and didn't bring in more fans to the source material or maybe drips and drabs. 

For me, it has to be **The Magpie Murders**. The tv show pacing is atrocious, Susan Reyland's character is so ...**not her** even Atticus Pund - heck all the actors chosen are probably capable actors but in the context of the book it was just a big fat no. I had to seriously question my taste in detective mysteries and wonder if the book was even good to begin with. Even worse,  it just put me off all Anthony Horowitz's work entirely especially as he was literally integral to the tv series adaptation.  

Second Adaptation but not as bad as to turn me against the books.

I hate to even utter these words I'm such a fan - **Discworld, Terry Pratchett**. I love these books so much. But every screen adaptation just seems to miss the mark for me, it lacks that...that..quintessential Discworldian energy. I can't put my finger on it.

8oz9ki,A stupid thing that irritates me about The Gunslinger way more that it should (light spoiler warning for the first chapter of the novel),"I actually ust recently (like half a year ago) got into reading books and I enjoy it more and more. Currently I've started to read The Gunslinger by Stephen King (just finished the first chapter (""The Gunslinger"") ) as my second King novel, the first one being Misery.  And while at this very early point of time I think that the writing in Misery, at least for me, was way better I still very much enjoy The Gunslinger so far. But there is one tiny stupid thing, probably not even worth mentioning, that irritates me way more than it should that I just have to get it off my chest (maybe light spoilers from the beginning of the book ahead):

So the gunslinger meets a named Brown and his pet raven Zoltan. Eventually the gunslinger starts to tell about his experiences in the city of Tull. What irritates me is that the story that the gunslinger tells is written in third\-person view. Personally I would have found it much better if it was written in first\-person view giving much more the expression that it actually is the gunslinger that tells his story and not some flashback kind of thing where a random narrator tells the story of the gunslinger.

Yeah I know it's a stupid thing to be irritated about.

2vkitu,So I've recently finished the Dark Tower series...,"After a time lurking on r/books during which I was reading my own random assortment from the unread titles on my shelf, I browsed this sub for some ideas on what to read and gathered that The Dark Tower sounded like just what I'm into...and I wasn't mistaken.

I grabbed the first book in October and was absorbed in the series nonstop from that point. I devoured each one, reading in any spare time and staying up late to finish chapters. I think I read Song of Susannah in 3 or 4 days. When it came down to the seventh and final installment it was like I was on my own quest - neither my local library nor the one just north of me had it and I had to track it down after a bit of a drive, and it was worth it. 

I haven't been so engrossed and INVESTED in such an epic story since I was younger reading the Harry Potter books. The characters came to life for me and there were a few times at night I actually had dreams of gunslingers. The ending of the final book, I had to remove myself from the house (TV was on, parents talking) and finish it in peace, and once it was done, I didn't know what to do with myself. I was emotionally drained and felt like an era had ended. 

Anyway, thank you r/books for pointing me toward that story and more (I just started On The Road by Jack Kerouac). I think this is a cool community and I hope to be more active in sharing. 


EDIT: This blew up, and I'm glad for all your responses. Definitely a lot more displeasure with the way King ended the series than I knew (both the last few books, and the way book 7 wrapped up in particular). I totally dig that so many were disgruntled by the end. To answer some of the main questions folks have asked me:

What did I think of the ending? I was not as unhappy with it as many others were. I enjoyed all seven books, however forced/contrived King might have made it while under pressure to complete the series. As I replied to one user, it may have helped that I started recently. I probably had the revised(?) editions some people mentioned so it may have flowed better, and also I didn't have to wait years and years for the next book just to find a contrived twist later on. 

Have I read supplementary/related works? Nope, but I will now! I think I'll start with The Stand, and also search for the graphic novels which sound cool. I'm hoping to take a road trip to Canada in the not-too-distant future and will invest in audiobooks at that point too.

Thanks all for the discussion, and for bringing me to a new favorite! For those unhappy with the way it ended, I wish for you a fine new saga that will be everything you hope for. There'll be water if god wills it.

cfatek,Just tried to read Stephen King for the first time,"I've always been meaning to read Stephen King. I've seen a bunch of the movies based on his books and have been consistently impressed at the lore and settings of them. I even watched the Dark Tower movie, because I was bored and drunk one night. Despite this, I decided to start with The Gunslinger. 

I picked it up yesterday and read the first two thirds of it in a straight go. I'll be surprised if I pick it up again. I have a lot of problems with the book. 

***warning: Minor spoilers for The Gunslinger by Stephen King***

The Gunslinger is so god damn aggravating to read, because it's great. It's compelling, the setting and mood is spot on, and I genuinely want to know the secrets of this strange world and the strange people and beings that inhabit it. 

And then Stephen King mentions a woman. And I want to claw out my fuckin' eyes. 

I don't want to nitpick, and I know Stephen King has a really troubled past, and whatever, but holy shit the portrayal of women in this book is so troublesome to the point of distraction. Every single named female character is a whore or a cook. That's not even an exaggeration. Allie, the only female character with positive characterization, is so god damn horny all the time that she doesn't trust herself around men. 

I'm not going to go on, because things just get worse. I stopped reading when the gunslinger dropped mescaline to have sex with a demon. 

So, I'm wondering if Stephen King's other books continue this sort of misogynistic bent, or if he does get better. I understand that The Gunslinger was one of his first stories, and I get the sort of writer that he is, and that he goes into some pretty dark parts of the human experience, but The Gunslinger just made me feel gross, because I got the sense that the storyteller was getting off on the terrible stuff he was saying.

wyqmgt,I love The Stand and really didn't think I would.,"Hey folks! Normally I'm actually not a big book reader. But after finishing the Dark Tower series by Stephen King and adoring it I wasn't sure where to go next.

I'm more into fantasy adventure (back in my early teens) but haven't read much.  I randomly decided to try The Gunslinger and was hooked. But I figured I wouldn't like anything else by King because it wouldn't be in that genre. 

Long story short I eventually tried The Stand and even on my second read through (immediately after the first) I just can't put it down! 

It's really hard for me to place what I love so much about it. As I said normally I read fantasy and adventure so I can enjoy that, and normally don't care for characters that much. But I think I'm really enjoying these characters and seeing what they do in the world. I'm invested in the good guys as well at the terrible monster people King creates. You believe that happy crappy?

In between rereading The Stand, I've started Salem's Lot. I'm liking it quite a bit as well but after this I'm not sure where I'll go next.

txupxi,"Just finished the first book I've read in over a decade: Stephen King's ""It""","I read a lot in high school because we didn't all have phones yet, and Stephen King was mostly what I read back then. When the age of never-ending scrolling came along, the time I used to spend on books was spent on social media instead. I'm old and self-aware enough to realize this isn't good for me, so I'm making an effort to replace my scrolling with books again.

I bought a paperback copy of *It* for $20 when the most recent movies came out, but it sat on a shelf collecting dust and intimidating me whenever I'd look over and see how thick it was; the only other books I've read that were comparable to *It*'s size were the Harry Potter books, and I tapped out halfway through the 5th one because it was so slow and boring. But after seeing the remakes and hearing everyone talk about how different/better the book is, I finally decided to un-waste the $20 I spent on *It*, and began reading it every night before bed.

I finished it last night after 3 weeks of reading, and I wholeheartedly agree with everyone who said it's better than the movies. The final battle between It and The Losers Club was so much better than them just insulting It to death. The way It used the oblivious adults in Derry to commit random atrocities was amazing, and felt like a much bigger part of the story than the movies let on. I could go on about how much better the book is than the movies, but I digress.

*It* has rekindled my love of reading books again, and I'm going to keep on with the trend of reading long-ass Stephen King books by picking up *The Stand* after I finish *The Gunslinger* and *The Drawing of the Three*.

6aufj1,How do you feel about books with movie scene covers or 'Soon to be a major motion picture' printed on the front?,"Ordered The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger and it arrived with ['Soon to be a major motion picture' printed on the cover](http://i.imgur.com/N9nn1CM.jpg) which upsets me far more than it should.  

I don't know how to explain it but I just feel it takes something away from the book (obviously not the story though and does not affect my opinion of the story when reading it).  Perhaps it's because it doesn't seem as timeless.  Soon it will be irrelevant.  I think it would be better if it was just a sticker.

I also avoid movie covers for books.

56madj,The Dark Tower ending [spoilers],"Ka is like a wheel, its one purpose to turn, and in the end it always comes back to the place where it started.


I just finished the Dark Tower and I have to say, I think the ending is perfect, how else could it of ended?

So many questions, I feel just as I felt when I finished the gunslinger or when I began, The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed, again.

I'm not really sure how to feel to be honest, angry? shocked? happy? definitely not happy.. 
Did anyone stop when King warned us? He wasn't wrong but the tower pulls us as well.

How did you feel when it was over? (if it ever is) I feel like I have to read it again.

nrtoa4,Why is “The Drawing of the Three” considered the best book in the Dark Tower series?,"I’m about 2/3 done with The Drawing of the Three, and I am not seeing the hype around the story. To me the plot of this second book seems drawn out and not that eventful (granted I haven’t finished the book yet). I enjoyed the first book because we not only got to meet Jake and the Man in Black but we also got deeper insight into who the gunslinger is and what is past was like. This book is mostly just Rolland picking up and traveling with random people from the regular Earth world on some sort of quest that I am not completely understanding yet. Am I missing something? If I don’t like this book should I even continue reading the series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nrtoa4/why_is_the_drawing_of_the_three_considered_the/,2021-06-04 01:44:30,24,28,books
qw0kbm,The Dark Tower Series - Help understanding book one,"I just finished reading book one of the Dark Tower Series so please no spoilers. But, I'm trying to understand what I just read.

As a background, I read a lot. I also consider myself quite educated. However, after reading book one, I'm so confused. 

Here is my take and please, if someone can tell me if I'm on the right path or if I'm completely lost. 

The Gunslinger, Roland, is some kind of immortal being who was trained as a fighter/killer. The book takes place in some kind of apocalyptic world maybe thousands of years in the future. Or is it an alternate universe? 

I'm not quite sure I fully understand who the man in black is. He seems to be a representation of the character Marten. But, I didn't understand who Marten was. The exchange between him and Roland confused me. Why did Roland feel the need to take the test with Cort after that talk? How did Marten threaten him? And how did the man in black bring Nort back to life? Who is he???

Then, there's Jake. From his story, I'm guessing he grew up somewhere like New York city. But, how did he end up in this place? He died and then was brought to this world? Then, does that mean this world is some kind of after life? But the people in Tull never died previously (other than Tort). Or is Jake some kind of imagined character to Roland? Who or what is Jake supposed to represent? I get his death (in this world) is supposed to mean something as it seemed to affect Roland because he did love him. But, what was his purpose to Roland? 

I'm going to continue reading the series but, I'd like to know if I'm on the right path in my analysis so I don't get completely confused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qw0kbm/the_dark_tower_series_help_understanding_book_one/,2021-11-17 14:33:52,73,23,books
96wyz0,Opinions on the writing style in Stephen King's The Dark Tower,"So I recently started re-reading SK's *The Gunslinger*. The first time I read through the series, I thought that King's harsh and jarring writing style was quite appropriate for the books. 

However, especially after reading *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy, I find myself slightly ticked off everytime King repeats the same word three times in a sentence, or when he seems to use the wrong word on purpose.

I'd like to know you guys' thoughts on King's writing style in these books (Especially *The Gunslinger*).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/96wyz0/opinions_on_the_writing_style_in_stephen_kings/,2018-08-13 09:45:47,14,0,books
17e2w3o,I finished the Dark Tower Serise by Stephen King,"Over the summer I was given a lend of the books and I also got some on audible as I found it was a great listening experience. 

I really enjoyed reading the afterwords by King and finding out some more detail about his feelings on the books, the audio narrators etc (for example the fact that he edited the first book at a later point, which was the version I read). 

So my thoughts I believe my least favourite were the first and the last books. I enjoyed King being featured to a point but the full amount of his character I did not always enjoy. I found it interesting that his own characters did not always like him though. 

I absolutely loved and was excited by the Salems lot cross over and the low men in yellow coats. Over the years I've read so many books and stories of his including UR so all the final links makes so much sense about multiple universes, it all clicked into place. 

I read a couple of reviews and I have to agree that the Mordrid vignette was a bit anticlimactic. I had wondered was Mordrid going to be linked more to IT, or that it would in fact be IT. 

I absolutely loved Oy and I was so sad at his death, I had wished he got to go back to Jake in his living form. It mentioned a version of him will get to turn up in the universe with Jake, Eddie and Sushanna but I wished it hadn't happened the way it did. 

Finally the ending, very trippy and I thought maybe as King himself says, it had to be this ending. The fact we have Ka and the Turtle it made me think of Karma and reincarnation from the Bhagwad Gita. He is being perpetually punished because he isn't fully capable of change. It also reminded me of the insanity in secrete window at the end for some reason but I'm not sure why, more the writing style, the idea of perpetual unfixable insanity than the character itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17e2w3o/i_finished_the_dark_tower_serise_by_stephen_king/,2023-10-22 20:47:23,9,15,books

ld90lc,"The Dark Tower Series Gets Better, Right?","I recently just finished the first dark tower book, and I gotta say I wasn't a fan.

There were parts that I enjoyed, sure. But for the most part I found it all a confusing mess. Plus the writing ticked me off a little, like he attempts some kind of world building by having the gunslinger talk different, or have a backstory that wasn't really explained, but there was no explanation. Not even subtle.

Even ignoring the writing, I couldn't find much I enjoyed. The little things I did like was the desert oasis, it was a great setting. And the plot was...good enough. Plus Tull had a lonely, atmospheric vibe that I liked.

""Like the world had moved on.""

However, I'm not going to devote months of reading to a series I won't enjoy. I will probably read the second book, just because of that ending! But I sincerely want to know if the series gets better from here, because some people rate the first book as the best, and if that is the case there is no way I can continue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ld90lc/the_dark_tower_series_gets_better_right/,2021-02-05 15:05:24,35,18,books

I realize that that list is some of his best, but I thought that the Stand would be up there with the rest.

45ct4u,"Just finished Stephen King's The Dark Tower series for the first time and I wanted to share my thoughts. Beware, spoilers ahead!","I first tried reading The Gunslinger when i was in high school but it didn't click with me then so I stopped. However, after hearing about this how good this series is for years, I decided to give it another shot a few months ago and I am so happy I did. This has to be one of my favorite book series (though I think IT is still my favorite SK book). I loved the ending of book 7, it payed off for me big time, I love how the last line of the book is the first line of The Gunslinger. I got the hint in somewhere around the middle of the Wastelands that the series would end the way it did (also all of the references to Ka being a wheel kinda solidified my theory before I finished 7) so I wasn't very surprised with what Roland found behind the door at the top of the Tower. Also, I thought Roland starting the next cycle with the Horn of Eld was a nice touch. Idk how they are going to turn this series into a movie series, they are going to have to cut it to pieces, plus with Idris Elba most likely playing Roland they are basically throwing 2/3 of the plot of Drawing of the Three out the window so I am not super excited for it even though I love Elba and think he is a great actor and would make a good Roland.

First of all, it's a German kid. You'd think he'd know that particular German word. 
Secondly, even if he was an English kid ( let's not get to how an English kid would be in Nazi Germany), he's still too old to use easy words in place of difficult ones like this. Kids do that when they are around 3-4 years old. 9 year olds are actually pretty advanced when it comes to language. 
And then his 12 year old sister goes to call Auschwitz ""Out With"". I mean, at this point, are you kidding me? Kids learn algebra at this age, but oh no, this girl can't get the proper pronunciation of a name. Heaven forbid that she actually reads it somewhere and corrects herself!

I never thought the ending would live up to the promise that was constantly hinted at throughout all the books, but I have to admit I loved the ending and really couldn't imagine it ending any other way (even though I never for a moment imagined the ending the way it is).

Blitzed through the first chapter and am really enjoying it, especially thinking of Idris Elba as the Gunslinger.

7vz0oe,I Loved the Last Three Dark Tower Books [Spoilers],"So I just finished the Dark Tower last night, and I wanted to discuss the series. So to grab everyone's attention, I thought I'd post one of my more controversial opinions of the series: I loved the last three DT books, while I thought Wizard and Glass was a slog and The Waste Lands was ultimately unsatisfying. 

I think my overall ranking is: 

*  Wolves of the Calla

*  Drawing of the Three

* The Gunslinger
 
* Wind through the Keyhole

*  The Dark Tower

*  Song of Susannah

GAP

*    The Waste Lands

BIG GAP

* Wizard and Glass

**Brief Explanation of Rankings** 

Wolves was by far my favorite for a few reasons. The first is that we actually get to see the ka-tet act as gunslingers of old, helping those that are unable to help themselves. Loved the *Magnificent Seven* vibe of it, and, more importantly, loved the (re)introduction of Pere Callahan. I'm a sucker for the doubting, struggling, flawed Catholic priest trope (go read Graham Greene's *The Power and the Glory,* if it does ya fine), and I loved *Salem's Lot,* so The Pere's character arc was a favorite of mine.  

*Drawing of the Three*, *The Gunslinger*, and *Wind through the Keyhole* really show off King's ability when the story is nice and tight. Plot moves along at a good clip, you get a lot of ""showing, not telling"" of character traits, especially in the Gunslinger, and overall the structure of each of the books is really satisfying.

I did not hate the meta-ness of the final two books at all. The Dark Tower, in my opinion, is Stephen King's Ode to Story-telling. The references to other series (Wizard of Oz, LOTR, Harry Potter) and to his own works show how important King thinks the act of telling stories is. So it didn't bother me that he placed himself, as a story teller, in the story he's telling about story-telling. It made sense to me, in a weird way. I didn't particularly like the Mordred and Flagg payoffs either, but on the whole I really really liked Books 6 & 7. Each character got a satisfying send off. I loved Susannah being stronger than Roland in a sense, and able to turn down the allure of the Tower in order to go find peace with her new family. Likewise, the ending of the series, being a meta way to reference re-reading Roland's journey, was also satisfying to me. 

Why I didn't love *The Waste Lands*: two reasons, primarily. The first is that the entire first half of the book felt like it should have been at the end of the *Drawing of the Three*. Even as a first time reader, I knew that Jake was going to make it to Mid-World. There was no tension for me there, so it was more just like reading 300 pages urging King to hurry up and get Jake to Mid-World so we could move on with the story. Secondly, there were lots of **VERY IMPORTANT THINGS** in the book that had a really weak payoff. Roland going insane could have been a really interesting arc, but instead it gets solved immediately when Eddie carves the key. Likewise, Eddie's ability to carve is really important for the key, but then is barely ever mentioned again the rest of the series. The Tick-Tock man is set up at the end to be a scary villain that pursues the ka-tet for a while, then is summarily shot and forgotten in like three pages at the end of *Wizard and Glass*.

Which brings me to the book at the bottom of my rankings. W&G has a good book hidden, but it's obscured by an un-needed 300 pages. Roland learning how to act as a leader, meeting and losing Susan, learning his purpose in life to seek the Tower, and finding out he kills his mother is a good story, but there's way too much fluff.

ivs0rj,I'm making custom Dark Tower dust jackets for my bf but I haven't read the books.,"Hi Reddit! 
Apologises if this is the wrong place to post this! 

Title kinda says it all. My bf's favourite series of Books are Stephen King's Dark Tower Series. Sadly his collection got stolen during lockdown (people can sometimes be the absolute worse) 
His birthday is coming up and I've ordered a brand new set. 

My intention being to make some custom lino printed Dust Jackets so they are extra special for him. 

However, I have not personally read the books and am wondering if those that have can give me visual themes and motifs that appear in each of the books so I can plan my composition for the covers. 

So far what I have read up Plot wise for the Gunslinger I should definitely include a something crow related within it. But I'd really like to hear it from those that have truly experienced them.  :)

i got my mom into this series, i was about 3 books in, she started and finished it really fast. Well before i finished. She told me she hated the ending it was so dissapointing and that i would hate it. 
I loved it... 
King pointed out through the book that mistakes might have been made. That character flaws were present. 
I loved that when he walked through the door he did it all over again until he got it right. 
What else would be up there for the gunslinger? Hes not a man of possessions... doesnt seem to be interested in ""ruling"" anything. 
I was sad when his friends died... but king did warn us it would happen and i was grateful for that. 
What did you guys expect to be up there?

c3t9he,"The Dark Tower IV, is it considered good?","First time posting here, but here goes.

I've just finished the fourth book in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, so up to the end of that book, spoiler alert. 

I'm a fan of the series so far, and I am, in general, a fan of Stephen King. Having read some more of his work, I know he can drag conflicts or stories out a bit far, but this entire book seems like a filler prequel. I have three problems with the book.

I don't like prequels, and with this particular book, one of the biggest problems that comes with prequels is very clear, there is no tension. We already know he loses his friends and his dear Susan. The actual surprise is that he doesn't lose his friends in this particular story. Also, whether the Coffin Riders succeed or not is not important at all and doesn't impact the story, as this is a prequel and the Gunslinger is already in an established world/timeline. The only genuine surprise is the death of his mother.

Second, the love story. The lonely ever so bad ass Gunslinger's entire backstory is a fling from when he was 14? This is somewhat mediated by having him also kill his mother, which would be pretty impactful, but the story itself feels very weak. I might be underestimating how ""in love"" a person can be at 14, but it feels so unnatural. At some point, Jonas, I believe, says something along the lines of: ""stop that schoolgirl shit."". Which feels like it applies to the story twofold, first that it's just a silly story and second that Roland and Susan are actually written like schoolgirls. Which would could be okay, if Roland wasn't at the same time a 14 year old kid that can handle a dozen adults in combat.

Lastly, Ka. While I'm aware that the Turtle is probably involved as a guiding force, like in IT, Ka, in this book, really often feels more like a ""it happens this way (or we do things this way) because otherwise the story cannot progress"", and I wholeheartly agree with Cuthbert, when he complains about people using Ka as an excuse to do strange things or the dodge responsibility. Which might be resolved in the rest of the series, but we will see.

Having laid out, roughly, what I think of the book, I am wondering what you all think. Is it a well liked book? Have I missed some key points (I'm using an audiobook)? Am I being unfair? I genuinely want to know what the reading community thinks of this book. 

I will be continuing the rest of the books, so, no spoilers past this book, please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c3t9he/the_dark_tower_iv_is_it_considered_good/,2019-06-22 18:44:00,26,8,books

The problem is, I’m struggling to get through “The Drawing of the Three.” I really find it to be exceptionally boring, it’s seeming to take forever to get to anything in this particular book. There isn’t much plot to it other than finding these three people which personally to me feels like is just taking forever to get to and I haven’t really found much love for these characters he’s introducing to begin with.

y2zd8v,Thoughts on the Dark Tower ending: Yin & Yang,"First of all, I want to thank this sub for making me aware of the series in the first place. I did not love every book, and took a long time to finish it, but as a whole I can't deny that it's an incredible work of art. I will be thinking about what it all means for a long time, may it do ya fine. 

Now, the ending... (Please don't read ahead if you don't want spoilers).

This dance between the Crimson King and Roland has played out countless times (or perhaps 19 times). Ka is a wheel.

I call it a dance because ultimately, the crux of the conflict is: the Crimson King's realization that Roland will restore the beams, causing him to flee to the Tower and be trapped by it, where we know Roland will follow and be trapped in his own way.  

Yin and Yang is a Chinese philosophical concept describing interconnected, but oppositional, forces: winter and summer, order and disorder, light and dark. 

Undoubtedly, Roland is the Yin to the Crimson King's yang. They are two sides of the same coin: each believing they are acting out of agency, but each serving the beam. All things serve the Beam. 

What I wonder is, is this dance like its own Beam? Undeniably, the tension between them has its own power. The power to make or break worlds. We were told time and time again in the series that time only runs one way in the Keystone world. And this may be true, but clearly time can return to itself. It can overlap itself, as Roland's journey does. 

There's one piece that really stuck with me from the ending: the Crimson King's eyes. Patrick was not able to capture the CK until he got the eyes right, using juice from a rose petal and Roland's own blood. And once he did, those eyes -- and the CK's tie to Roland himself -- could not be erased. 

How many times throughout the series did Stephen King remark on Roland's blue ""gunslinger's eyes""? I wonder if somehow, a piece of the Crimson King is trapped in Roland's essence as well. And I'm willing to bet that part can't be erased either. 

Yin and Yang. Ka is a wheel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y2zd8v/thoughts_on_the_dark_tower_ending_yin_yang/,2022-10-13 13:54:44,18,13,books

The last line of the book got spoiled for me but it was still amazing to see how it came about. 

Certain tenets of Hinduism suffuse this series - especially an almost literal take on reincarnation as Roland loops back to the beginning of his journey and the voices indicate that his journey will end when he is good and true. 

As soon as I finished book 7, I went back and read the 1st chapter of the Gunslinger. It was surreal upon rereading. 

Of all the deaths in the latter portion of book 7, I dreaded Oy's the most and I'll always remember the day I read it. The portion of the epilogue where King says that Jake, Susannah, and Eddie would adopt a canine Oy literally brought tears to my eyes.

9lzlhb,Just finished reading The Dark Tower Book VI: Song of Susannah by Stephen King. Lets discuss it!,"As soon as I finished Book V: Wolves of the Calla I was hesitant to start book VI I honestly had no want in dealing with Susannah and another personality. I know I know this time it's not another personality but another person. Well Susannah is my least favorite character in the Ka-tet and my hesitation was sort of justified to me. This book breaks down into three separate stories. Roland and Eddie, Jake and Father Callahan and last and least Susannah and Mia. 

Let's work our way down from best to worst. Jake and Father Callahan barely got any time and that's a damn shame. Seeing Jake so young acting as a true Gunslinger was awesome! Seeing Father Callahan regain God's grace so to speak was dope and him giving Jake's his last rights right before they walked into the Dixie )IG gave me chills. But that's all we got! How dare you SK. 

Roland and Eddie's story was fine. They had a pretty awesome shootout. This though brings me to a problem I've had since Book I: The Gunslinger go.  No to it b bc guys be there to no one ever dies! Something drastic has to happen in the last book to make up for this because no one fucking dies! I never fear for the Ka-tet. Anyways I was super excited when I realized they were gonna go talk to Stephen King and then. I'm not sure what I was expecting but they went from ""let's go talk to our God"" and Roland acting all humble. To fucking Roland hypnotizing him and treating him like every other schmuck. What the hell. 

Now to the worst (in my opinion) Susannah and Mia. While I thought the whole ""it's Roland son was cool"" I had absolutely no interest in any of the story. I know it will be a huge part in the last book but I just didn't care. Also SK really lost me with the low men and  being rats and the bird creatures. I know it's a fantasy story and all that but to me it was i don't know just a bit too much. 

At the end of the book we get Stephen King's diary and I'll be honest it was great and wether or not his description on what inspired each book is true or not I loved it! And him dying in the end was honest a shock and again I loved it! 

I'm ready for Book VII: The Dark Tower even though I'm not ready to have the story end just yet.

I've read the first three Dark Tower novels, and a common phrase used in those books refences a world thats ""moved on."" Based on the fact that Randall Flagg/The Dark Man seems almost identical to ""The Man in Black"" from the Gunslinger. I'm wondering if the scarcely populated US in The Stand become the world thats ""moved on"" in The Dark Tower? 

So I suppose my ultimate question is where in the Kingverse does The Stand fit into? Is it an alternate universe vaguely connected to everything, or is it a straight prequel to The Dark Tower?

1bnmt03,I finally started my 17-book adventure to The Dark Tower with The Stand and it's a horror masterpiece,"“The Stand” by Stephen King is a novel I regret not reading sooner. I knew going into this that greatness was awaiting since many readers consider this one of King’s best books ever written and let me tell you, it delivered and then some. In case you didn’t know, I have officially decided to start my journey to The Dark Tower and wanted to do a ton of pre-reading to ensure I get the complete experience the best I can.

I am conquering The Dark Tower by reading all these books leading up to it. In case you want to know what I think the best reading route to go is, here’s how I’m reading everything after weeks of research and asking several Constant Readers for their feedback...

The Stand  
The Eyes of the Dragon  
Insomnia  
Hearts in Atlantis  
‘Salem’s Lot  
The Talisman  
Black House  
Everything's Eventual (The Little Sisters of Eluria)  
The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger  
The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three  
The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands  
Charlie the Choo-Choo  
The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass  
The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole  
The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla  
The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah  
The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower

I know, I know. 17 books. I have thousands of hours of reading ahead of me but if “The Stand” is any indication, this will easily be one of the best reading experiences of my life. I’m super excited to finally read all these books (some I have already read) and my goal is to be finished before King’s next new anthology “You Like It Darker” comes out on May 21, 2024.

Before I jump into my review, I found a ton of trigger warnings while reading as many of these are very graphic. They were…

\- Cancer  
\- Suicide  
\- Abortion  
\- Domestic abuse (physical)  
\- Racism  
\- Pandemic  
\- Quarantine  
\- Dead animals (cars, dogs, kittens, rabbits, and rats)  
\- Drugs  
\- Drinking and driving  
\- Parental abuse (mental and physical)  
\- Vaccination  
\- Rape  
\- Bullying  
\- Dead children  
\- Burning churches  
\- Homophobia  
\- Death of a child  
\- Self-harm  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Violence against women  
\- Religion  
\- Politics  
\- Violence against animals (hens and chickens)

If any of these triggers you, please do not read this novel. “The Stand” is hands down a horror masterpiece and at this point in my life, the longest book I have ever read. This tome is 1,348 pages deep and I know is an intimidating number to many but it’s worth it.

There are two versions of “The Stand” which is the original one that was released and truncated in 1975 due to how much of a behemoth this novel was at the time and a newly re-released “complete and uncut” one in 1990. I went with the latter since King re-added over 400 pages of text that were removed and revised everything to unleash the true vision of this novel he wanted. I love how King wrote about that to start this novel off to keep it real with his Constant Readers. It is officially King’s longest stand-alone novel in his catalog and will go down in history as one of the greatest horror novels ever written.

King held nothing back in “The Stand” as the intense opening set the groundwork for one hell of a ride. I loved the tension and suspense right off the bat and instantly loved all the unique characters I met along the way.

Speaking of which, there are a ton of characters in this novel to the point where I had to take quick notes on who is who due to a lengthy list of people. I didn’t want to get confused but thanks to my notes, it was pretty easy to remember everyone and enjoy everything in stride. I also loved all the references King had in here from my hometown of Queens here in New York, Freddy Krueger, The Lord of the Rings, Shirley Jackson, Norman Bates, and many more.

This novel was divided into three books all of which contained a bunch of mini-stories in addition to the main story. It was just a brilliant way of formatting everything so you are still kept in the loop of what was going on with the main characters and also all these side characters. I loved how you never knew who could end up being one to keep an eye on as their story progressed.

There weren’t any boring parts as all the dialogue, situations, and horror were top-notch. King is the master of subtle horror that hits you and continues bringing that terrifying dread of what was ultimately going on. Needless to say, this novel hit home with me and probably many other readers since it’s eerily similar to the whole COVID-19 pandemic we dealt with a few years ago. Imagine that but taken to extreme new heights in a way only King can deliver.

All the descriptions, stories, atmosphere, and overall horror are perfection. I couldn’t put this novel down as it took me over two weeks to read and I even dedicated my days off from work to get through it because it’s such a massive and addictive novel. It’s great and I assure you if you’re one of those readers that think this book is too big or would take forever to read, it’s worth it if you chip away each day and don’t rush anything. Take your time reading this as it’s a novel you will never forget for the rest of your life.

Another nice touch was how King added graphic illustrations to this novel as you read to capture some pivotal (and creepy) moments to add to this epic reading experience. I love when authors do this since it brings me back to my teenage days of reading horror paperback books where every chapter had a graphic illustration or they were sprinkled in between chapters.

King did not hold back when it came to all the horror, gore, and creepiness. Some of which I couldn’t believe and made many weird faces while reading as I started to put the pieces together to the mystery of this disease. Once that was revealed, a whole new part of this novel opened up to situations I never read before in a horror novel.

Once all the characters were finally connected and the race to the end was on, this is where “The Stand” truly delivered. There’s even more horror including a bloodbath of an action scene that was unexpected and pretty intense with some of the main characters. Out of this impressive roster of characters, while hard to choose, I loved Frannie, Stu, Nick, and of course, Kojak the dog. I can’t also leave out the main antagonist who had some scenes that sent chills down my spine… the infamous “Man in Black” Randall Flagg.

This was the first time I’ve ever read a novel involving Flagg and wow, I can see why he is despised by so many. Some of the situations involving Flagg were insane and now that I got my introduction to him, I’m excited to see what happens in the future with such an iconic villain in King’s Dark Tower universe.

The climactic race to the end was monumental as King takes the famous “good vs. bad” angle to new horrific heights. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but all the plot twists and turns led to an awesome drop-the-mic ending. It was so good that I went back to re-read the last few chapters again because they were outstanding. I never saw that coming and am beyond satisfied with how it ended. The range of emotions from sadness, laughter, rage, disbelief, hope, and heartwarming moments were just some of what I experienced while reading this novel. All of which will last a lifetime with me as it was such a powerhouse of a novel.

I give “The Stand” by Stephen King a 5/5 and would give it a 10/5 if I could because this was by far one of the best novels I’ve ever read by King and in my entire life. The incredible story, memorable characters, a villain for the ages, brutal horror that only King can deliver, and the power of hope led to such a powerful read. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to prepare for the next step in my journey to The Dark Tower as I plan to start “The Eyes of the Dragon” next.

6ard7i,[No Spoilers] Question about the new Dark Tower movie in relation to the books,"Hi everyone!

I'm not sure if this would be the right place for this, but I have a question regarding the new upcoming Dark Tower movie:

Does anyone know how much of the book series is  going to be covered in the movie? I only ask because I have only read book one so far (really dug the second half. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!), and half of the trailer looked a little unfamiliar/further along in the overall story from the events I remember of book one. 

I would do some research on my own, but I'm trying to avoid spoiling the series for myself. After enjoying The Gunslinger,  I would prefer my remaining experience with The Dark Tower series to be through the source material. I don't want to go see the movie only to have future plot points spoiled for me. Any help as to whether or not it's safe to go see the movie with only completing book one would be much appreciated :)

a2bes,I finished a book today.  I didn't read the Epilogue.,"So.  Did I, in fact, truly finish the book?  Does anyone else skip Epilogues?


When I read an Epilogue, it feels to me as if the writer is thinking ""hmm, I didn't really like that ending.  I don't really want to re-write it.  Well, I'll just write a second ending, that'll work.""  I nearly always think less of the book after reading the Epilogue.  The last Gunslinger book.  _To a God Unknown_.  The last Harry Potter book.

The last few Epilogue's I've read have made me think about not reading the Epilogue.  I think I'd rather stop at the end of the story.  The epilogue isn't what happens in the story, it's what happens after the story.

So, today I finished a book.  And I came to a short little Epilogue.  And I didn't read it.  I closed the book and put it back on my shelf.

It's killin' me that I didn't read it, but I think it's better if I don't.

4shxjo,How I was forced into loving The Dark Tower (why you should finish the series(x-post from r/TheDarkTower )),"**For TL;DR, read the text that is in bold**

**I feel like my experience reading the series was a lot different than many others I have read on Reddit. I wanted to talk about my experience reading it and why you should finish it if you are struggling.** 

The Gunslinger was my first SK book. My reading buddy suggested we read it after I mentioned picking up a series to read. He had heard good things about it and was already a SK fan so I agreed. 

**I didn't hate The Gunslinger but I felt bored and completely uninvested. If it had just been me I would not have kept reading.** Still, my buddy loved it so I pressed on with him. I liked the second book even less. I just kept wondering the entire time ""where the fuck is this going?!"" by the end of book two, I had resigned myself to stop trying to reason with why all this insane shit was happening and just follow along and accept it. Don't reason out the crazy, just accept it and keep going. 

Having accepted this, in book three I found myself going through periods where I could not put the damn book down and lulls where I was wondering why the hell I was still reading this series. I was intoxicated by how unpredictable  the book was. All this time I never realized there was a hunger in me for a story line that I could not see coming 1,000 miles away. Now I was getting hooked to the feeling of feeding this hunger, but still could not say one way or another if I was *enjoying* the book itself. 

Wizard and Glass was the book where I decided I would stop reading if it didn't hook me halfway through. Luckily it did. I finally became invested in Roland's cause. As I kept reading on, this investment spread to Jake, Eddie and Susannah. Suddenly I loved them all because I finally became invested and I already had all of their character development from the previous books to back it up. I enjoyed Wolves immensely and Wind through the Keyhole further won me over to, not only Roland, but the world they were in and the lore surrounding it. 

I'll admit, Song of Susannah was hard. It was necessary though. It was like the frame to a beautiful painting. Necessary but the least interesting part of the art. I'd still call it alright though. In this book I flopped to caring about the story *because* I cared about the characters instead of the other way around. 

The seventh book was magnificent. If I had to pick a favorite it might still be Wolves or Wizard and Glass, but the seventh book will always hold a holy place in my heart because it ended the series and changed my perspective. Let me explain how with this anecdote ....

After I had finished reading the series, my boss asked me ""is it a good series? Should I read it? What's it like?"" And I thought for a while and said:

**Reading this series is like staring at a giant pointillism painting three inches from your face. You painstakingly scan and memorize every dot and every pretty color. You learn to appreciate it even if you might not understand it fully, or know where it is going. You become intimately familiar with every part of it. Then, right at the end, Stephen King pulls you 10 feet back and say ""look"". And you see it. You see the whole thing. You see that all those little dots really did come together to create something magnificent and enormous. You also have a deeper appreciation for it because you knew every intimate detail of the painting before the whole canvas was revealed to you. It's a fucking masterpiece but it takes a lot of work to recognize. Still, once you do, it can bring you to your knees.**

So although I think Wolves or Wizzard and Glass might have been my favorite individual books, I will always love the seventh book the most because I got to see the whole painting at the end. 

**So for those of you wondering if you should finish the series (either because it's long or that someone told you the last books are not as good) my own personal answer is yes. God yes. You'll never appreciate the magnitude of the full piece until you do.**

**It's funny, after I finished the series, I went back and read The Gunslinger. I fucking loved it.** 

 ""Ka Is is a wheel, it's one purpose to turn, and in the end it always came back to the place where it had started.""

l0f5dt,I didn't like The Stand by Stephen King. Why did you like/dislike about it?,"So, I want to preface this by asking you all to please not downvote me to oblivion. I understand my opinion of The Stand seems to be wildly different than any other person's opinion I've read on the internet. The purpose of this post is for me to find out why so many people hail this book, and what makes the book great (or if you share my opinion, not so great) to you? I truly feel like I may have missed something within this book, or there is something wrong with me in general, that caused me to really dislike this book. It actually makes me kind of sad, since I'd built up an expectation of this book being one of King's best but finding it at the very bottom of the list for the 10 Stephen King books I've read this year.

For further background, this past year I decided to begin reading novels from the author Stephen King. Being 25 years old, I've never read any of his works; in fact till this past year I'd never even watched an adaptation of one of his stories before. I felt that not having experienced King's writing was creating a dissonance of experience and knowledge between me and other's around me who have read his creations. So, I decided to finally jump into the numerous creations that Stephen King has written into this world. A quick list of the books I've read this year are as follows in order of completion:

* Roadwork
* Pet Sematery
* The Body
* The Shining
* Doctor Sleep
* IT
* The Dark Tower Series: The Gunslinger
* The Stand
* Sleeping Beauties
* The Dead Zone

The most disappointing of those for me, as I mentioned above, being The Stand. My main complaint being, and something that I've never seen someone mention when reviewing the book, is how long it takes to get to an exciting section of the plot that actually feels like it's working towards an end/goal. For a little over half the book, it felt like a very slow burning setup. I'm not sure if it's because I read the extended/remastered version that added some 400 extra pages to the original work, so maybe I should have started with the original? But, it just felt like the first half of the book was a slog to get through. There were times, during the first half, I had to re-read sections because my mind had wandered while reading (much like it does when reading a boring textbook). I never experienced this with any of his other works. In fact with IT, which is almost as long as the extended version of The Stand, I felt engaged and excited to see what happens next for the whole book.

Maybe it's because we are in a pandemic of our own that caused this book to fall flat for me? I'm really not sure. So please, I ask for courteous discussion about this book. Please tell me what you liked, or didn't like, about this book. Maybe seeing opinions of the general public will help me view the book in a new light.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l0f5dt/i_didnt_like_the_stand_by_stephen_king_why_did/,2021-01-19 07:46:35,58,37,books

During his lifetime, he became an internationally recognized celebrity on par with today's biggest Hollywood stars. Because of his reputation, he quickly became mythologized and ""tall tales"" began to spread about him through dime novels and the hyperbolic (and often flat out fictionalized) accounts people shared of their encounters with the notorious gunslinger. Clavin does not really immerse you in the exploits of Wild Bill, but rather chronicles his life while separating fact and fiction; the truth is as fascinating as the myth. Clavin also does a solid job in describing the real American West during the post-civil war era of expansion and how celebrity existed at the time. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Wild Bill or learning more about America in the 2nd half of the 19th century.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hzpgsz/wild_bill_the_true_story_of_the_american/,2020-07-28 23:21:51,0,6,books

6rrx0j,"Just bought the Dark Tower yesterday. 10 pages later, I'm in love with it.","People had recommended the Dark Tower for a long time, and I'd been trying to find it on bookstores and malls, without avail. Yesterday, I found it on the best sellers aisle, with the movie poster in the cover. Ugh, talk about merchandising. They even promote the movie on the back cover, with the all-caps ultra thin movie text in the bottom, and the Columbia pictures logo. It makes me sick. But I'm grateful because I was finally able to read this. Anyway.

It's my first Stephen King novel, so I didn't know exactly what to expect. At least I expected a good sci fi story.

It exceeded ALL my expectations, by a landslide. I feel like a guy who had never eaten a particular dish before, and then he's presented with the best version of it, prepared by an expert chef. Every single word tasted like joy. I felt like a kid eating ice cream as I read this. I knew King was a good horror writer, I mean, I knew about Cujo, Carrie, I watched The Dead Zone, but I never had imagined his prose would be THIS good. It's a masterpiece of art.

Here we are, reading a detailed description of the gunslinger: His guns, his clothes, the alkaline desert around him (this is the first time I've seen a desert described with so much detail, I felt like I was already there), and the occasional tidbits of mystical gurus and mysterious phenomena (the ""holes"" in the world, the talking crow, the bird man) made me say ""Whoa. This is NOT our world. What the hell happened to Earth?"".

Here I feel compelled to quote Jodi Foster in her astronaut role in Contact: ""A poet. They should have sent a poet."" Man, it's THAT good. I've read dozens of fantasy and science fiction works by several authors: Verne, Dan Simmons, Gibson, Stephenson, Asimov, Herbert, Heinlein, Orson Scott Card,  Philip K. Dick, Robin Hobb, and yet, the quality of King's narration took me by surprise. It's dense enough to give a lot of information, and yet, it's not as dense that I need to stop every paragraph to digest it; it has the perfect balance between detail, pacing, and thesaurus-worthy terms to give out the exact meaning in the quantity of words he wants. It is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

&nbsp;  

These are all the books I read last year, with their page counts. I read The Dark Tower series once before, years ago, and it was still my favorite series of all time when I read it again last Summer. I was convinced that if after reading hundreds of books I still enjoy The Dark Tower this much, especially for the second time, I shouldnt get my hopes up for finding something better anytime soon.  

Then I read the Stormlight Archives.  

*HOLY* mother-of-pearl, I have never been so engrossed in the emotions of so many different characters while struggling to sort through my own feelings about the character interactions.  

Being well-read I can often predict the general direction stories will go, as they all follow similar tropes, but not with this epic. Beautiful ideas that would have never, ever occurred to me are plentiful in these books and Brandon Sanderson is a master at making you feel like you know the characters personally. 

Im open to discussing any of these books, just comment or send me a message! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7r4y9b/i_managed_to_devour_17_books_in_the_last_6_months/,2018-01-17 22:35:20,35,17,books
aik8a4,What books have the best intros? What about the worst?,"Usually I can tell within the first 10-15 pages whether I will enjoy a book. What are introductions to books that really draw you in? What will immediately turn you off? What are the best examples of this?

I typically dislike books that immediately introduce a bunch of characters or jump around to different settings all with in a very short amount of time. Stephen King does this a lot. While I typically like his writing, it usually frustrates me to remember every character and their relevance. 

I really like the introduction to Fight Club because it immediately sets the tone for a huge plot twist. I also love the cliche introduction of starting the book at some climactic pivotal point and then jumping back and exposing how the main characters got there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aik8a4/what_books_have_the_best_intros_what_about_the/,2019-01-22 06:51:38,28,16,books
8ooq37,The dark tower IV: Wizard and Glass discussion.,"Ok, so I'm not entirely done with the book but Roland is finished telling the story of his youth. And while I did enjoy it A LOT! I also enjoyed the Gunslinger and that might be why. I felt like it took me completely out of what was going on with Eddie, Jake and Susan. 

That has left me conflicted about how I feel moving forward. I feel so disconnected with Eddie, Jake and Susan and I find myself missing his friends. I am glad the story gets to move forward but I feel like SK really messed up the flow of the story. 

Anyone else feel this way? Could he have done it different? Or was this the best way to go about it? Also quick note. Does anyone feel like he completely lost track of where he left off in the third book? He kept the tick tock man alive for basically nothing.

5mgbvd,The Wind Through the Keyhole by our friend Stephen,"Over the last few months I've been working my way through the Dark Tower series. I know The Wind Through the Keyhole was written after the main story but I think it just topped Wizard and Glass as my favorite Dark Tower book so far...

I just finished Wizard and Glass three or four days ago and in the time between now and then I devoured The Wind Through the Keyhole.

I wish there was more material involving Roland's world before the fall of Gilead. (Maybe there will be more in the next three Dark Tower books) I still wish there were other stories about Roland's ka-tet/his fathers/other Gunslingers.

9i517w,Just finished The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla. Anyone want to discuss it?,"Where to even start. My biggest take away after finishing this book is ""I want to read Salem's lot"". There's no denying how intertwined these two books must be. Anyways this was another great dark tower but honestly it just felt like filler. The 2 deaths 3 if you count Andy's death also were at best ""eh"". I didn't care much for a robot being killed, truth be told I wanted them to get more information from him but oh well. The big ranchers wife, eh! And Jake's friend? The biggest eh! I never cared for him in the least. 

I did love Jake's growth and I hope to see what more he does with the ""touch"". Eddie is still Eddie and my favorite character. Roland is still Roland but I haven't seen much change from him and im over the ""ah!"" when it comes to him.  Susanna, oh Susanna another fucking personality? Honestly Im not looking forward to book IV. 

My favorite part had to be Callahan's story and that's not a good thing.

I loved the **Gunslinger** so much I consumed it in a single sitting, a year later I read **The Drawing of Three** and felt extremely underwhelmed by the change in style, and the strange pace of the story. I was depending on this volume to be the tie- breaker to decide if I would continue this saga or not. And after finishing it I have to say I definitely will be. I think this is the first part of the story where I actually started to enjoy the dynamic of the Ka-tet, and I could finally feel the whole story pulling (somewhat) together.

i6nlxk,The Dark Tower Series,"A year ago I read The Gunslinger at the behest (more like at gunpoint) of my brother. I hadn't read a fiction novel in some 15 or 20 years, and I didn't know how to start. He gave me the book, told me it was his favorite series, and made me read it while we were on our weeklong vacation (what even is that anymore?). I finished it on the last day of our trip and subsequently ordered the next two books (The Drawing of the Three and The Waste Lands). I continued reading through the series, only finding a lull in the middle of book 3, but steady on as they say. Last night I finished The Wolves of the Calla and I simply can't describe how great it feels to get through these. The story is so dense and rich and interconnected that I find myself staying up late at times just to turn one more page. I skipped Wind Through the Keyhole at the recommendation of my brother, who said it was better to read it after the final book (it was written after the final book as a sort of book 4.5 entry). I'm already 30+ pages into Song of Susannah and I don't want this series to end.

Edit: without any spoilers for what I haven't read yet, I'd like to hear what everyone's favorite part in the series so far (for me) was. I personally loved the interaction between Donald Callahan and Walter when the *faddah* was receiving black 13 and being transported to the calla. Walter seems to imply so much from the interaction with just his physical reactions to the accusations Callahan makes during this short exchange. I don't know how this story ends, but with what has happened so far with crossovers to the fiction world of ours (Jake, Eddie, and Odetta's world) and with how time is strange for the ka-tet, seeing Walter almost recoil at the idea that he is the reason all these things are happening was palpable through printed word.

ca1qki,The Dark Tower V: The Wolves of the Calla,"This is my second summer of The Dark tower. Last summer was The Gunslinger- The Waste Lands. This summer I've read Wizard and Glass, Little Sisters of Eluria(as a pallet cleanser) and just finished The Wolves of the Calla. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought it was silly that at the end of Wizard and Glass the ka-tet is like ""Nothing can stop us!""... first town they stop at... ""Let's stop here for a bit.""

People had told me after Wizard and Glass the series begins to go downhill but I disagree. This was a fun romp. I loved the return of Father Callahan from Salem's Lot, which I had read in the beginning of the year and had questioned what happened to him. Loved that this was The Dark Tower version of The Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven. I felt the pacing was spot on where the pacing in Wizard and glass drove me nuts. The pop culture references are getting a bit weird but we'll see where this goes. Thought it was a ballsy move on King's part to include himself in this book.

The big decision I now have to make is do I stick with my plan and continue on to Songs of Susannah or push it back one more year and let the suspense of the the cliffhanger build for a year?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ca1qki/the_dark_tower_v_the_wolves_of_the_calla/,2019-07-07 02:11:16,6,5,books

It seems like they take place in the 'Old West'. Horses, revolvers, desserts and small wooden towns. And yet they keep finding places like old run down train stations with modern computers and such. Or desolate skyscraper cities.

I know there was a bit of interdimensional travel in the 2nd book; with the ""doors"". But that was only one part, and the rest of the time they're in Gilead (I think, Gilead might just have been Rolands hometown/where he learned the ways of the gunslinger).

y3wto,"To those who have read the Dark Tower series, I have a question","I'm almost done with the first book (The Gunslinger), and so far it's been a painful read. It's my first dive into King fiction, and I can't say I'm enjoying it. I find it over-written, slow, and I don't particularly like our protagonist. I have found no pure joy in reading the book so far.

Now, this isn't meant to be a riff on a much-beloved series. I'm not here to blindly criticize a series I'm not even 1/7 through. I'm here to ask you: **should I keep reading**? If I'm not enjoying the first book 3/4 of the way through, is there any chance I'll like it later on? I'm asking you this because I hate the thought of missing out on a series I could potentially fall in love with, just because I didn't like the way it started out. 

I know every person's reading experience is different from the next, so I would love to hear all of your experiences reading the series. Did you love it right away? Did it take 'till the end of book 1, or book 2, or book 5 for you to truly enjoy it? For those of you who enjoy it so much--what is it about the series? For those of you who don't--why not?

Stephen King is who really got me into reading when I was a teen. I've always been a fan, though I haven't read much of his ""newer stuff"" other than Under the Dome, which I really enjoyed. And I love fantasy books. But I am having a hard time getting into The Dark Tower. It's taken me 3 different times to get through The Gunslinger, which I finally accomplished today. My question is, does it get better? Is this a common thing with this series, or is it just me? Ive always heard great things about it, it's considered one of the great fantasy series, so I'm hoping this is normal. If I wasn't very into the first book can I expect the same with the rest or should I stick it out?

glgpo3,"The Traitor Baru Cormorant is the best Science Fiction and Fantasy book I've read in the last decade. I have read many, many, books.","The tl;dr of this post is exactly what you've read from the title. It's incredible. Also it's not just a review, I promise.

The story is obviously building throughout the book to some epic climax and does not disappoint. Not only does it fail to disappoint, it promises even higher plateaus from what will follow.

The characters are not always my favorite; there are many characters and much to keep track of in this story and, normally, it's hard to be emotionally invested in characters when there are so many. It's also hard not to be emotionally invested in the characters in this book. In my opinion it is a tragedy in it's literal definition.

Consider that I *immediately* bought the second book after I finished the first and have committed my incredibly precious free time to reading it and that so far it is *not failing to deliver*. My free time is measured in minutes per week, so setting aside a few hours to consume this book is a **big** deal for me.

For context, since it often helps me to understand a reviewers tastes:
* I think Hyperion is a great work of art while Endymion is a rollicking adventure and *love them both dearly* for what they are (though in my secret heart I would admit to loving Endymion more, having read it first.)
* I enjoyed Steven King's Gunslinger series and read them all as they came out. I was immensely disappointed in the ending.
* I think that The Name of the Wind is a beautiful story and that the author is likely to be considered a modern master of prose, provided he doesn't pull a GRRM with his work.
* Speaking of, you lazy git, I'm not buying another book from you until you are either *done*, or *dead*, for while the Winds of Winter may be coming it is proving to be the slowest stiff breeze ever.
* I love the Expanse for it's world building and characters and story and who doesn't love fast space ships! I also love technical details. I'm a data and modeling guy. /shrug.
* I think that Brandon Sanderson saved the Wheel of Time and redeemed much of it. When recommending the series I often mention that most of the middle could be skipped.
* I think Ready Player One is fun, but uninspired, for a specific target audience. People are allowed to enjoy pulp and smut. Romance novels exist for a reason!

Some of you may say that this book might not qualify for Science Fiction. Some others would disagree. I, personally, belong to the 'others'. (Which might possibly make me sound like a lunatic.)

If you do disagree that this book is one of the best examples of science fiction and fantasy produced recently (and no, this is not merely meant to be a token question), I would ask why and in what author and book do you see the 'best'?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/glgpo3/the_traitor_baru_cormorant_is_the_best_science/,2020-05-17 14:54:40,19,24,books

lrb9fl,Finally finished The Dark Tower Series (Spoilers),"I  don't even know how i feel about the ending... like dam. Literally  spent the whole day thinking about the last book trying to make sense of  it all.

Firstly I think what  happened to Roland was just shocking & upsetting. The question that  arose to mind was how many times has he replayed all the events since we  first met him in the gunslinger? 10, 20, 50, 100 times?? each time he  forgets and starts over again. Clearly the purpose is for him to change,  to maybe rid himself of this obsession of the tower which has literally  cost him the lives of his loved ones, his ka-tet. He's used people like  tools, a means to an end and disposed them like nothing e.g. letting  Jake fall to his death for the tower. How can Roland change if everytime  things reset he forgets what happens? Is that fair? Is it a form of  mercy to let him forget all that pain, knowing he will have to relive it  again and hopefully this time not make the same mistakes hes done all  those previous times? One thing is for sure he now has the Horn of Eld  which he hasn't had before so this run might be different maybe it will  be his last? I sometimes hate open end endings drives me nuts.

As  for Susannah, I personally think she is dead. Something happened to her  when she crossed over maybe that door was a tunnel to the clearing at  the end. My reasoning for this is Jake & Rolands revolver. If we go  back to Song of Susannah after Susannah left and her ka-tet followed,  they all landed in keystone earth at different points in time. What we  learn here is that there are no do overs, this is keystone earth if you  mess up here, die here its game over. Jake died by throwing himself  infront of Stephen King and being hit full on by the van, so how is it  possible for him to be alive in a different reality? He died in the only  reality that mattered, that main reality, if that makes sense. The  second being Rolands revolver, Susannah opened the cylinder and looked  at the shells and thought these are wet, the barrel of the gun is also  blocked so the gun is pretty much useless. Susannah thinks the reason  for this is because she travelled through the door. If we go back to  Song of Susannah when Roland, Eddie, Jake, Oy & The Manni are at the  cave of voices Henchick says to Roland he might not be able to take his  revolver with him through the door, but Roland takes his chances and as  we know the second he lands with Eddie he is ambushed and the revolver  works fine. I could may very well be wrong, but i think she is dead.

Another  thing which really made no sense to me was why Stephen King made  himself into a character in his own story, for me personally that whole  storyline with Stephen king made no sense whatsoever. I was confused  half the time when he was involved.

Patricks  character was a weird one, what I didnt understand was if he could  remove Susannahs sore why not draw her legs? or draw Rolands fingers  back?

Would have loved more  information on the old people, what happened to them? I do recall from  Wizard and Glass that Steven Deschain told Roland the old people left  through doors. Would have been nice to know where they went.

The  Crimson King was a huge let down for me! There was this huge build up  for his character and in the end it is was some old dude in an robe  acting like a child and throwing sneetches from a balcony.

I don't think Walters storyline did him justice, we find out in the end he was scared of Roland while he was chasing him across the first book, it kind of dissolved the image of this powerful sorcerer. The same Walter which bought a dead guy back to life while laughing like a maniac, same guy who in the Wizard and Glass was shown as this strong powerfully built magaican who no one dared to cross paths with and showed off his strength, same guy who appeared in the city of Lud while Blaine was going fully on suicidial and didn't even need a mask. I would have prefered if he died at the hands of Roland rather than Mordred.

All in all i loved this series especially the drawing of three, wastelands & wolves of calla",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lrb9fl/finally_finished_the_dark_tower_series_spoilers/,2021-02-24 12:05:23,37,16,books
9t0gbd,Just finished The Waste Lands by Stephen King,"I want to start by giving my background of the Dark Tower series. My Mom is a huge King fan and always saw this books on the bookshelves in the house. I remember my older brother reading the series when I was a teenager. My younger brother had also read the series as well and kept pushing me to read it. I was not a big reader until about 2 1/2 years ago when I decided I needed to read more and started with Dune. Fast forward to this March I picked up The Gunslinger, read 20 pages, and put it down. Around June I picked it back up and finished it in about a week. I immediately moved on to The Drawing of the Three and finished it in about two weeks. Needless to say I was hooked. I want to read something different before moving on to The Waste Lands, so I started reading Contact by Carl Sagan. I made it about 120 pages in and was enjoying the book, but I couldn't stop thinking about what was next for Roland and friends. I shelved Contact and picked up The Waste Lands.
I'm sure this goes without saying but spoilers will follow. I loved this book. It did such a good job building the world. The first section of the book with Jake and Roland's mind splitting from the events of The Drawing of the Three was a fascinating idea to explore. I felt so relieved when those two met up again. It took me three months two finish this book and I have to admit the biggest reason was the section where they make it River Crossing. Don't get me wrong it helped with the world building but I felt the story came to a grinding halt. After that section the pacing definitely picked up and it was when Jake got kidnapped that I fell in love with this book. Just finished the book about 20 minutes ago and I'm looking forward to the next book.

4end6z,Just finished The Dark Tower Series... Now I Am Empty Inside...,"(Spoilers probably ahead) 
I looked at when I purchased The Gunslinger and saw that I've been in Roland's world for over an entire year... I read really slowly, taking things in and letting them marinade in my mind. But even for me, that's a crazy long time to be in one universe. Now I feel an empty hollow place where Roland, Susannah, Eddie, Jake and Oy once were. 

I am sad :(

But also super excited for the movies that are on the way! 

Does anyone have any suggestions for specific Wikis, websites, etc that maybe have answers to some of the big burning questions I still have?

I'll post them here too (here's where the spoilers start, look away!)


1. That ending....? So, Roland is on repeat? It goes on again? Does that mean he did something wrong? Or is he doomed to quest for the Tower for all eternity? I know King said to stop before reading because an ending is just 'an ending' and I agree with him that he does seem to struggle with endings but that is a lot to take in.

2. What IS the Tower? ever since page one I've wondered what the heck it is, at first I thought it was something metaphorical, since Roland quests for it for so long and its in fact, 'his death' where his life flashes before his eyes but then I remembered, the Beams all lead to it, which were created by the Old Ones, and it apparently holds the universe together. So does that mean the Old Ones created life?

3. The Old Ones; They can create robots that last centuries, Beams that hold the universe together, but they all die out?

4. Where does Roland come from? the 'Keystone' world or 'when' is this one basically, the one with Stephen King, but where the heck does Roland come from? What 'when' does Gilead belong to?

5. Since King states that certain worlds are connected to The Dark Tower, does it insinuate that ALL of Sai King's stories are different universes all connected somehow by The Tower? I kept thinking about ""IT"" and the great turtle in the end and thought it was strange that it was never brought up. I haven't read Salem's Lot yet so missed all those references unfortunately.

I have a bunch more but don't want to be writing this forever :P

All in all a great journey and I thank Sai King for putting pen to paper

Long days and pleasant nights

A little more info: I have been a casual reader my whole life. These are the audiobooks I've listened to over the past 8 or 9 months, but I still read paper books quite often. I've been really digging audiobooks, and I've found the performer makes a huge difference. Some books I've kept with even though they sucked because I enjoyed the voice actors so much (Children of the Mind, Shadow of the Hegemon) and other great books I actually had to stop listening to and go find a physical copy because the audio quality/voice actor were so terrible (Catch-22). I still prefer to read the books, but I have greatly enjoyed my foray into audio recordings.

gvzbq5,"A long, thorough, honest, spoiler-ridden review of The Dark Tower series.","Disclosures: There are spoilers of the series, but also of *Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, It*, and possibly some others. Not including *The Dark Tower,* I’ve read these Stephen King books: *The Shining, It, The Green Mile,* and *11/22/63.*

Allow me to start by saying that fans of *The Dark Tower,* of which there are many, won’t like a lot of what I have to say here. Whenever I come across reviews of the series on this subreddit and others, I read a title saying something like “*The Dark Tower* is a masterpiece.” People often liken it to King’s version of *The Lord of the Rings*; they say it’s his magnum opus. Maybe it is King’s magnum opus. If so, I may just not be such a huge fan of Stephen King’s writing. I didn’t hate the series—I’ll discuss some of the positive aspects—but I thought it was one of the biggest letdowns I’ve ever experienced. 

That said, let’s begin.

Most of the problems I have with *The Dark Tower* stem from King’s writing style. I’ve read in various places that he doesn’t use outlines. In fact, in *The Song of Susannah,* the character of Stephen King admits as much. His character says that he once had an outline of the series, but lost it somehow. I don’t know if this happened to the real Stephen King, but if so, I really wish he hadn’t lost the outline, or that he’d made a new one. This series was so promising and told such a massive story that an outline would have served King very well.

The first issues I have that show King lacked foresight in writing this series revealed themselves in *The Gunslinger.* I liked the book and enjoyed the Western motif, but it works better as a standalone book than it does as part of a series. I don’t want to impugn motives on Stephen King, but to me the book reads as if King decided mid-story to turn it into a series. A prime example of this is when Jake dies while the two are pursuing the man in black. I think Jake’s death would have worked as a critical plot point in a standalone story, in which Roland’s only goal was to catch up with the man in black, but as part of the series, it was totally unnecessary. Jake comes back later in the series, but it takes the first half of *The Waste Lands* to bring him into Mid-World. I think Roland should have contrived some way of saving Jake—after all, he is a gunslinger and has solved harder problems before—and the two could have palavered with Walter and then walked to the beach together for *The Drawing of the Three.* But, alas, Jake dies, and comes back in a convoluted way in the worst book of the series.

Another issue I have with *The Gunslinger* is Walter/the man in black. Roland chases him throughout the entire first novel, and we discover just how powerful Walter is. Walter sets the entire town of Tull against Roland, then evades him for the rest of the book until the end. Also, we later find out that Walter somehow doubles back on his pursuers to usher Doc Callahan into Mid-World. He brings Callahan out of the shed where Jake shows up and points to two dots far in the distance, saying that Callahan will have to help those two people in the future, and ultimately bring them to their doom. He then (teleports?) back in front of Jake and Roland to evade them again. 

First of all: why continue to be chased by them? Wouldn’t it have been better for him to walk in the other direction? Walter is a servant of the Crimson King, and Roland’s purpose is to defeat the Crimson King and save the Tower; shouldn’t Walter try to evade Roland as much as possible and not help him bring a powerful ka-tet into the world to achieve his goals? If he can teleport so easily, he should have just left and Roland shouldn’t have caught up to him. 

We also find out later in the series that Walter is clever enough to seduce the wife of the most powerful gunslinger in Gilead; he has lived for over a thousand years; and he is the right-hand man of the Crimson King, which means that he is the second-most powerful person in Mid-World. Yet this extraordinary array of powers apparently offers no help when Walter confronts Mordred in the final installment—Mordred, the son of both the Crimson King and Roland, who is only a few hours old at the time. If Walter could die so easily, how could he have been so powerful throughout the series? 

I think Stephen King should have given Walter a much larger role to play in the series. He was an interesting character and well-written, except a lack of foresight meant that his extraordinary powers were really just a façade, even though it’s clear they weren’t.

I have fewer problems with *The Drawing of the Three.* This was one of the most compelling an entertaining books I have ever read, on par for me with *11/22/63,* which I think is King’s best work—at least of the ones I’ve read. I found only two things hard to believe. One is the ending scene, in which Roland forces Detta and Odetta to face each other while they see Jack Mort get run over by the same train that takes off the legs of Odetta/Detta. This, I think, is a weird way of reconciling the two halves into the one whole, as it were. The resulting union, Susannah, is a great character, but I found this process to be slightly off. The other problem I have is that Eddie is bitten by the lobstrosities, but we never hear anything else about this, unless I missed that part. When Roland gets his fingers bitten off, he nearly dies from infection, but Eddie’s ankle gets snatched by one of the monsters and he’s fine in the next book. Other than those two things, *The Drawing of the Three* is fantastic—my favorite of the series.

Following the best book of the series is the worst. *The Waste Lands* was a poor showing of Stephen King’s storytelling and planning abilities. The writing is engaging enough to keep you turning the pages, but not much else is redeeming in this book. The first half deals with the return of Jake, who is drawn back into Mid-World in a way that opens a can of worms that King was, I think, not prepared to deal with. Jake stumbles upon a key in a vacant lot with a rose growing in it, and this key is the way for him to get back into Mid-World. He goes into the *Dark Tower* equivalent of the house in *It,* and gets rescued by Eddie, who has whittled a key on the other side to bring him through a door. I object to none of these plot points. I think it was a clever way for King to bring back Jake through a series of doors, which is a sensible motif. I do, however, reject the entire premise of the New York half of the series.

That’s too broad: I’m fine with Jake, Susannah, and Eddie all coming from our New York to join Roland’s ka-tet. But much of the series unfortunately revolves around the Keystone World version of the Dark Tower, which is a flimsy rose in a vacant lot in the middle of New York City. This becomes a huge problem in *Wolves of the Calla*, which I’ll get to later, but my main objection is that this part of the series didn’t need to exist in the first place. With an outline, King could have recognized that this would become an issue that he would have to deal with in the future and thus omitted it entirely, but once the book was published, the readers know the rose is in New York and must be protected. Thus King spends a good portion of *Wolves of the Calla* figuring out how to deal with the rose in the vacant lot.

I actually didn’t mind the Lud part of *The Waste Lands,* other than the odd references to songs by ZZ Top. Gasher was an interesting—and terrifying—character, as was the Tick Tock Man. The ending was obviously a cliff-hanger, but I was less incensed about it than I undoubtedly would have been if I had read the books when they just came out, because I was able to pick up *Wizard and Glass* a few hours later. I did, however, find the actual waste lands distasteful. When Blaine the Mono hurtles over what is essentially a hellscape, I found my imagination stretched too thin. Where are the awful creatures described there during the rest of the series? How is the waste land area so insignificant later in the series? It seems that the Crimson King could have used those creatures to battle with Roland, rather than throwing the unfortunately-named sneetches at him and made Roland’s life more difficult at the end. 

Finally, how did Eddie and Susannah become so good at gunslinging? Throughout the series, we find out that Roland spent his entire life training to become a gunslinger; meanwhile, Eddie and Susannah become battle-hardened sharpshooters in a few months. This doesn’t make any sense; we should have at least gotten a training montage.

I thought *Wizard and Glass* was excellent, but I had some problems with it. I think it would have worked better earlier in the series because it explained a lot of Roland’s world and how he became the man he is. However, it started off poorly. The riddle contest with Blaine the Mono is silly: that’s really what it comes down to. Obviously, Blaine was a computer, and smarter than any of the ka-tet. Thus, Eddie’s defeat of him, by asking him “riddles” that were nothing more than dead-baby jokes we all stopped telling after middle school, seems disingenuous. I get the point that King is trying to make—that no matter how smart computers get, they can never understand the illogical nature of humans—but I was disappointed. I thought for sure that one of Jake’s riddles would have stumped Blaine—after all, I figured the riddle book played some part in the series—but, alas, it was Eddie’s dumb jokes that saved the day. 

Then, somehow, the ka-tet comes out in Kansas. This makes little sense, because there was no explanation of a portal into another world, but with King, sometimes you have to take what you get. This is the world in which the events of *The Stand* take place—a book I haven’t read—but also somehow it’s like Mid-World. Here are the things that I don’t like in *Wizard and Glass:* the thinnies, which were dangerous in Mejis but apparently harmless other than the annoying noise in this version of Kansas; the ruby slippers and the perplexing entrance into the plot of *The Wizard of Oz;* the mysterious, yet never-explained story of the glass balls; and the Tick-Tock Man’s reemergence and subsequent death.

Other than those issues, I thoroughly enjoyed *Wizard and Glass.* I thought Roland’s adventures in Mejis were very interesting, so much so that I didn’t want the story to go back to that weird version of Kansas. I became so attached to Susan that I almost cried when she died at the end of Roland’s story. I liked how Roland led Farson’s men (by the way, why didn’t Farson play a larger role in the series?) into the thinny, killing them and saving Mejis, though I was surprised that he killed the Coffin Hunters so easily. 

I found it odd, however, that the pink glass ball was so important in the story, yet so conspicuously absent in the rest of the series. Yes, Black Thirteen makes itself known in *The Wolves of the Calla,* but we never find out the purpose of these things, or their origins. I think that they should have either been much more important than they were or omitted completely from the series, because once Callahan places Black Thirteen under the World Trade Center, we never hear from them again. Why, for instance, couldn’t the Crimson King have been seeking these out to wield in order to bring down the Tower? Doesn’t it make sense for the glass balls to play a similar function to the rings in *Lord of the Rings*? Again, not to impugn motives, but I think Stephen King may have realized that the balls were going to be too much like the rings, which is why he abandoned them later in the series. I mean, he also made the Crimson King’s ethereal presence essentially the same as Sauron’s (the red eyes that could see the entire world), so I don’t think this insight is misplaced.

Like I said before, the ending of *Wizard and Glass* was dumb; there’s no other word for it. The Tick Tock Man was seemingly very powerful, yet he was just the Wizard of Oz, revealed by (Toto) Oy and shot by Roland (I think). Why did King bring him back at all? I was worried, at the end of *The Waste Lands,* that he was going to pursue them and maybe take them out with the help of Walter, but he died as easily as Walter does later on. Also, how on (Mid-World) earth did Walter and the Tick Tock Man escape from Lud? Maybe I just missed that part, but from what I can tell, Blaine either nuked the city or released poison gas on it, so no one could have survived.

*The Wolves of the Calla* was my second-favorite book of the series. This was, however, the book that revealed to me the most issues, and was really the inspiration for writing this unbearably long review. Let me start by saying I loved the concept. The Wolves snatching up the kids from the Callas and returning them mentally disabled was very interesting, as were the Rizas and Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions). I think the traitor angle was great and necessary, and the suspense of the final battle felt like one of the best thrillers I’ve ever read. Although I haven’t read *’Salem’s Lot,* I really enjoyed Doc Callahan’s exploits in New York, and how he came to assist the ka-tet.

However, there were some major problems with this book. The first was Susannah’s transformation back into a schizophrenic. At the end of *The Drawing of the Three,* we find out that Susannah is the final merger of Odetta and Detta, and King wrote this with such finality that I assumed there would be no more separation of Susannah from herself. However, Mia comes along and ruins that perception. I have no problem with Mia existing; it’s just that Susannah was supposed to be fully whole after her revelation that Odetta and Detta were the same person. 

Next comes the todash nonsense—and that’s what it really, is: nonsense. When they first go todash, Roland foreshadows it by saying that the naturally-occurring muffin plant things cause vivid dreams. Instead, Jake and Eddie go todash and hang out in New York for a while. King explains this by bringing up Black Thirteen, which presides in Calla Bryn Sturgis, and is apparently the most powerful of the mysterious glass balls. I think King invents todash to attempt to fix the error he made in making the New York rose the other half of the Tower.

This attempt is the weakest part of the book, which ties into the weakest part of the series. The logic of the New York aspect of the series hangs by very thin threads, if any at all. New York—but really the Keystone World version of New York, the concept of which is only brought up in the fifth book in a seven-book series—is the twin of Mid-World. Thus, the Dark Tower has to have a twin, and the twin in the Keystone World is the rose in the abandoned lot. The rose has to be protected at all costs, but for some reason, someone has to actually own the lot to have control of the rose. Calvin Tower, who played a minimal role in *The Waste Lands,* owns the vacant lot, which (sort of) makes sense because of his last name. What doesn’t make sense is that the Crimson King, whose henchmen include powerful figures like Sayre, the low men, and vampires, chooses a low-level mob boss based in Brooklyn (or the Bronx, I forget which) to try to shake up Calvin Tower. Why would he do this? If the rose was so important, wouldn’t the Crimson King make one of his many strong underlings take it, rather than Enrico Balazar and his band of misfits? Or, better yet, wouldn’t he just take the abandoned lot by force, or pluck the rose out of the ground, rather than have his shadowy enterprises try to own it?

When you start to think about the logic of the rose, you realize there is none. More than half of *The Waste Lands* and *The Wolves of the Calla* could have been avoided if King simply used an outline, thought ahead a bit, and realized that this was the weakest part of his “magnum opus.”

Like I said, most of *The Wolves of the Calla* was fantastic. As a standalone book, this could have been made great without the New York digression. But it doesn’t stand alone; it’s part of what some people call the greatest fantasy series ever written.

Now I should talk about *Song of Susannah.* To be honest, there are parts of this book that blend into *The Dark Tower* such that I’m not really sure where one ends and the other begins. I think the Unfound Door part was odd—if Susannah took the all-powerful Black Thirteen with her, the door shouldn’t have been able to be opened, yet the Manni used their voodoo magic to do it. (By the way, who are the Manni? How are they so powerful? These are questions that I would like answered.) Believe it or not, I actually liked the Keystone World aspect of the book—at least the part in Maine, where Eddie and Roland meet the fictional Stephen King. But a large part of this book was to get Calvin Tower to sell the vacant lot over to a made-up company, which Eddie declares should become powerful by buying up early stocks of tech companies. That’s a little far-fetched, but you can deal with it once you accept the existence of the rose in New York (which I don’t). 

The scavenger hunt that Susannah leads Callahan and Jake on is fun; the turtle that Susannah uses to hypnotize the guy into buying her a hotel room hearkens back to *The Waste Lands* and gave me (unfounded) hope that the Turtle of Enormous Girth was going to play a large part in the story like at the end of *It.* Like I alluded to earlier, I found it odd that Callahan simply put Black Thirteen in a locker under the World Trade Center, which would conveniently come down in two years. Did no one else feel the power of the ball, which apparently is so strong that travelers from dozens of miles away can go into other worlds while they sleep? Did the Crimson King not wonder where the ball went and send someone to find it? These are other questions that are left unanswered, and contribute to my frustration in the series.

Finally, we have the finale. There were good and bad parts of this book, as with any, I suppose. I liked the part with Ted Brautigan and the other Breakers. I thought the battle that the ka-tet had with the people who ran the place in Thunderclap was great, even though I was saddened by Eddie’s death. I think Jake’s subsequent death, while slightly depressing, was also necessary. I found Roland’s pain explanation clever: it disappeared after Stephen King gets hit by the car, which suggested that King’s pain was Roland’s pain. The escape under the mountain from Thunderclap was thrilling and satisfying, and it hearkened back to Roland and Jake’s escape under the mountain in *The Gunslinger* from those weird humanoid creatures*.* I liked the scene in the house during the blizzard, although I found it weird that Roland sensed absolutely nothing wrong.

Besides the ending, there was only really one thing that rubbed me the wrong way with the last book: Mordred. Mordred promises to be an incredibly powerful villain for Roland and Susannah to face. When he is only a few hours old, he kills Walter, a powerful guy in his own right, with his mind. Furthermore, he is the son of both the Crimson King and Roland—the former of whom is the most powerful figure in Mid-World, the latter at least as strong as Harry Potter is in that series (which is to say, very). He changes his shape from a spider back to a human in much the same way that Pennywise changes his shape in *It.* Therefore, I was surprised at how easily he died. To me, it seemed pretty simple: all Mordred had to do was to immobilize Susannah, Patrick Danville, Oy, and Roland, which shouldn’t have been that hard after Mordred grew so much. However, he tried to sneak up on Roland et. al, failing to account for Oy (the best character of the series, by the way), and ended his life only a few months after he began it. Roland put a few well-placed bullets into Mordred and killed him on the spot—no mind battle, no immobilization, no recognition that Mordred can read everyone’s thoughts on the spot. This was a flat conclusion to Mordred’s story-arc; it’s almost like King got tired of writing about him.

Then, of course, the final battle with the Crimson King happens. I haven’t read *Insomnia,* and I know that Patrick Danville is in that book, but it seems strange that Danville is so powerful that all he has to do is draw the Crimson King and erase him in order to get rid of him. Remember, the Crimson King is the strongest person in Mid-World, perhaps the strongest character in all of Stephen King’s worlds. Yet all it takes to kill him is for Patrick Danville to draw and then erase him? That’s silly.

Once I realized how much time I had invested into reading this series (a little over a month), I began to feel apprehension about how it would end. While I was reading *The Dark Tower—*the book, not the series—I remembered what it was like to read *It* (warning: spoilers for *It* coming). That book was so suspenseful and kept me turning the pages so well that it almost hyped itself up for me. The result was that I was disappointed and, frankly, confused at the ending. What was up with that mind-battle that Bill had with the spider? It wasn’t as smooth as similar mind battles in *Harry Potter* or in *Eragon,* and it left me to wonder how King decides to write his endings. It was simply an odd conclusion, and left me feeling confused.

Thus, when I began reading the final installment of this series, I felt a sense of foreboding, like I was sure that I would be disappointed by the ending. I was right: the ending sucked. You may think otherwise; you may think that the circular nature of the series was clever, or awe-inspiring. I only thought it was depressing, almost to the point where it was shameful. This, by the way, is the biggest spoiler of them all, so if you haven’t read the series and don’t want me to ruin it for you (though perhaps I already have), go no further.

I thought the book was going to end with Roland closing the door to the Tower. When I read that part, before the epilogue or whatever, I was temporarily crushed. Then I read the actual ending, and wished that it actually had ended that way. Instead, Roland enters the top room of the Tower, only to end up right where we started with him, *all the way back at the beginning of the series.*

I can’t be the only one who almost threw my copy of *The Dark Tower* across the room when I read that. I was prepared to be disappointed by the ending, but this was a step too far. I realize that not all stories have to have happy endings. I realize that maybe King was trying to do something different with ending it this way, showing that a magnum opus doesn’t have to end happily. 

But I honestly do not care one bit for this reasoning.

Anyone who read this series put hours of effort into understanding what was going on. We breezed through the pages like we would any good Stephen King thriller. We trudged through the parts that didn’t make much sense, but we held onto the hope that we would discover a happy ending for Roland, or at least a sense of completion for a character who spent years searching for his salvation. That ending is the opposite of the ending most of us had hoped for, and it bummed me out to no end.

I couldn’t help comparing *The Dark Tower* to *Lord of the Rings* and *Harry Potter,* because those are my two favorite fantasy series. The ending of *Lord of the Rings* wasn’t exactly happy—I was sad to see Bilbo, Frodo, Sam (I think he went, too), and Gandalf sail into the Grey Haven. But at least the task had been completed. At least evil had been vanquished, and the Ring destroyed. I was satisfied by that ending because it simply made sense.

Similarly, *Harry Potter* ended the way it should have. I was always wary of the part where Harry willingly gets himself killed, then suddenly reawakens to defeat Voldemort, but the idea was that Voldemort had created in Harry a Horcrux that had to be destroyed. It was a stretch, but it was logical. The ending, too, made sense: yes, it was sad to see many of the best characters die, but good triumphed over evil, and we were left satisfied.

This didn’t happen with *The Dark Tower.* Yes, the Crimson King is gone—but is he?. When Roland enters the desert holding the Horn of Eld, he is chasing Walter again—does this mean that the Crimson King is still alive? Has he gone back in time? Is he going to draw the three again, or is something else going to happen? What will happen next time Roland enters the Dark Tower? The book leaves too many questions open. This would have been fine if it wasn’t Stephen King’s magnum opus, but I’ve heard from so many people that it is. 

King anticipates the anger, and tries to address it in the Afterword. He say something like “Isn’t it enough for you that Roland is holding the Horn of Eld, and that he has gotten his redemption that way?” In short: NO! It’s not enough to say that the Horn of Eld gives Roland salvation: we have only snippets of what happened in the Battle of Jericho Hill, not nearly enough to give us an idea of how momentous the occasion was.

The ending proves the point that Stephen King should have used an outline for this series. He should have anticipated the ending far before he actually wrote it. Yes, I understand that he always writes without an outlie, but usually his books don’t take close to thirty years to write. Stephen King owed his readers a satisfying ending after going with him on this long journey, but he dropped the ball in the worst way possible.

A lot of the criticisms I leveled at Stephen King’s work can probably be pushed back on by saying that I should have suspended my disbelief a lot more than I did. After all, it is a fantasy series—no one suggested that it was going to be realistic. But the more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that I’m right. I did suspend my disbelief. I accepted the lobstrosities, the Wolves, the bear Shardik, the Breakers, the monsters under the mountains, and most other things about the series. When I read *Harry Potter,* I accepted the magic, the Marauder’s Map, the Whomping Willow, the Pensieve, the Horcruxes, and most other things about it. Similarly, when I read *Lord of the Rings,* I took in the hobbits, Tom Bombadil, Mirkwood (yes, I realize that’s in *The Hobbit*), the orcs, and even Smeagol. *The Dark Tower* simply left too many questions unanswered, too many stones unturned, and undoubtedly too many unhappy readers. I can only imagine what it must have been like to start reading *The Gunslinger* in 1981 and then finish with *The Dark Tower* in 2004—a long, grinding story that you might not live to see the conclusion of, only to be hit with a ton of bricks by the ending.

I’ve gone on far too long already. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations. I shouldn’t have written this much, but believe it or not, I have other thoughts. There is no TL;DR, other than saying that *The Dark Tower* (series) is maybe the most overrated fantasy series ever. It’s good, not great; it only needed some direction and foresight to be one of the best works of fantasy ever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gvzbq5/a_long_thorough_honest_spoilerridden_review_of/,2020-06-03 18:20:31,4,20,books
3b0aka,Just finished the Dark Tower Series [Spoilers All],"While waiting on the next books in ASOIAF and King Killer Chronicles, I took a stab at the Dark Tower, started reading in November, and I was hooked after the first sentence.  I know there have been other posts, but it is hard to contribute to old posts and others may have read it since then.

.

I loved almost every moment.  After a quick search, it sounds like there is some mixed feelings, but **I love the ending**, it just fits everything so perfectly.  It has me wondering if anything will change now that Roland has the horn, but I doubt it, so I will be unlike Roland and I will not obsess about it.  


.

I do hate that King wrote himself into the books, I didn't mind it at first when his name popped up as a writer of books, but I did hate that we get to meet him, I just kind of pretend that that didn't happen and focus on Roland and his ka-tet.


.

If I have to rank them, it will be hard to do, the top three are excellent and I could rank them in any order

1. Wizard and Glass
2. The Gunslinger
3. The Wastelands
4. The Dark Tower (the last 1/3 bump it up for me, there were some slow parts though)
5. Wolves of the Calla
6. The Drawing of Three (a few slow parts lower its rankings for me)
7. Song of Susannah (luckily I didn't have to wait, even if it was a short wait when the last two books came out, too big of a cliffhanger, other books in the series at least had some resolution even if they had cliffhangers)


I enjoyed them all.  What did others think?  Where do you stand on the ending? Has anyone read The Wind Through the Keyhole? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3b0aka/just_finished_the_dark_tower_series_spoilers_all/,2015-06-24 22:58:40,4,1,books
31gaor,Stephen King - Dark Tower Series/The Stand crossovers: Wouldn't it be wicked cool if Jake Chambers was in the novel The Stand?,"I have been on a bit of a Stephen King bender over the past few months, and I just finished reading the Dark Tower series after reading The Stand.  I was curious why Jake Chambers, a gunslinger from the Dark Tower series, wasn't included in The Stand.

The two stories take place in the ""same"" universes (multi-verse??? it's complicated...) and it's made clear that all of the characters from The Stand have telepathic abilities to some degree; the only people who survived the plague were those with the telepathic power; people survived the plague because they had telepathic powers (this might be a stretch).  

Telepathic powers are often referred to as ""the touch"" in the Dark Tower series, which Jake Chambers is hinted at as having the strongest sense of anyone Roland has ever met.  In the 4th(?) Dark Tower book, the gunslingin' crew walk through Kansas in the universe of The Stand book, and both Jake and Eddie note the differences in this particular universe compared to their own, but also note a majority of similarities.  I think that this would heavily suggest that both Jake and Eddie actually existed, albeit in an slightly alternate form, in the universe from ""The Stand"".  I think this theory is made stronger by the 6th Dark Tower book when Eddie and Jake go todash and follow an alternate Jake in a slightly alternate universe, proving that there are more (possibly infinite) Jakes.

Thus, Jake exists in this universe and probably has very strong telepathic powers, so he would... survive... the... plague?  Possibly be the main protagonist and about the same age as the other major characters in The Stand (source: math)?

I really liked that Flagg was a crossover character and I also enjoyed Father Callahan, from 'Salem's Lot, being brought into the Dark Tower series.  I think that Jake would have made a pretty strong crossover character as well.  

Do you think Mr. King would consider rewriting The Stand for me?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/31gaor/stephen_king_dark_tower_seriesthe_stand/,2015-04-04 20:27:26,4,1,books
ewr5pw,Stephen King’s ‘The Institute’ - My Thoughts (Spoilers),"Before reading this, I wasn’t much of a reader. I’m 17 and haven’t read many books. Only started some but never finished. ‘The Institute’ is the first book I’ve finished. I’ve never really been into reading much because I’ve always found it boring. But the reason I found it so boring was so blatantly obvious! I wasn’t reading the genres I enjoyed. I tried reading Percy Jackson (can’t remember which one, it was years ago) and it was..meh. Couldn’t really get into it. 

I’m new to Stephen King. Yes, I know who he is and I’m aware of the books he’s written and how many there are but ‘The Institute’ was the first one I read of his. 

Back in September last year I saw a tweet on Twitter from Stephen King that his new book ‘The Institute’ was out and I thought to myself, ooh! That word, that title sounds interesting. 

Then came October and I was going on holiday. I saw ‘The Institute’ on the shelf in the bookstore and I had to pick it up. I did, and I Immediately started reading it. 

You might be wondering why I’m only just writing this when I picked the book up in October. It’s because I stopped reading it for almost a month. I read a lot, then got to a point where (I have to admit this) I got bored and couldn’t read anymore. However, I started reading the reviews and to sum it up, they said the buildup was worth it. Oh yeah, it was. I’m a slow reader, I tend to read a page in 1/2 minutes. I picked the book up again around late November and I finally finished it today. 

I’m going to be talking about thoughts as they come to me, they won’t be in logical order. 

I absolutely loved it. 

The fact that over 800,000 children are abducted every year shocked me. I guessed what this story was going to be about and that was one thing that got me into it. 

The opening hooked me on right away. I was interested in Tim’s journey from the the plane to the Motel. And then came Luke who I adored. 

I loved the relationship between every single character. God, I miss them! 

I especially miss Avery. I cried when he died. That last line really hit me. I was so invested in his character, so intrigued to see whether he would make it out alive or not...and he didn’t. I’ll talk about this later. 

It was horrid knowing Luke didn’t have any family left because those assholes killed them but it was so wonderful that Tim looked after him, I just loved their relationship. 

Mrs Sigsby was a total bitch, obviously. Same with Stackhouse and all the other heartless, bastards that abused the kids. 

I’m so glad the kids retaliated and fought their way out as much as they could. Yes, not all of them got out but not everyone could. They were so brave and so determined to fight their way through it, I liked that.

A lot of it was very sad. However, there were a few moments that I found genuinely hilarious. Some times I laughed for a good 30 seconds, loved it. 

When Luke escaped, that was incredible. He had to injure himself, but he was so resilient to leave, he did not stop, he did not give up, he kept digging and pulling himself until he was out. And he just ran for it. Good on him! 

The ending was good but sad. Nostalgic. Honestly, I would have just shot Mr Smith right on the spot. The kids and Tim had more patience than I would have. I didn’t care what he had to say, the moment I heard his lisp and got out of the car, he’d be lying in his own blood. 

When Luke remembered Kalisha and Avery. The first time they met, that hit me. I remembered reading the part where they met in the corridor. Filled my eyes with water. 

Luke and Avery share joint position in being my favourite characters. 

What I wish had happened, was for the story to get out instead of Tim telling the kids to seal their lips. I wish the world could know their story and for every single one of those evil bastards to be brought to justice. 

It’s Stephen King, so of course it’s going to be damn good. It was a joy to read, was sad and funny. I didn’t want it to end. I don’t know if he’s writing something similar but I’d love to see a sequel considering Mr Lisp is still alive. 

I’m planning on reading ‘The Outsider’ next, but I’m also thinking about ‘Elevation’ or the gunslinger series. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ewr5pw/stephen_kings_the_institute_my_thoughts_spoilers/,2020-01-31 16:47:59,15,9,books
cvdimw,I shotgunned the Dark Tower series from start to finish this month. Some thoughts.,"I tried to read this years ago, but Stephen King's flaky progress lost me. You can't wait six years, and just pick up where you left off. And it's hard to restart from scratch, if you have another half-decade wait ahead.

Finally digested the whole thing (except the Wind through the Keybole and the comics). Spoilers ahead.

• The first book has a very different, un-Stephen-King-like feel that is lost in the rest of the series. The world is bleak, alien, empty. The dialogue is sparse and filled with odd words. The customs are foreign. The names like ""Zoltan"" and ""Cort"" scream fantasy. It feels like something you'd read in those not-so-short-story fantasy/sci-fi anthologies. The ones where you got fat paperbacks for 2 bucks, and read a bunch of promising young guys you never heard of, polishing their words and trying to make their story stand out. Thinking hard about scenes and concepts that will be memorable (what if our whole universe fits on a single blade of grass in an unthinkably larger universe?). Magic jawbones, a succubus/oracle, falling asleep for ten years and waking up to find the guy you were talking to is just bones... very oldschool fantasy.

This vibe partially carries into the second book, but over time we get more modern culture references, more backstory, we dive into past and future new york, and that pure-fantasy feeling dwindles away. 

• That said, some of my favorite scenes are the ones where Roland and ka-tet stumble across ancient-but-advanced technology, in an otherwise medieval-western world where working guns are pretty much the height of tech. There's this sense of wonder, even from the modern-day characters, when they discover some sci-fi gadget or environment. It's fun to see Roland's brief forays into the modern world. His mind is blown by an airplane, which is understandable, but almost equally blown by aspirin and the idea of a cheap box of ammo containing over 100 rounds.

I loved the encounter with Shardik in the beginning of book 3. Discovering it's a cyborg is the kind of cool detail that demands more thought, raises questions: what kind of culture would [genetically engineer?] a bear that's 70 feet tall, controlled with a brain implant? If it's a guardian of the beam, does that mean all the guardians are manufactured? If they die, is the beam vulnerable? What happened to the others? What's the deal with his little retinue? Fun to think about.

• I especially like the idea that Roland's world is not just some totally alien alternate reality, but possibly a glimpse of our own VERY distant future. It's like... imagine shooting right past past sci-fi... beyond the time of Blade Runner or Alien or the Matrix... all the way into a future where even teleporters and sentient robots are thousands of years old. A world that is post-technology, where we're back to using lanterns and horses, because humanity finally self-destructed and lost the ability to make or repair machines. 

It's a cool concept, it takes a different path from most sci. Instead of going into space and encountering alien life, our future lies in rediscovering the strange magical structures that underpin reality. We find and build portals to alternate universes... and then we fuck it all up, presumably with some sort of nuclear-like war. We bomb ourselves back to the stone age. Now there's this sense that Roland's ka-tet (and the bad guys) must exploit these remaining bits of advanced technology before they finally break down.

• Some of the books are better than others but they mesh pretty well despite being made years (decades!) apart. None of them are duds for me, some have more memorable high points than others. The first one got me hooked. The second has some good dramatic tension though I found junkie Eddie and his brother pretty tiresome, and Detta/Odetta even worse. The Wastelands has the post-apocalyptic city of Lud and the discovery of the still-pristine microcosm of the ""old world"" where Blaine rests. The Wizard and Glass might be my favorite, briefly placing the crew in the haunted, post-Superflu Kansas pulled from The Stand, and showing us a young, badass, quietly cocky version of Roland. It's a nice break from the adult version who always seems to be maimed, infected, arthritic, or going insane. 

Wolves of the Calla has a lot more fat than meat, but we get to see the ka-tet whole and competent, negotiating local politics, hidden dangers, and the wolves themselves. Callahan also made for a pretty interesting character.

Song of Susannah was a low point for me, as I never really loved the character and found her whole pregnancy arc very tedious. The final book is a bit of a down, and that's to be expected, it's been hinted many times that partnering up with Roland = death for the characters you've grown fond of. But the concept of the ""breaker camp"" and the battle to save it were cool. It's a drag that Roland's final 'real' companion turns out to the character I liked least, and the final trek seems to be filled with misery and squabbling. 

• The series works great in audiobook format. It feels like being having an old man by the campfire telling you fantastic and creepy stories. The narrator for the first few books, Frank Muller, was gifted. He was in a tragic accident that took his life after 7 tough years of hospitalization. He could convincingly jump from a wisecracking Brooklyn kid, to a psychotically spiteful black woman (""honkey muhfuh!""), to the ever-steady gunslinger, and you'd quickly forget one guy is doing all these characters. He'd narrate the scenes with this measured, ominous tone, that added drama and mystery.

The narrator for the later books, George Guidall, did a fine job... Muller was a tough act to follow. He has a bit more age to his voice, and nails the older characters in the book. He does especially well with the Gunslinger himself. He reminds us that Roland might be old and worn, but he's still vital and dangerous.

• Part of the reason this works better as an audiobook is... Stephen King badly needs a more ruthless editor. There's so much extraneous fat that could be trimmed. I don't need an entire chapter with backstore that explains why Jake is afraid of a giant (illusory) T-Rex. It's self-explanatory. I don't need to read Father Callahan's entire work history. I don't need the entire Charlie the Choo-Choo children's book to get the picture that it's a dark children's story. This stuff isn't that bad, it just doesn't add much. If I were reading it rather than listening to it, I'd be severely tempted to skim.

• I did not Stephen King's inclusion of himself. In general, there's a good reason you're not supposed to break the 4th wall. It feels like an ego trip. Like ""look at me, I'm so clever, I can break the rules and still make you love it"". But I don't love it. I don't love being sucked out of the fantasy world and being reminded that somewhere, there's a clever guy with a typewriter trying to manipulate me as the reader. I don't love characters in a book going ""holy shit! I'm just a character in a book??"" which forcefully reminds me that they aren't real and everything that happens to them is contrived. I don't love King shamelessly including a Deus Ex Machina and then including himself leaving a note saying ""here comes the Deus Ex Machina!"".

• And speaking of Deus Ex Machina, how about a throwaway character who can create magic doors to the reality of your dreams, and defeat the ultimate antagonist with a few minutes of drawing? 

There's also a whiff of plot armor. Walter could easily kill Roland, but just lets him sleep. Mordred can literally mind control anyone he sees, and kill them, but for some reason just chooses not to use this godly power against Roland and Oy. Rhea is a powerful antagonist who dupes him into murdering his own mother, but we don't ever learn how he defeats her. 

• In general, the single most frustrating thing about this series, and maybe all of King's books, can be summed up in these two words: ""too cute"".

The man is always trying to get too cute. Including himself as a character, and the incident where he gets hit by a car (complete with a cartoonishly asshole drunk driver). Then, starting with book 5, all the 19 stuff... 19 letters in this guy's name, 19 books on a table, 19 in addresses, 19 in dates. After a while it gets old because it's so clearly contrived - you're constantly aware there's Stephen King, pounding away on that typewriter, deciding on names and dates and addresses that will make the characters exclaim excitedly ""oh my god! Another thing that is 19! Wow! These coincidences are crazy!""

Then there's the endless references to King's other books. Not just events in the books, but the books themselves. It feels like a plug. Imagine you're watching Pulp Fiction, and when Mia starts talking about her TV career she says ""I was gonna be this badass ninja in a movie called Kill Bill..."" It just makes you roll your eyes.

Some of king's dialogue choices occasionally grate too. Mordred is ""a-hungry"". The hills are ""a-rolling"". OK, Chaucer... Too cute.  
""Commala Come Creech! When the farmers fight the robots then the tower's within reach! Unless he gets blown up by a sneetch!""... Too cute.

I LOATHED the 2nd-to-last chapter, where the author talks directly to the reader, saying ""oh you wanted a real ending? That's so literal-minded, you don't get it, you're enjoying the books wrong. But sigh, ok, if you insist. But you're missing the point."" ... fuck that trolling BS. King's trying to make a virtue out of one of his weaknesses, that he sometimes sucks at endings. Is there a single person who read that and enjoyed it, and felt it added anything to the book?

• Also annoying at Stephen King's penchant for the unnecessary gross-out. Is Roland gonna stick his gun up the fat woman's pussy? Of course he is. Is the wicked witch woman gonna molest the girl she's to prove ""onnest""? Of course she is. The bad guys pop radiation-induces zits and eat them. Mordred's diarrhea is described in loving detail. Roland ruins the powerful moment of seeing the Dark Tower finally, by musing about how he's still just a man who shits and farts. 

• Don't wanna end on a down-note, so some things I really enjoyed: Jake's late night adventure, sneaking into the Dogan. I could see it so clearly. The somehow comical lobstrosities who nonetheless remind us that Roland isn't exactly invincible. The natural settings... beaches littered with floating doors, forests with massive towering trees, mysterious caves, the field of roses. The strange world of Fedic and the castle, a place with many doors into alternate realities. The idea that twisted people used to live there, and did time travel for entertainment, notably to view tragic historic events, wars and bombings and assassinations. A helpful town robot who is verbally abused, and we assume he doesn't have the capacity for being offended, but secretly he's seething. Eddie scurrying up a tree to escape an insane cyborg bear. Finding out that humorless and grim Roland can dance his nuts off, and is actually quietly adept at charming people. The breaker's town being almost like some sort of rich college campus... one with comfortable living, grass, books, great sex, and doing something you're good at and enjoy every day. Roland telling the resentful breakers to basically go fuck themselves. The deeply western feel of Mejis, with its oil fields and horses and pseudo-mexican population. Eddie having more steel than anyone would have guessed. 

This may be approaching the word limit so, I'll cut myself short. I'd recommend the series, despite any gripes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cvdimw/i_shotgunned_the_dark_tower_series_from_start_to/,2019-08-25 20:09:32,22,19,books

mocpxw,The Dark Tower is Life-Changing,"I finished it a few weeks ago. I struggled with the right adjective for the title. Amazing? Criminally underrated? Fantastic? Shocking? I settled on life-changing because it's true. 

I'm a big reader of fantasy sagas and the Dark Tower was like a two-by-four between the eyes. As I've grown older, I've feared that I was growing out of fantasy. The last several fantasy novels I've read were guilty pleasures, yes, fun, yes, but they left me empty. They didn't stick with me.

But The Dark Tower reminded me that fantasy is a pretty broad category, and even within that category The Dark Tower is the weird platypus creature of fantasy sagas. It was written over the course of 30 years, and the story reflects the growth of the writer, evolving both narratively and thematically as King grew up, matured, started a family, and struggled with substance abuse. And there's at least one story swerve caused by other true-life events. It is also, I think, not a story that is supposed to make you feel good about yourself. The protagonist starts out downright unlikeable and evolves into one of the most complex, compelling and ambivalent figures I've encountered in fiction. I'm still not sure how I feel about him. I certainly want to have a few words with him about certain choices he made.

That all sounds rather dour, I guess. But there are few books I've ever read as *fun* as these books can be. Not all of them and not all the time, but the heights reached in *The Drawing of the Three* and *Wizard and Glass* are nearly unmatched, for my money.

I said life-changing. For me, that means that the books really seriously forced me to confront what's important in my life, and whether I'm making the choices that line up with that. I use present tense here because this feels ongoing, this feels like these books will be with me for a long time. We all have our own Dark Tower and our own ka-tet, and it's impossible to just keep plodding on as before after learning the tale of Roland of Gilead.

km325u,My thoughts after reading The Witcher series: A subversion of fantasy (x-post from r/Fantasy),"Over the past month or so I decided to read the Witcher saga from start to finish. prior to this my only exposure to the series was from the Netflix show (which I thought was mostly ok) and a lot of my friends telling me I should play the games (which I plan on doing now that I'm finished with the books.) I came away from the series as a whole with a very different experience than the sum of its parts, and I think there's a lot to talk about. I've tried to mark any spoilers for those who haven't read it but might like to.

**The Short Stories**

Reading the short stories in The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny almost instantly gripped me into the series and world. Each one was framed as a typical fairy tale or fable, but always managed to subvert what we should expect from those kinds of stories (admittedly this was probably more novel in 1993 than 2020). This permeates every aspect of the stories from Geralt himself to the monsters who are often victims more than terrors. 

Geralt is almost modeled on the archetypical ronin or western gunslinger as opposed to a typical fantasy hero. The most obvious way this is shown is the fact that he wanders from town to town picking up odd jobs that serve as a framing device for the story. However a more subtle way this manifests is the fact that Geralt is of a dying breed that is paradoxically both direly needed and seen as in the way by those in power. This is an often overlooked aspect of the Cowboy archetype: the ""wild west"" at the turn of the century was dying, and while they still had a use on the fringes of society, proper civilization with its new social structures were coming and wanted them gone. Witchers in this universe are seen the same way. They are not noble knights, but someone who can be paid money to take care of a problem that others might not even want to acknowledge. It would be very easy for Sapkowski to use this as a way to write a brooding antihero, but he subverts that subversion (which even by then had begun to become cliche) and shows that no matter how much Geralt might want to pretend that all he cares about is killing monsters for coin, he will always care about those around him.

This leads me into a running theme throughout the series, the importance of close relationships and empathy in the face of those who believe that anything/anyone can be justified for the sake of the bigger picture. This is explored a lot more in the novels, but many of the people Geralt encounters in his travel want to use him as a tool to harm innocents or carry out injustices often for no other reason than that they're in the way. Just as Witchers live mostly on the fringes of society, so do many of the monsters and other fantastical races of the world. Because of that, it becomes exceptionally easy to write off harming them or other insignificant individuals as ""for the greater good."" The official Witcher creed is that they should always be neutral and simply carry out monster hunting contracts for money, but it's made abundantly clear by the narrative that neutrality is never really an option. When getting involved in the machinations of people who see people as disposable, the most important thing is to protect the helpless and those you care about, no matter how often Geralt wants to convince himself he's a lone wanderer with no connections to any side. This self-perception vs reality contrast is often highlighted for comedy as Geralt continues to insist he has no friends despite continually picking up a larger and larger group of (wonderful) characters who care about him and he them. It can also be used for drama as Geralt struggles with who he is as a person and whether he is able to have healthy human relationships.


**The Novels**

I had originally planned to only read the short stories because I had heard from various people that they were better than the novels. However the last short story ends on a cliffhanger for the novels themselves so I decided to read at least the first book to see what I thought. The first thing I as a reader noticed was the slower pacing. This makes sense, as writing a 300 page book is very different than writing a 50 page short story, and one could argue that it's actually a 2000 page story given that the 5 novels form one single narrative. I was prepared for that and very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book. It focused on grounded character interactions between Ciri, Geralt, and Geralt's friends. As I said before, the characters in this series are excellent so I was enjoying the ""downtime"" where things could breathe even if not too much important was happening, since that's not something you can really do with short stories. This portion of the book also set up conflicts and characters that would later become important. We later got an excellent chapter exploring the relationship between humans and the non-human races both in times of peace and times of war. However chapter 6 was the first of what I call ""exposition chapters"" of which there are a few in the series. 

These exposition chapters are instances where a lot of fantasy names of people and places are thrown at the reader at once in BoE Chapter 6, the point of view switches from one group of important people sitting around a table talking about important things to another, and I hardly had any idea what anything was. Ironically, when I eventually go back and re-read the series, I'll almost certainly enjoy reading these chapters way more. The people involved and the things happening do end up being really interesting, I just had no way of knowing that at the time so it became very hard not to just kind of gloss over everything. Even a world map would have helped contextualize everything, yet the Witcher series seems to be the one fantasy series in the world that doesn't put one on the first page. The other notable exposition chapter comes two books later in Baptism of Fire when another table of important people are discussing a complex family tree full of names we've almost never heard before. One character even comments that she's confused and the writing sort of implies to the reader ""if you are then that's fine, you just need to know X is the ancestor of Y"", but if you're going to throw a complex explanation as to why this is the case, people will want to follow along. Once again visuals would go a long way in alleviating the flood of made up names to keep track of. There are only a small handful of these chapters, but they stick out a lot to a new reader and can be frustrating.

The next two books, Time of Contempt and Baptism of Fire, are where the plot actually starts and we get to see what the primary conflict of the series will be. I also think this is where some people might be tempted to drop it because at first glance it seems to have adopted a much more conventional fantasy narrative as opposed to the subversiveness that the short stories were known for. That is not to say that they're bad. The big moments are well told and character interactions are still wonderful, but suddenly you've got an evil emperor/wizard, a prophesized princess that needs saving, etc. and everything feels very typical. It's very unfortunate that people feel this way, because this is all intentional. Just as the beginnings of the short stories led the reader to believe that it would be typical fable/fairy tale only to subvert them, the set up here is just like any other fantasy story only to turn everything on its head later.

Sapkowski starts playing with expectations as early as Baptism of Fire, especially with Geralt's ""hanza"" of companions. >!You have a kindly, eccentric hermit that turns out to be a powerful vampire (and one of the best characters in the book.) Then there's the black-masked knight that tried to capture Ciri way back in Sword of Destiny and has been haunting her dreams since then, who in any other fantasy story would be someone Ciri must eventually face an defeat. Except here we learn that the circumstances that led him to trying to capture Ciri were almost entirely out of his control, and he devotes himself to helping Geralt rescue her. There are also smaller moments like Dandelion's ""half century of poetry"" memoirs that are built up for multiple chapters as the culmination of his life's work, only for the book to hard cut to centuries in the future where it's discovered under dirt and then burnt for kindling.!<

Things get very different in the last two books, Tower of the Swallow and Lady of the Lake. Before this point Sapkowski has toyed a bit with non-linear storytelling and multiple points of view, but it kicks into overdrive here. Unfortunately I think this is another point where the series loses some readers who up until this point may have been enjoying the more conventional writing style. The writing definitely starts demanding more from the reader and it can be easy to get lost if you're not paying attention, but I think that the payoff is absolutely worth it. The way points of view from multiple times are used to inform one another is brilliant and when you learn some final piece of a mystery in ""real time"" it hits that much harder. I've seen people complain about perspectives like the trial and the historians, but I personally found them to be a great way to show how others view the protagonists of fantasy stories and how important interpretation is. At times it reminds me of Rashoman.

The way that the series finishes is, in my view, absolutely phenomenal. Everything climaxes in an extremely satisfying way on both the large scale, and more importantly, for our characters. You also realize how much the themes from the short stories carried over to the novels themselves. >!Every faction seemingly wanted to control Ciri ""for the greater good"" (Except Vilgefortz who actually was just evil) and yet we learn that the doom she was prophesized to save the world from was just global climate change that was always going to happen in a few thousand years. Everyone willing to murder to control the chosen one was deluding themselves for personal gain, and she wasn't even the chosen one. Then you have Skellen who aligned himself with corrupt and evil people because he thought the wake of death and destruction he was leaving would be worth it because there was a long shot chance that it could possibly lead to democracy generations down the road.!<  Just as with the short stories, the people who want to control and shape the world as they see fit, even if for supposedly good causes, inevitably become the source of real evil. Not monsters or chaos, but the ones who are supposedly meant to protect. It all ties back to the first short story in The Last Wish.

Then there's the final chapter. >!After everything he's been through, it's tempting for Geralt simply abandon the world and retire. After all, getting involved only results in pain and it would so easy to just decide to do what he always tells himself he will: stop worrying about others and only care for himself. And that's what the plan is, until a riot breaks out in the town where he's staying and innocent people are being attacked. Geralt realizes he can't just let these people be slaughtered. He rushes to their aid and dies in the process. Not from a vicious dragon or evil wizard, but a random guy who got lucky with a pitchfork. It's tragic and yet strangely perfect.!<

v6q3xd,"About: ""The Stand"" by Stephen King (full version, 1988)","I have rarely been so fascinated, amazed, amazed and stunned (because yes, this is also needed after all...) by a book. Beyond the various opinions that can be had on King (including those who like myself praise him, and those who consider him a generator of novels with a mere commercial purpose) I believe that a work so multifaceted and universal for the variety of lives and facts that intersect, due to the multiplicity of narrative levels exploited, is nothing short of unattainable. 

King abandons - but not too much - the horror theme to land in a post-apocalyptic narrative with an even more human face than his works that I already know: it was impossible not to feel part of the survivors if not just one of them, protagonists who crowd the novel and whom we met together with their shreds of life before the virus destroyed everything. In their speeches, in their thoughts and in their lives there is a strong air of humanity, they become attached to them and then follow their path once everything changes quickly.

And if only this... it would take weeks to analyze every single issue analyzed. But do we want to talk about the extreme - and disturbing - realism with which King renders the effects of the virus on the human body? And the thrill sensations that he manages to give when talking about entire abandoned cities? And the human side of the few survivors who are some on the side of good, others on the side of evil? And those ravines where that theme of the paranormal, premonitory dreams and supernatural powers that led me to think that all of this could be a magical realism in a post-apocalyptic key insinuates itself into the narrative? And so much more that I could really go on for weeks.

adbttg,I just finished the Dark Tower saga by Stephen King - what a ride!,"From the end of chapter 1 of the first book I was hooked and after 2^(1/2) months I'm finished (including the 4.5 story within a story within a story).

All I can say is... wow.   Honestly - I don't know what genre to put it in as I experienced a western, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi, an action/adventure, a romance/drama, a dystopian fantasy, and even a little horror.I've tried explaining some of the storyline to my SO and she thinks I was reading a kids book at times, or some weird twisted stuff.  But with all of the strange stuff going on - I could. not. put. it. down.

&#x200B;

Never before have I laughed aloud at a character before, and I've never actually teared up at the loss of co-protagonists.

At times I thought I was lost and confused, but King was always able to provide context and purpose as to why the writing style changed the way it had.  Especially when an author writes himself into the story, I honestly wanted to quit because of the guy's ego - but when you remember some of the odd you put up with before, it's not so difficult to get past, and the outcome of this was pretty rewarding.

Stephen Kings books are all in the same universe, and the more you read the more you notice the influence of his other stories. If you are a fan of SK I promise you that your mind will be blown when reading The Dark Tower. If the movie turned you off, know that the story of the movie doesn't take place in any of the books. They literally removed half of the 4 main characters. I would like to know your thoughts on Stephen Kings writing and what is keeping you from reading his books.

I know that The Dark Tower series is one of the most spoken of here - and so sorry for another gushing post. But I want to thank each person who has celebrated this series on the internet because I couldn't be more glad that I gave it a try.

I really struggled with the first book, and nearly gave up, but I knew there must be a reason that everyone raved about it, so I decided to try again. And goodness me, what a ride. I haven't grown to love a group of characters so much since LOTR and Harry Potter. I was so invested. I was desperately racing to the end of the last book and my poor SO couldn't understand why I was out of breath. Then I got the end and sat in silence for about 30 mins trying to take in what I had just read.

This was about 2 weeks ago, and I've not got over it yet. I've had 4/5 dreams about those troops, and I'm still not sure what to do with myself.

Obvious plans are to read the other Stephen King books that are in canon. But I am now dying to dig my teeth into another series, of any genre, that can grip me that strongly!

I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing, but I’m also left with a lot of questions, foremost of which regard Flagg and Trashy and the Hand of God. Specifically, what the hell *was* the hand of god? And why did Flagg react the way he did to trash showing up with the A-bomb? Based on what Flagg had trash doing before, I assumed he’d be thrilled to be brought this all powerful weapon. But it’s like he somehow knew this thing would be his undoing as soon as trash rolled up with it. Immediately Flagg was terrified of it, and wanted it gone. Why? How did he know the hand of effing god would show up out of nowhere to set the thing off? And why was that even necessary when Flagg seemed to just evaporate and disappear, against his will, *before the bomb even went off.* So was it or wasn’t it the bomb that destroyed him? And if it was, how did it destroy him *before it exploded?*

knva7u,So I just finished the Dark Tower and can I just say...(spoilers),"The last two books really aren’t that bad.

While reading the series, I kept seeing how people say that the last couple of books just dive off a cliff. Are they a step down? Definitely. But they aren’t bad at all. In fact, I think both suffer from one problem each.

For Song of Susannah, King does that stupid thing where he just stops telling the story. If you take the first ~100 pages of book 7, up until when the Ka-tet is reunited, and stick it to the end of book 6, it becomes much better. 

For book 7, the main problem is the villains. All of them are useless and terrible. The man in black, after doing fuck all for most of the series, gets killed by Mordred. Mordred, after being hyped up all through book 6, does fuck all. The Crimson King, the supposed big bad guy, is just a salty old man who lobs grenades. Dandelo threatened the ka-tet more than any of these three and he’s hardly even mentioned. 

Overall, I did love the series. Despite the step down the last couple books are, they only suffer from one fatal flaw each imo and there’s still a lot of good stuff in them.

There were some interesting power struggles and plenty of bizarre settings and characters, but not many moments that stuck with me.

The writing didn’t ‘sing’ for me in the same way that Lynch’s Gentleman Bastards or Abercrombie’s First Law series’ did.

For an abstract world, the characters and settings weren’t as lively as Miéville’s Perdido Street Station

I convinced myself that it was a passive world builder and that the meaning would slowly occur to me over time. But, with the likes of Follett’s Pillars of the Earth and Stanley Robinson’s 2140 to compare to, it even fell short in that department.

>”In glimmers, in shreds of thought, in the aftermath of my reading, I wondered if he kept a journal still, or if the dolphin’s eye had been familiar for a reason other than that it was so human. But soon enough I banished this nonsense; some questions will ruin you if you are denied the answer long enough.”

75sguc,"First details of Stephen King's next novel, 'The Outsider'","From #1 New York Times bestseller Stephen King, whose brand has never been stronger, comes one of his most propulsive and unsettling stories ever.

An eleven-year-old boy is found in a town park, hideously assaulted and murdered. The fingerprints (and later DNA) are unmistakably those of the town's most popular baseball coach, Terry Maitland, a man of impeccable reputation, with a wife and two daughters. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland coached, orders an immediate and public arrest. Maitland is taken to jail, his claim to innocence scorned. Maitland has a foolproof alibi, with footage to prove that he was in another city when the crime was committed. But that doesn't save him either.

King constructs a propulsive plot, and a race against time to uncover the identity of a terrifying and diabolical killer who has left victims—and ""perpetrators""—across the country, and who is on his way to his next horrific act.

King's psychological suspense is at its most riveting in this extraordinarily dramatic and eerie story. He is devastatingly vivid on the experience of being falsely blamed—the effect on the accused, the spouse, the children; the suspicion of friends, even the most loyal; the impossibility of ever being innocent again (if you are lucky to enough to live). He is also masterful at showing us that supernatural monsters are startlingly like human beings who do monstrous things.

5zsh0r,"Stephen King's ""The Stand"" Theories *spoilers*","THIS WHOLE POST IS SPOILERS, SO DON'T READ IF YOU ARE WORRIED.

Just finished reading Stephen King's ""The Stand"" (I have the 1990 Unabridged Version).  There are a couple of theories I have considered, and want to get any feedback to see if others have the same or different viewpoints:

1.  The Plague would never have happened if Stu Redman does not turn off the pumps at Haps Gas Station and allowed Campion and family to burn up in the resulting explosion, along with Captain Trips.  So, the ""Hero"" of the story was really used to cause the whole catastrophe.

2.  Immunity to the plague is related to strength of ""The Shine"" each person has.  That's why it's not specifically related to blood lines or inherited, but everyone who survives seems to have some innate ability, thus the dream communication.  Even Kojak has a unbelievable ability to follow his master across country.

3.  Randall Flagg is the collection of demons known as ""Legion"" from Mark 5:1-20.  King even references this at some point toward the end of the book.  This dovetails with how Flagg can possess animals and be in many places at once, eg. the crow outside the Judge's window.

4.  King intended this as a modernized version of the Lord of the Rings.  Again, he even references Sauron a few times in the book.  Thus the gathering of the party and all the long treks.

5.  ""*Rome Falls*"" Gen. William Stakey's code name for the orders to release the SuperFlu on the rest of humanity.  Would it really have mattered if this order was given or not?  I believe this would have been a **much** better title for the book.

What say you?

85acyo,Just finished my first Stephen King book - The Dark Tower I,"I first heard about The Dark Tower when the movie came out and while I haven't watched the movie itself (yet) the setting sounded really interesting. So I bought the whole series and now finished the first one, which also is my first Stephen King ever. 

I am sure there already were a lot of discussions concerning the series and I read a few reviews about the book but I am really curious, long story short: The book was hella not what I was expecting. 

It should be said that I am German and therefore read the German version and I already learned from the reviews that a lot of questions storywise will be answered in the following books but what really confused me was the writing style. Maybe it is badly translated into my language but the writing was such a mess, while sometimes interesting, I found it really hard to read at other times. Is that through translation or is that just SKs writing style? (I may lack the correct vocabulary but it is so ""jumpy"", ""imaginary"", and it feels like he is changing the style every page which can be exciting but also confusing and tiring). I am curious to learn how the story continuous but if that is SKs style I am not sure if I'll enjoy the ride or if I'll touch another book of him. Which seems quite surprising to me since he is such a famous author, maybe I'll just get used to it though. Or I might switch to the English version.
