7b2yug,"Just started The Way of Kings, getting super excited for Oathbringer!","I have had the pleasure of reading both the Mistborn trilogy and Sanderson's Elantris earlier this year. I am listening to Warbreaker at the moment as well, and though I can say for sure that I am not totally in love with everything Sanderson does, I really enjoy the stories that he tells. What is your favorite Sanderson novel? Why? Are you excited for Oathbringer??

8wzzlp,Just finished The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson and was absolutely blown away by the worldbuilding,"I've read one Brandon Sanderson book before (The Rithmatist) so I knew to expect good world building. Oh my, did I underestimate this author's skills. The world building was amazing! I can't get over the extreme weather and how it affected the evolution of the plants, and animals. The imagery used to describe the highstorms, their speed, even the crem, was nothing short of epic. I loved the illustrations of the plants and animals sprinkled throughout the book. Also, the various cultures and races were really interesting. At first I rolled my eyes at things like the 'safehand', and gender segregation of food in Alethi culture, but as I kept reading and learning more about the world, everything just fit together so well. As soon as I finished this book I bought the sequel. Words of Radiance has 89 chapters, so I know it'll take me a while, but if its anything like the first book it'll be worth it. 

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold! I've only been on /books for a few months but it's so great to see a place that has such great discussions about all things books.

dy56qj,I just finished the Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. I haven’t been this obsessed with a story in ages!,"It’s a science fiction/ fantasy book by Brandon Sanderson, the author of the wheel of time series. (EDIT: apparently only the last 3) 

The story building is phenomenal, I love the way the world is different from our own, and you just have to muddle though at first and figure out wtf everyone is talking about. The characters are a *little* cookie cutter fantasy tropes, but the story itself makes me forgive that.

It’s such a great feeling! I had it on audiobook to listen to during my commutes, but it was so enthralling that I never wanted to get out of my car. I just went to Barnes and Noble and bought the other 2 in the series, and I have the rest of the day off work to be a total bum and burn through them.

It’s just feels like a really long time since I’ve gotten completely obsessed with a series, and I’ve missed that!

Now I would find time on weekends or other times to get longer stretches in but that was maybe an hour or two here and there. I’m just excited that I made it through to the end!

u4mz1j,I finished reading “The Way of Kings” in a just a week after letting it sit on the shelf for 2 years - consider my socks removed due to this story,"So I read 400 pages at first. At that point, the story was extremely slow. I let this book sit and moved onto other things.

I picked it up again recently and I tell you: once I actually *did* read past the halfway point, it became one of the best books I’ve ever read. Especially at the end - the end of this book closes the story perfectly and opens it up to sequels at the same time. It’s amazing.

The thing that kept me going through the middle were all the chapters about the bridgemen. Those were the most captivating.

Maybe you haven’t read it yet. I saw suggestions for this book after I finished *The Name of the Wind* and *The Wise Man’s Fear* by Rothfuss. Compared to those? There is so much better planning, so much better writing in *The Way of Kings.*

I would not have said I liked this book more than Rothfuss’ books if I hadn’t crossed that halfway point. But I did, and I do.

Planning on picking up *Words of Radiance*. These are such long books, but completely rewarding.

This doesn’t mean much, but I only noticed 1 minor misspelling in 1258 pages (I read slow to really take the story in, and catch those things sometimes). It was “spearmen” —> in the context it should have been “spearm*a*n”. But I’ll let it slide.

2wak1d,So. I'm halfway through Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings.,I've never read anything by Sanderson. This book is blowing my mind. It's probably the longest book I've ever read but it doesn't feel like it. The depth is staggering. The world building is incredible. The characters are just so real. And even though I'm loving every single page of this book..I still am not entirely sure of what's going on haha. But discovering clues along the way has been so much fun. If you're a fan of fantasy do yourself a favor and try this book out. It's definitely not Tolkien-esque fantasy at all.

I understand the message here but its literally everyone who’s honorable receives misfortune to a point where im worried thats how all acts of ‘righteousness’ will be responded to.

The characters, magic system and worldbuilding kept me coming back for more every day. 

I had read the Mistborn series by Sanderson also. First time reading multiple series by 1 author and it was neat seeing the similarities in styles, story and characters yet at the same time being able to dive into a completely different world.

fn8mn1,"Help me understand why ""The Way of Kings"" by BS is so praised"," I've been reading ""The Way of Kings"" by BS and I REALLY wish I could like it, but I don't, and it's driving me crazy. I feel like I'm reading a diferent book to everyone else tbh. It feels like the kind of stuff 13 year old me would have found ""pretty cool"", but nowadays I just don't see the point in reading it. It feels ""artificial"", and safe, as if Sanderson wrote down what feels like the equivalent of a Marvel movie. Entertaining at times, with an ambitious setting and background for every detail of the world, but it never gets me. There is nothing about the book I could love. It feels like a shounen anime where everyone is taken very seriously and has some ""serious power"" and every fight is to prove how amazingly amazing they are. And the dialogues are just... they are. As if Sanderson hadn't really thought about what he was going for other than delivering the necessary information. I'm also not even a fan of swords fights in books to begin with, unless they are well written and, well...

The worldbuilding is ambitious and detailed, as I've said, and that's as much praise as I can give it. The rest is... fine. Sometimes a bit annoying, but mostly just fine. I don't see any masterpiece or groundbreaking novel here. For the record, this is not my first fantasy novel, so the genre shouldn't be a problem.

125ebaf,Brandon Sanderson’s “The Way of Kings”!,"after a long, long, LONG time, I’ve finally finished the massive tome that is Brandon Sanderson’s “The Way Of Kings”! I haven’t visited any of Sanderson’s works since I read the Mistborn trilogy a few years back, which I loved immensely. This book definitely acted as a great starter to this series — it had all of the political stuff that I dig in fantasy and great characters (which is interesting, because I never thought I’d like Kaladin at the start and the tables did turn on that one). I found that it never really hit the level of stakes that something like Mistborn did, at least in terms of comparing the first book in a series, however Sanderson’s world building continues to be so rich and complex. Seeing The Shattered Plains take a central role in this story was a real treat. While there were some parts that did slow things down a bit, plus the introduction of certain characters that I honestly don’t remember much about and I wonder the true purpose of, it was a great start to a series I’m excited to continue in. For what it didn’t have in high energy and high stakes, it made up for in slow moving themes on tradition and honour, which made for a fascinating read.

doopnj,"The Way of Kings - An Amazing, Fantastical Journey","So, it took me roughly a year to get through The Way of Kings. I started my reading the physical book, switched to the audiobook, took a break due to a heavy workload, but found myself continuing to come back due to the story. I ended up finishing the book last night and have to say that I am absolutely blown away. This is the first Brandon Sanderson book that I’ve read so far but as soon as I’m done with the next two Stormlight books I will be working my way through Mistborn and the rest of his catalog. 

Brandon’s ability to crazy a story and pace it in a methodical way is like nothing I’ve ever read. Granted, I’ve never been the biggest reader and just the last couple years started diving into fantasy.

6m97xu,[Spoilers] New to Fantasy. I wish I didn't read The Way of Kings before The Name of the Wind,"(Spoilers throughout for both books)

**TL;DR:** I am a new fantasy reader, someone who used to be afraid to try the genre. I was simply blown away by The Way of Kings. And I think it gave me too high of expectations for The Name of The Wind, which is struggled to finish.

**About me:** I’m nearing 30, and have always envied those who have been able to immerse themselves into the various worlds found in large fantasy novels. I’ve been worried that I just didn’t have the imagination or reading comprehension in order to fully appreciate an epic fantasy novel/series. This was made worse by the fact that, at various times of my life, I’ve tried to get into fantasy by starting to read The Lord of the Rings, only to find myself feeling bored and unable to fully form the world in my mind (despite seeing, and loving, the movies). 

This spring, I decided I was going to finally try some true fantasy works. I narrowed my list down to **Brandon Sanderson’s The Way of Kings (WoK**), and **Patrick Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind (NoTW)**. I searched on Goodreads and Reddit, and it sounded like these were popular titles today. 

**In my opinion, after finishing both, Rothfuss’ prose is more elegant than Sanderson’s. But WoK is head and shoulders above NoTW in terms of plot, character development, and world-building. (Again, just my opinion.)**

**Plot:** I agree with some people who have stated that WoK really drags in the middle. It gets off to a rip-roaring start with the killing of King Gavilar, but then slows as Sanderson seems to be setting the groundwork for a big finish. (I really found myself losing interest in Shallan’s chapters). But the plot of WoK certainly picks up, and when the threads start to come together, it left me breathless. The multiple-chapter climax of the Battle of the Tower was remarkable. 

I honestly don’t know what the climax was in NoTW. Was it the incident with the draccus? The scuffle in the Weystone Inn towards the end? Kvothe calling the wind? I’m inclined to think the draccus incident was the climax, but that is hard to believe when one of the main characters (Denna) goes to sleep during it… I really got tired of the “Kvothe needs money” subplots, and, when Kvothe got to University, I all but forgot about the Chandrian until the incident in Trebon. The University happenings (interactions with Ambrose, getting the pipes, being “on the horns”), seemed to really drag on, too. 

**Characters:** I was aware of the criticism Rothfuss gets about Kvothe when I started the book. And, during the early parts of NoTW, I didn’t completely agree that Kvothe was too one-dimensional (the early Weystone Inn chapters, learning from Abenthy, and the first incident with the Chandrian were really interesting). But after Kvothe finds his footing in Tarbean, the rest of the book is filled with him being the super-mega-perfect-hero. I understand the argument that we are hearing Kvoth’s account of his life, and he could be embellishing. But the flatness of Baste and Chronicler make me wonder if Rothfuss just tends to write one-dimensional characters. (I think Denna is intended to be a multi-faceted character, but I didn’t find her to be that way.)

I didn’t find Adolin and Shallan to be the most interesting characters in WoK. But I became so interested in, and attached to, Dalinar and Kaladin it was suprising. Dalinar’s difficulty in understanding his visions, and his struggle about whether to abdicate were very interesting to me. And Kaladin was someone I felt like I grew to love. His winning of the Shards, giving them away, and then being branded, left me greatly affected. And when he decides to save the Kholin army despite his hatred for the Lighteyes, I was so captivated (even if the decision could be seen coming…). 

**World Building:** Roshar jumps off the page. The magic, cultures/peoples, geography, and history were so compelling and fleshed out. I’m not sure how Sanderson did this, but after finishing the WoK, I felt like, despite how much I’ve learned, there was way more that I don’t know (but want to find out). I’m hungrier now than I ever was while I was reading. 

Conversely, I’m not sure if I’m going to try A Wise Man’s Fear. NoTW starts off really interesting. The scrael, stories of Taborlin, the different cities visited by the Ruh, and learning from Abenthy were, I admit, very interesting. But, again, once Kvothe gets to the University, everything seems to come to a halt. I began to lose interest in exploring the world or discovering more about Sympathy. Kvothe’s ease with advancing just sucked the tension out of the work. It was weird: after the incident of the draccus, I reflected on the title of the book, realized that Kvothe didn’t call the name of the wind during that incident, and wondered if it would never happen. And then, seemingly out of the blue, Kvothe calls the wind in a less than compelling final show-down with Ambrose. It felt so tacked on. When the main character can so easily do something that is said to be so rare, it really kills the mystery for me.  

I realize that this has turned into a bit of a NoTW bashing, and maybe that is because of how disappointed I still feel. I’m open to the possibility that I missed something with this work, so please share your thoughts, especially if you disagree with me. 

Like I mentioned, I don’t know if I’ll continue with The Kingkiller Chronicles. However, my current feeling with The Stormlight Archive is that I can’t wait to start Words of Radiance (but am just afraid of being let down considering how much I loved WoK).

w082ac,"So, I just finished reading The Way Of Kings By Brandon Sanderson. WOW.","The only other Book I read by Sanderson was The Final Empire and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So coming into The Way of Kings I thought I had a good indication on what to expect. I was wrong.  The first thing that stood out to me was the world building in this book. It was so well realized compared to The Final Empire. Just how much detail went into this world was astounding.     The magic was very interesting. I really thought that Sanderson did a great job creating Characters with different voices. Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, Wit, and Jasnah just to name a few. They all had their own unique voice.  I would be lying if I didn’t say that Kaladin wasn’t my favorite I have a soft spot for unexpectedly strong leaders. Sanderson also made me enjoy the flashback chapters. I’ve never been a big fan of flash back chapters. But the ones in this book really felt like they were important and not just written for the sake of word count. Even though it was a 1,000 page book it didn’t feel like that at all. I was worried a little because Stormlight is a pillar in the community and is beloved by so many people and I was thinking that what if it doesn’t click for me. That wasn’t the case I’m a huge fan . The interludes was another part that I looked forward to. Even though we didn’t spend that much time with Szeth I felt like he was a in the book more than he actually was. His arc was one of my favorite parts. 

I’m a bit sad that I didn’t get Sanderson’s kickstarter, I didn’t want to invest $200+ for a author I wasn’t fully sure I would like his writing. Hindsight is 20/20.

I'm so glad I did, this is a really great book and Sanderson appears to be an excellent writer.

In searching old posts on Mr Sanderson I'm a little sad to see that this is regarded as his best series yet. Has anyone read what's been released of The Stormlight Archive and then gone back to read his other works? How do they compare doing it in that order?

I've got a couple of long flights in the next couple of days and am really looking forward to spending some quality time reading my new favorite book! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7pl7b0/recently_started_the_way_of_kings_book_one_of_the/,2018-01-11 03:17:37,59,25,books
c3jkwy,"Trying to get into ""The Way of Kings"" by Brandon Sanderson","I hope this post is allowed, I read the rules, didn't find anything against this! 

I've been meaning to pick up Sanderson's hugely hyped series the Stormlight Archives for AGES (since it came out lol) and I just started The Way of Kings early this month. I'm about 100 pages in, and it's such a long slog. I found the second chapter really fun, but there was a huge timeskip after that and I just keep losing interest with all of the different characters and perspectives. 

When does this book get good/interesting? Should I stick with it? I've been reading the guide on the wiki alongside because there's so many characters to keep track of, but it's just so difficult and stressful haha. I want to enjoy this book/series but I'm awful at starting books!

jftnfk,The Ways of Kings By Brandon Sanderson,"
Going into this book, I had a lot of expectations because it's such a hyped up series and not to mention; a lot of people had raved about it to me. Safe to say, The Ways of Kings lived up to those expectations! 

It took me about a month to get thru it, twice as long as it would normally take for me to finish a 1000 page book because there was a lot of information regarding world building to take in, but it was worth it. The Ways of Kings is the start of a masterpiece series in epic fantasy. It’s a series that everyone should have in their bucket list
to read. Its highly character driven, with themes of betrayal, trust, love, hate,
hope and despair etc. Brandon Sanderson fulfilled all of the pillars required for epic fantasies. 

Kaladin, Dalinar,  Shallan and Adolin are
the main four POVs with a few other POVs. As mentioned before, the character development was phenomenal, especially considering that the character’s story arcs were just beginning despite 1000 pages of development. Everything
that happened in the last 900 pages lead up to the climax, and I gotta admit, I was holding my breath the whole time!

Holy God...

First of all, thank you to the people here who recommended The Way of Kings to me. I was torn between Gardens of the Moon and this book and was steered towards Sandersons masterpiece first.

Now then, holy God this battle. The writing. The pacing. The sheer badassery. The only negative: Being up till 2am on a work night because you can't put a book down.

I've read a lot of high fantasy, including much of Sanderson's other works, and the build up and payoff in this battle for our main players is some of the most enthralling reading I've ever done. 

I always enjoyed the way Glenn Cook paced and planned his battles, but this was a clinic. 

If you're on the fence as I was. And find the early-mid stages of the book a little difficult as I did. Stick with it. The payoff is worth the squeeze!

gqiah4,[Spoilers] The Way of Kings was not good,"Okay, first of I will start by saying that this is all just MY OPINIONS, not the objective truth. If you disagree with me that's fine.

Secondly, let me do you a favor: if you have read maybe the first few hundred pages of this book and wonder when it gets good, just put the book down, it won't get any better. It won't get exciting at all until about 1100 pages in and at that point you will probably be so fed up that you won't care. I know I didn't. Seriously, put it down, let the next time you touch it be the time you give it to a friend who might like it better or donate it to a local library or something. 

I had pretty high hopes going into this book. I had read good things about it both here and on other places on the internet, many even say it's their favorite book. So I was looking forward to what I thought would be a good, long series I could enjoy for years to come. Well, for me this series ends with book one.

I'm writiting this partially to blow some steam since I'm disappointed (as you might be able to tell, secondly to show other people who dislike this book that they are not alone and thirdly as a counterweight to the masses hailing Brandon Sanderson as the greatest fantasy writer since pretty much ever. 

&#x200B;

Worldbuilding 

Welcome to lobster desert. This is probably the least interesting fantasy setting I've read about. I heard somewhere how Brandon Sanderson really put time into creating this universe and fleshing it out. I just don't see it. I feel like if you gave a bunch of high schoolers about one hour to come up with a fantasy setting then that universe would feel more natural and interesting than this. To me this world feels very man made and empty. It's desert, and not an interesting desert as the ones we find in real life, this is a desert both literally and figuratively. I'm sure you can write interesting deserts but this one just feels empty. A desert filled with crustaceans in various sizes. That's it. The history or lore or whatever didn't really do it for me either. Basically, this world feels very man made, everything feels designed, not evolved. I'm almost surprised that I don't know how much experience points Dalinar is awarded for each parshendi he kills.

&#x200B;

Action  

The action scenes in this book were so boring that I considered to just skip them. Honestly, nothing ever seems to be at stake, ever. All the characters are VERY much stronger than any opponent, it's like reading about an MMA-fighter beating up a kindergarten class. Nothing cool happens and no one is in danger. One might argue that the reflection some characters engage in during some of the action scenes, either with Sazed being sad that he can't kill himself or Dalinar  thinking killing isn't super fun anymore, is the point but then I would have preferred not to read about sliding tables and big swords passing through opponents more than necessary.

&#x200B;

Characters  

This book has three main characters, Kaladin, Shallan and Dalinar. There are also a few minor characters that get their own chapters but most of these are only visited once, with Sazed being the only exception (I think). I will focus on the three main characters.

Kaladin seems to be the character this book is mostly focused on, unfortunately, since his story is the least interesting one. Although, neither Shallan or Dalinar are much better. Kaladins story is boring and predictable. I -personally- think the book would have benefited from maybe having a few darker scenes in the slave camp. It would fit the setting and give good opportunities to actually make the readers feel something. Even better, throw in some philosophical thoughts about humans will to stay alive or living on hope or something. Instead what philosophy we are given is given poorly in Shallans chapters (I will get back to this). As it stands (as far as I can remember) being a slaves comes across as being at a bad summer camp. Sure some slaves die but as a reader I never -feel- it. It also felt like I've heard the same story a hundred times before. Oh he's the chosen one?  No kidding? Boy, I never saw that coming! He manages to motivate the slaves to better themselves and becomes their leader? Gee, you don't say? I don't think a story i necessary bad because I've read something kind of similar before, but if I already kind of know where we're going at least make the journey worth while.

Shallans chapters were not much better, although the fact that she was the one that murdered her father was probably the most unexpected thing in the book. Other that that it was mostly reading about her studying. And eating bread with jam. The storming jam eating. I can't really put my finger on it but it just felt forced somehow. ""What do you like?"" ""Jam!"" And not just one jam eating session, probably about 4 or 5. As so many other things in this book it just felt repetitious. There must have been a more elegant and natural way to have jam boy try to assassinate Jasnah. I must admit that I didn't see it coming that he would try to kill her but since it had already been revealed that he was shady (since Jasnah knew he was after her soulcaster) it didn't feel like a big reveal. The weirdest point in the Shallan chapters though has to be the philosophical lesson, or whatever we should call it. Suddenly, out of nowhere whe are going out for a walk, completely wreck a few guys, brush it off like it's nothing and then follow with some kind of junior high level philosophy. What was the point of this? If the point was to show that Jasnah was a badass that could totally handle herself in combat then there must have been better ways to show this. Why not somehow corner jam boy so he had to use violence to try to kill her in a more direct way at some point? Then we would be free from the jam and we would be spared the nightly excursion. All in all, I can see Shallan becoming more interesting in future books, but not enough to make me read them.

Dalinar was probably my favorite of the three. The chapters had more intrigue and to me he was the most likeable character. Now I will admit that I had Sadeas betrayal spoiled to me about halfway through the book (remember how I said i read a few reviews) and it's hard to say with any certainty how much this affected my enjoyment of the book. However, in my mind the way Dalinar was described as honorable and honest in a society in moral decay and full of power struggles some sort of betrayal almost felt unavoidable. The whole ""maybe Sadeas is a good guy after all"" pretty much sealed the deal. His change of character in the end is probably my second biggest surprise, and to be honest, even though it was kind of cathartic, a disappointment. Beating up the annoying king, telling him that he's banging his mother and then cut to how he's laying with said mother huddled up  beside him is a little.. I get that he's just been through a lot and that it changed him it just feels a bit much.

&#x200B;

Language and style

 I don't have much to say here since I don't feel like my grasp of the English (or any language haha) is good enough to really give good critique. I will say however that the way this book sounds makes it easier to see how Brandon Sanderson can be so productive. It feels sloppy to me. Like he wrote it, checked for spelling errors and sent it to the printers. The dialogue feels cringy and unnatural. The book is also waaaaaaay longer than it has to be. A lot of this book is repetitive and by the end I feel like there should have been way more content in all these pages. Finally, this is very petty and might be because English is my second language or because I have weird connotations to words but to me words like ""engineer"" or even worse ""scientist"" slightly ruins my immersion in an epic fantasy.

&#x200B;

All in all, as you can tell, I didn't like this book. I feel like it left me with nothing, some books are tedious to get through but in the end you feel like you've gained a new perspective or learned something that makes it all worth your time. Some books are the other way around, you have a good time reading them, enjoying the feeling of venturing into another world and meeting cool characters, and then you move on. This book have neither of these qualities. Maybe I'm just getting old.

Also, I want to be clear that if you are someone who likes this book then I'm happy for you and slightly jealous since you have a lot of reading ahead of you. It just wasn't the book for me and honestly it has made me start to think more about what parts of fantasy literature I actually enjoy.

I haven't been reading as much as I used to lately. But this book drew me in like very few had done before. I spent the last two days doing little else. 

Brandon Sanderson is a master storyteller. The mythos, the world creation, the waves of emotions you get, and especially the spren, are all brilliantly crafted. 

This and The Kingkiller Chronicles are the premier epic fantasy series I've read in recent memory. In my humble opinion, The Cosmere Universe has the potential of becoming the next Tolkien-esque/The Wheel of Time (without the lags, hopefully).

f5x93t,"Considerations on Brandon Sanderson's ""The Way of Kings""","Pre-Premise: English is not my mother language fellow readers, sorry in advance.

Premise: So to start, a few weeks ago i wrote a post here in which i complained about the wheel of time series by Robert Jordan. That series is reguarded as one of the most beautiful fantasy series of all time as i got it, so i thought i hardly could find something wort of it, at least reguarding the plot. God was i wrong  


I was blown away. The Way of Kings is undoubtely the most beatiful fantasy book i ever read, and among the absolute best i stumbled upon. I cound have never imagined finding a story that could astonish me to this point after i gave up on the wheel of time. I enjoyd the world building and the characterization a lot, and after finishing it, i am happy that Sanderson took all those pages (a good 700 pages in fact, and one could easily argue that is too much) describing characters in minute details: their past, their dreams, their feelings, because after all those time ""together"" with them, when i was reading about them, it was like I was reading about ME, so deep was my understanding of their emotional perspective on the world and on the situations they were facing, the people they were dealing with...

I believe the real action started around the last 1/3 of the book, and for the previous partt, i totally disliked Kaladin, but after the final events narrated, i can tell he is my second favourite (Dalinar being the first!!), and is rare that i change my mind this much after i take an opinion on something. I also loved Navani, Jasna and Shanna a lot.

To top it off, the last 10% of the book was...mind blowing. Awesome. I'm out of superlatives. If before these last pages there were 10 thousands worthless and boring ones, the book would still be worth reading just for this tiny bit. So many unexpected things, so epic, so daring! Wonderful! It was long time i enjoyed a book this much!

My favourite point in the plot was:

SPOILER:

The moment Dalinar understands that the voice from its vision was god himself. It was so unexpected, and thinking that god (Not ""a"" god, but ""the"" god, the one and only of that universe) can be dethroned and its status affected, and not simply being omnipotent, is something that really i wasn't expecting. Wonderful.

6zqvk6,The Way of Kings: Book Review [No Spoilers!],"Forenote: I will not spoil any of the plot in this review, I won't just review The Way of Kings, but also his other book in the series: Words of Radiance.  This series has become my favorite series I have ever read in my entire life (I have 350+ books on my Kindle), and I have read through the first two books twice already.


Book Review:


The Way of Kings is the very first book in Brandon Sanderson's 10 book series called the Stormlight Archive.  Here's the real kicker about this series that distinguishes it from every other epic fantasy series ever: each book is 1000 pages long!  Now, please don't leave, even if their approximate 400,000 words each sounds like a lot.  Each page in his two books in the Stormlight Archive is jam packed with action, character development, and admirable writing.  Since the series will be ~10,000 pages long, readers like us are able to have our time and attention truly captivated by amazing story-telling for a long time. With his third book, Oathbringer, to be released on November 14th of this year, I thought I would bring attention to this outstanding series that needs more love than it currently gets.  In this review I will describe in detail pretty much everything I love about his writing:




Originality (10/10):


With a 100% original landscape, fantasy elements, and non-Mary-Sue-like characters that are memorable and admirable in every way.  I will talk about each of these elements later on.



Plot (10/10):


The Way of Kings paves the way for an unforgettable story of Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar as they uncover secrets about themselves and others around them, using them to their advantage, and attempting to figure out who are their friend and foes, each working for their own separate goals which all merge into one later on.

In short, his books are literally the embodiment of Game of Thrones on fucking steroids, without all that much of the sexy stuff and Khaleesi (sorry dragon chick fanboys).  From political backstabs, to manipulation of the world, gravity-shifting, swordplay, 30 ft. tall monsters, giant floods, to ship potential :O, The Way of Kings has it all.  HOWEVER, SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO ADD: the first ~50 pages of the book are REALLY SLOW.  Most of it won't even make sense until later, nor will the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  Once you meet Kaladin and Shallan and begin following them on their journeys, the story begins to speed up and shit begins to go down, which is when you really won't be able to put down the book.  Sorry I didn't really say much about the plot, but I really don't want to spoil any of it if you plan on reading it.



Action scenes (10/10):


Many books struggle a ton with these.  Fast-paced action scenes in other books seem very vague, as the reader struggles to understand exactly wtf is happening.  This is one area where Brandon Sanderson's writing really shines.  Without being overly simplistic in his writing, the reader can picture in his head everything that happens in the book, with two people sword fighting while gravity-shifting in mid-air to following a slave as he runs with others carrying a bridge to cover a chasm towards the enemies amidst a hail of arrows.  Every action scene is so intense, yet so understandable, and I can even feel myself reading so much faster as I blast through these parts, often with my buttcheeks clenched furiously.


Setting/Worldbuilding (8/10):


Talking before about originality, the Stormlight Archive's world is beautifully organized.  The entire series is set in Roshar, a continent surrounded by multiple islands and a vast sea, and similar to Game of Thrones, is inhabited by multiple unique societies.  Although Brandon Sanderson doesn't exactly help us with giving us a feeling of the characters' traveling directions, he kindly provides us with a map, allowing us to follow characters as they progress through the story.  Each culture is wonderfully colorful, and is described as the narrator follows the main characters throughout their new experience of these countries.  


The era the story is set in is one with bountiful merchants on large boats, structured governments with militaries composed of soldiers outfitted with bows, swords, and the like.  There is nothing in terms of modern technology, and horses and carriages are still being used for transportation.




Fantasy Elements (10/10):


Oh ma gawd I could talk about this for ages.  I cannot say much here as characters' 'powers' and abilities are revealed as the story goes on, and all do not know their full bounds until the end of the second book.  For now, you just gotta know dis shit is fking lit.  Ya got people who can shift their sense of gravity, allowing them to run up walls and stand on ceilings, allowing them to sprint around enclosed areas like a Yoda on cocaine.  Ya got things called Shards and Shardplates which are unbreakable plates of armor and swords that can cut through anything, even the soul of a person.  These shards can be summoned after focusing on them for ten seconds, as long as it is bound to you, and often Brandon Sanderson uses these ten heartbeats to ""slow down time,"" putting in numerous details in between heartbeats, adding to suspense and pressure.  Everything here is absolutely insane, and I can't even exaggerate how great it is.



Characters (10/10):


There are no perfect ""Mary Sue"" characters.  None of the characters are cliche in any way.  All of the characters just FEEL human, and Brandon Sanderson makes them so utterly relatable that shortly after being introduced to the characters we are fully invested in the characters' success.  As The Way of Kings was meant to emphasize and focus on Kaladin's character, we heartbreakingly watch as Kaladin is beaten down again and again and again, unable to get up, emotionally, physically, and mentally.  Every character in the book is flawed in some way, with backstories so interesting that mere flashbacks don't feel like they delay the actual storyline.  Every word Brandon Sanderson puts on the page is important, often affecting, changing, altering our opinions and views of the characters with a rollercoaster of emotion.


Overall (69/69):


It's my favorite book of all time.  But don't take my word for it.  Please find out for yourself.  Even if you are a slow reader, read the first 200 pages of the book.  At most it will take two weeks of your time.  Although the series doesn't carry with it a moral or greater purpose (at least to me), it is the best story-telling I have ever seen, whether in anime (yes I'm a weeb, and yes this book is better than kimi no na wa or Attack on Titan 1 and 2) or on paper within a book.  Even though I don't mention it in this review, if you still think that 10,000 pages is still daunting, but you still want a taste of his writing, read his Mistborn series.  The books are much shorter (~550 pages), and the original series is only a trilogy.  Again, if you seem to get stuck on page 10, force your way past it.  It's worth it.

I came along this one and saw that it was free and by Brandon Sanderson. Man I gotta say, it was pretty dull slogging through it, but the last few chapters were amazing, and will definitely have me cleaving through the second one.

49co8n,I finally finished The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson - Discussion thread,"From a World-Building standpoint alone, this book is an absolutely incredible feat. The world of Roshar that Sanderson has created feels real. Many fantasy books give you a map of a continent in the starting pages of the book, and end up telling a story that occurs on an Earth-like planet in appearance and feeling. With tWoKs, it didn't seem derivative of other fantasy series (that I could tell) and various races and cultures of people, plant and animal that Sandson created astounded me. I can see how some people might be overwhelmed by it. At first, it feels a bit like being dropped feet first into the deep-end of a pool when you don't know how to swim, but as the story begins to come together and you find yourself beginning to really understand this world and how it works, the world itself became incredibly satisfying for me. 

Another area that Sanderson excels in, which I knew he would from reading some of his blog posts on his website, is in creating a magic system which has set rules, and costs for the characters using them. There's nothing worse than reading fantasy where a character is a magical being that ends up being unstoppable simply because the author forgot to write in any limits to, or ramifications for magic use. That is not the case here. Sanderson designed a magic system that is introduced within the opening pages of the book, and done so in a way that the reader immediately understands the cost of the magic, as well as the abilities inherent within it. Of course, that same magic system is further expanded on throughout the book, and it appears it will continue to expand in future novels, but the revelations made never felt like they went against what we knew so far about the system. 

There are two areas that I have to take a tiny bit of fault with. The first, is in the armor that Sanderson created for Dalinar, Adolin, and a few other characters in the story. The Shardplate and Shardblade felt a bit much. While wearing this armor, the characters become somewhat invincible, which I think sucked some of the suspense out of the action at times. Sure, they could become overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemy forces they faced, but at times it felt like watching Lord Sauron from the Lord of the Rings cutting down enemies in the opening scene to the trilogy. I worry that the armor makes characters a bit too safe. 

Secondly, I felt that some of the dialogue was a bit contrived. It's not the entire book, and it didn't happen often enough that I felt like my enjoyment was ruined, but the characters sometimes spoke with such a conventionally ""fantasy"" and proper manner of speech that it became somewhat grating. Shallan, for instance, is meant to be a very proper and somewhat sassy woman, but her quips that were meant to prove her intellect never really hit home for me. Similarly, Kaladin had a tendency to become incredibly repetitive in both his inner monologue and spoken dialogue which was annoying in it's own way, although I have high hopes that this will be quite different in future novels. 

That being said, those couple things weren't enough to detract from my enjoyment of the book. This is definitely one of the strongest fantasy novels I've read in quite some time, and I am very much looking forward to starting the second book in the series in a few weeks. (I have it on order as my local bookstore was out of stock.)

Those of you who have read it - without spoiling me on the next book in the series--what did you think of it, and how do you think the next book compares?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/49co8n/i_finally_finished_the_way_of_kings_by_brandon/,2016-03-07 13:48:52,19,10,books
fneo5g,"I Saw What That Other Guy Posted About ""The Way of Kings"" and Thought I Could Voice the Same Opinion for the Wheel of Time series","I've personally never understood the love for the series. I know a lot of people love it, but when I picked it up with expectations for it to be a ""better"" version of the Lord of the Rings I was sorely disappointed. I too am not a stranger to fantasy, but I was in the hankering mood for something like LotR and the WoT fell woefully short. Everything about it, the Aes Sedai, the Aragorn-like warrior, the 4 guys from the village, felt like a rip-off, and not a good one. There was no originality, no changes in any way to the basic underlying plot of LotR, and for all those reviews I read about how the world building was better than LotR, I completely disagree (trollocs? Really?). Every town felt the same, the same words to describe things got old (oh ma lawd did I get tired of Rand and... that other guy's road trip by themselves as they just hopped from town to town). Nothing was explained and everything was just so confusing. And there is no language that Robert Jordan came up with, so that kinda defeats any  claims of a ""richer world.""   


Btw I'm not a purist, and actually have been thinking about giving it another shot, but goodness does it drag.

5w6bqn,"Brandon Sanderson - ""The Way of Kings"" - Something I noticed","I have just finished ""The Way of Kings"". I must say I really liked it, but this post isn't about such a simple fact.

There is a thing I noticed about that book, that I don't see mentioned by anyone else (at least at a cursory glance). It seems to me that a big influence on the book must be... video games. Consider:

1) All scenes with the Assassin in White. Even discarding the seeming reference to Assassin's Creed, all segments about this character's combats read like a novelization of a video game level. I can almost feel player's fingers tapping on gamepad buttons. And his gravity-changing abilities! It's just a kind of thing a game designer would come up with.

2) The Shattered Plains. Relatively small regions with naturally-enforced borders. Differently-colored princes who ""control"" said regions. This looks so much like a strategic map from a game - specifically, Dune 2, - that I can't stop thinking that Highprinces might be not too wrong by treating the whole thing as one.

3) Shardplates and Shardsblades. Shardsblades seem a bit like swords from video games: they pass through matter, and they disappear when not needed. But this is a minor thing. Shardplates, on the other hand, scream ""video game!"" just so loudly! Consider: to hurt someone in Shardplate, you need to hit him several times in the same place. And after the first hit, it begins to leak Stormlight. Do you remember ""blinking"" damaged parts of huge enemies? This is mostly a visual trope of older/retro games, but it's a well-known one.

I'm not saying ""The Way of Kings"" is a ""game novelization"", or that the world of the book is a virtual reality, or anything. Just that... It's a bit too many video game-like things for one book, to be an accident, you know? :) Maybe the author just likes video games.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5w6bqn/brandon_sanderson_the_way_of_kings_something_i/,2017-02-25 21:05:41,7,13,books

hj0q2s,The Way of Kings is NOT AT ALL like the things I normally enjoy reading... But I still love it! (!!!Spoilers!!!),"I haven't read the whole book yet, sorry to dissapoint, but I still feel like I HAVE TO share this right now!

I read plenty of criticism of Sanderson's writing style being too long... too drawn out... too much exposition... and those are all the exact things I HATE about books!  
I just CANNOT STAND it when Characters are given hundreds of pages of backstory just so that I can then start caring about them at the end of the book! Also I like using my own imagination when Characters appear, so the very detailed descriptions of rooms, people, landscapes, cities, it just all kind of bores me. I rather have very basic descriptions, and then imagine the rest myself! (The swords being described is fine though... they're friggin awesome!)  
And even though this book has SO MUCH that I do not enjoy at all... I felt that I had to read it, because the synopsis intrigued me and the reviews were just so good... I kinda had too...

&#x200B;

AND I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS BOOK!

I think something just CLICKED within me, making me understand why exposition is so important!  
There were chapters and chapters of Kaladin just... being a kid... training... being miserable... and I kind of had to slog through it. But when I read the scene in which he takes down a shardbearer and what his superior does to him... my heart completely broke. Suddenly I am ROOTING FOR THIS GUY SO HARD.  
And the chapters about Shallan? Yeah they were kinda cool, I liked the dynamic between Jasnah and Shallan (so far...), but it also got kinda stale...

But then my absolute favorite scene came (favorite chapter?)  
Shallan making a drawing and, not for the first time, drawing these mysterious creatures ... it was kinda creepy, but it happened before, so it wasn't that surprising. But the following, her running down the halls and continously drawing her surroundings? The mysterious being always following her WITHIN HER DRAWINGS? I actually got super anxious while reading! I dreaded reading line after line... but in a good way! And that's when I thought ""Alright, this character arc just reached its peak alright"" that scene in the hospital followed. And my heart friggin dropped. How could Kabsal do this?! Why is Jasnah such a Bitch?! I mean no... I love Jasnah! No I hate her! I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

This book played with my emotions.  
I am really curious to see how some of these other character arcs end up playing out.  
I just wanna say, as a very impatient reader, sometimes its good to step out of your lane. Read something you normally wouldn't. It can be an enriching experience.

&#x200B;

PS: I also LOVE dalinar! Even though I started out finding him boring! Those flashbacks (I guess?) that he has during highstorms? Damn they're fun to read.

100qcyl,Finished The Dark Tower series! It was an incredible journey!,"I just finished The Dark Tower series! It was a long journey, but for sure a remarkable one!

Contrary to many other readers though, I really liked the last 3 books. Also loved the ending! Roland's quest was hard and sad, and it seems to focus on obsession and redemption, and it was amazing!

It started a bit slow to me, and at some point I almost gave up. There are some mannerisms in King's writing style and some references to american pop culture that I didn't really like, and sometimes felt a bit cringe, but maybe it's because I'm not too familiar with said references.

But I'm glad I decided to stick to it, because after a while I was hooked to the tale and the characters, and, by the end, it was like a sad and hard farewell! Not many stories touches me this way now that I'm getting old.

The tale, the journey, the characters, they were amazing! His characters feel very human with the right amount of complexity. It made me connect to them and understand them, even if they're so different than me!

If you ever had the interest to read the series but for some reason decided to hold back, I urge you to do it! If you're looking for a new series to read, give it a try! I think you will not regret!

blqvmo,Which Stephen King character genuinely terrified you the most and why?,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan so, there are so many I could put in this list but I think the scariest character ever to be put on paper is Anne Wilkes.

King does a good job of making his supernatural villians generally as scary as his 'grounded real ones. But Annie really is the personification of fear. She has the worst attributes of a sadist, but she's also childlike and spoiled. She also has huge memory lapses that make her somewhat innocent to her own hyper-violence but all the more terrifying when trying to navigate her mood swings.

I also like the way that King alludes to her behaviour being tied to lonliness and depression which is so believably real for so many of us, it makes you feel anyone could turn into Annie if left alone long enough.

j8f030,11/22/63 is the best book I have ever read.,"I often see Stephen King hated on in subreddits for being to pop culture or somehow a level below other authors. I am now not afraid to say that no matter how many great books I have read 11/22/63 is not only my favorite Stephen King book, but my favorite book I have ever read. There is something about the way King writes characters that has drawn readers in for so long but I feel this book is a perfect example. The characters are outstandingly realistic and you feel as though you know them personally. Not only that but this is a perfect example of his power to blend genres. It’s got the scariness many fans desire along with a blend of action, drama, time travel and it’s an amazing love story. I never lived through the 60s yet this book made me feel nostalgic for a time I know very little of. Not once has a book made me feel as strong emotions as this one and I recommend it to those who haven’t read it.

Instead, I found myself saying, ""Stay with it, stay with it"", and slogging through nearly the entire book. It's not that it was badly written, because it wasn't, it's that he made a couple of literary choices that I spent WAY too much time treating as obstacles. Chiefly:

Naming: I get it, I get it. Fantasy worlds have weird names. It's a staple, and I'm not knocking it. But for some reason, THIS world of weird names didn't work for me. The sounds and rhythms of them were jangly and discordant to my ears, and the protagonist going by ""Kal"" amidst all of it felt like pandering to me.

Exposition: Praise you, Brandon, for avoiding infodumps. But damn you, Brandon, for making each worldbuilding nugget as rare as Shards. I've finished the first book, and I STILL don't have an explanation for all this 'dahns' and 'nahns' malarkey.

... Now that I wrote it out, that's pretty much it. But DAMN, those last (roughly) 10 chapters turned me around. BUNCHES of new information without feeling assaulted, and while the naming issue never really resolved itself, I'm resigned to that being MY problem, not the book's.

8elno6,Just finished The Dark Tower series a couple of days ago and it’s taken me this long to think about and wrap my head around the ending.,"I was hesitant to start this series; I’m a huge fan of King and I’ve read lots of his novels and I knew these books were going to hold something different. I quickly began to love the characters and the premise (I think after the town shootout in “The Gunslinger”, I knew I wouldn’t be able to put these books down) and swept through the series. 

Reaching the end of “The Dark Tower”, I knew there had to be a twist. King ended the epilogue with Susannah, Jake, and Eddie reuniting, albeit without the memories of Mid-World (this made me sad but happy too?). King warns that reading any more after this may “ruin the experience” for some readers but of course, we read on. Roland walking into the final room and realizing with a shock at what he had found made be yell out loud. 

How many times has Roland gone through this? What has he changed, if anything? I feel like I have so many questions yet this was the only way Roland’s story could end (?). 

I would love to see an HBO adaptation or a good movie series (haven’t seen the actual movie and don’t plan too!). 

Just thought I’d share some of my thoughts. I loved this series and love how King ties his other works into the story. 

Edit: Thanks for all of the comments! I wasn’t expecting this much feedback but I’m glad I’m not alone in my thoughts on the ending and the series in general. Sounds like Amazon has a series on the way at some point so I’ll be waiting for that!

10y8b19,Happy 50th Anniversary to The Princess Bride,"Technically the real anniversary date would be the 1st of September, but we are at least in the same year!

I know we can't take anything promised by William Goldman seriously, he is a comedian at heart, but it does make me sad he is no longer alive to write Buttercup's Baby or publish a 50th year anniversary letter to us fans.

I wanted to ask if anyone could think of an author who you would trust to write it, seeing how Stephen King was recommended but turned it down, or is it best the way it is? A single chapter at the end of a great book.

Side note: I once convinced my entire class of seniors that if they could find a Florinese unabridged copy of S Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure I would give them 100% in their English Capstone class for the year and have to do no other work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10y8b19/happy_50th_anniversary_to_the_princess_bride/,2023-02-09 22:28:54,243,5582,books
wef9d6,"I haven't seen any discussion here yet about the potential merger between Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster. As book fans, and supporters of authors, I think this is something we should be paying attention too","Here's the best article I've seen in the last couple of days about it: [https://apnews.com/article/stephen-king-government-and-politics-a90ec7fb88505213ba1292c424ec6287](https://apnews.com/article/stephen-king-government-and-politics-a90ec7fb88505213ba1292c424ec6287)

Here's my best attempt at a TLDR; Penguin Random House (largest book publisher in the world) wants to buy Simon & Schuster (fifth biggest), which would turn the big 5 publishers into the big 4, and give the new company nearly half of the book market. 

The government argues that the merger likely wouldn't result in higher book prices for customers, **but does think it would result in lower incomes to authors**. As someone who loves authors, that seems like it would be an awfully bad outcome to me, and in general I can't really see any way this would benefit anyone - both companies seem big enough to me that I can't imagine there are a lot of new economies of scale in the actual printing of books or back office functions, so I can't imagine any possible world where book prices going down as a result.

uev1j,The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is one of the best books I have read in a while,I have not seen any posts talking about this book and I believe it deserves some attention. I simply enjoyed everything about this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy novels. The beginning is a little slow but you have to keep in mind it is the first book in the series The Stormlight Archive so it has to set up the plot properly but it is worth it in the end. As usual Brandon Sanderson delivers as expected. Can't wait for the next book to come out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uev1j/the_way_of_kings_by_brandon_sanderson_is_one_of/,2012-06-01 01:20:35,8,3,books

tvnkoc,"The Stand, by Stephen King","I'm sure this book has been talked about on here already, but here is my quick take.

I'm forty three.  I first read it in around '91 or '92 when I was in middle school.  It was the biggest book I had ever read and it played well to my liking of stories like Canticle for liebowitz,  Mad Max and the Earth Abides.

I read it again in my early 20s and once again enjoyed it.  Fast forward another 20 years, and I picked up my old tattered copy a few days ago.  I cant put it down.  This is the first book since the pandemic that I am truly reading and enjoying without it feeling forced.

Feel free to comment about my words or preferably Stephen Kings.  The Stand is a classic and so well written. And in today's world, maybe even kinda prophetic in it's own weird way.

fg810s,"Boy, did I pick a really bad time to read The Stand","A month or so ago, I was watching The Outsider, which got me in the mood for Stephen King. I’m not his biggest fan, I gave up on The Dark Tower after The Drawing of the Three, thought The Shining was only okay. Loved the TV adaption of 22/11/63. 

I did a quick search for second hand books in my area, and picked up a copy of The Stand. Took me a bit to get going but I’m halfway through now. 

Boy, oh boy, is this book hitting way to close to home. Basic necessities are sold out right now where I live, and all I see on the web is news about the virus and the death toll overseas rising.

For me, two obvious ones are Return of the King (no explanation needed - has there ever been a better conclusion to a trilogy?) and Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian; whilst not my favourite of the series, the battle of New York is the epic finale the series deserved and the goodbyes at Camp Half Blood really feel like the end of an era. The sequels - Heroes of Olympus - never really clicked for me in the same way and had - guess what - another really disappointing ending...",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11v3di5/whats_the_best_ending_to_a_book_seriesfranchise/,2023-03-18 22:46:45,614,854,books

j25rn1,The Dark Tower is fantastic,"I’m reading the series now for the first time, because pandemics give you a lot of reading time, and man, this is amazing. The characters are some of the most well-drawn and loveable I've ever seen, and I don't think the writing could possibly be more gripping.

At first I was confused as to why you don't tend to hear about this series talked about in the same breath as the other great fantasy sagas. Eventually I concluded it has to be the first book. It is a very unusual book, and it's very unlike the rest of the books in the series. >!After talking to a friend about it, I think that Roland's choice to ""kill the little kid"" turns a lot of people off. In fact, Roland's whole portrayal in the first book is almost completely unlikable, and it's hard to imagine enjoying a whole series about this monster. Of course, once you're 3-4 books in, you understand why Roland starts out this way, and come to really appreciate what King has done with a protagonist who isn't just yet another teenager who needs to master his magical powers.!< If you've read the first book and were turned off by it, I would recommend giving the few chapters of the second book a try, to see the direction that King starts to take things, in particular once a new main character >!<3Eddie<3Dean<3!< is introduced.

1bnmt03,I finally started my 17-book adventure to The Dark Tower with The Stand and it's a horror masterpiece,"“The Stand” by Stephen King is a novel I regret not reading sooner. I knew going into this that greatness was awaiting since many readers consider this one of King’s best books ever written and let me tell you, it delivered and then some. In case you didn’t know, I have officially decided to start my journey to The Dark Tower and wanted to do a ton of pre-reading to ensure I get the complete experience the best I can.

I am conquering The Dark Tower by reading all these books leading up to it. In case you want to know what I think the best reading route to go is, here’s how I’m reading everything after weeks of research and asking several Constant Readers for their feedback...

The Stand  
The Eyes of the Dragon  
Insomnia  
Hearts in Atlantis  
‘Salem’s Lot  
The Talisman  
Black House  
Everything's Eventual (The Little Sisters of Eluria)  
The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger  
The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three  
The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands  
Charlie the Choo-Choo  
The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass  
The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole  
The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla  
The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah  
The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower

I know, I know. 17 books. I have thousands of hours of reading ahead of me but if “The Stand” is any indication, this will easily be one of the best reading experiences of my life. I’m super excited to finally read all these books (some I have already read) and my goal is to be finished before King’s next new anthology “You Like It Darker” comes out on May 21, 2024.

Before I jump into my review, I found a ton of trigger warnings while reading as many of these are very graphic. They were…

\- Cancer  
\- Suicide  
\- Abortion  
\- Domestic abuse (physical)  
\- Racism  
\- Pandemic  
\- Quarantine  
\- Dead animals (cars, dogs, kittens, rabbits, and rats)  
\- Drugs  
\- Drinking and driving  
\- Parental abuse (mental and physical)  
\- Vaccination  
\- Rape  
\- Bullying  
\- Dead children  
\- Burning churches  
\- Homophobia  
\- Death of a child  
\- Self-harm  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Violence against women  
\- Religion  
\- Politics  
\- Violence against animals (hens and chickens)

If any of these triggers you, please do not read this novel. “The Stand” is hands down a horror masterpiece and at this point in my life, the longest book I have ever read. This tome is 1,348 pages deep and I know is an intimidating number to many but it’s worth it.

There are two versions of “The Stand” which is the original one that was released and truncated in 1975 due to how much of a behemoth this novel was at the time and a newly re-released “complete and uncut” one in 1990. I went with the latter since King re-added over 400 pages of text that were removed and revised everything to unleash the true vision of this novel he wanted. I love how King wrote about that to start this novel off to keep it real with his Constant Readers. It is officially King’s longest stand-alone novel in his catalog and will go down in history as one of the greatest horror novels ever written.

King held nothing back in “The Stand” as the intense opening set the groundwork for one hell of a ride. I loved the tension and suspense right off the bat and instantly loved all the unique characters I met along the way.

Speaking of which, there are a ton of characters in this novel to the point where I had to take quick notes on who is who due to a lengthy list of people. I didn’t want to get confused but thanks to my notes, it was pretty easy to remember everyone and enjoy everything in stride. I also loved all the references King had in here from my hometown of Queens here in New York, Freddy Krueger, The Lord of the Rings, Shirley Jackson, Norman Bates, and many more.

This novel was divided into three books all of which contained a bunch of mini-stories in addition to the main story. It was just a brilliant way of formatting everything so you are still kept in the loop of what was going on with the main characters and also all these side characters. I loved how you never knew who could end up being one to keep an eye on as their story progressed.

There weren’t any boring parts as all the dialogue, situations, and horror were top-notch. King is the master of subtle horror that hits you and continues bringing that terrifying dread of what was ultimately going on. Needless to say, this novel hit home with me and probably many other readers since it’s eerily similar to the whole COVID-19 pandemic we dealt with a few years ago. Imagine that but taken to extreme new heights in a way only King can deliver.

All the descriptions, stories, atmosphere, and overall horror are perfection. I couldn’t put this novel down as it took me over two weeks to read and I even dedicated my days off from work to get through it because it’s such a massive and addictive novel. It’s great and I assure you if you’re one of those readers that think this book is too big or would take forever to read, it’s worth it if you chip away each day and don’t rush anything. Take your time reading this as it’s a novel you will never forget for the rest of your life.

Another nice touch was how King added graphic illustrations to this novel as you read to capture some pivotal (and creepy) moments to add to this epic reading experience. I love when authors do this since it brings me back to my teenage days of reading horror paperback books where every chapter had a graphic illustration or they were sprinkled in between chapters.

King did not hold back when it came to all the horror, gore, and creepiness. Some of which I couldn’t believe and made many weird faces while reading as I started to put the pieces together to the mystery of this disease. Once that was revealed, a whole new part of this novel opened up to situations I never read before in a horror novel.

Once all the characters were finally connected and the race to the end was on, this is where “The Stand” truly delivered. There’s even more horror including a bloodbath of an action scene that was unexpected and pretty intense with some of the main characters. Out of this impressive roster of characters, while hard to choose, I loved Frannie, Stu, Nick, and of course, Kojak the dog. I can’t also leave out the main antagonist who had some scenes that sent chills down my spine… the infamous “Man in Black” Randall Flagg.

This was the first time I’ve ever read a novel involving Flagg and wow, I can see why he is despised by so many. Some of the situations involving Flagg were insane and now that I got my introduction to him, I’m excited to see what happens in the future with such an iconic villain in King’s Dark Tower universe.

The climactic race to the end was monumental as King takes the famous “good vs. bad” angle to new horrific heights. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but all the plot twists and turns led to an awesome drop-the-mic ending. It was so good that I went back to re-read the last few chapters again because they were outstanding. I never saw that coming and am beyond satisfied with how it ended. The range of emotions from sadness, laughter, rage, disbelief, hope, and heartwarming moments were just some of what I experienced while reading this novel. All of which will last a lifetime with me as it was such a powerhouse of a novel.

I give “The Stand” by Stephen King a 5/5 and would give it a 10/5 if I could because this was by far one of the best novels I’ve ever read by King and in my entire life. The incredible story, memorable characters, a villain for the ages, brutal horror that only King can deliver, and the power of hope led to such a powerful read. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to prepare for the next step in my journey to The Dark Tower as I plan to start “The Eyes of the Dragon” next.

91klrg,Just finished reading 11/22/63; the ending was the first time a book has made me cry,"Man that was amazing. I never thought the ending to a Stephen King book would be what would push me to tears. Kinda ironic I suppose considering the main character is someone who never cries until the end. But fuck, it’s just so sad. You spend the full book focused on the assassination, but in doing so you put to one side his relationship with Sadie. I didn’t realise how emotionally attached I was to them being together until it wasn’t possible. Jake spends his full life looking for the life he builds with her, the sense of fulfilment, the emotional connection that does actually push him to tears, the close friends and meaningful connections. And yet just like that, it’s gone, never to come back. It’s like real life; we focus so much on things that seem important to us, when really they don’t matter at all. It’s not until much later when you look back at the time that has past you realise what’s really been important all along.

The only thing that matters to Jake at the end is being with Sadie, and he simply can’t. While for him it’s due to time travel shenanigans and knowing it could cause chaos in the future, it’s really just like real life; by the time you really realise what’s important to you, it’s usually already gone with no way of getting it back, and you’re left only with the memories. Jake takes for granted he can always just ‘reset’ and meet her again, just like we take for granted real life just has a way of things working out. I guess I’m just a bit of a sucker for lost love or whatever, but the whole last scene when he dances with old Sadie for the last time made me cry. Her kind of but not quite remembering him from somewhere because of the residue, tripping up due to her clumsiness, both of them getting caught up in the moment even if she doesn’t quite understand why, him telling her simply that he’s just ‘someone she knew in another life’, knowing that somewhere, somehow, if things had aligned differently they could have been together for not just this little moment, but their whole lives. God damn heartbreaking. King doesn’t usually get endings quite right, but fuck if he didn’t nail it that time.

c6vmh3,I'm 30 years old and I just finished the a book for the first time in longer than I can remember. I feel like I have discovered a whole new world.,"I have always disliked reading. I blame it on the way that reading was presented as a chore during my childhood, but that's not what this post is about. 

I just finished A Clash of Kings. It was so good. I read for nearly 12 hours today to finish it. I'm a slow reader, but I couldn't put it down (even though I pretty much know what's going to happen thanks to the show). Reading for that long is simple unheard of for me. In the past when I would attempt to read, I could last maybe 30 minutes and be bored with tired eyes.

I have finally realized something about books. It's not about the destination. It's not about how fast you can read it, how many books you can read, how long or short it takes you, and it's not about getting to the end as quickly as possible. It's about the journey, the imagination, and enjoying each page.

This is probably an elementary point to most of the people here, but for me, it's a huge paradigm shift. And it's one that I'm thrilled to have had. 

I feel so accomplished and proud of myself right now. Finishing a book is one thing for me. Finishing a book that's almost 1000 pages is something I never thought I would do. But I also feel that I've unlocked so much adventure just waiting for me. 

It may be dumb, but I'm excited and wanted to share with someone. I have now set myself up with a Kindle connected to my library, I am on the wait list for a couple of books there, and I just placed an order for 3 more books (Elantris, Mistborn, and A Storm of Swords).

E: I will be coming back to this post for recommendations for awhile. You all are a pretty cool bunch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c6vmh3/im_30_years_old_and_i_just_finished_the_a_book/,2019-06-29 06:41:27,566,8184,books

skrsem,Man... Tolkien didn't have to go so hard with the tale of Beren and Luthien in Fellowship of the Ring,"First time reading Lord of the Rings... Yay!

Not even halfway through, and it's already a 9/10! Tolkien has such a homey way of writing magic and adventure, it's modest and easy to follow, while being completely OVERFLOWING with lore and detail. Almost like your favorite teacher, or an old man that you look up to is reminiscing a great tale.

And let me tell you, something happened that elevated this book to 10/10, and that's the story of **Beren and Luthien.** 

When this plot diversion occurs, Frodo, his Hobbit friends, and Strider are all sitting around a fire at Weathertop. They're all weary, and nervous of the Nazgul stalking them, so Strider tells them a story to pass the time. 

What follows can only be described as **mythologic**. A classical epic. Lore, of the absolute highest caliber. 

*In the first age,* *Beren was the son of the king of Men, Barahir. At the time, They led a force to destroy the ancient king of darkness, who yet goes unnamed but it's obvious who it is, and of whom Sauron was merely a servant... And they lost. The force of men was destroyed, Barhir was killed, and Beren barely escaped into the wild with his life....*

*Eventually, after wandering the forest after many days, he came upon a beautiful Elf singing, whom he named Luthien Tueniviel. They soon fell in love, she restored his strength and gave him purpose, and together they faced many perils....*

Keep in mind, this page-long epic story is being told WHILE Frodo and his gang are having their own epic adventure!

*Beren and Luthien together overthrow the dark lord! Claiming the prize that the Dark Lord treasured, Beren was set to marry Luthien. But the Dark Lord would have his revenge... a great wolf was released from the Dark Lords domain, and he tragically killed Beren in battle. Luthien, an immortal elf, forsook her immortality in order to be together in death with her love. It was a tragic end, but also really quite reassuring knowing that they were together.*

*It is said that their spirits walked the forest once more before departing from this mortal realm....*

IDK about you, but I consider this an ***amazing*** diversion. It's so excellently told, flowing with description and narrative beauty, and it serves to build the lore and history of a world that has only had one other book up to that point! It's so complete, it could be legitimate mythology. Not to mention, the clear narrative parallels between Aragorn and Arwen :)

I've no doubt Tolkien has many more epic stories like these. Can't wait to see what more is in store, lore-wise!

750i5b,"I finally read ""The Lord of the rings"" books, and they were better than I've ever expected.","Warning: spoilers 

Four year ago when I was in high school I bought and read ""the hobbit"". It was a well written book that got me really into the story and excited to read LOTR. So I read the hobbit again, but unfortunately I couldn't get myself to start with LOTR, partly because I bough all three books in one and it looked intimidating to finish, and partly because I started with university and I didn't have much time on my hands till beginning of this summer. 

I start with the fellowship beginning of July and it just hits me hard with nostalgia of the hobbit. Tolkien's style of writing didn't feel tedious like many other stories I've read. He paints a picture and explains in a way that I would've never thought I'm capable of imagining. 

Today I just finished ""The return of the king"" and it's bitter sweet end to me. I feel attached to the books after 3 months of reading and sad that I know I won't wake up to a chapter of the book with my morning coffee. But at the same time I'm happy that I got to read all of it finally and it was such a journey that I've never expected and I recommend the books to anyone and everyone.

But I have one thing that is confusing me, that is the time of the journey (to mount doom and back). At the beginning of the book Bilbo is celebrating his 111th birthday, and a year after that Frodo leaves the shire, when Bilbo is 112. Now after they come back from mount doom, gandalf sits with Frodo and tells him that although it might feel long ago that he started out of the shire, it's only less than a year since then. And that timeline was mentioned I think a few times after. But when they are on their way back to rivendell and celebrate Bilbo's birthday, he is turning 129. That means he grew 17 years older in this one year. Am I missing something here ? What's going on ? 

I would love to hear from other people who've read the books :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/750i5b/i_finally_read_the_lord_of_the_rings_books_and/,2017-10-08 07:54:17,834,8956,books
17hltq2,What book series has the most complex reading order? Why that one? How complex is it? In what way?,"When someone asks ""where do I start reading Discworld?"" there's a bunch of different possibilities and their storylines all intersect. Then there's ones with clear starting points and general paths, but with a lot of other stuff that comes in-between, like the Malazan Book of the Fallen or Steven King's Dark Tower series that intersects with various horror novels of his. Then there's the ""cinematic universe"" approach of things like Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, that start with multiple standalone novels and series that later on intersect in small ways and then bigger ways, to the point that you'll need to have knowledge of multiple sub-series to read some of the newer books.

I was wondering... what book series has the most complex reading order? Is it any of the ones I already mentioned? Is it one I hadn't even realized had a complex reading order? Is it a series I might not even ever have heard of? I'm curious! And why do you think it's that one? How complex is it?

ecenwt,I just finished reading the entire Shakespeare bibliography for 2019,"I have never really watched any Shakespeare plays, or studied any of his works. I was familiar with *Romeo and Juliet* and *Julius Caesar* from high school, but other than that, while I knew of *Macbeth*, *Hamlet*, and others, I never really bothered to check them out. At 41 years old, I felt like I was missing out on something great.

I'm not a teacher or a librarian. I'm not in college or in any other way compelled to read Shakespeare other than personal curiosity. So, I set a goal for myself that 2019 would be my ""Year of Shakespeare"".

I kept the history plays in chronological order based on the date setting of the play. The comedies, poems, tragedies, and problem plays I randomly shuffled. I also included aprocraphyl and collaboration works in my goal. I came up with 48 total works in Shakespeare's bibliography to tackle.

My favorite work of Shakespeare over the entire bibliography would be *Titus Andronicus*. It was so shocking at the amount of violence, that it felt like an outlier compared to the rest of his works. Aside from that, it was just really engaging story telling. I was glued from the start of the play to the end, which really only happened also with *Macbeth* and *Hamlet*, and which I also count among my favorites.

My least favorite work would be the *Sonnets*. I guess I'm just not a romantic, but 154 poems about romance just put me to sleep. Granted, it read darker than what I would expect from love poetry, and even homoerotic in some parts, which wasn't a shock, given the homoeroticism he penned elsewhere. It just didn't resonate with me.

As an unpopular opinion, *Romeo and Juliet* is overrated. I enjoyed *Antony and Cleopatra* for a romantic tragedy more. It felt more grounded at human love and it's problems, where *Romeo and Juliet* felt too contrived, and I really just don't resonate with ""star crossed lovers"", especially when teenagers are involved. Both endings were very abrupt, however.

My favorite character would be Falstaff, as a companion to Prince Hal in *Henry IV, Part 1* and *Henry IV, Part 2*, and the oddball in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*. Even though he's presented in the plays for comedy relief, I found him remarkably complex as a character, despite all his faults. I think there is a great deal of potential here for fan fiction.

I learned the following phrases were first penned by William Shakespeare:

* ""Send him packing"" in *Henry IV, Part 1*
* ""Eaten out of house and home"" in *Henry IV, Part 2*.
* ""A laughing stock"" in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.
* ""All that glitters is not gold"" in *The Murchant of Venice*.
* ""There's a method in my madness"" in *Hamlet*.
* ""Double double toil and trouble; fire burn, and cauldron bubble"" as well as ""A sorry sight"" both in *Macbeth*.
* ""Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em."" in *Twelfth Night*.

I tried to keep a pace of about 4 works per month, but life gets in the way, in addition to reading other things, so in the summer, I didn't keep that pace faithfully, and had to seriously catchup in the autumn if I were to meet my goal.

Here's how my year went:

I've heard a lot about Shakespeare throughout my life, especially living in Utah where a large annual Shakespeare festival is held every year.

This kid is hilarious, often times when he repeated something or blatantly contradicted himself I laughed out loud (rare for a book). I started to think about stuff in his wording in my head at a certain point and yeah. I mean he complains about stuff but I just found it endearing, interesting but never annoying. He is such a nuanced and realistic/relatable character that I feel like I could imagine what he would think and say about anything. That's a brilliant achievement. One of the most well realized characters ever created in any medium, period. Also he's outwardly a really nice person. He cares deeply for his siblings, he asks to bring Ackley along to get burgers because he knows he doesn't have any friends. He gets pissed at Stradlater because of the way he only likes Jane for her looks and wouldn't care that she ""keeps her kings in the back row."" I wanna give this kid a hug.

2vkitu,So I've recently finished the Dark Tower series...,"After a time lurking on r/books during which I was reading my own random assortment from the unread titles on my shelf, I browsed this sub for some ideas on what to read and gathered that The Dark Tower sounded like just what I'm into...and I wasn't mistaken.

I grabbed the first book in October and was absorbed in the series nonstop from that point. I devoured each one, reading in any spare time and staying up late to finish chapters. I think I read Song of Susannah in 3 or 4 days. When it came down to the seventh and final installment it was like I was on my own quest - neither my local library nor the one just north of me had it and I had to track it down after a bit of a drive, and it was worth it. 

I haven't been so engrossed and INVESTED in such an epic story since I was younger reading the Harry Potter books. The characters came to life for me and there were a few times at night I actually had dreams of gunslingers. The ending of the final book, I had to remove myself from the house (TV was on, parents talking) and finish it in peace, and once it was done, I didn't know what to do with myself. I was emotionally drained and felt like an era had ended. 

Anyway, thank you r/books for pointing me toward that story and more (I just started On The Road by Jack Kerouac). I think this is a cool community and I hope to be more active in sharing. 


EDIT: This blew up, and I'm glad for all your responses. Definitely a lot more displeasure with the way King ended the series than I knew (both the last few books, and the way book 7 wrapped up in particular). I totally dig that so many were disgruntled by the end. To answer some of the main questions folks have asked me:

What did I think of the ending? I was not as unhappy with it as many others were. I enjoyed all seven books, however forced/contrived King might have made it while under pressure to complete the series. As I replied to one user, it may have helped that I started recently. I probably had the revised(?) editions some people mentioned so it may have flowed better, and also I didn't have to wait years and years for the next book just to find a contrived twist later on. 

Have I read supplementary/related works? Nope, but I will now! I think I'll start with The Stand, and also search for the graphic novels which sound cool. I'm hoping to take a road trip to Canada in the not-too-distant future and will invest in audiobooks at that point too.

Thanks all for the discussion, and for bringing me to a new favorite! For those unhappy with the way it ended, I wish for you a fine new saga that will be everything you hope for. There'll be water if god wills it.

EDIT2: and thanks for all the additional reading suggestions! I've started a list. There'll be no shortage of good reads in the foreseeable future",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2vkitu/so_ive_recently_finished_the_dark_tower_series/,2015-02-11 19:53:56,927,1803,books
233uiu,Wizard and Glass: The Dark Tower IV by Stephen King... About 1/4 of the way through and I may throw in the towel.,"I've read King on and off for years, having most recently finished his *11/22/63*, and thought I'd pick up the Gunslinger series again.

As fascinating as I find the overall concept, I think I've come to realize the following:

* I've grown less interested in the characters, their journey, or what may happen to them.
* I find this particular mixture of technology and magic to be un-interesting. I don't have a problem with the genres being employed in the same universe, but the way that it's done here just seems to lack care.

joxygl,"Stephen King's ""The Stand"" is such an underrated masterpiece","I know King is extremely popular and ""The Stand"" is one of his most popular books, but in the grand scheme of things I think this book is so underrated. Unlike 'The Shining"" ""It"" or ""Pet Sematary,"" no one outside of Kingdom knows about it, owing mostly, I'm sure, to the lack of a notable film adaptation to place it within the cultural zeitgeist. 

Besides that, though, I think this book is overlooked frim a critical/literary standpoint, too. It never gets talked about at the university level and I know King himself has been famously spurned and looked down on by the literary community, but I just can't believe the absolute treasure trove of devices and and mechanics and characterization being ignored here. 

This has been one of my favorite books for years, but rereading it now for the first time since high school I'm blown away by this thing. The introduction of Frannie Goldsmith may be my favorite character intro in all of literature. Her personality is painted so quickly and vividly I was knocked out of my chair. That whole opening scene between her and Jess just oozes heart, personality, and melancholy. Not only is it a great intro for Fran, but also in setting the stage for the whole novel and the bittersweet feel of it all, including the end. 

The first three chapters of this book just feel so much sharper than I remember. King's prose is incredibly fresh here and his descriptors are staggering. Maybe my heightened appreciation for it only comes from the fact that lately I've only been reading King's new stuff, which is stale garbage, but this... This is something special. 

What do you guys think? Agree or am I nuts?

EDIT:

Wow, I was not expecting the absolute shit storm this stirred up. At all. 

To be clear, titling this ""underrated"" was a mistake as it conveys the wrong idea. I've also been blasted for calling it a masterpiece and told I don't know what ""underrated"" is. I am not using ""underrated"" and ""I like this book"" interchangeably. I like this book a lot, yes, and think it is King's masterpiece. I know it has been adapted and influenced music. None of that addresses anything else I said in my post. I think the actual writing and mechanics of this book don't receive enough attention- and some people have said they think the writing and characters are poor, which is ok. I'm not going to tell them they're wrong, especially when they take the time to give the reasons they feel that way. My question this whole time has solely been:

Why is this book not regarded as critically ""great"" in the wider literary canon, and why has this book- despite being so popular among his readership- not found the same cultural success as some of his other works? Is it simply due to lack of a popular, recent, lasting, theatrical adaptation?

If I come of as an idiot or fishing for something, I'm sorry. This is not intended to be a controversial post at all, but instead basically just an opinion poll. I have not had any luck finding fellow readers at my University (despite enrolling in master's English courses) or really anywhere else. That's part of what got me feeling this way about the book in the first place- the lack of exposure I've personally witnessed. If that doesn't align with other people's experiences that's completely fine, as those experiences are what I'd like to hear about. Obviously I'm the asshole due to the largely negative feedback I got here and if I ever post again it will be nothing like this. 

But anyway, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to comment and interact with me and the post. I appreciate the discussion and hearing other people's thoughts. Take care everyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/joxygl/stephen_kings_the_stand_is_such_an_underrated/,2020-11-06 03:58:45,362,202,books
x053xw,"What are your favorite depictions of mental illness, whether written about a character who appears to be mentally ill or written from the perspective of a mentally ill person?","I am particularly interested in psychiatric disorders as portrayed in fiction. Because it's fiction, characters are not necessarily diagnosed or may not act the way one would expect from a person with that disorder. There is a lot of stereotypes too, so it is difficult to find a fictional account which are not only enjoyable to read but also true in a scientific way.

For me, it's King's *Misery*, which is about a writer and his number one fan. \*shudders\*

If you have not read the novel, you may have seen the movie, the 1990 film directed by Rob Reiner, starring James Caan and Kathy Bates. The character Bates plays, called Annie Wilkes, appears quite paranoid, delusional, and might have borderline personality disorder. People with borderline personality have a terrible fear of being alone and abandoned. They have an unstable sense of self.

To be clear, not everyone with paranoia or borderline personality will behave the way Annie Wilkes does. This is a story after all, so there needs to be drama, and King is not a psychiatrist either.

1bkk8ss,"My journey to Stephen King's ""Holly"" reminded me of kindness and why I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again","“Holly” by Stephen King was a book I couldn't wait to devour but I wanted to get into it the right way. I went on a Holly-inspired reading marathon so I could jump in and be fully caught up. I’m talking about taking an entire week off of work to enjoy a BOOKcation with everything involving Holly. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, I devoured four novels and an entire short story collection written by King that featured Holly and it was such a rewarding reading experience.  
  
Just so you know, to get the most out of “Holly” I highly recommend that you read all five books she is in before reading this novel. The order to read them are…  
  
Mr. Mercedes -> Finders Keepers -> End of Watch -> The Outsider -> If It Bleeds -> Holly  
  
Now before I jump into my review of this novel, here’s a list of the trigger warnings I found while reading…  
  
\- Homophobic comments  
\- COVID-19 pandemic  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Politics  
\- Racism  
\- Sexual harassment  
\- Rape  
\- Abortion  
\- Cancer  
\- Alzheimer’s Disease  
\- School shootings  
  
If any of these trigger you, please don’t read this novel. One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion.  
  
As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate.  
  
Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc.  
  
In my opinion, King is 76 years old and will be 77 years old on 9/21/24. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong.  
  
These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life.  
  
Anywho, I loved this novel so much and I would consider it one of the best he's written if you go on this Holly journey. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there.  
  
Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his legendary work.  
  
The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her novel and not only what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things.  
  
To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time.  
  
Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful.  
  
Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance.  
  
It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me.  
  
Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending.  
  
I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did make me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created.  
  
I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all the novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again.

4dvj5j,"Stephen King was among the authors that rekindled my love for reading 2 years ago, but the more I read the worse I find his works","First of all, let me say that I enjoyed King's books. I read ""It"", ""The Gunslinger"", ""The Long Walk"" and ""The Green Mile"". The Gunslinger wasn't the greatest read but the other three were definitely solid or good and particularly ""It"" got me back into reading. However, the more books I read the less fond I grow of King's books. Granted, it's only been 4 books and possibly not the very best of the bunch but I have to admit that his insane popularity does surprise me a bit as his books tend to have pretty big flaws.
I find his rambling to be a huge turn off. His books could be shorter without losing out on anything worthwhile and oftentimes I feel like he follows up with a long boring chapter after a tense cliff hanger just to not blow his load too quickly. I can see why one would approve of that method of keeping the tension up but particularly in ""It"" I just got frustrated by that way too often. 
Then, he clearly just starts writing with a vague but possibly cool idea in mind without considering how exactly he can conclude the story. He seems very enthusiastic about the idea he came up with and at some point comes to realization that he has to wrap all the stuff he wrote. King is the exact opposite of a write like Brandon Sanderson for instance who plans his twists 2 books ahead. And frankly, I appreciate Sanderson's approach A LOT more.

So yeah, thanks for getting me back into reading. I was told I should get into King's short stories which I might do at some point. The 4 books I read were good but not extraordinary and the more writers I get to know, the more apparent King's flaws become.

c2yji1,"I just finished my first listen of the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett, and nearly cried.","""Books have to be heavy because the whole world's inside them."" - Cornelia Funke, Inkheart

41 Books hold the Discworld inside them. A world so improbable that sometimes things leak through from other worlds. It took me years to listen to these books, pausing from time to time to listen to something else in between. Sometimes another entire series, but I'd always have the next Discworld book ready to go. Ready to let myself leak into another world. 

In 41 Books, I met a coward who was fate's plaything, and saw him gain courage, confidence, and friends, in his own way.

In 41 Books, I met a librarian who was turned into an orangutan, and preferred to stay that way thank you very much.

In 41 Books, I saw a disgraced City Watch grow to be a powerful and respected force for Justice.

In 41 Books, I met a Barbarian who overthrew empires, who bested a God in a game of dice, and who refused to stop adventuring, even after death.

In 41 Books, I met a young witch who was good with sheep, and could call Thunder and Lightning to her side in an instant. I was there when she became the Hag o' Hags.

In 41 Books, I met an old witch, who spoke her mind, said what needed saying, and helped those she could. I was there when she passed away, gently into the night.

In 41 Books, I met Death, and his family, and grew to see him as a kind old soul, with an important job.

I'm sad to say, I didn't start this series until after Terry Pratchett had already passed away. I feel selfish that, after all of this, all of these beautiful, and amazing people, and trolls, and dwarves, and goblins, and everyone I've met; after all of these curious, and wild, and familiar places I've been, I want more. I want to know if The Big City will ever need its king back. I want to know if Young Sam will follow in his father's footsteps, or blaze his own path and step in something exciting. I want to see everything this world has to offer!

Thank you Mr. Pratchett, for giving so many people a glimpse into this strange and magical world. 

It's a strange world we live in here. Who knows, maybe somewhere out in the vast emptiness of space, swimming along with it's great burden, is a Turtle.

1aux8u7,Just Wrapped Up “It” for the Third Time – Here’s Why It’s Still a Must-Read!,"Hey everyone,

Just finished my third go-around with Stephen King’s “It,” and I gotta say, it’s still as captivating as ever. Let’s dive into why this book remains an essential read.

First off, let’s chat about the movies. The adaptations from 2017 and 2019 were pretty solid, capturing the essence of King’s work while adding their own flair. They brought some of the most iconic scenes to life in a way that had me glued to the screen. Sure, there were some tweaks here and there, but overall, they did justice to the story.

Now, onto the book itself. This being my third time through, you might think it would lose its magic, but nah. King’s storytelling prowess keeps you hooked from start to finish. The blend of horror, friendship, and nostalgia hits all the right notes, making each re-read feel like coming home to old friends.

And let’s not forget the depth of the themes explored – from the nature of fear to the power of memory. King doesn’t just scare you; he makes you think, and that’s what sets “It” apart from your average horror novel.

Whether you’re a die-hard King fan or just dipping your toes into his work, “It” is a must-read. And if you’ve only seen the movies, do yourself a favor and experience the original story – you won’t regret it.

Happy reading, and remember: “We all float down here!”

Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1aux8u7/just_wrapped_up_it_for_the_third_time_heres_why/,2024-02-19 20:11:37,40,35,books

152dddd,The Father Doesn't Have a Name: The Laziness of Sarah J Maas,"I'm not one to begrudge people their preferences, in life or in their forms of escapism. If the works of Sarah J Maas provide you with a much needed reprieve or help you through dark times or help you see the beauty of the world, I am truly happy for you. Nothing I post here is meant to take away from or invalidate your experiences. That being said, I am not going to be saying anything nice about Maas, specifically her ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" series. If reading unfavorable opinions about your favorite author or favorite series is going to upset you, I do not recommend continuing. Thank you for understanding. 

When I say that Sarah J Maas is lazy, I mean that the amount of effort she puts into her worlds feels rushed and haphazard. She clearly isn't a purely lazy person. No one who can write as many books as she has is. She has achieved more than most of us ever will. But the lack of purposeful thought that she puts into constructing her fictional realities is the central core of my issues with ACOTAR. My many, many issues. I'll begin with the more technical and work my way to the more specific. I'll probably devolve in coherence as I go, I apologize. 

&#x200B;

***PACING***

Books 1 and 3 are the perfect examples of poor pacing in this series. ACOTAR begins quickly enough; Feyre kills a faerie, gets taken from her ungrateful family, and is forced to live among the strange beings of the Fae. She plans to escape, using her skills as a hunter to her advantage. And then...nothing. For a couple hundred pages. Oh, I know, she meets the Suriel, she gets to know the Spring Court, she falls in love, but there is absolutely no urgency, no goal to work toward, NOTHING for her to accomplish to strive toward except to learn to live in luxury until the plot suddenly kicks back in and she has to go Under the Mountain after an exhaustive monologue from a minor character that explains LITERALLY EVERYTHING. No sprinkling of clues or details throughout the lull in the book, just a massive deluge of long-needed context and information that turns it all into a different story. 

I am a patient reader. I got through all 15 books of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time and all 16 of Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings and LOVED them. I can wait for a good payoff. The problem is that Sarah gave us very little to go on (or outright misinformation, ie Amarantha IS the plague) for any of these revelations to feel like anything more than last minute plot points she forgot to include. But these aren't just first book problems.

For all of the migraines Book 2 gave me, Book 3 was so much worse when it came to pacing. There is a war going on. This was established by the end of Book 2. And yet, there isn't even the remotest sense of urgency about it until at least 200 pages into this tome. ""War is here,"" Sarah omniously declares, several weeks after the first shots were fired. It's like declaring the house is on fire halfway into the fire fighters putting it out. Yeah, we know! But even once it begins, everything still moves at a snail's pace with Feyre and her new family just talking in the Night Court about what they should do. That is when Rhys isn't having sex with Feyre over the sounds of wounded soldiers crying out in agony.  

Then, before we know it, the final battle is here. And then it's done. What?

***PLOT***

There isn't one. Well, I'll clarify, there isn't a thought out, overarching narrative. Feyre gets kidnapped, falls in love, PROVES that love, frees the entire magical land, and gets to ride off with her man. Neat and tidy ending. Except, no. Now there's a massive clumsy shift in character for Tamlin so now he's controlling and abusive (something other characters never get called out for) and so now she must be kidnapped - er, rescued - again.

(Tangent, skip if you want: I hate this trope so much. The feminine character gets kidnapped or rescued instead of making the choices and escaping/leaving on her own. Is it a trope? I have no idea, but it is EVERYWHERE. Twilight, Savage Lands, From Blood and Ash, and now ACOTAR, she's just whisked away from one location to the next, a passanger in her own narrative. Absolutely no agency. Luckily, Feyre breaks out of this, but it is beyond infuriating for a work that is lauded as ""Feminist"" to completely remove the agency of the character that is supposed to be empowering! Rant over.) 

The status quo essentially resets and now the REAL plot can begin; Feyre gets a *mate.* Because that is the plot. There are bones of a conflict with stakes but they're not actually important. What's important is Feyre getting a new boyfriend and an entire friend group (she can't make her own friends, she needs them to be provided) and a big house and wealth and power and can you see how bone crushingly boring this is? It's a self insert wish fulfilment checklist. There isn't a PLOT, there is no actual CONFLICT because there was never a chance in hell that Feyre was ever going to lose any of the things she gained. That'd break the fantasy.

A Court of Silver Flames is the only story in the series that has a plot. There is a personal goal for Nesta, she grews personally and physically through her training, she makes her own friends (something Feyre could NEVER do), there are things happening! All of the background stuff about the trove and lake sorceror actively get in the way of the story being told. Even this story is ruined by SJM's laziness but I'll get to that later. 

There is no story to tell, no conflict to occur beyond who will end up getting with who? 

But, ""What about Hybern?"" you'll ask. What about Hybern? 

***WORLDBUILDING***

Hybern want to take over Prythian because they...want to enslave humans again? Because they've been poor since the last war 500 years ago? Because the king and his people are just straight up evil? All of the above, with essentially no elaboration. I know he gives an explanation to Rhys while they're fighting (JUST FIGHT, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TALKING!?) but it strains my believability. An entire country just sat there grumbling about how it wasn't fair that they lost for 500 YEARS, lost more wealth, became more miserable and starved and somehow managed to get all of the soldiers, ships, and equipment needed to overwhelm Prythian? Seriously? It was better when it was just, ""Yeah, they're evil over there."" Don't provide backstory that instantly conflicts with whats happening. 

But honestly, that's the most creative the worldbuilding actually gets. Name a mythology and Sarah took something from it and just threw it into her world. Oh, the High Lord of the Day Court is named Helion. She took Helios, changed a single letter, and them put him in charge of the Day Court because...SUN. I hate this. 

There are seven Courts and we barely get to know any of them or what makes them unique. How do the politics between Courts work? They don't they gather in one room and throw insults at each other. ""Playing the games of the Courts is dangerous."" NO ONE PLAYS THE GAMES! THEY ALL LITERALLY SAY EXACTLY WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS AND THEN LEAVE. 

The most interesting one is the Night Court and even that falls apart at the slightest bit of probing. There's the Court of Nightmares and the Court of Dreams. Why? Well, the Court of Nightmares is run by the evil, cruel people in the Night Court that live inside of a mountain but the REAL Court is the Court of Dreams with all of Rhys' friends. The Court of Nightmares is just a front. 

Ok, do policies from the CoN actually affect anything? Just the people in the mountain. Are the people in the mountain allowed to leave? No. Are they all evil? No, Mor actually grew up there abused by her parents. 

So Rhys, the most powerful High Lord, King Feminism himself, is keeping an entire population of his people trapped inside of a mountain, more than likely suffering abuse from the other fae, and it's all to protect this ONE city that he's super proud of? Wow, Rhys kinda really sucks when you put it that way. Why does he even have this awful Court if he basically just keeps everyone out anyway? Oh, cause Sarah wanted to have scenes where he's the villain cause that's hot apparently. Sorry, priorities. 

***CONSEQUENCES***

There aren't any. Nothing has any real consequences, good or bad. They have the Weaver and her siblings for the final fight? Yeah, they're gonna die almost instantly. Feyre looked into the mirror that drives people insane? She'll get over it in less than a page and it won't affect any of her behavior going forward. (We never learn what she saw. She tell all of the other Courts but we never get to know, because doing a psychodellic horror sequence of all of her main characters flaws would've been interesting and we can't have that.) Feyre went to spy on Tamlin and Hybern? ALL OF THE INFORMATION SHE BROUGHT BACK CONFIRMED WHAT THEY ALREADY KNEW, IT WAS POINTLESS!

Velaris was attacked!? Oh, we're chill, kids are already playing in the streets again. Ugh. I'm moving on.  

Edit: No, I'm not! Amren sacrifices herself to save everyone but NOPE, SHE'S BACK! Yeah, she's regular Fae now but functionally unchanged soooooo......

And that Rhys fakeout death? Really? Like that was ever going to be a consequence. 

Immortals never die while mortals just bite it constantly. Only immortal Fae matter guys.

***WRITING/STYLE***

This is one of the most repetitive, tedious styles I've ever read. The word ""mate"" is used 202 times in book 3. I cannot tell you how many times male, female, purred, like calls to like, growling, and VULGAR GESTURE are used. No variety, no nuance, always, ALWAYS, the same descriptor!

I won't let Robert Jordan off the hook with all of his ""Folding her arms under her breasts,"" and ""Tugging her braid,"" and ""smoothing her skirts,"" but here's the thing; Robert wrote a complicated, amazing world full of complicated, amazing characters. There are other things to compensate. Sarah did not. There is only the frustration.  

***CHARACTER***

These are not immortal 500 year old beings. They are petty teenagers. So many tongues sticking out, so much ""banter,"" not an adult conversation or interaction to be had. No one has hobbies, no one has any real personality beyond how they relate to Rhys or Feyre. Yes, Amren starts playing with puzzles, the most boring hobby on God's green Earth. She missed intellectual challenges? Maybe she picks up linguistics, history, something she can work at and accomplish things. No? Fine, puzzles. 

AH, but Feyre, she paints! No. No she doesn't She looks at things happening in front of her and gives them cringey titles. If you're going to give a character a hobby, it should be worked into the narrative somehow. Brandon Sanderson does this pretty well with Shallan in Stormlight Archive. Her ability to draw influences how she uses her powers and useful in the narrative. Feyre's painting is more a narrative thermometer for us to gauge how depressed/happy she is. And not a very good one. 

Rhys. I hate Rhys. I hated him when he showed up and drugged Feyre, I hated him when he revealed himself to be King Alpha Male, Champion of Feminism, and I hated him when he kept the dangers of Feyre's pregnancy hidden and threatened to kill Nesta for telling her about it. He is not a character. He is a cardboard cutout for whatever traits Sarah thinks would be hot. OH, a bad boy villain! Oh no, wait, a dark and handsome proto feminist! Wait, a controlling dickhead! Oops.

My problem with him is that before A Court of Silver Flames, he has no flaws. He is the perfect gentleman, always gives Feyre a choice and just CARES so much about his COURT. It's obnoxious. He's such an overdone fantasy that he's no longer appealing, he's insulting. Rather than giving him edges (actual edges, not bad boy nonsense), Sarah settles for making him beyond perfect. No conflict to be had and no effort to be exerted. 

***He Doesn't Have a Name***

Here's the detail that legitametly broke me. The only major character that wasn't evil to die at the end of this trilogy was Feyre's father. His interference changed the course of the battle. His death haunts Nesta and serves as her central internal conflict for her own book. The meaning behind his death and legacy is supposed to be profound.

What's his name?

He doesn't have one. HE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME!!!

HOW!? How do you create a character and actually USE them for such an impactful moment in the ""narative""  and NOT EVEN GIVE HIM A NAME?

Oh, but this feeds into so much more.

What's the King of Hybern's name? Hybern. His Country? Hybern. His people? Hybern. The Island the country is located on? Hybern. 

The Human Queens! Names? Not till book 5! What nations do they rule? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I know she didn't mean to, but I am beyond insulted at the audacity to not even bother.

***There is Only Maas***

My final point. If you stuck around this long, you are a trooper. Seriously, congrats. I am awful and you deserve an award for putting up with me.

Sarah only brings in her perspective. Now, that's true of any author but what I mean by that is that her priorities are the only ones that matter. 

The only characters that matter are the High Fae. Every named character of worth either starts out as or becomes one. Name me one human who matters. Jurian? That guy got resurrected and is basically immortal now. Name me a MORTAL human who matters to this story. What's the name of Feyre's village? 

The rest of the Fae barely matter, either. If they're not on a Court in the first 3 books, you won't know a thing about them. Only the high class matters, only the Fae matter. Humans? Gross, who cares?

Even personal goals shift according to Maas' will. Why, for the love of GOD, did Nesta physically alter her own body in order to have children? Something she has never expressed she wanted? Because Sarah wants her female characters to have babies. It's fulfilling for her, so they all must want them. Nesta. The newly minted warrior Valkyrie. She can't have ambitions of her own! Give her a baby!

There are only MALES and FEMALES in Maas' world. You can't escape it. STRICT GENDER ROLES FOR ALL! MATES! Oh, there's one token queer character but she has the absolute worst backstory in the history of representation so does it really count? And she's never actually happy or being herself so keep it to yourself, everyone!

Sarah offers us the straightest, whitest world possible. Where it's fine for there to be slums in the cities while the ruler builds a sixth house for his new wife. Where the only people unhappy after a war are the widows, not the soldiers going through PTSD or injuries or anything. Where conflict only arrises because someone is being mean. No resources to worry about, no socio economic concerns, nope, not here!

***Conclusion***

If you couldn't tell, I am miserable. Part of that is from reading these books. And I am being a little unfair. If I wanted Sarah to write her stories perfectly according to what I've complained about, then they wouldn't be hers. She's found an audience and success, and that's wonderful. However, I find it troubling that she writes for an adult audience but doesn't put in the work to make it hold up to basic adult scrutiny. I'm not saying I need her to write up what kind of tax forms the Night Court uses or anything, but just enough information that makes it make sense. 

I have never met Sarah J Maas and probably never will. I can make no judgements on her as a person. I can make assumptions based on her work but I don't think that's entirely fair. All I can do is judge the work itself.

It is lazy. Characters without agency, worlds without coherence, no consequences for any actions, a work that has ""First Draft"" written all over it for me.

t62de9,"[Spoilers] I read Stephen King's unabridged version of ""The Stand"" and I'm so frustrated with the ending. Is that the point though?","I jumped into this book with no expectations. I had no clue what it was even about, but I was pulled into it easily and I was really enjoying the buildup, which often drags in Stephen King novels.

Imagine my surprise when we're thrown an entirely new supernatural angle halfway through the book. There's a brand new major antagonist. I feel like there were some established expectations about the world that were just ripped out from under me. I went from enjoying the terrifying and plausible concept of a Super Flu to rolling my eyes and continuing the story because I hoped there was a saving grace, because I had already invested so much time into this book. I just didn't sign up for a silly Americanized Holy War. Possibly the worst part is that the antagonist ends up with a smaller body count than the supposed good God who sends 3 men who decide to trust him and his ""mysterious ways"" to their deaths in the most idiotic and pointless way imaginable along with the thousands of other people in the community.

The men could have started an uprising, they could have all died as long as that ridiculous journey hadn't all been for naught. Trash was gonna bring that nuke no matter what and00 you're telling me that they ""had"" to be put on trial to get one guy to stand up. That one guy ""had"" to have his mouth burned closed in order for the nuke to be set off?


What a load of garbage.

y6xi1b,"I love the story about how ""The Martian"" blew up much more than the book itself","I recently finished The Martian, and I was outlining for a review of the book when I started looking more into Andy Weir himself. The Martian was such a technical book full of hard science that I figured any interview with Weir would likely be interesting.

I went down the YouTube rabbit hole & stumbled across a Google talk he gave back in 2014 prior to the movie's release. The book was already a big hit at the time he gave the talk.

During Q&A, someone from the crowd asked Weir if he preferred physical or digital books. Weir's answer blew my mind. 

He said digital books had made his career. The Martian was originally released as a serial novel on his website (in the vein of Green Mile by Stephen King). He'd write and then release chapters periodically for free. 

His readers were enjoying the book, but at some point they started complaining about having to read the story scrolling through on their PCs. Doesn't sound fun to me either. They asked Weir to make an ePUB so they could read it on their Kindles.

Weir obliged the request, and people started downloading it off his site. And then people started complaining that they had no idea how to transfer a downloaded ePUB file to their Kindle. I understand that pain quite well - even as a pretty tech savvy guy, I had to Google how to do this myself. It's not super intuitive. 

At this point, the readers just asked him to put it on Amazon so they can download it directly to their Kindle. At the time, the minimum price for a book was $.99, so Weir put it up for sale there, while also keeping it on his site for free.

The Martian started moving up the charts, and then it broke through the top 10 sci-fi books on Amazon. And it started to blow up. A guy from Random House read it, liked it, and showed it to an agent and asked what he thought. The agent thought it was pretty dang good. That same agent then reached out to Weir, became his agent, and they turned around and sold the book to Random House! 

The Martian was then ""re-released"" through Random House in 2014. 

I love this story because it shows how much has changed in the publishing industry in the last 20ish years. I had no idea that The Martian was initially self-published. Weir also said he never promoted the book - no marketing, no forums, no comic cons. 

I know things are different in 2022 compared to back in 2011. There are a LOT more self-published authors now, and it is likely a lot more difficult to break through. 

But it still does happen all the time. I love the story. I love that it's easier than ever to get my hands on the work of artists.

And if you're wondering why I didn't LOVE the book. Frankly, too much hard science for me! I am such a layman when it comes to science and math. Literally avoided it as much as I could throughout my education. Bachelor of Arts guy here. So the pages and pages of hard science & MacGyvering his way out of every possible problem that someone stranded on Mars can encounter - it all felt a little dry for me.

Why did no one tell me this was a fairytale?,"Alright so I know a lot of you may be rolling your eyes at what I'm about to say because it's ""wow so obvious"", etc. However, in my (non-English speaking) country, people don't generally read Lord of the Rings. Everyone watched the movies, of course, but only the folks really interested in fantasy literature read it; and personally, I don't really fit that category. I don't have anything against Robert E. Howard or anything like that, but it's just not the genre of book I've grown up with. So please be gentle if I end up repeating something that everyone but me apparently knows.

Also, please note that I've only read 10% of the trilogy (about a quarter of the first book), but I've read some of his interviews and his essay On Fairy-Stories, so I feel reasonably confident on thinking what I think.

Anyway, in 2020 I was temporalily suspended from work and confined, and so I had a lot of free time. I intended to read Lord of the Rings, and I did start but the prologue kept me from going on - it was just too many names and I had my own preconceptions of the story. After telling a friend of mine that LotR was a bit too complicated for my mental state at the time, she convinced me to read Dune instead.

Please stop laughing. (It was great btw)

I got through my mental state through grit, having to make sense of all the words and actually enjoying the complexity. I then took a break reading some Discworld and a lot of comics, and eventually tackled War and Peace. Russian names are the bane of my existence, but I powered through it.

Feeling quite uppity about myself, I started just this weekend on Lord of the Rings, expecting a very dry story recounting a complex tale full of the serious names of serious men who did serious things. I did love the movies, but I felt like I wouldn't enjoy them as much if they were stretched over a thousand pages.

Imagine how surprised I was to then find out that it was a *fairytale*. An honest to God fairytale, with ""and there he found great delight""s and ""O Gandalf! Please tell me!""s and other phrases like that.

The aesthetics of the story feel taken directly from a Howard Pyle illustration or one of Andrew Lang's Fairy Books; and I *bloody love* fairytales, especially well-written ones.

See, I was vaguely aware that there was a rift between Swords and Sorcery fiction and Tolkien fiction, but I didn't expect it to be *this* deep. Frodo behaves like one of King Arthur's pages, the descriptions - both of the history of the world as of the page-to-page character interactions - feel like modern adaptations of late 19th century literature. It's not only a fairytale, it's clearly written by someone who *loves* fairytales.

Like, take the Elves for instance. Contemporary fantasy tells me I know elves, they're the civilization of pointy eared guys that live on the forest and are generally detached.

*Tolkien* elves, on the other hand, feel like fairies. As in, the fair folk. Sídhe. Whatever. They don't feel like ""a civilization of guys"", they feel like ""a people""; a group of fantastic creatures like dragons or giant boars. They feel like the kind of person King Arthur would meet dining in the middle of the forest and playing with a golden ball. Like, they're magical, that's the driving point.

I feel like years of being close to people trying to understand Tolkien in a rational, grounded, real-world way kinda poisoned the way I saw the story. I figured that, if people were arguing about how the economy of the elves worked, or if the Balrog had wings (and the properties of wings for that matter), that the story concerned itself with that sort of question; or at least took it into consideration. What I've found was a fairytale from a world that doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't really *explain* a lot of things, just like fairytales, because they expect the reader to piece stuff together from their understanding of the world.

There's this example that really stuck with me from when I was reading the One Thousand and One Nights as a teen that mentions, in passing, that a Djinn was muslim. That felt weird to me; why would the Djinn practice a religion? Wouldn't they have their own religion? Are there Djinn mosques? Among a ton of other questions cropped up. And then it hit me: the Djinn is muslim because Allah, in the story, is the creator of everything. *Of course* the Djinn is a muslim, and could be a christian too, *why wouldn't* he be?

This is similar to how Beowulf treats Grendel too. Like, Grendel in a more modern story would show up, kill some guys, and Beowulf would predictably get real angry and hunt the monster down, because he's a monster and the like. But that's not how the people who wrote Beowulf saw the world; the mother of Grendel comes afterwards demanding his blood-price, because that's the law. And teen-me would have thought ""wait, why would she follows the law of men?"", but from the poem's point of view, the more apt question would be ""why *wouldn't* she follow the law? The law is of *this land*, not just of men, and everyone contained in this land follows it.""

A great example of this inside the world of Tolkien is during the first night of Frodo's journey, a fox looks at him and thinks ""huh, Hobbits this far? that's unusual"", and moves on with his life.

Personally, I really don't see a lot of this in contemporary stuff, because well... foxes don't think. And grounded stories don't feature thinking foxes, or the mom of the monster persecuting legal resource, or muslim forces of nature, because that's the *logical* step you'd take. That's ""how it'd happen in the real world"", but Tolkien doesn't really seem to care that much about this at all, and I love his work for it.

In short, I expected another Dune, and received a King Arthur story. I'm really enjoying the story, the clear passion that goes in fields and trees and the land itself, even the little songs every so often. I expect it'll only get darker as tragedy strikes and the quest gets closer to its conclusion, but fairytales are like that.

Sidenote, but I really appreciate how seriously Tolkien takes death and how commited he is to pity. As a Christian myself, it feels really refreshing to see something like this:

>‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’

>‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.’

>‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.’

>‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.

>‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.’

>‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.

God bless his work. And God bless Terry Pratchett too, I only got interested in LotR in the first place because of him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uh1nuo/ive_finally_started_reading_lord_of_the_rings_why/,2022-05-02 22:36:47,412,2508,books
1by4gt6,Finished Under the Dome and I don't think I've ever felt this vulnerable.,"I literally just finished it and I'm out of words. That ending was something else. I study physics and I've reflected quite a bit about the possible existence of extra dimensions and aliens, and about how we would be at their complete mercy, just like a 2D world would be at our complete mercy. But seeing it written like this, following each character, their lives, dreams and traumas and knowing that they are absolutely nothing to the ""children"", nothing more than an ant, a toy, a Sim in a game... it made me feel vulnerable as fuck. The worst of it all is that the kid only freed them out of curiosity/pity, but not regret, that she didn't really register them as real.

This kind of dread is already enough to make a book great, but the more technical aspects are really well done as well! Stephen King nails the character game, the city really feels so lived in and real. Everyone has their own voice, story and inner life, and the way it bounces between them didn't feel rushed nor dragged on, which is quite a fine line to thread. Jim Rennie in particular was so well crafted. He is so absolutely hateable, and you know his game as soon as you meet him. He's the ""fuck you, got mine"" rich fat coward archetype down to a tee and I grinned from ear to ear reading his death scene. My best description of him is a non-scifi version of Baron Harkonnen.

Barbara, Julia, Rusty, Rose, Brenda and the whole clan were big high points as well. You can't help but root for them.

c1nnl1,"Just discovering the ""New Weird"" Genre through the works of Jeff Vandermeer, and it is helping me cope with the loss of my son.","Eighteen months ago my son, who battled schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, passed at the age of 19. I have found fiction incredibly difficult to read since. Every story seemed to real or too fake, every subject too broad or too narrow. 

At a support group I went to someone suggested reading some scifi. The last science fiction or fantasy I read was 25 years or so ago when I was in high school. My favorite author was Piers Anthony and I read every Xanth novel up until my copy of *The Color of Her Panties* got confiscated in Government class and I was sent to the principal's office.

I tried a bunch of different books - from classics like *Stranger in a Strange Land* to *The Way of Kings* and a lot of things in between but I could not stick with anything long enough to finish. The same thoughts kept popping up: this reminds way too much of my son or why the fuck is this not about my son? Grief is a mother fucker.

Walking through my local library, I saw a copy of Jeff Vandermeer's *Borne* and was struck by the beauty and peculiarity of the cover (yes, I judged it by it's cover) so I picked it up. I read it in two or three sittings, struck by its blend of the real and fantastical. Like reading a dream.

I read the author's wikipedia page and it said he was part of (the biggest part of really) a literary genre called New Weird. Described as fiction that ""subvert cliches of the fantastic in order to put them to discomfiting, rather than consoling ends"". Not explicitiy sci-fi or fantasy, not exactly horror or postmodern.  I read some short stories by other authors in the loosely defined genre and for the most part am able to enjoy the stories, the tone, the language, and the characters without lapsing into my normal paralysis because, I think, they are just real enough to be interesting and just surreal enough to be unthreatening. 

I have just started the second book in the Southern Reach Trilogy, just the fact that I finished the first book and immediately went and got the second represents quite a turning point in the establishment of some type of new normal where books and stories are once again are something to appreciate and look forward to, rather than something to avoid, for fear of deepening the pain of my great loss.

I don't really have a point to all of this and don't know if this is a proper post for this subreddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c1nnl1/just_discovering_the_new_weird_genre_through_the/,2019-06-17 13:41:21,115,457,books
17b6mm0,Just Finished The Well of Ascension (Contains Spoilers),"Wow, this was a lot better than I expected. I really liked the first novel and figured this might be more of an intermediary novel. 

Cons:   


* I wasn't too excited about the love triangle but I felt it did make sense and helped introduce a character so I was able to live with it. 
* There was a bit more politics than I'd have like at the beginning but I think over all it pays off. Could some of this been condensed? Maybe. 
* It felt like this may have been a candidate for ""could this have been resolved if the characters just talked?"". However, I felt like their were valid reasons the discussions didn't or couldn't occur.

Pros:

* Characters had a lot of depth and were easy to be invested it. I really felt gutted when some characters died.
* The larger overarching plot and world. I love how Sanderson drip feeds information and always seems to take the plot up a notch. 
* The suspense and action was great, the plot pacing was really good as well.

Overall a perfect 5/7. What did you think of the book if you have read it? I got about 700 pages into the Way of Kings but stopped. I've only read Mistborn and this of his.

wfg3rv,"[Minor Spoilers] I finally started reading Stephen King and started with The Shining. It's great, but I wasn't expecting such a relatable story about struggling with alcoholism.","I've always kind of rolled my eyes at traditional alcoholism narratives. Too often, they follow the cliché of a character who ""drinks to forget"" some traumatic event in their life and is eventually cured at the end when they either fall in love with a woman or vow to change after they do something tragic to or around a loved one. I recently encountered this a well-known book series that I won't name just to avoid contention. While the latter situation does happen in The Shining, the book understands that Jack didn't cure what *caused* his need to drink.

In The Shining, Jack Torrance's drinking problem begins like mine did, where I would use the effects of alcohol to calm my racing mind and settle my edginess. While I never got blackout drunk or drove drunk, I almost always had a buzz or a tipsiness in any off hours of the day as it meant that I didn't have to deal with the more intense aspects of my depression or anxiety. It didn't help anything that I spent my teens and twenties working in kitchens with other alcoholics in a stressful and depressing environment. This created an atmosphere where regular drinking was perfectly acceptable to my peers.

When I finally quit drinking on my 29th birthday, I felt good for a year, just like Jack did. It wasn't difficult to notice that I had extra money in my pocket, a slimmer figure and better skin, and that I was now around different people who weren't put off by me always being buzzed or tipsy. Unfortunately, impulses and urges returned. Like Jack, my racing thoughts would make me irritable and I'd snap at people who would ask me too many questions or wouldn't understand that I can't relay what my ADHD-addled mind was thinking at any time. I'd get very upset over perceived offenses like Jack does with Ullman and go on self-destructive behavior over my desire for some kind of revenge or perceived justice.

I developed physical ticks like Jack's mouth-wiping, all of which gave me the urge to drink in order to quell them. Quitting cigarettes made it all even worse. I relapsed during the 2020 shutdown when I was working nothing but 12 hour shifts as an ""essential"" $11/hr. employee in a sweltering factory, which meant I could drink six pounders of beer a night and not gain any weight. Long story short, the factory's management got rolled out for gross mismanagement and the new CEO raised our pay and added mental health coverage to our company plan, so I'm now in a position where I'm off alcohol again and working on the issues that cause my addiction.

This is all to say that it's actually really heartening to see a book get things right, or is at least is relatable to my experiences. Sometimes it's really helpful to see a tragic storyline that you can relate to in a real, tangible way as it feels like the person writing it is sympathizing with you when nobody else around you can understand. On the other hand, it can be really disheartening to see a story get something like this so wrong to the point that it honestly feels kind of isolating.

I don't know how to close this out besides the fact that I'm now staring down my mom's copy of The Stand that she loaned to me.

P.S.: While the Shining movie is impressive, I can understand why King was unhappy with it. It really just feels like a slasher movie with really impressive cinematic choices attached to it. I've always been kind of either hot or cold when it comes to Kubrick. I don't share King's love of the miniseries he worked on, though.

Oh, I'm also reading Twilight because I had to finally know what the deal is, and it's not what I expected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wfg3rv/minor_spoilers_i_finally_started_reading_stephen/,2022-08-03 19:47:17,159,1855,books
mo7kke,I just finished Steven King’s Under the Dome and I’m at a complete loss for words.,"So recently, after years of never cracking a book, I’ve gotten back into reading fiction (starting with Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5). It took me a while to settle on a second book, and even though there are many books that may have been more important to the literary canon (Jurassic Park, The Godfather, Artemis Fowl etc), I had already seen those movies/shows so I figured I would pick something a little more out of my element. So a few weeks I made a point every night to read a few pages of Stephen King’s little-discussed *Under the Dome* and I am FURIOUS that it took me this long to give it a look.

I fell in love with everything about this book.  The prose is mature, but not stuffy.  It’s sentimental, but not melodramatic.  It’s funny, but it’s not cartoonish. I can go on an on.  The themes and motifs really resonated with me, especially in 2020/2021, given the overall state of, not just the United States, but the world.  The setting(s) were evocatively characterized.  No matter how harrowing, or how alien the locales seemed to be, King described them in such a way that quite figuratively transported me there.  The main character was richly written, and though this work was a piece of fiction, he really felt like a *real* person.  His motivations, his demons, his highs and his lows.  I could have easily believed that King was writing about a *real* person.  And the plot! I admit that it took me a while to fully comprehend what was going on, but that’s a testament to King’s ability to weave a complicated web that, by the end of the book, reveals itself to be a beautiful tapestry. I would be lying if I were to say I wasn’t emotionally affected by the end of it.

I know it’s not as sexy as some other books out there at the moment, and maybe it’s not as “classic” as something like Tom Sawyer, but I can genuinely say that *Under the Dome* isn’t just one of the best books I’ve read in the past 10 years, it’s one of the best STORIES I’ve read (or watched) in the past 10 years.  If you think it’s gonna be boring, or scary, or “lame” let me assure you that it’s anything but.  It’s endlessly quotable and searingly memorable, and quite possibly the best book you’ve never read (unless you have).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mo7kke/i_just_finished_steven_kings_under_the_dome_and/,2021-04-10 16:10:13,174,284,books
16nedw5,The Stand is a poor Steven King novel,"I'm a big king fan and I heard great things about the book but this was a real let down. I enjoyed the first act immensely and the way the different characters were written. I was invested in the novel but at the mid point I don't think King knew what to do with it and introduced supernatural elements. 

My main complaints were:

- I could not believe that a whole town of people would congregate around a 100 year old woman because ""dreams""
 

- The internal politics of the town was not interesting 


-Harold was set up as a major antagonist and dies very suddenly without any real impact on the plot


- Flagg is a poor bad guy whose supernatural powers or backstory were never explained


- The ending of the book felt entirely rushed as there was a lot of filler to get to act 3,  I expected guns and helicopters and flame throwers that were mentioned to have been collected by the Trashman


- Characters didn't seem to have much difficulty finding food or surviving in a dystopic world


I really resented this book in the end but finished it because I'm a completionist. What are your thoughts on this book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16nedw5/the_stand_is_a_poor_steven_king_novel/,2023-09-20 06:52:06,77,0,books
y6grrk,"Just discovered the Cadfael Chronicles about a 'medieval monk detective' who solves murders, in the 12th century","I had been looking for a good murder mystery, but was encountering way too many of the modern tropey types.  I happened upon this series by chance.  It's about a monk named Cadfael, during [the Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy) in England. 

The pacing of the book is really different from modern mysteries, it's more relaxed; there are nice moments of tranquility and reflection, in and among the various events surrounding the murders and it's also an insight into what medieval life would have been like.  The revelations happen in good time, the deductions happen carefully, and there's always just enough bits of information uncovered to keep you guessing about the culprit.  The sentences (prose?) are so full of descriptive words. There are some words used that seem to be archaic so I have to keep long pressing for the definition. 

Yet it's really comfortable reading these.   If you like historical fiction and mysteries, this might be worth a try.  First one in the series is [A Morbid Taste for Bones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321545.A_Morbid_Taste_for_Bones).

8gt5m8,In Defense of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,"This started off as a reply to someone who said he had read Hitchhikers Guide and didn’t really get it. I looked at the comments and there was a mixture of agreement and defense of the books.  But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. 

Now, I don’t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. 

So I’m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I’ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn’t capture. 

The first, and most simplistic view of it is that there’s just general silliness around. The people get into silly situations, react stupidly, and just experience random funny stuff. 

The second, still fairly easy to see bit is Adams just generally making fun of the sci-fi genre. He loves to poke fun at their tropes and describe them ridiculously. 

The final bit though is why I think this series is a true masterpiece. In a way, even though Earth gets demolished in the first few pages of the first book, the characters never really leave. All the aliens they encounter behave fundamentally like humans, with all of our foibles and oddities. 

The first time he does it, he really hammers you over the head with it to try to clue you on what he’s on about. A rude, officious, uncaring local government knocks down Arthur’s house - where he lives - in the name of efficiency. The government doesn’t care about the effect on Arthur’s life. What happens next? A bureaucratic alien race demolishes our entire planet, with all of its history, art, and uniqueness, to make way for a hyperspace bypass that literally doesn’t make any sense and isn’t needed anyway. 

In a lot of ways Arthur’s journey reminds me of The Little Prince, a fantastic book in which a childlike alien boy travels from meteor to meteor and meets various adults like a king, a drunkard, or a businessman. They all try to explain themselves to the little prince who asks questions with childlike naïveté that stump the adults. 

Adams is doing the same thing. The Vogons he used as a double whammy to attack both British government officials and awful, pretentious, artsy types. What’s worse than awful poetry at an open mic night and government officials? How about a government official that can literally force you to sit there and be tortured to death by it!

My absolute favorite bit in the entire series is in the second book which you haven’t read (yet, hopefully).  In the original version of the book he uses the word “fuck”. It was published in the UK as is, but the American publisher balked at printing that book with that word in it. 

Adams’s response? He wrote this entire additional scene in the book about how no matter how hardened and nasty any alien in the Galaxy was, nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever utter the word “Belgium.” Arthur is totally perplexed by this and keeps saying it trying to understand, continually upsetting everyone around him. The concept is introduced because someone won an award for using the word “Belgium” in a screenplay. The entire thing is a beautifully written takedown of American puritanical hypocrisy and the publishing industry’s relationship with artists. 

Adams uses Arthur’s adventures to muse on the strange existential nature of human existence. He skewers religion, atheists, government, morality, science, sexuality, sports, finance, progress, and mortality just off the top of my head. 

He is a true existential absurdist in the vein of Monty Python. The scenarios he concocts are so ridiculous, so bizarre, that you can’t help but laugh at everyone involved, even when he’s pointing his finger directly at you. 

Whether it’s a pair of planets that destroyed themselves in an ever escalating athletic shoe production race, their journey to see God’s final message to mankind, or the accidental discovery about the true origins of the human race, there is a message within a message in everything he writes. 

I encourage you to keep going and actually take the time to read between the lines. You won’t regret it. 

EDIT: This is the first post I've written on Reddit that blew up to this extent. I've been trying to reply to people as the posts replies roll in, but I'm literally hundreds behind and will try to catch up. I've learned a lot tonight, from both people who seemed to enjoy my post, people who felt that it was the most obvious thing in the world to write, and people who seem to bring to life one of the very first lines of the book, ""This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.""

In retrospect maybe I shouldn't have posted this on a Thursday.

I've also learned that I should spend more time in a subreddit before posting on it; apparently this book is quite popular here and a lot of people felt that I could have gone more out on a limb by suggesting that people on the internet like cats on occasion. This has led me to understand at least part of the reason why on subreddits I'm very active on I see the same shit recycle a lot... I'm gonna have a lot more sympathy for OPs who post popular opinions in the future.

At the request of multiple people, here was the thread I originally read that led me to write this response. https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/87j5pu/just_read_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_and/

xnc9w8,Fairy Tale is the best novel I’ve read in 2022 so far,"“Fairy Tale” by Stephen King was such a delight to read, it’s something you just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy slowly in stride. I loved how as always with King, he brings you back to a time when you were a kid and had to deal with all the usual things kids dealt with. Relationships, sports, family, friends, doing stupid things, and just trying to make sense of it all.

I absolutely loved all the characters King created in this novel. Charlie, Mr. Bowditch, Leah, and even the fantasy characters were all fantastic. Now, for me personally, when it comes to Radar, I became a dog owner for the first time in my life back in 2021 as she really connected with me. I have a cockapoo by the name of Ozzy Skywalker and reading about Radar really hit home for me in so many ways. 

All the interactions, situations, events, and descriptions were exactly that of a dog and how a dog owner would react. I can imagine if you’re also a dog owner, you will feel the same way as you connect immediately with the dynamic duo of Charlie and Radar and the adventures that await them.

Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you but this novel is simply amazing. The way King blurred reality into fantasy completely blew me away. Even all the scary and horror situations were perfect that led to an awesome fairy tale story that was unique and just so good. The atmosphere, world-building, character development, and the pure creepiness of everything King built just really resonated well with me. Once I got to the 80% mark, it was incredibly hard to put this down to see what would ultimately transpire.

Also, the illustrations for each chapter brought me back to my childhood as I remembered reading a lot of horror and mystery novels that did this. I have no idea who created these graphics for King in every chapter but they were great and captured the essence of each one. As I read, I’d often head back to see the image just to give me that visual as it happened. Just really well done!

When it comes to the ending, it really delivered after such a climactic buildup. I had no idea what would transpire but when it did, my goodness, it was wonderful and wrapped up an unforgettable novel. It was simply a perfect way to end things that left me beyond satisfied.

I give “Fairy Tale” a perfect 5/5 and so far in 2022 at the time of this review, is the best novel I’ve read. King published this novel in September which is his birthday month. Considering he just turned 75 years young and wrote yet another impactful novel, truly made this year a great one for Constant Readers all across the globe. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that loves King, fantasy, horror, and wants to see what happens when both worlds ultimately collide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xnc9w8/fairy_tale_is_the_best_novel_ive_read_in_2022_so/,2022-09-25 03:28:39,48,45,books
14vdrvv,I read the First Law Trilogy by Abercrombie and it blew me away,"Spoilers for the general vibe of the endings of the main characters but not any events specifically. Spoilers have a text warning above them.

Wow. I picked up this trilogy on a whim. I had just finished the Three Body Problem and needed something more fast-paced and character driven. 

The First Law Trilogy (The Blade Itself, Before They Are Hanged, and The Last Argument of Kings) was absolutely peak fiction in my eyes. 

Granted, I am the perfect audience for a grimdark, stylistically written, alternating PoV fantasy series. But damn, this series has proved to me that so many authors are falling short of what they could be doing.

Abercrombie somehow makes a trilogy that just gets better with every book and ties off every plot thread neatly in a satisfying way. So many fantasy series just drown in plot holes and incomplete storyline. It really felt like Abercrombie started from the ending and wrote backwards, which is incredibly refreshing. 

On top of that, he constantly subverts expectations, has some wild twists that are completely believable, and deconstruct fantasy to the bone. 

I don't think this series is for everyone, but readers that enjoy dark literature and deconstruction in their fantasy will be blown away. 

There are a few flaws that stood out to me. There aren't many female characters and the female characters don't have that much agency. I'm personally fine with that so it didn't bother me. I could see that bothering other readers, so please do note that. 

I've also heard people say The Blade Itself is too slow. I disagree, but it is the weakest in the series. It's still phenomenal. It has a lot of high points, but compared to other modern fantasy it could be taken as slow.

The only complaint I had with this series is also somehow one of my favorite aspects of the work:

(Spoilers of how the ending is!!! Don't read this part if you want to read the series, and I reccomend it!!)









The ending is defeatist and essentially nihilistic. While ""the good guys win,"" it is subverted and shows that victory isn't what it seems. It feels like not much progress was really made, and the world and our protagonists are completely broken. This is honestly great, and it's done tastefully. It doesn't feel like it's being depressing to have a tragic ending for the sake of being tragic. It feels more realistic than anything, but it still didn't feel great.

On one hand, I was euphoric reading such high quality story telling. On another, I just wanted to see some kind of a happy ending. It was a bit merciless to have literally 5 out of 6 of the main characters have an overtly negative ending. Still, I like that Abercrombie did this.

I hear that he becomes a bit less savage towards his protagonists as the series continues, and I've purchased all of the rest of the series and will be manically devouring them. 

Thank you for this experience, Joe. You've blown my mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14vdrvv/i_read_the_first_law_trilogy_by_abercrombie_and/,2023-07-09 23:47:31,181,490,books
wc47hi,"Born in the mid 90s and growing up in the 2000s, I feel like reading books from the 70s/80s and before makes me nostalgic for an era I never knew.","I read a lot of Stephen King, and I feel like his books especially always invoke this feeling in me. It’s a weird, almost indescribable feeling, but I’ll try my best to articulate. 

For me, a pretty average middle class millennial, the US of the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s just seems so foreign, but so freeing in a way. You finished high school, you either got into academics if you could afford it, or you just took whatever job was hiring, or what your family business was. 

I get that it wasn’t all rainbows, and in many ways life is better than it was in the 20th century, especially if you weren’t a white male, but the simplicity of careers and just general life seems so appealing to me from that era.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wc47hi/born_in_the_mid_90s_and_growing_up_in_the_2000s_i/,2022-07-30 18:37:10,68,270,books
f3v68n,"Today is the 30th anniversary of the “Pale Blue Dot” photo, I always go back to Carl Sagan’s book when I think of this image","I truly believe these might some of the most important words ever said. Carl Sagan had a way of seeing things for what they really are. This to me is the best description of that photo of earth taken billions of miles away. 

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

yiee62,"I read 13 horror novels for the month of October, and here is a short pitch for each to see if you should read one!","So I've always been a fan of Horror, and tied with Fantasy it is probably my most-read genre. This year as a challenge for myself I decided to read 100 books (currently at 92!) and I decided to do a horror run to get me in a festive mood. The mix below is... unique... to say the least. I decided to leave my ratings out of this because I think each one was good in its own way. They are totally *not* in any ranking order in any way. 

Anyway, let's begin. 

1. **The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones**

Want a traditional Slasher mixed with a supernatural Elk Monster? Then look no further. *The Only Good Indians* also does the troupe of ""ancestral revenge"" really well. There is a lot about the life of an Indian, and what it means to grow up on a reservation, providing insight into culture *while* being scared. There is a lot of basketball. 

2. **Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix**

The first on this list I would call *Comedy Horror*. This is a campy novel, as Grady Hendrix can be a campy author. It is a wonderful take on the Haunted House stereotype done with the scariest of all things... *retail!* Run around following a fun main character trying to survive the night in an Ikea.

3. **Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon by Matt Dinniman**

A Horror Lit-RPG, and a pillar in the genre. Extensive in length, this provides a very detailed and *fleshed* out world. This story mixes strife, loss, and suffering and blends them seemingly with giant monster battles, and otherworldy torture. This is not for the faint of heart, instead this is for anyone looking for a horrifyingly gross time.    

4. **The Twisted Ones by T Kingfisher**

A Horror book that will warm your heart. This is the story of a woman and her dog stopping and thwarting some ancient evil. This is the result of wonderfully dynamic characters meeting an Appalachian Horror. The terrors in here will leave you genuinely frightened, but the characters will be holding your hand along the way.   

5. **Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia**

I mean... The title does a pretty good job. A Mystery Thriller that turns horrific; this is a wonderful story about a strong female protagonist taking control in a House and Family that wants to control her. A steady and progressively unsettling sense of unease that will leave readers wanting to escape the Gothic home called High Place.

6. **Family Business by Jonathan Sims**

We all have to clean up after ourselves, but who does the cleaning after we're gone? That would be our depressive and lonely protagonist! This story follows an unreliable narrator slowly descending into madness, as an eldritch entity slowly taunts them. But all they want to do is clean up the blood from a recent building collapse... This story features a diverse cast, and strongly focuses on the idea of healing after death.

7.  **Tales from the Gas Station by Jack Townsend**

Another *Comedy Horror*, but one that will leave you trembling and wondering where all the emotions weld up from. Follow our terminally Ill protagonist as he works at a 24-hour gas station in a town frequented by *all* supernatural things. An Eldritch horror is trying to stop Jack, and all he wants to do is not have a crack-head pee in his bathroom (Which is home to a singing Ghost). A wonderful story for anyone who has worked retail, and needs a good laugh. 

8. **Fairy Tale by Stephen King**

A new King book!. This is a love letter to HP Lovecraft and the Grimm Brothers, and a beautifully written one at that. This is a story of a boy and his dog against the evils of a dark fairytale world. Imagine King deciding to write Alice in Wonderland and this is exactly what you get. All the fairytales from your youth will be seen dancing through these pages, bringing a sense of nostalgia, until you notice the slightly unsettling grin of Rumpelstiltskin.


9. **The Ruins by Scott Smith**

There is something more horrifying than actually uncovering ancient ruins filled with evil, and that’s the Human mind. This is a perfect psychological horror that aims to show how we as a species deal with traumatic situations. Follow four distinct victims as they try and survive the conditions of a perilous jungle. Also you gotta love the troupe of rich college kids not heading the warning of locals.

10. **Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie**

This is the only one on here that is technically a part of a larger universe. I do not think you *need* to read the original trilogy to appreciate this book, it is highly recommended though. This is a stand alone novel all about revenge. You will question what is right, *know* what is wrong, and still have the desire for them to get their revenge. This is THE BEST novel I’ve read where the main character/s decent into absolut evil, and this is also probably the most *hilarious* books about revenge. 

11. **The Fisherman by John Langan**

This story is about the grief of losing a loved one, and what one must give in order to get them back. This is a slow and seductive work filled with themes from HP lovecraft. There is dark magic, ancient evils, zombies, fish people, and even leviathans! Following two distinct timelines dealing with *The Fisherman* this story combines the two into an explosive finale that will leave the reading wanting to… just go fish, and clear their mind. 


12. **Piranesi by Susanna Clarke**

Join a scientist as he explores a desolate world of marble statues and ocean waves. This book is more of a psychological thriller than it is pure horror. The story telling excels in its use of an unreliable narrator; causing the reader to figure out the true mysteries of this world alongside one of the most lovable but forgetful protagonists. The horror comes from reading in between the lines for this one. 

13. **Uzumaki by Junji Ito**

Last but not least, a Manga! This story follows a towns descent into madness and pure abstract horror because of *Spirals*. This is beyond eldritch horror and extends into some form of madness that I found astonishing to have come from the mind of a human. The stark black and white contrasting images provide such stark and dynamic storytelling alongside the grossest and most horrific art you’ll ever see.

15z6jkb,"The Gunslinger (Book 1 of The Dark Tower) - first read, first thoughts, no spoilers.","No spoilers.

Pretty good for 11 quid! This wasn't the original version, it was the one with King's later revisions. It's the first King book I've actually enjoyed (I read *The Stand*, *Dreamcatcher*, and *Tommyknockers*, and didn't like them)- and I REALLY enjoyed it- but why is King allergic to good female characters?

**Judging books by their covers**

The one I got had a shitty ""cinematic"" digital art cover (no offence to the artist, but it wasn't great, and I didn't get the impression they read the book), with a permanent sticker telling me to go and watch the Major Motion Picture. I believe there is a circle in hell for the person who decides to put these things on covers. Let me know if I should watch the movie.

**Prose**

I've just ended a string of books by Cormac McCarthy, and I've come to love some nice, sparse prose, so The Gunslinger's prose was a nice palate-cleanser- crisp without endless adverbs. Very nice.

**King-isms**

The unnecessary sexualisation of every woman who appears throughout the story was so over-the-top it felt like self-parody. I understand King's sentiment that the original version was written by his less capable adolescent self, but this is the revised version- couldn't he have changed any of this? This was what I hated the most in a book I otherwise found it easy and enjoyable to get through. Ugh.

It seems even more of a shame when you look at how well-explored every other character was. I understood why Roland acted the way he did at every point, no matter the morality of it. The page or so describing Jake's backstory didn't feel like info-dumping even given how compressed it was, which is mildly impressive.

**Worldbuilding**

My favourite part. I loved the bizarre, decaying American fantasy world of The Gunslinger- it doesn't show much of it, but the hints you get make your imagination run wild. It felt like the bad trip it probably was, knowing King. 10/10 for worldbuilding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15z6jkb/the_gunslinger_book_1_of_the_dark_tower_first/,2023-08-23 15:07:49,23,7,books
134xlmd,The Shining by Stephen King really messed me up.,"After years and years of putting it off, I finally decided to read **The Shining** because I really wanted to watch or read **Doctor Sleep** and knew I would miss something’s if I didn’t read the original. I avoided reading it this entire time because the movie is one of my favorite films ever, and felt like that satisfied my need to read the book. I am so glad I decided to read it, I definitely rank it pretty high on my list of Stephen King books. I cannot believe how many plot points were left out of the Stanley Kubrick film. I still love the movie, but where the movie lacked in emotion and minor themes, the novel excelled. King’s description of “getting on the wagon” and the agony of alcoholism was perfect. The suspense of the creeping boiler stayed in the back of my mind throughout the entire book.

One thing that really struck deep with me is the ‘becoming your parents’ theme. I love my Dad with all my heart, but he can be cold, harsh, and mostly emotionally unavailable. These are traits that I have loathed as long as I can remember. While reading **The Shining**, I started to relate to Jack in the most innocent way possible. I see so much of my dad in my actions. I am starting to become so self conscious to the way I speak to my loved ones and hyper-aware of any behavior that reminds me of my father. I am very grateful that my dad wasn’t as brutal as Jack’s, and that I’m not being brain washed by a hungry hotel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/134xlmd/the_shining_by_stephen_king_really_messed_me_up/,2023-05-01 18:43:07,41,127,books
f4gbb9,"I stopped reading chapter 108 of The Wise Man's Fear. I don't know if I will go back to this book or not. Is it only me who thought ""WTF am I even reading?"" while reading the Felurian part?","Some people seem to think that the Felurian part of the book is essential to realize how much Kvothe has grown as a character. Personally, I think that they are reading way too much into it and that this part of the book is here to make it thicker and that's it. I love supernatural/fantasy elements but man, this one is a stretch for sure!

1. So wait, Kvothe ran after a Fae in a forest and somehow end up in another world.
2. Kvothe ends up having sex with her for days, not caring about the rest of the world and the Fae, who has had sex with countless men and is ""the most beautiful woman in the world"" BUT is impressed with him. Yeah well, he is Kvothe so he is special.
3. She makes him a Shaed made of starlight (????) and we still aren't learning anything about the Chandrian or the King. At that point, you wonder why he is even staying.
4. A tree tells the entire truth to Kvothe's face, who returns to the Fae crying like a baby because he knows damn well that it is the truth. 
5. Don't forget that Kvothe always gets away with most things and always gets himself out of dangerous situations where others would have perished so OF COURSE he escapes from the Fae, as he promised to work on a song for her (yep, a song).
6. He comes back to his friends, bragging about his encounter with the Fae and OF COURSE, making stuff up again because he really can't help it. They have to think that he is the greatest. Also, two women who work at the bar tell him that he has a Fae look to him, which means strictly nothing (since nobody ever saw her anyway). They deduce that he is now experienced with women (???)

14vifcm,The growing prudishness in the reading community(?),"When I read books from the 70s-90s, one of the things that I am struck by is how frankly sex and sexuality were discussed. Books still had a way to go in LGBT+ representation, of course. But it was widely recognized that characters *got horny.* This is a thing that human beings feel. And some of those horny thoughts get pretty dirty. People make fun of Stephen King for it, but based on other authors I've read, he wasn't too much of an outlier in his day (with the exception of one particularly infamous scene).

A lot of things have changed. Some of it, I understand. No author wants to end up on r/menwritingwomen. Unfortunately, that fear has led to a lot of authors being afraid to describe men even finding women physically attractive. The romance and erotica community is also just as (or perhaps more) voracious than it ever has been. But outside of that, I am finding more and more adult fiction that just...doesn't acknowledge sex. Almost as if it doesn't exist. Moreover, I am finding an increasing number of reviewers, booktubers/tokers, and even posters here who complain the moment that sex shows up.

I want to address two elephants in the room before they get brought up: the first is that, yes, we are in the middle of the biggest and most far-reaching book banning/censorship wave in the history of the United States, and many of these people who complain tend to be American. However, from what I've seen, they would not identify with those values. In fact they tend to have feminist views, and they'll typically frame their criticisms in those terms. The second is that the biggest backlash of all has been reserved for depictions of sexual assault against women entirely for shock value. I believe that's been a good thing, that certain authors should think twice before just resorting to that as a plot element. But I don't think that we should throw out sexuality as a whole with it.

Am I off-base, or are other people noticing this?

**TL;DR:** I feel like the modern book reading community has actually gotten more prudish, and I feel like modern books are being forced to cater to them. Am I right?

**\*\*EDIT:** I'm really happy that this post resonated with some people, even if they disagreed with it. Starting discussion was the goal. But I also probably can't afford to respond anymore to all the comments. Thank you, I think my perspective has shifted or been broadened from what it was when I made this post.

I think that the controversy in this thread alone proves that there is something to what I felt, even if I didn't totally have it right. Maybe it's not new, maybe it's just been going on since the 70s, in some form or another. Thank you for your input.\*\*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14vifcm/the_growing_prudishness_in_the_reading_community/,2023-07-10 03:25:20,249,369,books
fs6xjb,"Finished The Shining a day ago. However, only after watching the movie, did I realise what a genius Stephen King is","So I finished reading The Shining yesterday, and i really liked it. The story made my flesh creep and I was really satisfied with the ending 

My favourite parts were
1) Jack going into 217 and not finding the woman but  feeling her presence 
2) The ballroom scene where Jack meets Grady
3) The wasps stinging Danny at midnight


I then decided to watch the movie, and I have to say, very good acting by Jack Nicholson. However, IMO, the movie doesn't even come close to the book

It was then I realised the true genius of Stephen King.  The way he builds up his characters(Jack's history with his violent dad, Wendy's bitch of a mom),  his understanding of abuse and trauma, and the way he spins the story to make a hard hitting impact is truly brilliant. When I watched the movie, Jack came across as an evil bastard who was excessively selfish, but when I read the book, I really felt pity for him inspite of his violent ways. 

This was my second book by King. I read Pet Sematary a year back and that too was amazing. Right now, I have IT, Salem's Lot, Cujo and 11/22/63 lying in my bookshelf .

txupxi,"Just finished the first book I've read in over a decade: Stephen King's ""It""","I read a lot in high school because we didn't all have phones yet, and Stephen King was mostly what I read back then. When the age of never-ending scrolling came along, the time I used to spend on books was spent on social media instead. I'm old and self-aware enough to realize this isn't good for me, so I'm making an effort to replace my scrolling with books again.

I bought a paperback copy of *It* for $20 when the most recent movies came out, but it sat on a shelf collecting dust and intimidating me whenever I'd look over and see how thick it was; the only other books I've read that were comparable to *It*'s size were the Harry Potter books, and I tapped out halfway through the 5th one because it was so slow and boring. But after seeing the remakes and hearing everyone talk about how different/better the book is, I finally decided to un-waste the $20 I spent on *It*, and began reading it every night before bed.

I finished it last night after 3 weeks of reading, and I wholeheartedly agree with everyone who said it's better than the movies. The final battle between It and The Losers Club was so much better than them just insulting It to death. The way It used the oblivious adults in Derry to commit random atrocities was amazing, and felt like a much bigger part of the story than the movies let on. I could go on about how much better the book is than the movies, but I digress.

*It* has rekindled my love of reading books again, and I'm going to keep on with the trend of reading long-ass Stephen King books by picking up *The Stand* after I finish *The Gunslinger* and *The Drawing of the Three*.

17bt718,"Is the genre of ""IT"" by Stephen King ""torture porn""?","I promise this is a genuine question and I'm not trying to provoke anyone.

""Torture porn"" is the name given to a particular subtype of horror that flourished in movies in the early 2000s. It's basically horror that is focused on fear of physical pain, and in which the victims have to go through deaths that are especially long and agonizing (think the Saw movies as an example). The term is often used as a pejorative, but it is a legitimate niche in and of itself, and while it's not my thing, I understand it has its audience.

Now, I'm not a big Stephen King fan, but the man is undeniably a gifted storyteller and I appreciate some of his work. However I really did not enjoy IT. It just seemed like a very simple story used as a platform for over 1000 pages of the most painful, nightmarish, unpleasant death scenes you can imagine. The part where >!a psychopath kid spends days torturing a dog puppy!< was especially hard to bear for me.

So I'm just wondering, would you say that IT, in terms of genre, falls under the category of ""torture porn""? If you agree or disagree, why?

NB This is really not intended in any way as a slight towards Stephen King fans. As I said, I don't think torture porn is really a derogatory term, and I'm fine with the idea of IT being considered as belonging to that genre and in fact as one of its best representatives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17bt718/is_the_genre_of_it_by_stephen_king_torture_porn/,2023-10-19 20:47:17,45,0,books
wcrux1,"The Dark Tower kinda sucks, no?","I was gifted a free (old, 1st ed) Kindle w/ the Dark Tower series on it, so I read the 1st book. It felt surprisingly amateurish, I honestly couldn't believe how disappointed I was in it all-around:

* the meager character development,
* thin plot that relies almost entirely on mystery the readers' intrigue,
* an inevitable and trite confrontation at the end of an overall predictable odyssey.
* The fictional world development, again, just felt anemic.
* And I ***hate*** (and am insulted by!) the way he wrote the female ""characters"", oh my god - and why does the gunslinger feel so many of his (nonsexual) feelings in his loins??
* Even the language, again it's borderline amateurish, just a lot of dull sentences reinforced with wholly unnecessary colorful adjectives, and way too much description of landscape that's done *much* better by other writers (Jean M Auel comes to mind).
* Dialogue is built riddle upon riddle, as though he trusts the reader to follow the breadcrumb trail, and then - agonizingly - the reader is patronized *over and over again* with reminders: ""Allie, you know, the girl with the scar I fucked and then killed? The one from the town. The murder spree, remember? With all the people? After all the sex? That Allie."" JFC YES WE REMEMBER, would you care to clarify *anything else in this goddamn plot?!*

The Afterword was the most well-written part of the entire book, and that was written in the form of a letter from King to the reader (EDIT - though he did compare himself to *fucking Chaucer, the nerve!*). I will say there were chunks of prose, few and far between, where I admired the writing, and tiny sprinkles of other well-utilized language here and there.

I know people (men/boys mostly) who have been totally enamored with this series and there is not a single thing I find appealing about it. I can only imagine that their interest is in identifying, somehow, with the pallid stoicism of the gunslinger whose emotions are Oedipal and un-evolved. I truly believe if this wasn't written by King it would have been passed over as some creative writing exercise by a neckbeard wannabe.

Shall not be reading the rest of them. Ugh. **UGH I SAY.**

**EDIT:** Downvoted a bunch so far but no substantive arguments to the contrary. If you disagree, *why do you disagree?* I need some explanation from an alternate viewpoint.

fwi1xx,It bothers me when authors reuse the same rare word shortly after using it the first time.,"At some point in my life, the idea was put in my head that using the same words in relatively quick succession was bad writing. Usually excluding common words, especially articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, but  ""he/she said"" can get old if it occurs after each character speaks. 

I didn't even think it was an opinion for most of my life, it was a truth that governed how I wrote and that I used to judge other people's writing. I sometimes feel like I get a glimpse into the author's creative process, perhaps they had a word on their mind that they wanted to use so subconsciously they created opportunities to use it several times. 

I wish I could think of more examples, but all I've got right now is ""stertorous"" which means ""adj. (Of breathing) noisy and labored"" and which has occurred only pages apart for a second time in Dracula, by Bram Stoker, inspired this post. It hasn't happened in this book many times, but I remember observing it in pretty much every chapter of The Gunslinger, by Stephen King. 

The words aren't being used wrong, it's just that if I were writing, I would have found another way to express the thought. 

Really the point in posting, as I've considered posting about it many times, is that I'm curious to know if anyone else notices it. Even the most highly regarded authors do this so it makes me think this rule is unique to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fwi1xx/it_bothers_me_when_authors_reuse_the_same_rare/,2020-04-07 10:16:53,215,542,books
4qpd1d,So Apple lost a lawsuit about price-fixing eBooks... so why is it the eBooks in general are so much more expensive now than they were back when Apple got in trouble for this?,"One of the reasons I really embraced the Kindle back in the day was because eBooks were cheap--very cheap. It was *always* a better deal to buy an ebook instead of a paperback or hardcover copy. Books were $4-6 USD on average. It was great.

But lately, it seems like eBook prices have skyrocketed. Oftentimes when I look at an Amazon listing, I'll see the eBooks selling for more than hardcover editions. It's silly. Beyond silly.

For example:

* George R. R. Martin's ""A Clash of Kings"" has a paperback edition for $5.03; the ebook edition is $9.99.
* Joseph Heller's ""Catch 22"" has a paperback edition for $11.41; the ebook edition is $11.99.
* Brandon Sanderson's ""The Way of Kings"" has a paperback edition for $6.94; the ebook edition is $9.99.
* Ernest Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" has a paperback edition for $10.97 and a hardcover for $13.99; the ebook edition is $13.99.

And those aren't cherry-picked examples. Those are literally the first four books I randomly checked on Amazon while writing up this post.

The big appeal of ebooks in the first place was that they were cheaper for both publishers *and* consumers. Now it seems like they're only cheaper for publishers, and frequently *more expensive* for consumers.

So what the hell is going on?

upyct9,The Shining,"Just finished The Shining. All I have to say is… wow. I’m the kind of person who’s brain really gets into books. This one only took a couple days to get through cause I had to keep putting it down to digest what was happening. I’ve only read a couple of Stephen King books, but I really enjoy his work. I never know what’s going to happen. 

The way that Jack slowly became part of the hotel. The fact that there was not one drop of liquor in the entire hotel, but he still got drunk because that’s how the hotel needed him. The way that Danny knew that the hotel was bad, but hey, he’s just a kid, of course his parents wouldn’t believe him. It was crazy how he got through to Dick all the way in Florida. And Dick’s willingness to go through all of that trouble just to help the kid. Wendy fighting for her life against Jack to save her son even after she had her back and ribs broken. Danny outsmarting Jack with the boiler and all of them narrowly escaping. And then the hotel trying to get Dick to kill them instead when they were trying to escape. My mind is just a blown right now. Kind of like the Outlook (haha) 

I have a whole shelf of Stephen King books from my mom, and I can say with confidence that I will probably read them all.

17osqgo,On the Realism of Lord of the Rings,"I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/16j0jw2/the_way_tolkien_dealt_with_realistic_history_and/) a little while ago, as I was still in the fellowship I believe, talking about how in love with LOTR I already was even though I was barely into it. A couple people told me to come back with a long effortpost when I finished the book, summarizing my thoughts.

Well, I finished the book on Friday night, however...I think there is too much to say even in a long effortpost to summarize the scope of what I think about this book. There is SO much going on. A good review would probably be at least 60 pages if not a whole novel in and of itself. So I guess some bullet points of the highlights for me is in order. I realize that many of the sections are just comments about realism, I needed some excuse to split them up anyway.

&#x200B;

**The Real**

I was blown away by Tolkien's ability to maintain a sense of realism about the story, even concerning wildly imaginary things, e.g.:

*Tree Beard.* He is how old? 50,000 years? Why would he use the word ""hill"" when he can say  *a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burúmë*? 1 day of my life is 5 years to Treebeard. He may as well take his time! Tree and twig... I love his sense of humor too. Taking any less than a full day for a few sentences is *hasty.* I agree!

*Lore of the Rings.* From the point where Gandalf began to suspect that Bilbo was in possession of the *One Ring to Rule them All,* it took him *eighteen years* to confirm his suspicion with any degree of confidence. Of course it would! Sauron's been gone for thousands of years. Everyone pretty much assumed that the one ring is gone forever in some ocean somewhere (**INCLUDING SAURON!)** Even if one was around the whole time, you probably wouldn't have known of the ring in the first place, and if you did know of it, you most certainly wouldn't have been certain of it's behavior.

*Accurate Corruption.* Boromir had *every reason* to want the ring. No one in their right mind thought that a mission to deliver the ring to Mount Doom had a shot at success. Minas Tirith is right there, not only is it guaranteed to be attacked with the full force of Sauron's army at some point, but it also is the only place left in middle earth that stands any remote chance at winning that battle, especially with the ring. Any leader of Minas Tirith would be justified in assuming that taking the ring by force is their duty. Boromir wasn't crazy, his plan made perfect sense. Also note how Denethor assumed the plan to deliver the ring to Mordor had failed by the time Minas Tirith was attacked. He was wholly justified in that assumption too. I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of corruption in a story. The movies butchered it.

*Portrayal of distance and logistics.* When the Rohirrim are delivered the Red Arrow, it takes them at least 4 days to ride to Minas Tirith, *riding almost literally 24/7.* Otherwise the distance is more like two weeks. Those protecting Minas Tirith have frankly no idea if the Rohirrim will show up in time to turn the battle, knowing that in the best of cases the battle may already be lost by the time they get there, or worse, the battle might still be unwinnable if they get there in time. Theoden shows up, and dies in one of the most benign possible ways, getting crushed underneath a terrified horse. As you would.

*Sauron's Bluff.* When the army of Gondor arrives at the Morannon, Sauron sends his messenger to show everyone Frodo's gear. Frodo has been caught! The jig is up! Game over! Except...Sauron was assuming Frodo was just a spy. What else would he be doing in Mordor? I don't think it matters how intelligent the guy is, why would you assume this guy was sneaking into Mordor to *destroy the most powerful object in the world. An object characterized by it's possession of those who wield it.* Brilliant storytelling.

*Shelob.* She's apparently been there in Cirith Ungol since the time before Sauron. Initially you might think, ""surely Sauron would have just killed her by now."" Why would he? He knows she's hungry, therefore she will likely try to eat anyone that comes over that pass. I would probably just leave her there too. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

*Sauron's dysfunctional army.* The trolls sometimes get carried away and smash though all the orcs in their way. The orcs constantly fight amongst themselves. None of them really seem that loyal to Sauron in the first place other than the Nazghul (why would they be?) I adore how the dysfunction of Sauron's army is not really used for the strict purpose of eucatastrophe (though it does turn into that sometimes,) instead it seems like just an everyday reality of trying to form a big bad army out of stupid slaves that are controlled through fear. When these moments happen, it no longer feels like a cheap plot device, but genuine good luck.

*Frodo's Illness*. This is a relatively minor point, but still significant to me. After getting slashed by Angmar, the leader of the ringwraiths, Frodo never quite recovers, not even with help from all of the best healers in middle earth. Even in 2023 with high tech medicine, there is still a huge swathes of chronic illnesses that we know nothing about, not even the best doctors, and if you get them, you are basically sick forever. I find this portrayal within LOTR to be highly convincing.

&#x200B;

**The Petty**

Tolkien is a master of petty humor. The only other author I've seen capture the real life pettiness of conflict as well as him is Orwell in 1984.

*Galadriel vs Arwen.* This conflict is so well done that I almost wonder if the internet Rei vs Asuka from Evangelion thing originates here, or if this is just a timeless human particularism. Gimli ardently defends the absolute beauty of Galadriel everywhere he goes, tolerating no disparaging remarks or implications whatsoever. Eomer meets Galadriel and Arwen at the same time, and tells Gimli to go get his axe, as Arwen is more beautiful, therefore they must fight to the death. Gimli, also seeing them together for the first time, concedes that they are both extremely beautiful and forgives the remark. I feel the same way when anyone calls Dua Lipa mid.

*Saruman's Pipe Weed.* Following the sacking of Isengard by the ents, Saruman is clearly *pissed* about all of his high quality pipe weed being stolen. When they run into him later, the most bitter comment he could come up with to curse the party is to wish them a bad pipe weed crop in the future. It must be some good stuff!

*Elves vs Dwarves.* No one is exactly sure, including the ancient loremasters, about why exactly the elves and dwarves came to dislike eachother so much, with both sides accusing the other of starting it. Nonetheless the conflict remains like the football teams of two neighboring cities.

*Denethor's title.* Denethor was wise enough to refuse to ever accept the title of King, as no amount of time would be acceptable for the steward of Gondor to claim that title. However, when he, effectively the King, finds out that the real King plans on returning to claim his throne, he is struck with absolute despair (the visions of the destruction of middle earth probably didn't help,) and decides to self immolate.

Compared to the movies, Gandalf has a bitterer personality. There's many moments within the book that Gandalf is genuinely impatient, and sick of getting asked stupid questions by minor characters. I like the book version much better, it makes the character feel like a real, powerful guy, instead of just everyone's Grandpa who is only there to make them feel good about themselves.

&#x200B;

**The Beautiful**

Aesthetic beauty seems to play a significant part in the story. One of the most powerful entities of middle earth uses her ring of power, one of the greatest rings, primarily to create a secret sanctuary so beautiful that it creates a sense of permanent wistfulness in anyone who lays eyes on it. When her ring loses its power, she immediately plans to leave middle earth. I would want to too, if my sanctuary was ruined like that.

Arwen and Galadriel are considered so gorgeous within the story, that casting them is realistically not even possible. I still agree with the early consensus that Cate Blanchett was an inappropriate choice for Galadriel, though I don't know if there was honestly any better choices. Throughout the story it's implied that their extreme beauty *by itself* carries substantial influence in middle earth, which I could easily see happening in real life too. I'm pretty sure there's supermodels in real life who could raise a small army if they wanted to.

&#x200B;

**The Magical**

LOTR exists within a universe where magic is real. However, much like anything else, that does not mean that *anything is possible* and certainly at least not at *any time*. Gandalf is one of the most powerful wizards in middle-earth, *and has a ring of power,* and most of the time is still limited to fantastical displays of fireworks (to such a degree that he was given the name Incanus!)

Sauron is the most powerful wizard in middle-earth, and even he cannot send long distance messages without assistance from powerful objects, he cannot make orcs smart, apparently he cannot even make orcs, he cannot show up and win a battle by himself, he cannot see everywhere at once, he is just as unsure as everyone else is about the discovery of the one ring.

Speaking of the one ring, even that existence of that makes perfect since within the context of the universe. Many elves made many rings. The most talented elves made the most powerful rings. It took them *a long time* and a lot of effort to make those rings. The highest elf with the highest powers managed to manufacture the *most powerful ring*, which lords over the other rings. Even so, most of those who wield the ring cannot do that much with it, even to the extent that they consider it more of a literal party trick than anything.

The Ent Draught has magical properties. Not surprising. What are they? Mostly they make a bunch of small hobbits into much larger but still small men in size. They're ents, not Gods, what would you expect?

&#x200B;

**The Romantic**

I will not make any comment about the Aragorn - Arwen relationship, as I have heard enough from the many women I know who are fans of LOTR that this is a fantastic piece of romance, I personally do not care strongly for it at all.

That said, the story of the Entwives is *heartbreaking.* They left thousands of years ago. No one seems exactly sure why they left. No one knows whether or not they still exist. They spent thousands of years looking for them all over middle-earth, and then, eventually, when hope appeared lost, they returned home to Fangorn, dreaming about eventually running into them again. They ask everyone who comes through Fangorn whether they have seen or heard from the Entwives, maintaining a hope of eventually seeing them again. It's beautiful!

&#x200B;

**The Pacing**

I've heard a significant amount of people complain that the Lord of the Rings is much too long, it aged poorly, it's too full of dry / irrelevant / boring detail.

I couldn't possibly disagree more. I feel that every single page of the entire book was put to good use, I was never bored reading it, I enjoyed every bit and piece of lore, and above all else was enamored with the sense that this is a *real* and a *big* world. You can tell Tolkien spent decades putting this world together. For a while during the Mount Doom chapter, when Frodo and Sam are marching toward the mountain after Frodo is freed, saw how much of the book was left at that point, and assumed that he must somehow waste 100 pages just with Frodo and Sam marching to Mount Doom, and I was dreading how slow and boring that looked like it was going to be. As it turned out, I was actually only 4 -5 pages from the ring falling into the lava, and the rest of the book is quite active and full of other content, much to my pleasant surprise.

&#x200B;

**The Legacy**

After finishing the book, I'm noticing more and more how everything else I've ever consumed in the genre of fantasy, especially Skyrim, World of Warcraft, and DnD, are dripping with influence from LOTR. There is absolutely no way these things could exist in the same way without LOTR coming first, whether it be the distinct depictions of Dwarves, or Elves, or the beautiful forest of Lothlorien which seems to have been copied directly into many other works, the stamp that Tolkien put on the fantasy genre forever is clear and great.

&#x200B;

Etc., Etc., I could go on forever. This is the greatest work of fiction I've ever read or otherwise consumed hands down, I am baffled that it actually managed to live up to it's lofty reputation without any feeling that it's overrated or poorly aged (that never happens for me,) it is an unquestionable 10/10, and if the scale goes up to a 100 it can't be any less than 100/100. I will never forget this masterpiece.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17osqgo/on_the_realism_of_lord_of_the_rings/,2023-11-06 02:36:28,110,276,books
rqhp3v,"The Left Hand of Darkness is one of the all time greatest sci fi books, and its incredible Ursula K Le Guin broke the glass ceiling right on the nose with a book that actually examines gender","This book blows me away every time I read it! Its one of the few books that I’d say I honestly recommend to anyone, no matter your reading style. It's a no-doubter for any best sci fi book list, but it's so well written it really transcends sci fi and becomes literary fiction that everyone can enjoy.It was also the first book by a woman to win the Hugo or Nebula awards (and it won both) - and Ursula K Le Guin could not have shattered that glass ceiling in a more incredible way. Not only did she do it, but she did it with a book that examines the very idea of what a world might be like *without* gender.

*Left Hand of Darkness* follows Genly Ai, the first Envoy from the other human worlds of the galaxy to the planet Winter.

Winter is a cold, hostile world in the depths of a never-ending ice age, and the Gethenians who live there are biologically different than most humans. They spend most of their lives as hermaphrodites, but enter kemmer once a month, the time when they become sexually active and develop either male or female sex organs depending on the month.

Genly’s assignment is to get the nations of Winter to join the Ekumen, a loose collection of human worlds that share knowledge and try to improve the lives of all humankind. Genly has to navigate an alien culture, a mad king, and two feuding nations to try and complete his mission. Most importantly, he must learn who to trust, and how to build a relationship with people so different from himself.

Unlike a lot of sci fi, *LHOD* is really tightly crafted - Le Guin manages to create an entire, fully realized world in only 300 pages. Short chapters interspersed in the first half of the novel tell the myths of the Gethenians, and Genly’s travels across the continent and the bizarre and interesting cultural practices, religions, and seemingly superhuman abilities he encounters will transport you to Winter, and it is like no place you’ve ever been.

There are so many deep themes and big ideas wrapped up in that small package too. First and most obviously, a species of humans without gender, and the society they create as a result, is such an interesting thought experiment. Loyalty is also a big part of the book - personal, family, and national - as well as what happens when those loyalties contradict. What can happen within nationalism, and when loyalty is to a government instead of to other people or humanity more broadly? Is it possible to explore and grow to understand an alien culture without ulterior motives or colonization? And how can you develop trust and a deep positive relationship with someone who is deeply, deeply different than yourself?

If you haven’t read it, do yourself a favor and pick it up! If you’re anything like me, you’ll be staying up late reading and thinking about it for weeks after its over.

7pz3av,"Haven't read any adult fiction voluntarily in my life. I'm now about 300 pages into The Shining, and it's been one if the most rewarding feelings I've had in a long time.","So I'm a senior in college and my entire life up to this point has been readings force fed to me growing up. My school system forced kids to read fictional books every quarter and take tests on them for a grade. I absolutely hated it. Some kids soaked up fiction like it was liquid sugar, and others just couldn't read very well.

I was the weird kid with his head in a non fiction book. They were always on space or weather usually. When I was a kid I had wanted to be a storm chaser.
I just liked soaking up usable information rather than fiction, I suppose. 

Everything I had read was always forced for a grade. I read RL Stein, those books about the kid who could use a baseball card to travel through time, and later in highschool we had to read all of the usual fiction essentials. Shakespeare, The Odyssey, Catcher and the Rye, Of Mice and Men, and a lot of Poe's short stories.

Poe's stuff was always my favorite. I've always loved horror and science fiction, but never read it. I've usually just watched it. I was so into movies by the end of high school, I decided to start writing screenplays.

Now by the end of college I've still dabbled in screen writing, but I felt like I was missing some core story telling techniques. So I decided I wanted to start reading to perhaps get a different perspective.

I decided to go with Stephen King. Being a horror movie fan, you can't escape a King movie. You've all seen one or another. I've always seen people say ""the book was better"", so I decided to try out The Shining. I've always wanted to see what King did originally that Kubrick changed for his film.

I'm now 300 pages into The Shining and it has been one of the most rewarding and entertaining experiences I've had in a long time. All I do is read a chapter before bed instead of looking at my phone screen. It's such a rewarding way to put my phone down, and get a better night's rest. 

The book is just so much richer with character descriptions and background information you never got in the film. I also just see all of the actors from the film as the characters in the book, even though Wendy is a blonde haha. If only Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance had this much characterization.
I just liked every character even more than I did in the film. Not that the film isn't good, but with the book it's like I'm getting like 2 extra serving of cake and ice cream.

I can't wait to finish this book and go onto something else. I'm not even sure what to do next. I think my entire life I've just been looking at the wrong genres. I highly doubt my school library back in the day could have carried anything like this haha.

I think I want to try Lovecraft next, but I'm not sure if I want to perhaps go to another King book. I like the concept of cosmic horror, and who's better to read than the creator. I've also wanted to read Christine and perhaps The Langoliers, but I'm pretty sure those are short stories. 

Aside from horror, I think I may also want to go from movies to the books they are based on, and see what I'm missing. I want to see what inspired a lot of these amazing films I hope to write one day. 

That's all I really had to rant about. Just another person who re-discovered reading I suppose. I still love my comics and graphic novels though, but I've found the value in a thick wall of text, and one's imagination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7pz3av/havent_read_any_adult_fiction_voluntarily_in_my/,2018-01-12 19:40:41,102,717,books

y2zd8v,Thoughts on the Dark Tower ending: Yin & Yang,"First of all, I want to thank this sub for making me aware of the series in the first place. I did not love every book, and took a long time to finish it, but as a whole I can't deny that it's an incredible work of art. I will be thinking about what it all means for a long time, may it do ya fine. 

Now, the ending... (Please don't read ahead if you don't want spoilers).

This dance between the Crimson King and Roland has played out countless times (or perhaps 19 times). Ka is a wheel.

I call it a dance because ultimately, the crux of the conflict is: the Crimson King's realization that Roland will restore the beams, causing him to flee to the Tower and be trapped by it, where we know Roland will follow and be trapped in his own way.  

Yin and Yang is a Chinese philosophical concept describing interconnected, but oppositional, forces: winter and summer, order and disorder, light and dark. 

Undoubtedly, Roland is the Yin to the Crimson King's yang. They are two sides of the same coin: each believing they are acting out of agency, but each serving the beam. All things serve the Beam. 

What I wonder is, is this dance like its own Beam? Undeniably, the tension between them has its own power. The power to make or break worlds. We were told time and time again in the series that time only runs one way in the Keystone world. And this may be true, but clearly time can return to itself. It can overlap itself, as Roland's journey does. 

There's one piece that really stuck with me from the ending: the Crimson King's eyes. Patrick was not able to capture the CK until he got the eyes right, using juice from a rose petal and Roland's own blood. And once he did, those eyes -- and the CK's tie to Roland himself -- could not be erased. 

How many times throughout the series did Stephen King remark on Roland's blue ""gunslinger's eyes""? I wonder if somehow, a piece of the Crimson King is trapped in Roland's essence as well. And I'm willing to bet that part can't be erased either.

8rwo98,I’m in love with the Codex Alera,"So I just finished book 2 of the Codex Alera Series by Jim Butcher and I am completely enamored.

16x4ln8,The Three Musketeers - Sympathy for the Cardinal,"I'm rereading The Three Musketeers and have got to the part where they're breakfasting on the battlefield, and D'Artagnan is lamenting the enemies ranged against him - the man he picked a fight with over a joke at a tavern, the man he attacked and robbed on the way to London, the woman de tricked into sex by pretending to be someone else, and the powerful politician whose schemes he's interfered with, not out of any loyalty to the king, but because he's trying to get into the pants of his landlord's wife. 

These are all his enemies very much as the consequence of his own actions, and the other three musketeers don't seem to make significantly better decisions, frequently coming across as violent, lying, philanderers with gambling problems.

The Cardinal in contrast, seems less outrightly villainous than he's often portrayed, a shrewd but aging minister who's trying to steer France, which is in a precarious position with enemies on all sides, to a secure position, hampered by rival political factions, a fickle, childish king, and a queen who is both related to many of the enemies, and is having an affair with the prime minister of the country they're nearly at war with.

Maybe I'm just older and more cynical than when I first read it, but I remember the good and bad guys seemed much more clear cut then.

wgc6ln,Finally started The Stormlight Archives,"I wanted something to listen to on my long drives for work after I wrapped up *Project Hail Mary*, and I figured I'd finally take a shot at *The Way of Kings*.

I found the book to be a little longer than necessary, but the payoff was absurdly good. In fact, the climax was so good that I went to my local book store and bought the paperback box set of the trilogy just so I could read the final battle of book 1 on the page instead of having it read to me via Audible!

I started book 2 a couple of nights ago and don't really want to put it down. I was SUPER excited that Sanderson did something so rare in epic fantasy: Book 2 started with the same characters that Book 1 ended with! I'm so used to the GRRM style of fantasy where each sequel introduces 5 billion new POV characters that when the second book began from Jasnah's POV in the prologue and Shallan's POV in chapter one I was so, so pleasantly surprised.

I can't wait to finish this trilogy! I'll probably stick with the paperbacks now instead of burning more of my Audible credits. I found the voice acting to be just OK when compared to some of the other audiobooks I've listened to (*Project Hail Mary*and *The Expanse* series being big ones with great VAs).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wgc6ln/finally_started_the_stormlight_archives/,2022-08-04 21:03:22,26,26,books

I think the popularity of the IT movies got his eye back on what made his early work so much more popular with the public. I adored every character, even the Trump loving Sheriff John. Not only that, but the ending came together nicely and didn't feel rushed/made up on the spot like most of his endings. I enjoyed it so much that I found myself questioning if Joe Hill ghost wrote it, but Google assured me that King still writes everything himself and always gives proper credit on projects his sons co-write. 

It also made me think a lot about the weird way readers obsess over defining whether a book is YA or Adult. This book shatters all the lines dividing those groups. I wish other YA books had the balls to be R-rated like this was.

Either way, if you haven't checked out a new release by King in a while, this puppy is gold. And if you have already finished it, I'd love to hear what others thought.

18xafek,Do you sometimes dislike seeing book-based films after reading the book?,"I just finished reading Misery by Stepehen King and have started the film - I'm only a few minutes in. I've heard it's the most accurate film representation of his books, and I'm sure it's a very good film, but part of me doesn't like the way it might distort my vision of the book.

Reading it, you build a whole imaginary vision of all the scenes and places, and suddenly in the film it's all different. In this case, most of the book takes place in a single room, and I hadn't even noticed until now how in my mind I had made such a vivid picture of it. In my mind the bed was always placed on the left wall of the room, and the room itself was much smaller and worn out, and in the film the bed is placed against the right side, and it's more spacious, tidy looking, and the windows are different.

It's just a minor detail, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the film, but I can't avoid feeling a bit sad knowing that after watching it my vision of the book will probably be distorted.

Anyway just a random thing I guess, and I know all our minds work different so the representation of each scene will vary from one person to another, but I just wanted to share my little feeling of sadness when this happens",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18xafek/do_you_sometimes_dislike_seeing_bookbased_films/,2024-01-03 04:29:32,46,11,books
o6qgth,Lord of the Rings,"I know it is an unpopular opinion but I just finished the first two Lord of the Rings books and it has been one of those rare instances where I enjoyed the movies way more than the source books.

With the novels I just never felt the true desperation and overwhelming odds facing the characters. The book just felt more of a historical text; like reading a textbook vs watching an immersive documentary.

There are some books where I can separate the text from the movie, especially when there is great divergence between the story  (King vs Kubrick's The Shining) but the LotR movies are fairly faithful adaptations.

Sure I would have liked to see a bit of Tom Bombadil but I think the trade-offs with the movie interpretation are well worth it. One example: when Gandalf frees Theoden from the influence of Wormtongue - in the novels was a bit underwhelming, kind of like... hey, come get a few breaths of fresh air and a Snickers, you good boss? Look at the blue sky  (and his wrinkles smoothed. The end.) VS the movie interpretation when we can see the drastic  driving out of Sarumon's influence.

I know this is a hot take here and I'm not looking to change anyone's opinion or try to take away from Tolkien's masterpiece, I'm just surprised with myself that this has been my takeaway through the first two books and wanted to know your take.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o6qgth/lord_of_the_rings/,2021-06-24 01:16:21,138,202,books

Just finished Enders Game yesterday (which was amazing) wasn't much for the action sequences, I mean they were fine. It's just hard for me to picture for some reason. But anyway, I was in a comic book store and was browsing their small novel section. And they're staring right at me ""was the way of Kings""  so of course I had to pick it up. but for some reason a book being over a thousand Pages just sort of intimidates me. I don't know why honestly, I think it's a mix between the complexity of large novels compared to shorter ones, and also I think it's going to take me like a month. Partially because of time, and I'm not a very fast reader in the least. I did manage to read 10 pages before I left for work today. Anyone else have this issue?

But everyone just screamed ""classic"" at me when I mentioned the name, so it sat in my mental book queue for a while. Go figure I decide to make it my goal for the year 2021 after the bizarre year that was 2020, super-flu and everything. Anyway...

At 1153 pages, this is the longest book I have ever finished. I figured I'd be able to knock out 100 pages each month, have it finished by the end of the year. Well, I guess things got rolling and plot arcs started spinning faster, and now I'm done with the whole thing twice as fast as I'd planned. I really did enjoy it, especially with the new series coming out recently and being able to watch that with a slight delay to avoid spoilers. (I have several thoughts on the mini-series, but I'll focus on just the book here.) Bottom line here is: I'm so glad I didn't let a bulky book scare me away from reading a thrilling story.

My first impression as I started reading was that King never really does many dramatic moments of horror or the literary equivalent of a jump-scare. His style is more insidious. Instead of spaced out moments that spike the drama, there's a slow, sneaky build of... discomfort. I'm reading along and feeling just mild unease at what's unfolding. There's always something just on the periphery causing worry or tension or something, and not anything popping out and going, ""BOO!""

It took a while to establish all of the characters and start weaving all of the different threads together, but once it took off, then it was on. I really appreciated the diversity of characters and their struggles. Maybe I will appreciate them even more on my next reading of it. And I really like when they start raising the question: now that we have a chance to start over and do things differently, *will we*? I think it speaks to our constant NEED to evolve and break old patterns even when they're ""tradition"" or familiar or just hegemonic. There were tons of things I enjoyed about this, but these are the things that jumped out first. Oh - and Tom Cullen's prayer on the way home. That is fuggin' gold, and I burst out laughing at first encounter.

So what now? I feel hungover now. Like I can't even decide what to pull out of my massive literary queue to read next. How does anything follow THAT? I genuinely don't know. I'll probably have to veer toward something totally different to avoid any comparison, a biography or something. But again, I'm very glad I tackled this personal challenge and feel like I've joined many others of you that have gone on this same journey. I welcome your thoughts, memories, reflections or anything else related to your own reading of The Stand.

This is an experience I've always had with fiction, especially the suspense thriller types. Do you also rush or are you taking it all in while reading?

qf3y2p,The Dark Tower: good not great,"I just finished Stephen King's The Dark Tower series (note: I have not read any of the spinoffs yet, such as Wind Through The Keyhole). 

The series as a whole is good not great.  In recent years, TV and film adaptations of King's work have renewed interest in his stories, and this led me to consider The Dark Tower series a must read.  It is not a must read series. 

If you have been contemplating starting the series, or if you've started then stopped, I'd like to offer this review. 

Overall, the narrative lacks a sense of direction, and the payoff at the end suffers for it.  If you've watched the televison series Lost, you might understand what I'm saying.  It's not until book 5 of 7 that the purpose of the quest really starts to come into focus.  In some ways the world building is good, but in other ways it feels shallow.  The concept of multiple worlds or universes is eventually well flushed out.  Other elements, like the language of Mid-World, feel thrown together and unconvincing.  For a series that uses Tolkien as its inspiration, it just doesn't compare. 

At times the series feels likes a grind and I wanted to stop.  Realistically, you could stop at book 3 and probably be well-versed enough to keep up with the pop culture references.  Of course, you'd be stopping before the series really gets good. 

Book 4 is easily the best of the series.  Fortunately, since book 4 functions as a prequel to the rest of the story, you could practically just read it as a standalone book, which is my recommendation, although I know my recommendation will be controversial. 

I'd be lying if I said King wasn't able to stir my feelings with the ending, but it was kind of bittersweet.  King seems to acknowledge the ending is not great.  He speaks directly to the reader at the end and appears to apologize, so take that for what it's worth. 

Book 1 is a meandering, unneccesary story.  You would miss nothing if you skip it. 

Book 2 provides the real set up for the story. 

Book 3 is okay.

Books 4 and 5 are good. 

Books 6 and 7 are only necessary if you've made it that far. 

If you're a fan of King, you should read the series because it has numerous tie ins to his other books. 

I've only read 11/22/63, which I loved, so my experience with King is limited.

6r085j,I hate the fact the highschool/college has ruined pleasure reading for me,"When I was a kid I used to read every night before bed, usually way above my reading level. It was the only way i could get to sleep. I used to blow through books like it was my job, and I enjoyed it. I was the only person in my friend group who was a ""reader"" too, and that was something I was proud of. Then high school came along and, as you all are well aware, I was forced to read books for the curriculum. Some of the books I enjoyed, like Brave New World and Macbeth, the latter of which I mainly enjoyed due to breaking the story down in class. But for everyone book I did like, there were two that I did not, and of course, I had to read it anyway unless I wanted to flunk out. My pleasure reading grinded to a halt around the end of freshman year, and even now, two years after graduation, I still struggle to finish a book. I can't really explain it, maybe I lose interest quicker or just the overall experience of reading was tainted. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but it really does bother me at times. Like why is it that, of all things, SCHOOL is the one that robbed me of the love of books, I think that's a real problem. Maybe with the way American school systems are set up now, or maybe I've just gotten lazy. 

I finished American Psycho last week, the first book I've read all the way through since high school and loved it, and am re-reading Stephen Kings ""IT"" before the new movie comes out, but man, I'm struggling to get through it, and this is a book I knocked out in a week when I was 14.

17e2w3o,I finished the Dark Tower Serise by Stephen King,"Over the summer I was given a lend of the books and I also got some on audible as I found it was a great listening experience. 

I really enjoyed reading the afterwords by King and finding out some more detail about his feelings on the books, the audio narrators etc (for example the fact that he edited the first book at a later point, which was the version I read). 

So my thoughts I believe my least favourite were the first and the last books. I enjoyed King being featured to a point but the full amount of his character I did not always enjoy. I found it interesting that his own characters did not always like him though. 

I absolutely loved and was excited by the Salems lot cross over and the low men in yellow coats. Over the years I've read so many books and stories of his including UR so all the final links makes so much sense about multiple universes, it all clicked into place. 

I read a couple of reviews and I have to agree that the Mordrid vignette was a bit anticlimactic. I had wondered was Mordrid going to be linked more to IT, or that it would in fact be IT. 

I absolutely loved Oy and I was so sad at his death, I had wished he got to go back to Jake in his living form. It mentioned a version of him will get to turn up in the universe with Jake, Eddie and Sushanna but I wished it hadn't happened the way it did. 

Finally the ending, very trippy and I thought maybe as King himself says, it had to be this ending. The fact we have Ka and the Turtle it made me think of Karma and reincarnation from the Bhagwad Gita. He is being perpetually punished because he isn't fully capable of change. It also reminded me of the insanity in secrete window at the end for some reason but I'm not sure why, more the writing style, the idea of perpetual unfixable insanity than the character itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17e2w3o/i_finished_the_dark_tower_serise_by_stephen_king/,2023-10-22 20:47:23,9,17,books
wfah0e,"Good contemporary horror, ""in the spirit of"" Stephen King?","One thing that stands out to me about King's work is that a lot of it is a slice of contemporary Americana. I get that the American communities and attitudes he depicts are partly mythical. But they're also very much in the spirit of the place and time they were written. If you lived in the period in which one of his books was set, the way he describes that world resonates with you. You feel that bittersweet nostalgia and connection to a personal past. Even if you didn't live in that place and time, it felt like a true-speaking window into a real place and time. A town you could live in. People you recognized. Themes and values and even uglinessess that were familiar and somehow comforting. 

(I'm referring mostly to his older work; I stopped keeping up with him sometime around the end of the Dark Tower series.)

So my question is, who's writing like that today? Writing horror stories in a way that connects with our lives, and our sense of the world we live in?  There's more to it than just saying ""all the characters have smartphones! See?! Contemporary!""  It's not simply a matter of putting a recent political controversy into a character's mouth. You can't just litter the narrative with references to current events. There's something more that King brings to the table, some *je ne sais quoi*, and I'm wondering what current authors - especially horror authors - have it. 

Some authors that I think do have it, in their own ways:

qntm/Sam Hughes. There Is No Antimemetics Division almost perfectly captures the unique existential dread of our Internet-dominated era. 

T. Kingfisher. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but something about the way she writes makes me think, ""yes, this is the world I live in, and this is how I think and feel about it"".

Martha Wells. While not horror, and not set in our present day, The Murderbot Diaries capture an aspect of our current society, that has emerged in the long decades since It and Tommyknockers, and that King could never have contemplated. 

What are your thoughts?

oqrp2a,"Having a hard time understanding why Stephen King is often quoted as the ""master of horror""","I recently finished reading Pet Sematary (after having watched the original film which was awesome) and except for the last 100 pages or so it didn't read as a horror story to me. I was just wondering if other people feel the same way or, alternatively,  can explain why his books do rate as  predominantly scary/spooky to them?  Maybe I've had ""bad luck"" in picking up the few King books that are the least horrific, as I've only read Pet Sematary, IT, The Dead Zone and The Dark Half. The latter did give me some thriller vibes and it was a good read. For the other stories they just didn't make my blood freeze or my flesh crawl.


EDIT: genuine thanks for replying and sharing your views on King's work and horror in general.  :D I think I'll try some of his short stories after this.  I studied Gothic horror at uni and speculative fiction and half of the King books I've read were for those courses. Perhaps this in combination of my slight bias against his writing style plus desensitized nature due to watching all those horror films have made me less receptive to his ""brand"" of horror.

sly6fd,Is Stephen King the Herman Melville of our times?,"I know there are differences between them - Melville was not nearly as popular as King in his era. 

That aside, Melville was also criticised for his ""loose"" sentence structure and ""incoherent"" language - just as King is also said to have been inelegant in his writing. 

Melville was long thought of as a novelist who delved into marine adventure and whaling experience. King is also thought of as a horror exponent per excellence. The true merit of Melville came to light later.  Professor D.E.S. Maxwell, in his biography of Melville in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, has said it the best. 

> For Melville, as for Shakespeare, man was ape and essence, inextricably compounded; and the world, like the “Pequod,” was subject to two antagonistic influences . . . one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. 

King is similarly considered a horror exponent per excellence. Yet I think there is more in his writing than sheer horror. Take for instance ""It"", which is primarily a humane tale of the different ways power shapes our relationships.

o3s5g7,Asimov's Guide to the Bible - A secular look at the Holy Book.,"I recently found out that Isaac Asimov, arguably one of the keystones of the Science Fiction world, published quite a few books outside of the Sci-Fi world, forgive the error of my ways. I was recently gifted a copy of his [Guide to the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimov%27s_Guide_to_the_Bible) and I have been reading through it and I have to say, it is fascinating.   


This might be purely speaking to my personal taste for history, and being an atheist fascinated with world religions, but I found this book to be a great read. Asimov takes a purely secular view of the Bible, attempting to bring the people, events, locations, etc of the passages of the Bible out into the knowledge of the general public.   To do this, he uses various versions of the Bible, namely the King James Bible, Revised Standard Version, the New Catholic Edition, The Jerusalem Bible, ""The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic text"" (?), & the Anchor Bible. I personally never knew/heard of most of these, and I was expecting the Gideon Bible to have been used at first glance, but then further research told me it's the King James Bible.  


Each volume deals with one of the Testaments. Each chapter delves into a single Book of the Bible. Here, Asimov gets down to enlightening the Bible for the layperson. His writing and terminology, how he includes maps and directly referencing and breaking down Bible passages, I found, made this into a very easily-accessible book that anyone can pick up and read. This was intentionally written for the general public without any extensive knowledge of history.   


The book(s), there are editions where the two volumes are collected in one, are dense, I'm not going to lie. Who would have thought dissecting a book that is millenia old would be an easy, light read. But the subject matter, I feel is handled brilliantly by Asimov. I understand that there's parts of the secular world in 1968 at the time of the release of Volume I that are a little bit different now in 2021, most likely why it is now out of print. I read the combined 1981 version. I would highly suggest anyone with an even remote interest in the more secular aspects of the Bible, see if you can get a copy from your local library ( I discovered my college has a copy of most of his ""Guide to"" books) or ThriftBooks or other ways, I promise you, it will be worth your time.   


For those interested in the other non-SF reference/literary books Asimov has written, in release order:

xhk903,A Good Marriage checks all the boxes for a realistic horror short story,"“A Good Marriage” by Stephen King is a quick novella that delivers in such a way that’s relatable and well, creepy. As always with King’s work, the main characters here in Darcy and Bob are very well done and once things start to unravel, truly paint an evil picture of horror at home.

This is a perfect weekend read as it can easily be finished in a few hours and let me tell you if you’re also married, it’s going to hit you even harder because it makes you wonder what you’d do if such a situation ever occurred. It’s definitely a well-crafted read that hits you fast and hard once Darcy discovers something no wife should ever have to deal with involving her husband of so many years, all the memories they created together, and the two children they brought into this world.

I won’t ruin anything for you but everything from the beginning all the way to the beyond intense ending just makes you truly love how great King is as an author. He makes every word count and leaves his mark on what happens when a good marriage ends up being a real-life horror due to an innocent discovery. I give “A Good Marriage” a 5/5 and would highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good horror with a few plot twists along the way you won’t ever see coming.

wdsutb,Which book had the worst ending?,"I actually have three! 🤓

The first one was Warriors: SkyClan and the Stranger #3: After the Flood. I hated how Leafstar just abandoned her kittens despite her initial desire to love and protect them. Keep in mind, this was in middle school and the first time I ever raged over an ending. Sadly, it wasn’t my last. 😢

The second one was Deposing Nathan. I resented Nate and Cam not getting together and Nate and his father moving away from their hometown they loved just to escape the controversy Nate’s aunt caused when there were other ways they could’ve handled it. 🥴

The third one was Supernova, the eighth book in the Amulet series. The way Emily defeated the Elf King was too easy and anticlimactic. The series had set up the two having an epic showdown, only to resolve it within the span of a few pages. Very disappointing. 😔

12mj5cl,The Once and Future King really surprised me,"It was pointed out that my previous post about The Once and Future King was too short so I will give some of my thoughts on my new favorite:

I was surprised at how effective the mechanic of letting a novel mature with its characters is. I am sure there are other books that do this, but I have not encountered them. (Perhaps A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce, but I haven't read that novel, to be honest, it took me ages to finish Ulysses).

Both the style and the themes of the book change, but always in a very natural way.

At the start, The Once and Future King resembles a children’s book, but the books starts to explore deeper things like a loving marriage between people who are not in love (Arthur and his queen), the link between self-loathing and magical thinking (Lancelot, who believes that being pure is part of a deal with God, who grants him skill and strength and sees this as compensation for being 'ugly' and unlovable).

The key theme is how the impact of upbringing on how our ideas as adults are shaped.

Arthur is fundamentally decent because his mentor has thought him about the importance of being fair while giving him practical life experience by letting him be a child. Yes, Merlin uses magic to transform Arthur into animals, but that is similar to a child with a vivid imagination reading a book.

Lancelot can only think in terms of serving an abstract ideal, like being the perfect knight or being loyal to a perfect king because he wasn't thought much outside of being a knight.

The book might be one of the funniest books I have ever read. At least, the first part is hilarious. And I have come to release that the comedy is necessary. It serves a purpose.

Tragedy is so more meaningful when it is mixed with comedy.

Some favorite things: Lancelot as a boy looking in a shining helmet, trying to get the distorted image to show that he is not ugly, and then realizing he is ugly.

Gawain and his brothers desperately trying to get attention from their mother and wanting to be loved by her.

Lancelot suddenly seeing ‘Jenny’, a pretty girl, and not a calculating queen who stole Arthur’s love after he hurt her feelings.

It's details like this that make the book feel modern and characters out of old legends feel like real people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12mj5cl/the_once_and_future_king_really_surprised_me/,2023-04-15 00:13:02,23,57,books
11d9qcz,Just finished Fairy Tale by Stephen King - And i have a complete opposite opinion than the majority,"Yes, i dont like it. I honestly should have stopped the book 200 pages in, but i have never not finished a book, so i did what i had to do.

Let me preface this by saying this is my second King book. My first was the shining, which i would rate a 8/10. So maybe, King is just not my style and i was lucky with the shining.

So, there are many problems that made me dislike this book.

One of the biggest ones is the part that many people seemed to love. The first half of the book before Charlie found out about the well/other world.
I like normal fiction (stuff like Fredrik Backmann - A man called ove is my favorite book even!), so this wasnt something new for me. But in my opinion using half a book (~300 pages) in this case was just too much.
The interaction/relationship between bowditch and charlie could have been reduced to 100 pages and i still would have felt the same emotionally.
But that wasnt the biggest flaw for me for that half of the book. It just didnt built up any tension and mystery for me.
Obviously there are three big points: Where was the gold from, whats in the shed and who murdered the gold-trader.
Maybe i should have gone completely blind into it, but knowing that there is another world (which is said in every recommendation text to describe the book online) and the title being fairy tale basically made the first two mysteries obsolete.
So the only thing left was Christopher Polley and that just wasnt a big enough mystery - at least for me.

So after the first half was over and we finally got into the other world i felt relieved. And honestly the book got better. While i would say the first half is a 2/5 i would say the latter half is a 4/5.
But (there always has to be a but) the ending was just.. something else. I dont want to give it a 0, so a 1 has to suffice. 
There are two parts that made me hate it. 
First of all, the way the ""fight"" against Gogmaggog got won. Obviously it was a rumpelstiltskin way of ending, which got ""hinted"" multiple times throughout the book (and honestly besides polley and the dwarf being evil, i dont see another correlation to rumpelstiltskin). But in the case of the rumpelstiltskin fairy tale itself the whole fairy tale was building up to that point. It was literally the goal in the story to find the name.
Here? There is nothing like that. Even worse, it seems that everyone in the other world knows that name, but is afraid to use it. Using it then to ""defeat"" the big evil feels to me like King didnt know how to finish it. It honestly also felt like the rumpelstiltskin hints where plastered into the story after he did the ending, so it would make a little bit of sense.
The second part is how charlie handled the well at the end. To me fairy tales need to have a ""and they lived happily ever after"" part. Charlie never coming back (except for once with his dad) and even filling it with concrete was a total letdown. 
I cant say anything else, besides it disappointing me so much.

The last big problem (still got small ones) is charlie itself. The way he is written made he heavily dislike him. In fairy tales the main characters are usually some perfect kinda princes. The same is the case with charlie.
But in fairy tales there is only a small section telling us that they are perfect. In this book we get reminded every 3-5 pages that charlie is **the** good guy itself. And in tandem with it we also always get reminded that he was really bad in his childhood. After some time you would think that we already know, but that seems not to be the case in Kings eyes.
The same goes for charlie reminding us every few pages that some words dont exist in their language..

Those were my 3 big points. I also got 2 smaller ones.

Let me start with the easier one. The sex scene. Why? Just why? The whole second half of the book charlie is gushing over the princess and at the end he randomly has a woman (which was in jail with him) come up to him, ask him if he wants sex and does it (out of the eyes of a teenager i understand it, but not out of an authors eyes)?
And then talking about if it was a thank you or mercy fuck? Just why did this part have to be in the story? Like those 10 lines did add nothing at all. I'm not a prude, i like sex scenes. But at least give a little build up to it? Or just dont add it at all.

The second one is the way the fairy tales were referenced. I already mentioned it with the rumpelstiltskin one.
This book had so many opportunities (the goose girl one was a really good reference!) to integrate fairy tales better into the world. To hint at the fairy tales in good ways. But it never did.
There were always 1-2 really insignificant hints (except the goose girl) and then immediately charlie spoils the name of the fairy tale. So instead of getting the good feeling of ""hah, i knew that one"" we immediately get told ""and this is fairy tale xyz"".

I dont know what else to say besides i'm happy that it is over. I love fantasy, i love horror, i love good characters and good written relationships. So everything this book is seemingly loved for.
But somehow i dont like the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11d9qcz/just_finished_fairy_tale_by_stephen_king_and_i/,2023-02-27 11:34:56,39,11,books
q25vf5,Finally got around to reading the mistborn series all i can say is WOW,"For the longest time I've kinda just put off reading Brandon Sanderson works, even though everyone mentioned him! I guess I thought his work was ""over-hyped""

So I finally got around to reading the the first 3 books and was just blown away but them.

The world building, the storylines, the character development, the way the drama unfolded was really epic.

I literally could not put the books down, read them all within 2 weeks.  

The concept of mistborns & mistings is amazing!

Vin was an amazing lead the way she developed as a character from being this broken, scared girl who trusted no one, that was abandoned by everyone,  to having an idenity crisis. Is she a skaa thief whos worth nothing? Is she a noble women or a skaa pretending to be one? The overwhelming responsibilities of protecting Elend and being the hero of ages, to finally accepting that she was a theif, a noble women, an empress, a powerful mistborn.

Elend's own trials of a young man with ideals, on how the country should be run.  He was forced to grow from a young man with naive ideals, to a king who had tried to implement those said ideas and failed. To becoming an emperor who understood you have to compromise your morals to some extent to achieve the end goals. But through it all what I admired the most about Elend was and how he questioned himself, was this the right thing to do? He always cared for his people. Near the end he started to understand Rashek, and why he ruled the way he did.

Kelsier was by far my favourite character, he was filled with revenge for the death of this wife and to bring justice to the skaa, to liberate them. The whole plot regarding his wife - mare betraying him, to finally coming to terms and finding closure that she did not do it on purpose. He was an impressive leader, he did act on impulse but always got the job done. I like how evenutally he became a sort of father figure to Vin, and even after his death the crew stuck around to see his dreams fulfilled. 

Marsh story was tragic. He had a strained relationship with Kelsier, he loved a women who married kelsier, he gave up on the rebellion after trying for so long, only for kelsier to be successful. He became an inquisitor, lost his humanity after ruin took control of him and used him. For me Kelsier was everything Marsh wanted to be. 

What did you like about the book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q25vf5/finally_got_around_to_reading_the_mistborn_series/,2021-10-05 21:19:13,96,254,books
15h9loj,"The Stand (Spoilers, beware!)","So I just finished Steven King's The Stand and whoaa boy. I actually accidentally ended up with the extended version on my e-reader, so I've just spent a couple of months or so ploughing through over 1000 pages. Reader beware! There are spoilers in this post so take this is fair warning if you don't want any twists and turns ruined! 

So. First of all, I did *not* think this would morph from post apocalyptic horror plague setting into some pretty heavy christian God wholloping by the end. Good grief. I got an inkling about it when I reached the Mother Abagail part plus various allusions to the Dark Man being ""the devil"" but by the end, it was so obviously an allegory to various bible stories that I couldn't just couldn't ignore it. I found it a very compelling read but with 200 pages to go, I was really questioning whether I wanted to finish it or not. Just... Way too much god stuff. Also the part where  Glen, Stu, Larry and Ralph are walking west and they just leave Stu there with his broken leg to die. All because it is what God has willed. It just left a fully sour taste in my mouth. I genuinely stopped reading and said ""oh for fucks sake."" and had to frown at the pages for a while.

And THEN. The part where Flagg's electrical power/magical flame/whatever is was is turned into the hand of god that touches Trashcan Man's nuclear missile and blows up all of Las Vegas. Like, never have I been so hilariously flabbergasted by a book before. 

This isn't all a dunk though. Overall, the plot and the journey of all of the characters and all of the twists and turns were incredibly good - like I said, very compelling reading. Also an excellent window into aspects of 1990s american culture at the time. I really did enjoy all of those parts and I'm glad actually accidentally downloaded the extended version. 

All this to say, as a brit, what an utterly bonkers book. It was only after reading this that I discovered that King is really REALLY Christian, so it makes sense. I'm just kinda hoping not all of his work is quite like that as I like a little less God in my reading yknow? 

Anyway. Just had to get that out of my system. What did you all think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15h9loj/the_stand_spoilers_beware/,2023-08-03 16:59:56,29,7,books
adbttg,I just finished the Dark Tower saga by Stephen King - what a ride!,"From the end of chapter 1 of the first book I was hooked and after 2^(1/2) months I'm finished (including the 4.5 story within a story within a story).

All I can say is... wow.   Honestly - I don't know what genre to put it in as I experienced a western, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi, an action/adventure, a romance/drama, a dystopian fantasy, and even a little horror.I've tried explaining some of the storyline to my SO and she thinks I was reading a kids book at times, or some weird twisted stuff.  But with all of the strange stuff going on - I could. not. put. it. down.

&#x200B;

Never before have I laughed aloud at a character before, and I've never actually teared up at the loss of co-protagonists.

At times I thought I was lost and confused, but King was always able to provide context and purpose as to why the writing style changed the way it had.  Especially when an author writes himself into the story, I honestly wanted to quit because of the guy's ego - but when you remember some of the odd you put up with before, it's not so difficult to get past, and the outcome of this was pretty rewarding.

13zrwp2,Two books that helped me through the worst year of my life...,"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi. If you're going through a difficult time, these books might be for you. I'll break down each one briefly without spoiling and then share a bit about myself.

Meditations: This book is a philosophical read at its core. The author was a Roman Emperor, and this is his personal journal. Marcus Aurelius can be described as a philosopher king. One who doesn't care much for the politics of the state, but he does his duty all the same. This book focuses on how Marcus Aurelius rationalized and processed each day with its unique challenges. This ultimately led him to a more fulfilling life. In short, gratitude and rationalizing difficulties.

The Book of Five Rings: This book focuses on a legendary Japanese swordsman as he breaks down his Way of the Warrior. It should be noted that this book should be read while practicing a martial art, but it is not wholly applicable. In truth, the book serves more as a guide for pursuing your goals and purpose. Each day you must hone your skill, and that's true for a martial artist or a carpenter.

About me: I lost four people in 2022 that sent me in a death spiral of depression and nihilism. Each death came about every other month. It was horrific. I couldn't cope. I started doing drugs, lying to my (now ex) girlfriend, simply just giving up on existing. Not really living but hoping I would die soon. I made a lot of mistakes. But without this death and agony, I would not be here today as the best version of myself from the trauma. If you're struggling, and you look to literature for help like me, please check out these two books. Go into a martial art or really pursue an artistic passion. Journal daily. Etc. I wanted to share my story. And I'm curious how these books have changed your life too.

It's one of the only popular fantasy book set in a ""renaissance"" time for it's world. Early renaissance to be fair but ; no knight yet mercenaries, rhetoric as a study, more accepting for girl to be taught anything, more lavish castle built less for defence and more for prestige (although we really only see one) and even a less present church.
 
Are there other fantasy book set in a renaissance time for their world? Yes. Of course. But it's one of the reasons I like the king killer books.

5cpcd3,I've read more in the last 6 months than I have done in the last 10 years!,"Got a job in the leather business, and it involves driving halfway up the country (England) delivering leather to customers.

It's a 500 mile round trip every week, and I started listening to podcasts, and have started listening to audiobooks too. So far I've read (listened to):

- All the Harry Potters
- All the Hitchhikers Guides
- Brave new world
- Animal Farm
- 1984
- Fahrenheit 451
- All the Stieg Larsson books
- A whole bunch of other crime thrillers
- Gone Girl
- Girl on the Train
- David Mitchell's Autobiography
- Da Vinci Code
- Currently halfway through Stephen King's IT

Some I've enjoyed more than others, but I find it makes my drive so much more enjoyable, and I am really enjoying just the feel of digesting these books - I know I'm not technically ""reading"" them, but I personally don't think that matters.

Anyways, I'll be following this sub now for my next book recommendations :)

EDIT: Mod said I needed more depth so I've pasted my reply to someone down below about my favourites so far:

Okay so out of the classics, I'd say Fahrenheit 451, but the three dystopias were all pretty close. I dunno, just love the ideas of them. But what I liked about F 451 was its simplicity, and they way Bradbury focused on one guy - you got the message without really knowing that much about the dystopian world they lived in.

I loved Hitchhikers Guide, purely because it was lighthearted sci-fi and I enjoyed hearing Martin Freeman narrate them.

Gone girl is my favourite modern thriller so far. Though the Stieg Larson trilogy is a really close second.

I'm *loving* Stephen king though. The writing style really does something for me - I like the time and perspective changes, and his use of language is way better than I expected from what I thought was going to be ""pulp crap"" (just a little joke there.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5cpcd3/ive_read_more_in_the_last_6_months_than_i_have/,2016-11-13 10:00:31,57,294,books
14r7zw2,Is the whole point of 1984 that nothing will ever change?,"Im sorry if any of the names said in the book are wrong, I read it in portuguese and I may translate it wrong.

Towards the end of the book there's this concept introduced of Low, Middle and High class, which pretty much is consistent throughout all of our society structures we've seen through history.

Low Class: Working class, poor and unaware people essentially.

Middle Class: People not rich enough to be called High Class but they are educated enough to realize there's something wrong with the system and aware enough to make a change

High Class: I'd say thats the government or any type of leadership in a nation, be that a king, president or a big corporation.

What I think Winston failed to see when he was still against the Ingsoc is that, it doesn't matter who is in the power, the cycle will repeat, maybe Ingsoc is actually never gonna be taken down essentially because they made a revolution knowing that the power of hate and misery its going to be the main reason why people still accept that kind of gonvernment in first place.

Let's say by some force of nature, when Winston is being tortured a real revolutionary group somehow takes the Ingsoc and the other 2 other huge states down, rescue Winston and everyone else, for that to happen, first this needs to fullfield:

- They have to be against Ingsoc ideals, obviously, so they would want Freedom, End of War and misery etc. Essentially the good guys in this scenario

But isn't that what causes a Government to fail in first place? trying to be too liberal, too human, have too much empathy? Wouldn't there be a point where this new Government would fail like all the others that are named in the book, so there'd be a period of prosperity and then it would be taken down by a new revolution, until how long will it take for a Ingsoc type of revolution takes place again?

Seems like the only way to actually maintain power is through absolute misery and hate, otherwise you're just kidding yourself.

(This is ignoring the fact that Ingsoc is unlikely to be taken down, let's say this revolutionaries got extremely lucky or something like that)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14r7zw2/is_the_whole_point_of_1984_that_nothing_will_ever/,2023-07-05 11:28:27,79,112,books
146p7a,What are your favorite book series that are longer- minimum 5 books in the series,"I know there have been threads about peoples' favorite series before, but this one is for longer ones.  I love nothing more than getting into a great series because who doesn't love a series that keeps you up until the early morning and then makes you get out of bed to find the next one and continue the story.

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, but from there, it's pretty original world that he creates.  There's a minor issue in that book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder, more fantastical elements.

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone, but I think guys are more likely to like it.

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, I'm messing up the term) who is captured by Danes who raise him.  He loves the Danes and follows their beliefs.  But he becomes a warlord of Alfred the Great, who is responsible for creating the idea of England instead of separate kingdoms.  Uthred is another great character.  He's fun to listen to, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, his uniting of the Mongol people, and their conquests.  Later goes on to follow his descendants.  Really good historical fiction.  First book is a tad slow for a little bit, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship, accuracy, and detail.  7 books take you from 110-27 BC.  Very long books that are pretty dense.  But the time period is well documented and she does a great job with it.  There are plenty of real characters that she uses that are all fascinating.

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period, this is what you want to read.  Great books.  Must reads.  Hornblower gets a nod, but O'Brian's series is better.

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain, but they go all over the Empire.  Pretty good to the historical record for the most part.

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good, plots interesting, and it shits all over something like Dan Brown in terms of a light read that is actually good.

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books, all really good.  Read it.

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

5oyzz4,Is Brandon Sanderson the best fantasy writer of our time?,"It's a genuine question I have. 

I've read his *Mistborn* series. I've read his first two entries in *The Stormlight Archives*. I've read some of his short stories as well and am amazed more and more with every page turn.

Right now I am reading *The Way of Kings* through for the second time and am constantly floored by his world creation, character development, magic systems, and storytelling ability. 

So back to my question...Is he actually the best? Are there contemporaries of his that is even better? If so, I'd love to know and give his or her work a read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5oyzz4/is_brandon_sanderson_the_best_fantasy_writer_of/,2017-01-19 20:17:14,34,3,books
1bezjz1,“The Good House” is one of the most original haunted house/voodoo novels I've ever read,"“The Good House” by Tananarive Due is a slow-build kind of novel that builds up into a solid haunted house novel that checks off most of the boxes you’re looking for when it comes to this kind of horror. If you want to read about evil spirits, voodoo, and some pretty memorable characters and events, you’ll genuinely enjoy this one.  
  
This was the first novel I’ve ever read by Due as I love her writing style. All the characters are well done, places across Sacajawea were very descriptive, and of course, the center of this, the house itself, were all great. There is a ton of creepy horror here and even though I won’t ruin it for you, there are plenty of moments that will creep you out.  
  
I also loved all the Stephen King novel references as that was a nice touch as he’s my all-time favorite author. Besides all that, I did feel this novel could have been trimmed down just a bit more as some of the dialogue and situations were a bit repetitive. It starts slow, builds up nicely, then starts to level out as I kept waiting for more horror and big events to happen. Once they eventually did, I felt it took a bit too long to get there.  
  
The different layers to the overall story arc were all brilliantly written. I enjoyed how the chapters kept going back and forth from the past to the present with major events happening and then reading about what happened to fill in the important gaps. Again, it’s extremely hard to write this in a way that doesn’t feel confusing or annoying. I give much respect to Due for writing this to where it just all makes sense, especially with a wild, tension-filled ending that was fantastic.  
  
Overall, I give “The Good House” a 4/5. It’s a memorable horror novel with the only knock on it being I felt this could have probably been cut by 100 pages and still delivered an amazing reading experience. Either way, I genuinely enjoyed it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a good haunted house novel with a voodoo twist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bezjz1/the_good_house_is_one_of_the_most_original/,2024-03-14 23:33:24,3,34,books
hk3opr,The /r/books Best Books of the Decade - Results,"Hello everyone,

First off we would like to thank everyone who participated, by either nominating and/or voting, in our Best of the Decade Vote. Below you will find the top 3 voted on books in every category. I would, however, recommend you also check out the nomination threads as quite a few great books are mentioned in there.

**Best Science Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ft7kaj/best_science_fiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *The Three-Body Problem* by Liu Cixin - nominated by /u/Speaker4theRest

>Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.

2nd place: *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin - nominated by /u/sSlipperyPickle

>This is the way the world ends. Again.  
>  
>Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  
>  
>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/Aglance

>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.  
>  
>Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.  
>  
>After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first.But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

**Best Debut of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fxcbo7/best_debut_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi - nominated by /u/okiegirl22

>Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of *Homegoing* follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, *Homegoing* makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.

2nd place: *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/baddspellar

>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. By all rights their paths should never cross, but Achilles takes the shamed prince as his friend, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.  
>  
>Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/TheItalianDream

**Best Literary and General Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g2186t/best_literary_and_general_fiction_of_the_decade/)

**1st place:** *Circe* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/honeyiamsorry

>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  
>  
>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.  
>  
>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

2nd place: *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante - nominated by /u/SinoJesuitConspiracy

>My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.

3rd place: *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara - nominated by /u/Scurvy_Dogwood

>When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition.

>  
>Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

**Best Mystery or Thriller of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g684bn/best_mystery_or_thriller_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Gone Girl* by Gillain Flynn - nominated by /u/johnnywash1

>Marriage can be a real killer.On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife?

>Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students—a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.Not much later, Jake’s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958.

So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.

3rd place: *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton - nominated by /u/mercutio_died

>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.

**Best Short Story Collection of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gag0qp/best_short_story_collection_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Tenth of December* by George Saunders - nominated by /u/rjbman

>In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of *Tenth of December* are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.

2nd place: *Exhalation: Stories* by Ted Chiang - nominated by /u/amyousness

>This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate,"" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ""Exhalation,"" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""  
>  
>In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

3rd place: *Homesick for Another World* by Ottessa Moshfegh - nominated by /u/ApollosCrow

>There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. *Homesick for Another World* is a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and *Homesick for Another World* is her *Everything That Rises Must Converge* or *A Good Man is Hard to Find*. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources, and the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp. The needle hits the vein before we even feel the prick.

**Best Horror of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ger39o/best_horror_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer - nominated by /u/Bennings463

>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In *Annihilation*, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's *Southern Reach Trilogy*, we join the twelfth expedition.  
>  
>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

2nd place: *The Fisherman* by John Langan - nominated by /u/ifthisisausername

>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman's Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.

3rd place: *My Best Friend's Exorcism* by Grady Hendrix - nominated by /u/leowr

>Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since fifth grade, when they bonded over a shared love of E.T., roller-skating parties, and scratch-and-sniff stickers. But when they arrive at high school, things change. Gretchen begins to act….different. And as the strange coincidences and bizarre behavior start to pile up, Abby realizes there’s only one possible explanation: Gretchen, her favorite person in the world, has a demon living inside her. And Abby is not about to let anyone or anything come between her and her best friend. With help from some unlikely allies, Abby embarks on a quest to save Gretchen. But is their friendship powerful enough to beat the devil?

>  
>But on the day that life begins, would he even notice? Does it start at 21 when he meets the girl of his dreams? Or at 11, when he has his first kiss? Is it later in his life when his first son is born? Or earlier when he might have found his voice as a writer?  
>  
>Each day in Brás's life is like a page from a book. Each one reveals the people and things who have made him who he is: his mother and father, his child and his best friend, his first love and the love of his life. And like all great stories, each day has a twist he'll never see coming...

When Karen’s investigation takes us back to Anka’s life in Nazi Germany, the reader discovers how the personal, the political, the past, and the present converge.

Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

>The Tower of Babel is the greatest marvel in the world. Immense as a mountain, the ancient Tower holds unnumbered ringdoms, warring and peaceful, stacked one on the other like the layers of a cake. It is a world of geniuses and tyrants, of airships and steam engines, of unusual animals and mysterious machines.

>Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.  
>  
>Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.

**Best Non-Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0jyb8/best_nonfiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman - nominated by /u/TriangleTingles

>In the highly anticipated *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.  
>  
>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will transform the way you think about thinking.

2nd place: *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI* by David Grann - nominated by /u/GanymedeBlu35

>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.  
>  
>Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.  
>  
>In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.  
>  
>A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.

3rd place: *Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup* by John Carreyrou - nominated by /u/Flashy-Band

>The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.  
>  
>In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ""unicorn"" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.  
>  
>For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at *The Wall Street Journal,* got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the *Journal* were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.

I have returned to the world of Osten Ard, first introduced in the now impossibly ancient days of the late 1980s, in THE DRAGONBONE, first book of the ""Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn"" series (also known as, “Those really, really, REALLY long books by that Williams guy.”)  Just published is a short introductory novel — really a bridge between the end of the first series and some of the characters who will appear in the new books — the slender volume, THE HEART OF WHAT WAS LOST (http://www.tadwilliams.com/2017/01/the-heart-of-what-was-lost-first-reviews/) which will be followed by THE WITCHWOOD CROWN (a more typical Tad shelf-buster) in June.  The entire series will be called “The Last King Of Osten Ard”, because that’s what fantasy fiction needs — MORE LONG TITLES.
 
(I also thought about calling the first books “Osten Ard Classic” and the current series “New Osten Ard” or even “Osten Ard Zero”, until various soft drink company lawsuits got in the way.  Killjoys.)
 
I will be answering questions about the original series AND the new books live on Friday, January 27th, 2017 at 2:30 PM ET / 11:30 AM PT.   Feel free to leave a question or subpoena for me ahead of time, or to join me online.

ofu01f,"I just read 22 books over 8 weeks, while being stationed in the bush of Alaska. Here are some quick reviews and recommendations!","For context, my job was working a sonar count on the Copper river for the sockeye salmon, and I had plenty of free time when I wasn't actively counting. After all, I was 40mi away from the nearest town, had very little cell connection, and the field site was boat/air access only.

I had friends give me recommendations, and here is what I ended up reading on a kindle. Hope you enjoy or find something you like!

**Digging Up Mother - Doug Stanhope**

A fantastically entertaining autobiography, if you're able to handle and sometimes laugh at squeamish to downright ugly stories. It's a great mix of the coming up of comedian Doug Stanhope, and an explanation of why he is how he is due to his mother and upbringing, in the face of her death. Haven't set down a book briefly to have a good laugh like I have at this one in a while. It gets dark but it's worth it. 9/10

**The Fellowship of the Ring - Tolkien**

Great book. People were right about Tolkiens tendency to give context in terms of names and places and such that are only delved into in other books, and sometimes those sections can draw on long. The songs he made up, while often clever, don't really seem important to me. However the rest of the plot of the book and character development was great, as a first time reader who knew the movies well. I enjoyed seeing the differences between the book and what was cut out of the movie. 8/10

**Educated - Tara Westover**

Holy cow. This book is insane. I have never had to legitimately throw a book down and take a breather, holding my hands to my face often. Tara has an incredible story and it is amazing to see someone come out of the depths she did, while being able to recreate exactly how she felt and why she acted as she did in the moment (aided by journals as well as stories from her family and friends). Additionally, it gave me an insight into the psychology of women or children who dont leave a situation that is obviously terrible, abusive, destructive, etc. It shows at least a couple ways of how they might rationalize it and force themselves to stick through it. I think this is very valuable knowledge for anybody to have. 10/10

**The Two Towers - Tolkien** 

Fewer songs than Fellowship! Much of the same feelings as how I reviewed the first book. Enjoyed it, good character development, exciting plot. However I did find it interesting how the book is split straight down the middle with one group taking on Saruman and all the doings to get to that point. Then the next half is just frodo, Sam, and gollum. I feel like I enjoyed the movies version of this more, with side by side scenes leading to one huge climax at the end, rather than the books which has a climax in the middle and a small one at the end. 8.5/10

**The Fifth Science - Exurb1a**

If you're into science fiction and existentialism, and haven't read this, you need to get on it. Or if you're a fan of Ray Bradbury. Similar to bradburys collection of short stories in ""R is for Rocket"" this collection of short stories is an incredibly creative look at space and the future, and how it relates to humans, our purpose, and ethics. lots of fun little stories, a couple longer ones, and a very strong ability of the author to move through time in a believable way. 9/10

**A Sand County Almanac - Aldo Leopold**

I had been told about this book many times during my environmental management bachelor's degree. It was fascinating to read a book from the 30s/40s written by one of the earliest conservationists, and see how much was similar to today. Many of the same issues, including politics, economics, education, etc and how they harm natural resources. He made predictions too, so seeing what has and hasn't happened was interesting. Could've done without most of the first half of the book - very well written natural descriptions and experiences in nature but seemed a bit like it's purpose was to make a reader that isn't familiar with conservation understand why it's worth fighting for. Cool stuff but I personally didn't need it. 8/10

**Annihilation - Jeff Vandermeer**

Very interesting plot and setting, was very able to picture what the author was writing, so props to him. Creative ideas. But the main character was pretty shallow, as well as being annoying enough when it delved into her personal life that I didn't really care what happened to her at the end. Also the author is pretty ham fisted in creating tension or suspense/foreboding something to happen. 7/10

**The Return of the King - Tolkien**

Again the separation of this book into the main battles and Frodo/Sam was interesting but I think better done than the last book. I felt like Gimli and legolas didn't get along quite as well as in the movies. And there's a significant part of the book after the final main battle with saurons army, which never got into the movies... Perhaps because it's pretty anti-human. These books weren't the massive undertaking I thought they would be. 8/10

**Marching Powder - Rusty Young and Thomas McFadden**

Author did an incredible job telling the story from Thomas's perspective. They mustve been really close and working together closely. Dude experience hell and heaven in one of the weirdest prisons ever. As a tourist, I hope to experience something like what happened at San Pedro... Something special, brief, first starts just as recommendations at a hostel and then big enough that lonely planet picks up on it and a year or two later it's gone. 9/10

Hell I'd even consider doing coke with Thomas if I visited him and took his tour. 

**Naked Lunch - William Burroughs**

... What? 

**The Soul of an Octopus - Sy Montgomery**

I love octopuses and Marine life, so this was a solid mix of science and storytelling. I'll admit I have had an interesting resume, but the author here is on another level. So many adventures and experiences and it helps her add details and context to the wonders that are octopus. 8/10

**The Chain - Adrian McKinty**

Finished it within half a day right after I finished naked lunch. Thrilling thriller. Very creative plot. Mostly believable characters. Solid twist at the end. Decent foretelling. 8.5/10

**The Snow Child - Eowyn Ivey**

Wow. Such a great book, very good characters and such great descriptions of rural alaska homesteading. Very easy to picture it all. Also an important one to take in context of the time period it's set in. 9/10

**The Prince of Milk - Exurb1a**

A definite departure from what I was used to with the Fifth Science by same author, but not totally... Lots of similar themes and a well constructed story, mixing time travel, futures higher beings, and existentialism with great characters. If you're a Sci fi fan I highly recommend it. 8/10

**Anxious People - Fredrick Bachman**

One of the two best books I've read so far in this hitch. So well written. Usually not a fan of crime thrillers but this was so fantastically done. Made me laugh out loud and be close to tears the next chapter. Some great wisdom and experience here in the writing. Touching.
9.5/10

**Prayers for the Stolen - Jennifer Clement**

I'm the guy who sits in a brewery alone and reads alone. This book was recommended to me by a pretty girl who sat next to me at a Taproom in rural coastal CA  and talked with me about books. The book was ok, dark material (kidnappings in drug gang Mexico) obviously, but glad I read it. Can't say it really grabbed me, but it was a quick read. Also I couldn't tell if it was an autobiography or fiction, and I think I'll leave it that way. 7.5/10

**The Starless Sea - Erin Morgenstern**

Well it was fantastically written, and I loved stepping back for a few seconds after reading a new chapter and making definite and potential connections within the story. Would be a great book to reread, if only to figure it out more and understand the ending more... Which still felt... Rushed? Or wasn't setup properly, I was often confused. I already finished it while very sleepy. 8.5/10

**The Buried Giant - Kazuo Ishiguro**

So many twists and turns, reveals, this book was almost like a thriller. Using a trick of characters having poor memory to slowly hint at developments when memories come back worked great. Crazy juxtaposition of orcs and dragons and people praying to Jesus. Very unique, great book. 8.5/10

**I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream - Harlan Ellison**

Pretty solid, short collection. Downloaded for the title story and the rest of them were good too, slightly unsettling, and an interesting writing style to convey action. A nice read for a dark evening. 8/10

**City of Thieves - David Beniov**

Having been to st Petersburg in person, it was incredible just to read more of the history and recognize some of the names. But the plot of the book and the stories were incredible, and based on truth. Such strong characters, would highly recommend this if you have any interest in coming of age novels, history, ww2, Russia, etc. 9/10

**Cadillac Desert - Marc Reisner**

One of the reviews on the book labels says that this should be required reading if you live west of Nebraska. I wholeheartedly agree. I'd always heard about it while studying for my environmental science degree, finally got around to it. It's a long book, but the author has such a well researched grasp on context, history, politics and major players in environmental and water changes during the west being won. And at some points even makes it exciting. Worth the read. 8.5/10

**The Indifferent Stars Above - Daniel James Brown**

Well researched and makes an almost novel out of the very real Donner party disaster. It's one of those books where one thing after another keeps going wrong, it's a miracle anyone survived at all. I've been in that area too so being able to imagine the area helped a lot. 8/10

10ari8,Somebody once said that every author basically writes the same book over and over again. Do you think this is true?,"Basically, the idea is that every author reformulates the same themes and concepts into different narratives with different characters and outcomes. The books seem different, but they're all essentially wrestling with the same issues.

For example, Hemingway. Isn't every book about finding a way to be an honorable man in the face of fear and failure and cowardice?

Or Fitzgerald. Isn't every book about striving towards some ideal that wealth and prestige seem to offer but never quite deliver?

Or Stephen King. Isn't every book about how the grim mundanities of life conceal a deeper, perhaps bottomless horror, but that faith and bravery and sometimes overcome this horror?

d88hr7,"If you could only read the works of five authors for the rest of your life, who would it be and why?","I've been thinking a lot about rereading books (especially old favorites) and a thought experiment, of sorts, came to me. Here's the game: You can only read the complete body of work of only 5 authors forever. You may want to take into account factors like which authors are you willing to give up, reread-ability of the novels, size of their body of work, and so on. Who do you go with?

Personally, I would go choose...

(1) Franz Kafka, because no one else gets me like he does. His ideas and stories cut deep without you noticing and before long a simple short story of his that has no basis in reality or reason can leave you feeling like everything is futile. Also, ""The Castle"" is my favorite book of all time -- I felt lonely, lost and depressed while reading it but that is usually my default so it felt like I was reading myself. It was also very very funny, which I loved. I can't imagine never rereading ""The Castle"" or any of his other stories. Only three novels, but so worth it.

(2) Marcel Proust, because of the absolute beauty of his prose and the magnificent introspection of his characters. He is absolutely unmatched, and the day I finally finish all of ""In Search of Lost Time"" may be the day ""The Castle"" takes second place. I won't say any more because any praise I have will pale in comparison to any sentence he could write.

(3) Kazuo Ishiguro, because he's an absolute master at subtlety and emotion. I adore ""Never Let Me Go"" and Kathy and Tommy and Ruth and they kept me company again ( it was a small reread) during my law exams when I was near the point of breaking down. I also absolutely loved ""A Pale View of Hills"" and when I went into theories after reading it, I loved it even more. Oddly enough, I still haven't read ""The Remains of the Day"", but I'll get there. I must pace myself. He only has 8 books out and no word on a new book yet.

(4) Haruki Murakami, because he's feels close to Kafka in spirit yet also distinct in his own way. His prose reads so smoothly and honestly, I could read anything by him and still fall under his spell. ""Norwegian Wood"" is absolutely amazing reminiscent of ""Never Let Me Go"" (whatever their souls are made of, these two books are the same) and to this day, I'm grateful to my college mate who suggested I read that one first. I haven't stopped yet! Also, he has like 20-something books so that's also a plus.

(5) Stephen King, because he does phenomenal character work and has intensely amazing plots. When you read books like ""Misery"" or ""Carrie"", the characters come alive and are so believable that they just linger long after the book is placed back on the shelf. Not to mention the fact that ""11/22/63"" is one of the best time travel stories I've ever consumed (second only to 'Back to the Future') with a great hidden romance and I absolutely need to reread it soon. It also helps my 5 author-limit that King has written somewhere around 60-odd books for me to read. By the time I finish reading everything, I'd have forgotten enough that it's time to REREAD EVERYTHING.

8m6d3i,"In your experience, what books have most pulled you into the world within the story, so to speak?","I haven't experienced this effect from reading as intensely as I did in childhood, but I remember in high school or so Stephen King's novels made me feel for a bit like I was living in the stories while I was reading. When I was in grade school, ""The Little Vampire"" series felt that way to me too. 

I think ""The Master and Margarita"" had this effect on me most recently, when I wasn't reading it I felt anxious to re-enter the landscape of the story. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8m6d3i/in_your_experience_what_books_have_most_pulled/,2018-05-26 00:15:07,55,19,books
24ehn5,Who is the best storyteller alive right now? (more details in description),"To me, there is an enormous difference between a great writer and a great storyteller. A great writer knows the ins and outs of grammar, can form sentences in vastly varying (and creative) ways, has a large vocabulary, and essentially just knows how to write well. A great storyteller knows how to craft a tale in such a way that enthralls, grips, and transports the reader into a totally different setting and mindset. A great storyteller also knows exactly how to create great plots and ""real"" characters, and how to invoke strong emotions from his/her readers. 

The problem is, many people are great writers and poor storytellers (usually, it isn't vice versa in this case; you don't often get great storytellers who can't write well). An example, in my opinion, of a great writer but poor storyteller is Tolkien (although that's not the debate I'm trying to raise, so don't attack me for saying that). 

The best case scenario is when a person is a great writer and a great storyteller; this is what I call a true author. 

I think that the best (or one of the best) storytellers alive today is Stephen King. He comes up with fantastic, creative stories and he delivers them in such a way that has entertained and enlightened readers all around the world. His mastery of suspense is exceeded by very few (if anybody at all) and he is extremely prolific (one aspect of a great storyteller is someone who loves telling stories, and it's evident from his 60-odd book and 200-some short stories that he is one of these people). King, aside from telling great stories, also teaches valuable lessons/explores important topics within his books (Carrie is an example of this, as he goes in depth about bullying; or perhaps The Shining, in which he explores alcoholism). His knack for telling stories and his understanding of the trends/flaws of human nature and being able to insert them into his books for reflection are what make him one of the greatest storytellers alive today, if not of all time. 

That's just my opinion, of course. What's yours? (If you've read this far, thanks!!)

1nwezf,Neuromancer - What's the big deal?,"I love to read. I mean, I'm here on r/books, lurking everyday, reading about what people enjoy reading. Should be proof enough, right?

The past few years I've been trying to branch out, literarily. I've tackled Stephen King's Dark Tower, Frank Herbert's Dune, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, the Kingkiller Chronicle (why aren't you finished yet Rothfuss?!), most of Brandon Sanderson's work, and much of Terry Pratchett, David Farland, Jim Butcher, Neil Gaiman, Ernest Cline, and Douglas Adams,. That's mostly fantasy, and I wanted to try something new. 

Every time I've heard anyone talk about Neuromancer, they gush. Just read it, they say. Incredible, they say. I'm about a third of the way through the book, and I'm *just not into it.* I find a lot of the imagery confusing, and I'm having a difficult time forming a mental image of what's going on. Maybe it's the lingo? I'm going to finish reading it, regardless, but I was wondering if there was anything particular that people were drawn to. I know it's a different genre (sci-fi/cyberpunk) so maybe I'm focused on the wrong things... 

Could anyone tell me what they loved about the book, specifically? Just wanting to find the buried gold, as it were, because I'm trying to dig yet I'm coming up with nothing.

I'll admit, the first line of the book was amazing, though. I think I sat there for two minutes just appreciating how great of a line that was.

1430b1f,Has there ever been a series of books telling the same continuing story but in completely different genres between installments?,"I know that authors typically each have their own genres and niches. But I was wondering if there exists any series of books where the genre is not consistent between releases. If there's not, do you think it would be possible for a well known author to make it work? 

For example: lets say an author starts off with a YA dystopian novel. But it's followed up with a political thriller, following the same characters, but following all the tropes and conventions of political thrillers. Then followed by a romantic comedy, continuing the story, following the same characters, but following romcom conventions. Then followed by... etc. 

This sounds like a really fun idea, but I could see why it wouldn't work. (readers wanting to read only the types of stories they like) The only way I'd imagine this having any sort of success would be if it was done by an already successful author with fans willing to read whatever they released. Like a Stephen King embarking on such a project for instance.

1bpxs0c,The Word for Human is Violence: My review of Ursula K. Le Guin's 'The Word for World is Forest'.,"**The Word for Human is Violence**

*Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Word for World is Forest (1972) examines whether violence is human nature or not.*

Humans and killing go together like Subarus and Colorado. We kill one another with such frequency that we’ve developed cute little names for all the different kinds—genocide, xenocide, fratricide, regicide, etc. And we can’t forget about the world’s favorite pasttime: war. War for resources, conquest, religion, independence, or glory is so synonymous with human history that it seems no fantasy or sci-fi story can exist without it. We simply can’t get enough of killing each other!

> “Killing is the sweetest thing there is”
> — Sandor Clegane in A Clash of Kings by George RR Martin

But why do we kill? Is it hard-wired into our brain, as some research suggests? And why do some of us kill with propensity while most of us are sickened at the thought? Would those of us who find the act morally repugnant have a change of heart if we lived in the Middle Ages, or Ancient Hawaii, when war and killing ran rampant? Would we discover a deeply-repressed lust for killing if given the chance?

I don’t have the answers to these questions, obviously, but I think about them often, as do many of my favorite stories.

The Word for World is Forest (1972) was written at the height of American involvement in Vietnam, when Ursula K. Le Guin, living in London, had no outlet other than writing for her ethical and politcal opinions (in America, she would organize and participant in nonviolent protests). Le Guin wrote in her introduction, “1968 was a bitter year for those who opposed the war. The lies and hypocrisies redoubled: so did the killing. Moreover, it was becoming clear that the ethic which approved the defoliation of forests and grainlands and the murder of noncombatants in the name of “peace” was only a corollary of the ethic which permits the despoliation of natural resources for private profit or the GNP, and the murder of the creatures of the Earth in the name of ‘man’”.

> “I never wrote a story more easily, fluently, surely—and with less pleasure.”
> — Ursula K. Le Guin

While the Vietnam War is important context, paralleled in the story by the use of “firejelly” (napalm), guerilla warfare, and deforestation, it would be a crime to reduce The Word for World is Forest to an anti-Vietnam protest. The novella draws on countless indigenous genocides and oppressed cultures and histories, such as Aboriginal Australian ‘dreamtime’, and further serves as a larger commentary on colonialism and the patterns of ecological destruction that have quickly become the greatest threat facing the modern human race.

The Word for World is Forest asks a simple question which Le Guin unpacks with nuanced complexity over a snappy 170 pages: What happens when violent human colonizers clash with a pacifist, peaceful native people?

Le Guin’s story takes place in a future universe in which humans have colonized a large number of planets, including Earth (known as Terra). Their latest colonization project takes place on what they call New Tahiti, though its native name is Athshe. Terra is described by Captain Davidson—a vile man who rapes and enslaves the natives, whom he calls “creechies”, and sees himself as the epitome of human progress—as a “tamed planet”, where “New Tahiti wasn’t"". And that’s why Davidson is on New Tahiti: to tame it. Because Terra’s resources have been depleted by this taming, they have invaded Athshe, and are in the process of clearing vast swaths of forest for their lumber, which is sent back to Terra where it is more valuable than gold.

Davidson, a representation of everything wrong with the colonial mindset, incites the story by raping and murdering the wife of Selver, the main native Ashthean protagonist.

Selver aptly realizes that the ‘yumens’ won’t stop their conquest and violence, and decides to take a page out of their book, launching a full-scale guerilla attack campaign and killing thousands of humans in the process, including all their women.

I’ll spare any further details for the sake of spoilers, but the important thing to note is that the Terrans have induced damage that cannot be undone. They introduced violence and killing to a people that did not know it. At the end of the book, we get a confrontation between Selver and Davidson that speaks to this.

> “We’re both gods, you and I. You’re an insane one, and I’m not sure whether I’m sane or not. But we are gods. There will never be another meeting in the forest like this meeting now between us. You gave me a gift, the killing of one’s kind, murder. Now, as well as I can, I give you my people’s gift, which is not killing. I think we find each other’s gift heavy to carry. However, we must carry it alone.”
> — Selver, to Davidson

So, back to the question I posed at the start of this post: Are humans innately violent?

The already complex question is driven to further complexity by the definition of a ‘human’. In The Word for World is Forest, the native Athsheans see the Terrans as the same species—human—but the Terrans do not see the Athsheans as human. They are lesser-than in every way: shorter, covered in fur, uncivilized, lazy, and with customs that appear innately unhuman.

Of course, this rhetoric has been used for thousands of years to oppress indigenous and non-white humans, and likely, the “creechies” are a metaphor for this oppression. But I was also struck by another similar line of thinking that illustrates our incessant need for superiority over the ‘other’—Neanderthals.

We discover from Mr. Or, an offworld visitor on a separate mission, that indeed, the Athsheans are human, much in the same way that Neanderthals are human—only a sub-species of Homo sapiens, adapted to their environment with stocky build and hairy skin. Many of us think of Neanderthals as less advanced, hunched, savage brutes who went extinct because of their inferiority to humans. But did you know that their brains were as large as ours? Did you know that they painted, made art, fashioned tools from wood and stone, and perhaps even had musical instruments and funeral rites (those last two points are under debate)? Did you know that they crossbred with Homo s. sapiens? Did you know that they stood as upright as us; the hunched posture is a common misconception drawn from Neanderthal remains that likely had osteoporosis.

If we are to accept, then, that the native Athsheans are human, what does that tell us about violence? Will the Athsheans reclaim their peaceful ways now that humans have introduced murder, rape, and enslavement? This question is left ambiguous, but it would seem unlikely.

> “Sometimes a god (Davidson) comes. He brings a new way to do a thing, or a new thing to be done. A new kind of singing, or a new kind of death. He brings this across the bridge between the dream-time and the world-time. When he has done this, it is done. You cannot take things that exist in the world and try to drive them back into the dream, to hold them inside the dream with walls and pretenses. That is insanity. What is, is. There is no use pretending, now, that we do not know how to kill one another.”
> — Selver, to Lyubov

I quite liked Sean Gyunes summation of Le Guin’s message in his Reactor Magazine article: “All of this is Le Guin’s way of saying, perhaps, that colonialism cannot be undone—its effects linger in the heart, in the culture, in the soil and forest, in the stories a people have to tell and the songs they sing. Lyubov puts it this way: colonization brought Death out of the dream-time and into the world-time, unleashing new possibilities for violence, retaliation, and meaning-making. What is real cannot become unreal; what walks the world cannot return to dreaming.”

The United States has an illustrious history of oppression and war—whether direct, like our military involvment in Vietnam, or indirect, like our current military support of Israel. We are not the freedom-loving image that we portray. We are oppressors, we are violent, we are powerful, we are driven by greed and perceived supieriority. We are a land of immigrants that rejects and demeans them.

> “Some people say the military breeds killing machines. I say it is only the finishing training”
> — John Musgrave, US Marine in Vietnam War (paraphrased)

Our culture of war and violence may or may not be avoidable. It’s hard to imagine isolated societies, such as those in pre-contact Polynesia, independently developing rich histories of warfare without some innate desire for violence.

On the other hand, pacifist societies indeed exist, and we as humans have a responsiblity to strive towards this ideal and to right our wrongs—past, present, and future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bpxs0c/the_word_for_human_is_violence_my_review_of/,2024-03-28 15:03:58,42,85,books

I have started reading more often this school year - Stephen King novels, specifically - but “The Secret History” (which is 559 pages) is the longest novel I have read to date. It was a page turner - I will admit that I was partly motivated to finish it so quickly due to the fact that the date of the book club meeting was approaching, but I also found it to be one of the first books I’ve enjoyed in a long while. It reminded me of The Great Gatsby, and of “The Stranger” by Albert Camus (I suppose that I can’t explain how and why it reminds me of the latter book without spoiling it.) I found it to be well written and actually learned new vocabulary terms along the way. Reading it has given me the push to go to the library this weekend, and obtain a new library card. I have not used my library card in 7 years.

bt9lal,Reading the classics has helped me rediscover my love of reading,"I was a voracious reader in my youth, I never counted but I would probably get through about 15 books a year during my high school years

Now as a busy adult I tried to get back into the habit. I searched online for the best books, headed to my local bookshop and picked up various novels. 

I tried them but found I just couldn't get in to them. I got to various points in The Way of Kings, Ready Player One, The Dark Tower book 1, and Mistborn before giving up

I'm not sure why I couldn't get into them but I found the writing was just really bad. I think it also didn't help that I was reading books I thought I was *supposed* to read instead of just reading what I wanted

I went back to the internet and found lists of some older, critically acclaimed books, ""classics"" if you will. And let me tell you, this has sparked an interest in reading I haven't felt since high school.

In the past few months I've got through The Great Gatsby, Count of Monte Cristo, Ulysses, Crime and Punishment, A Tale of Two Cities and A Picture of Dorian Gray

I had some trepidation as I'd heard they were too stuffy and boring to read nowadays but the writing in those books is absolutely beautiful and they carried incredibly profound insights into the human condition that made me feel like I was almost a new person, with a new view of the world

I guess what I'm trying to say is it's important to just read what you want. There will always be snobs telling you not to read a book because it's too old fashioned and not ""cool"" but this kind of elitist and pretentious attitude is only going to turn you away from books you might potentially enjoy!

16s4vsn,"Finally finished ""The First Law"". Profoundly disappointed.","**(Obviously there will be story spoilers below)**

As I understand it, the First Law trilogy is widely regarded as an incredible trilogy through which fantasy tropes are turned on their heads, where everything you see is not as it seems, and everything you least expect is what happens. The noble swordsman is a selfish prick. The main female lead is not soft and kind, but rather a feral and vicious warrior with no mercy. The once war-hero is now a cripple of a man, and a sadist. The wisely wizard turns out to be the worst of them all. And the most reasonable of them is a split-personality barbarian who's as likely at times to kill his friends as his enemies.

I want to open by saying the prose itself is actually written well, and I had a lot of enjoyment over the incredible spars of dialogue and inner monologue characters had with each other and themselves. Abercrombie is exceptionally clever when it comes to games of wits between characters, and reading those bits throughout the books were always where I had the most enjoyment.

**But.**

Where the books fall apart for me is the story and its development. In the beginning, we're given a set of characters and the establishment of the general plot; the Union is threatened by the south, bad guy Bethod in the north is also making trouble, and the wizard wants to get some people together to stop it somehow. Cool.

But there's very little to actually *move* the plot. The first book ends without any kind of proper conclusion, the second book is an entire waste of the characters' time as it results in nothing more than a goose chase. By the time we get to the third book, we finally see where things are going—but it's only to destroy any ounce of development for their arc these characters have had:

• Jezal starts as a selfish prick with talent for swords, he ends as a puppet king who leaves Ardee behind and is married to a lesbian queen who hates him for being a commoner, and is ultimately, as Bayaz says, a coward

• Logen is initially portrayed as a reasonable man prone to bouts of rage and bloodlust. He ends as a worse and slightly less reasonable man prone to bouts of rage and bloodlust after giving up on self-improvement and being betrayed by someone he once called a friend

• Glokta goes from intermittently wondering why he tortures people to fully abandoning his mercy and enjoying the torment of others, as well as raping Terez by proxy by forcing her to fuck Jezal and become pregnant with four children or he'll torture her childhood friend and lover endlessly

• Ferro, a feral and vicious woman with no mercy, stays a feral and vicious woman who, in addition to still having no mercy, now seems to need some flex-tape for the holes in her brain to keep the fuckin' demons from gettin' out

• Bayaz, already a warped trope as a grounded wizard with a short temper and little patience, ends up being fantasy-hitler and nuking an entire city, as well as being just as bad if not worse than Khalul

• West, who was the only one who seemed (in spite of his faults) to actually be going somewhere with his arc, gets magic cancer

Not one character ends up better than they started out. Not in a literal ""well hey, they live in a bigger palace/have a better job"" way, but in a manner of character development. All of them actually *regress* as characters, aside from *maybe* Jezal who, for as little development as he gets, is unable to act on any of it without the threat of Bayaz coming back and curb-stomping his teeth in.

How is this some pinnacle of fantastic writing? People seem to praise its message that sometimes there is no hope and things are terrible regardless. But to me, the message that ""bad shit happens to good people, good shit happens to bad people, everything sucks and no one can do anything about it, so stop trying, fuck you"" isn't some intellectually profound revelation, that's just something pretty much everyone has already taken for granted about the real world.

Not to mention, that kind of writing/message is unbearably boring if, like me, you're waiting for an actual *plot* to happen rather than reading about people and their misfortunes for thousands of pages so the book can beat you over the head with the idea of ""stop expecting anything good to happen to anyone who deserves it"". If I want to consume media about needless and mindless suffering, I'll throw on a Saw film. If you know everyone is going to end up worse than where they started, it takes out any kind of stakes or investment for me because I'll simply stop caring about the characters—which is exactly what happened after about the first couple hundred pages I read of the third book.

And after all of this, I still don't know what exactly the other side *is,* what the demons do or want other than coming into the real world, what relevance the shanka had to the story other than being used as Bethod's fodder, how the fuck ""the Art"" even works or how non-magi like Caurib get to learn/use it, and a dozen other little things that I doubt I'll get the answer to because the end of ""The Last Argument of Kings"" has put such a bad taste in my mouth that I have zero desire to read anything else of the series/world.

Am I missing something important? Happy to discuss and hopefully be persuaded that I've got it wrong, because I really don't want to think that the whole trilogy amounted to essentially ""the bad guy wins, everyone sucks, GG.""

51fey5,"The Passage by Justin Cronin - still reading, but WOW, what a surprising, entertaining book.","*Note:  I'm a little less than halfway through the book, so please no spoilers past what I talk about below (first 300 pages or so).  I just needed an outlet to express how much fun and great this book is.*

I was recommended The Passage by Justin Cronin by a friend last week.  He told me to go into completely blind, dont look it up or anything.  The only thing he told me was that it's a recently finished trilogy and that I would love it.

I literally knew nothing else about the book (he even gave me his copy without the dust cover so there was no flap summary or anything).  I started it four days ago, and holy shit, what a book!  I had no idea what to expect.  I'm only like 300 pages in so far (first book is a little less than 800), but it's been an emotional rollercoaster since the first few pages.

**SPOILERS BELOW FOR APPROX FIRST 300 PAGES**

I tend to find 'monster' books not very good (there are a few exceptions, such as I love Stephen King's IT for example), and tend to avoid them as usually the quality in writing lacks, etc (at least that's my personal opinion).  Especially 'vampire' books (ironically the only other vampire book I ever liked was King's Salem's Lot).   If he told me it was a 'vampire' book before I started, I'm not sure if I would have read it or not. 

But this book just turned everything upside down for me, so far at least.  I was already hooked but once I hit the chapter where Amy went to the zoo with Lacey and the animals went ape-shit over her, I was blown away.

Then when the book took a completely tonal change after the vamps breakout of the labs, I was very impressed how the author was able to completely change the story.. almost like the entire genre changed from a typical thriller/monster book to a apocalyptic sci-fi novel with Wolgast and Amy surviving the world, almost like McCarthy's The Road (which I just read this year too).

And I love the whole spin on the vampire genre.  Somehow, Cronin has managed to make it feel fresh and mysterious.  I absolutely love it.

But the reason I'm writing this right now is because I just got to the part where Wolgast died (NEVER expected that, and I love that I didn't see it coming at all.  It really reminded me of the first time I read Game of Thrones (before the show was out) and Ned's beheading.  Like... did he really just kill the main character?!  Whoa!!

Then, when my mind was already blown, the book jumps about 1000 years into the future (holy SHIT, wtf!?!) after the chapter about the train going from Philly to California, which was an incredible chapter to read, with the fires blazing around the train the entire way and vamps slaughtering most of the train cars.  Absolutely insane.

This is where I stopped for now.  Right after the time jump, and meeting the Jaxons and 'Auntie's' journal.

So as I mentioned at the start, please don't spoil anything past the train from Philly to California chapter.  I really just needed to get it off my chest how crazy this book has been so far and I love that the author seems to be doing what other authors tend to avoid - killing off main characters and then jumping so far in the future that the entire tone/genre of the book seems to be changing.

And to go into this completely blind and knowing nothing was nothing short of awesome.

I really hope the rest of this book and the next two books can keep up this quality of character building, story and writing.  Can't wait to dive back into it after work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/51fey5/the_passage_by_justin_cronin_still_reading_but/,2016-09-06 14:21:16,100,243,books
prbx4a,I just read Niccolo Machiavelli's infamous The Prince and it was... Cold. But also... Good?,"As with many people, I'd often flippantly use the term 'machiavellian' as a euphemism for using immoral methods to get what you want.

But nursing a hangover today I found myself in a bookshop where I saw a copy on the shelf. At under a hundred pages, I hadn't realised how short a book it was. So thought I'd finally edify myself on what 'machiavellianism' was actually all about.

I did a naughty thing and ordered a big slice of cake and read the whole thing in one sitting, in the bookshop (my conscience got the better of me though and I did buy the copy in the end!)

Its short chapter layout, and the English translation I had, made for a suprisingly easy read, especially for books of this time period (15th century).

After a brief, and extremely sycophantic, accompanying letter. One that Machiavelli had penned to Lorenzo de' Medici, the then incumbent ruler of Florence, Italy, he delves into his philosophies on how an effective ruler should govern.

It packed a punch right from the off. Remarking in an early chapter ""in general, you must pamper people, or destroy them"". ""Harm them just a little and they'll hit back"". 

He starts as he means to continue. With an unflinching, but well supported case for the most effective way to govern. Some further reading showed me that in context, Florence had had a turbulent few decades, with a succession of leaders and depositions. So it's understandable that a new ruler would be open to entertaining ideas that would be... For lack of a better word.... Distasteful.

Machiavelli goes on to list the different forms of leadership and monarchies, and the different possible 'leadership styles' available. Citing a myriad of historic examples to back up each claim he makes. From the - at the time - current King of France, to the Romans and Alexander the Great.

He spins a compelling case for pragmatism, over morality or virtue. In perhaps his most controversial chapter ""cruelty and compassion, whether it's better to be loved or feared"". He boldly asserts that ""gratitude is forgotten the moment it is inconvenient. Fear means fear of punishment, and that's something people never forget"". Subliminally (though not so subtly) riling against the prevailing Christian zeitgeist of kindness and compassion. Machievelli concludes ""a sensible man will base his power on what he controls, not on what others have the freedom to choose"". Ultimately favouring cruelty over compassion. 

But there is an important nuance here that is often overlooked when pseudo intellectuals like me throw around the term ""Machiavellianism"" in an effort to sound clever. Machiavelli insists that cruelty must be both proportional and surgically precise in its execution. Emphasizing the importance of ""avoiding contempt and hatred"". His uncomfortable advice is for a ruler to ""keep his hands off his subjects property and women"".  Claiming ""a man will sooner forget the death of his father than the loss of his inheritance"". A point for debate at the very least.

It is also important that Machiavelli clearly states that this quick and decisive 'cruelty', exacted on a few individuals to quash dissent, is to prevent finding oneself in an endless cycle of violence. By leaving conspiracies and sedition unchecked this can (he argues) ultimately lead to more bloodshed. This is not cruelty for cruelty's sake. This is an extreme form of ultilitarianism. Designed to minimise violence in the long run, by inspiring fear and order in the short term. 

In conclusion, it's definitely worth a read. Especially as it's a seminal book you can finish in just a few hours. I wouldn't advise calibrating your moral compass on it. But there are useful nuggets of information, still as relevant today as they were then. Especially when facing the day to day issues of office politics, and social drama. Sometimes the harsh reality is that cold hard pragmatism not only trumps generosity, but can in fact be morally justified in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/prbx4a/i_just_read_niccolo_machiavellis_infamous_the/,2021-09-19 17:05:29,87,1119,books
llb4v4,Who else visualizes characters based on how their name looks on the page?,"My image of what a character looks like is totally different based on whether I'm hearing their name aloud or seeing it printed on the page. The length of a name, the way it's letters play together, or how prominent the font's lettering is can shape what I think a character is like.

For example, when I first read Harry Potter as a kid I always envisioned Hermione as kinda chubby. The length of the name plus the big giant capital 'H' of the font in those books gave me a very different impression of her than the slight, pretty way the name sounds when said out loud. 

It even helps me remember characters. In books that introduce a lot of people all at once and before you've gotten a chance to really know them, I find it much easier to tell them all apart when reading a hard copy rather than listening to an audiobook. Even though a performer may do an excellent job of giving characters distinct voices, as a visual learner it's much easier for me to remember them by the look of their name printed on the page.

Conversely, names with a similar length that start with the same letter might start to blend together. Reading ""Name of the Wind"" and ""Way of Kings"" at the same time was confusing, with 'Kvothe' and 'Kaladin' not only looking somewhat alike, but they have a lot of similar traits. So I found myself sometimes confusing whose backstory belonged to whom!

9hiaza,Which fantasy series has the most intriguing mystery elements?,"I’m a fan of epic fantasy and all the different aspects of it, but I’ve come to realize that what really hooks me in with a new book and keeps me motivated to keep reading is the mystery. Nothing is more likely going to keep me from putting down a book than the burning desire to find out secrets and explore the unknown. 

I really enjoy being kept in the dark, unknowing and then getting teased with subtle hints. There’s nothing worse than when the author tells or answers too much, in my opinion. I like it when new questions spawn at a higher rate than they are being answered. And then seeing the mysteries resolved in a satisfying manner, yet leaving some threads open and questions unanswered. 

My favorites are *ASOIAF* and *The Stormlight Archive*. 

• I'm a major ASOIAF-geek, and it's much because of the mystery element of it. I’ve spent countless hours exploring the unexplained questions, secrets and theories of Westeros. So many youtube videos, podcasts, articles and I’m still dying to find out more. Martin is great at keeping the reader in the dark and he raises more questions than he answers, which creates a lot of mystery. At this point I have hundreds of questions and while I crave the answers, I actually enjoy not knowing at the same time. This is for better or worse, though, especially in this particular case. I mean it would be nice to get some conclusions at some point… Ahem… Seriously though, all the mystery is pretty much what keeps my interest up during the wait. 

• Way of Kings hooked me hard because Brandon set up so many mysteries. Countless questions are raised right at the start. Why was the kings assassination ordered? Who was truly behind it and what was the motive? A crystalline spere that’s completely dark yet glows… What’s that about? *”You must find the most important words a man can say.”* So intriguing! And there are a million more incredibly intriguing mysteries, but I don’t want to spoil. I mean [Possible Spoiler](#s ""Hoid"") alone is enough to keep anyone captivated. Things like Dalinars cryptic visions of the past and weird creepy stuff happening with Shallans paintings… ahh that really scratches my itch. Sanderson is also great at giving answers/conclusions at an appropriate time and in a satisfying way. The last 50 or so pages of WoK is some of my favorite reading ever, with a major revelation or plot twist like every 5 pages. And there is still so much to be revealed in this series. 

I think mystery really is one of the most important aspects of fantasy, or any novel really. Sometimes you find parts of a book to be a bit tedious and then it’s great to have a foundation of underlying mystery to keep suspense at all times and motivation to go on. 

Anyway, what do you think? Which fantasy series has the most intriguing mystery elements and why?

bi3wj7,"Since so many of you asked, I'm the guy who's spent the last 6 years reading NOTHING but science fiction. Here's my top 15 list.","Let me start by saying this is the list of books that \*\*I enjoyed\*\*.  I'm not saying that #1 is better than #10, I'm simply saying I enjoyed it more.   Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads.

&#x200B;

I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well.  Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson.  I have tried to read several cyberpunk authors and simply didn't find them enjoyable, despite the talent that is clearly present in their writings and world building skills.  Oh, and I haven't read the Foundation series, so that's why it's not on here (yet).   


Apologies for not doing a top 25 (or even a top 100 that was requested), I just don't have the time.

&#x200B;

So, without further ado, here are my top 15:

&#x200B;

1. **The Sparrow (Mary Doria Russell)** **-** I addressed this in my previous post, I thought this book was fantastic. The first half is slow, yes, but the second half more than made up for it in my opinion.  A Jesuit priest and his friends discover singing coming from a planet 4-5 light years away.  The Jesuits are the first to be able to mount an expedition to this new planet, and the priest and his friends are the crew selected to lead it.  The story starts with the priest, back on Earth after the trip, and all of humanity wants him dead or imprisoned.  This book gave me a more intense emotional reaction than any book I've ever read.  I literally shouted out loud ""NO NO no no no no no no..."" at one point and had to put it down for the day.
2. **Hyperion Series (Dan Simmons)** \- The Sparrow knocked this out of first place, yes, but I haven't read the sequel to it, so as far as series of books go, this one is at the top bar none.  I preferred the first two books, but the second two were very fun reads as well.  7 people are selected all around the universe to venture into the Time Tombs in a mysterious planet with a violent and murderous monster on it known as the Shrike.  That's all I can say, this story is so sprawling that anything more than that just doesn't do it justice. Just an all around unbelievable experience.
3. **The Stand (Steven King)** \- A virus wipes out 99% of the population, and the survivors have dreams that direct them to either Boulder, CO, where civilization is starting to rebuild (symbolically Heaven), or Las Vegas, which is more a Mad-Max-everyones-killing-each-other-no-laws-type society (symbolically Hell). Whether you consider it science fiction or not, this deserves to make the list.  Loved this one.  I've heard it compared to Swan Song, so I was excited to pick that up, but was ultimately disappointed.  There's no argument to be made for SS being better than The Stand.
4. **I, Robot (Isaac Asimov) -** I picked this book up semi-dreading the read, and just trying to work my way through the classics.  I figured it was one of those classics that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read.  I was dead wrong.  I knew it was going to make a statement about A.I., but I didn't know how entertaining it was going to be.  Every story, every section, every word was also run to read, and the writing style kept my attention from start to finish.
5. **Dune (Frank Herbert) -** No surprise here, it's an absolute classic. Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said.  If you haven't read it, do so immediately.
6. **The Forge of God** **(Greg Bear)** \- An alien lands in the United States, and the only message he can give us before he dies is ""I'm sorry, I'm too late"" or something to that effect.  I love alien contact novels, and this was probably my favorite.  Sprawling, a lot of characters, a lot of viewpoints and different situation.  Huge action, a real page-turner.  This isn't the most philosophical or complex book, but it is a massively fun read. And the end, damn the end was crazy. I could definitely see it being made into a movie, but it doesn't have the feel of a novel written *specifically* to be made into a movie.
7. **The Forever War (Joe Haldeman) -** I believe this was the first military sci-fi book I read.  I didn't know much about military sci-fi and was doubtful that I would like it, especially since it sounded like a parallel of the Vietnam War.  Again, dead wrong. This book has a lot to say, and it says it extremely eloquently.  Humanity is in an interstellar war against the Taurens, and the soldiers who visit home (because of time dilation) visit after huge periods of time, so it's a good take on where humanity will be in 500, 1000, and 10000 years from now. Again, this one was hard to put down.  
8. **Not Alone (Craig Falconer)** \- A lot of you probably haven't heard of this book, I think it's pretty obscure.  Why is it so high up on this list?  Well some of my favorite novels are alien first-contact novels, and my favorite *parts* of those novels are the moments between a group of people finding out about the existence of ETs and whole world finding out about them.  This book is that idea under a magnifying glass. A UFO enthusiast stumbles upon incontrovertible evidence that not only do aliens exist, but that humanity has had contact with them for years.  And what does he do?  He leaks it anonymously on Twitter, which of course leads to a melt down as the world sees the evidence.  Great book, in fact I enjoyed it so much I messaged Craig Falconer on Facebook after I finished it just to tell him what a fun read I thought it was.
9. **The Sirens of Titan (Kurt Vonnegut) -** An interstellar story as only Vonnegut could tell it. My favorite Vonnegut book besides maybe his Welcome to the Monkey House collection of short stories.  If you've never read any Vonnegut, I'd still say it's a great place to start.
10. **Nightfall (Isaac Asimov + Robert Silverberg)** \- Takes place on a planet in a multiple star solar system that never experiences night.  Within even 15 minutes of pure darkness, residents of the planet lose their minds or even die. Scientists on the planet discover that once every 2000 years, there is a total solar eclipse that leave the planet in complete darkness, which matches up with the fact that once every 2000 years their entire civilization completely caves in.  Of course they make this discovery very close to the 2000 year mark.
11. **Old Man's War (John Scalzi) -** Military sci-fi, the elderly can basically get a complete regeneration of their body, restoring them to their 20s, if they agree to fight in an interstellar war.  I'm not making it sound very interesting, but it was a great read.
12. **Childhood's End (Arthur C. Clarke) -** Mmmm love me some Arthur C. Clarke. A peaceful alien invasion happens, with the result being that the aliens will share a technology, etc, if humanity agrees to end all wars, ban slavery, things of that nature.  Humans do, and the results humanity sees within themselves, and the changes the Overlords bring make quite the interesting novel.
13. **Spin (Robert Charles Wilson) -** One night, all the stars go out.  It's discovered that someone or something has put a permeable membrane all around Earth, and no one knows why.  Of course our protagonist dedicates his life to figuring out what's going on.  I particularly liked the ending to this book.  Great read, fun.
14. **Starship Troopers (Robert Heinlein)-** Another military sci fi in the vein of Old Man's War and The Forever War.  I think I read all 3 of these back to back.  They're sort of the heavy hitters of the military sci-fi genre, and I loved everyone one of them.  Other military sci-fi I've tried to read, and they just don't do it for me. 
15. **Footfall (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)** \- Almost forgot this one, but it's about an alien invasion where the aliens aren't *that* far ahead of humans, technologically.  And they show up to our planet expecting us to still be in the stone age, so they're surprised when they see how little time it's taken us to come so far.  Extremely entertaining, and gives viewpoints from both human and alien characters.  The only thing I didn't like was how the aliens supposedly looked.  Like baby elephants, pretty much.

**Honorable Mentions:** Ringworld, Out of the Dark, I am Legend, The Three-Body Problem, War of the Worlds, Rendezvous with Rama, Calculating God, Roadside Picnic, The Puppet Masters

Yes, I'm sure I've forgotten some good ones, be it intentionally or not, I'm writing this over my lunch break.  


Anyway, that's my list.  Hope you enjoyed, and hopefully it gave you some recommendations for future reading.  Feel free to message me for specific recommendations or anything else.


Edit: Yep forgot the Enders Game series, probably should be on there. I read it like 30 times when I was a kid and sometimes forget it’s even science fiction.

Edit2: Since I guess I'm on the front page now, here's a quick edit.  I know I should read the Foundation Series, The Culture series, and Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.  I read before bed a lot and these huge, sprawling space operas can sometimes be a lot after a long day.  And I stand by decision to put Starship Troopers over Stranger in a Strange Land, but I'll allow that both Stranger and Moon is a Harsh Mistress should probably have been an honorable mention.  Also for any of you that read or have read #8, Not Alone, I'd love to know what you think about it.

4z4rkf,Bought a book with spoilers hidden inside the first chapter,"So I bought a book from Barnes and noble. I haven't done so in a long long while, but I'm going to be in the back seat of a car for an even longer while so figured it would be a good time to invest. I ended up getting The Way of Kings since I had heard good things about the series.


As I read through the book I got pulled in quite quickly, I haven't been pulled in like this by a book for a long while. But halfway through the first chapter I noticed something off... Something pink? I thought the book was all black and white? Where did this splash of color come from? I opened the next page to see a sticky note.

I quickly read the note not understanding what it meant and quickly crumpled it up and threw it in between my legs. Not but a bit later did I realize what the note was for. 

Thankfully I don't clearly remember what it says but I got my brother to take a picture of it and upload it to imgur for me.  (No joke.  I just really don't want to read it again.)

1327vlx,Just Finished LOTR for the first time!,"Wow! I literally pulled an all-nighter to finish this. This trilogy was a crazy journey. I felt so immsersed/wrapped up in the narrative, as if I myself was living through the battles, wandering in an enchanted forest with all sorts of creatures. Tolkien's world building is truly something else, and I feel so strange now, back in the ""normal world"" with menial tasks and duties to fulfill, the normal daily hassles.

Little things I loved:

I love the Oliphants and Treebeard. I also love when Bilbo says ""what a pity"" and then he's like ""no, how silly of me"" when Frodo tells him he got rid of the ring lol. I think Bilbo is my favourite character despite his sparse appearances in LOTR as compared to The Hobbit.

I'm super proud of myself for pushing myself put of my comfort zone and trying this book. I felt that it would be way too challenging for my reading level but I always remember: I am reading for fun, for enjoyment, and i don't need to force myself to understand every little detail about every king, every single bit of Shakespearian-type dialogue, every single detail in the appendix. I view it as part of Tolkien's world building, this insane universe he created that I now miss so much. All of the characters that become dear to you as the novel progresses. What a masterpiece. I wish I could resurrect Tolkien from the dead to write a collection of bedtime stories occurring in an enchanted forest. He could also make a good sleep podcast or something imo.

Not sure what I'm rambling about but I am happy/sad/feeling a lot of emotions right now. I've kind of just been staring at the carpet in my room unsure what to do with myself. 

I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts about this book, your reaction to it, how you coped after (lol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1327vlx/just_finished_lotr_for_the_first_time/,2023-04-28 19:50:16,31,102,books
du2r65,"""The Book is Better"" finally fails for me: my review of Stephen King's ""The Shining""","The Shining is hailed as one of the greatest horror novels of all time as well as topping many lists of greatest Stephen King novels.  With Doctor Sleep in theaters, I wanted to finally read the book that I've heard so much about, and holy cow was it one of the most persistently frustrating and disappointing reading experiences of my life.  Without rambling too long, let me just say that I have a great respect for the film but am in no way obsessed with it (I honestly haven't even seen it in at least a decade), but like Danny big-wheeling through the Overlook, I was greeted at every other turn of the novel with something I wish I could unsee.  My primary criticisms of King's novel fall under 2 categories:

#1.  King's characters are not humans.  Jack, Wendy, and Danny are all simultaneously deeply broken and disturbed people *and* the generic leads from every Hallmark made-for-tv movie.  We learn that Jack is a drunk, a child abuser, a man with incredibly violent impulses that beats one of his students within an inch of his life after shaming him publicly, believes that he probably ran over a child during a drunk driving accident, has a disturbing and abusive childhood... but is also simultaneously a loving John Q. Everyman that just wants what's best for his family.  BULLSHIT.  Similar problems plague Wendy, who is supposed to simultaneously be some strong generic doting mother and wife (and a hot blonde), but at the same time a repressed coward that refuses to protect her child from what are clearly physically and emotionally abusive situations, again and again.  Danny has little dimension, but we're supposed to believe that he's constantly experiencing horrific traumatic experiences but somehow virtually unaffected by them, being a brainy every-kid that always stands up to his fears.  Again: bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  King wants to have his cake and eat it too.  I've heard that Kubrick's changes to the characters was King's main gripe with Kubrick's film, but the truth is, if you consider these characters to be real people and peel away the cloying saccharine Hallmark card dressing, you're left with exactly the broken and disturbed people that Kubrick introduces.  The book likewise wants to have Jack go insane based on his own personal issues, but then also wants to exonerate him from all wrong-doing as he's ""magically possessed"" by the Overlook.  Again.  It fundamentally does not work.

#2.  The book is hardly a horror novel.  You know the scariest images from the movie?  The twins in the hall, the bloody elevator, the endless hedge maze... yeah none of that's in the book.  Instead, it is straight up Looney Tunes and impossible to take seriously.  The main reoccurring horror is literally (I'm not kidding) giant magical prancing hedge animals.  Seriously.  The book is really banking on you finding hedge animals utterly terrifying.  And if that doesn't work, it hopes you're spooked by a possessed fire hose.  ... Again.  I'm not kidding.  Also, there's virtually no mystery to the Overlook and its ghosts.  It's all explained, and likewise, Tony is spelled out and not at all a nefarious or eerie presence.  Across the board, it's hardly even a horror novel.  You get one creepy scene with Danny hearing a voice in a tunnel outside and then the scene with the woman in the bath tub and that is it.  For me, the most effectively scary part of the novel was actually just Hallorann driving through a blizzard.  That's the only time that I seriously felt the characters were in danger, because even with Jack in crazy-mode, we don't really get a maniacal axe-wielding psychopath, we get a loving dad possessed by over-explained ghosts and wielding a wood mallet (which is never that threatening, and he never uses to kill anyone).  As a finale to the disappointment, there's a generic countdown-to-explosion moment before the Overlook is blown to pieces, an event that's depicted by having Hallorann (who lives) literally grab Wendy and Danny in his arms and jumps out of the exploding hotel like the ending of a Die Hard movie.

In summary, Stephen King's ""The Shining"" is fine for what it is: a generic Shirley Jackson rip-off made to be complete inoffensive to your grandmother.  At its best, I would say that at least it's well-paced and not-boring, and for how disappointing the ending is, it at least has a structurally climactic nature (which is usually a big criticism of King's work).  But is it one of the greatest horror novels of all time?  Not even remotely.  In fact, to say that it even deserves to be compared to Kubrick's adaptation feels, if anything, incredibly disrespectful to the film, which, from what little I remember, improves upon the book in virtually every way.

Sorry if this is one of your favorite King/horror novels, but my god was I incredibly disappointed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/du2r65/the_book_is_better_finally_fails_for_me_my_review/,2019-11-09 22:23:59,29,7,books
18nbdhr,The Mark of the Horse Lord by Rosemary Sutcliff,"I shared these thoughts on r/Rosemary_Sutcliff earlier and would love to hear from more fans of Rosemary Sutcliff here! And if you are a fan of historical fiction and adventure but haven't read Sutcliff's works, I highly recommend checking them out. Her most famous novels take place in Roman Britain, although she also writes about later eras. Her books are truly captivating and highly engaging reads for both young adults and adults. *The Mark of the Horse Lord* shares many elements of *The Prisoner of Zenda*, but is set in the late 2nd century AD. It has more raw violence and verging-on-graphic detail than previous books I've read by the same author, so I would recommend it for a teenage and older audience, not younger readers.

Overall, I thought *The Mark of the Horse Lord* was very good but not nearly as magical and re-read-worthy as Sutcliff's Dolphin Ring ""trilogy"" (*The Eagle of the Ninth, The Silver Branch, The Lantern Bearers*). It was interesting to re-visit the same geographical areas in Scotland that we visited in Eagle of the Ninth about a century before this book. Phaedrus and Conory's friendship was interesting and I wish it had been more developed. The ending was certainly the most >!tragic one I've read so far in Sutcliff's books, but it felt meaningful. Also, I wasn't as attached to Phaedrus from the start (thanks to his bar fight, I suppose) as I was to the Aquila family protagonists in the Dolphin Ring sequence, so in a way that lessened the pain, and the fact that Midir and Phaedrus both sacrificed themselves gave me the (yes, rather sentimental) idea that the they would at least be together as friends in the afterlife, watching over Conory and Murna and her child. I kind of felt more attached to the real Midir than to Phaedrus and wished he could have at least got to meet Conory again. I had a gut feeling that it wouldn't be possible for both the real and fake Midirs to survive together, but the ending just happened too rapidly, and I almost wish the person who spied on Midir and Phaedrus could have been one of Phaedrus' own men turned traitor, instead of a generic spy on Liadhan's side -- it would have added a bit more complexity to the story.!<

>!I wonder if Conory will become a sort of regent king until the child Murna is carrying comes of age? Will he tell Murna that her husband wasn't really Midir (she probably guesses this already)? If the other Companions and the rest of the Dalriads ever find out that their king wasn't the real Midir, would they turn against Conory and Gault for perpetuating the ruse, or would they be thankful to them for their scheme because it succeeded in getting rid of Liadhan?!<",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18nbdhr/the_mark_of_the_horse_lord_by_rosemary_sutcliff/,2023-12-21 01:52:34,0,3,books

8fv7aq,Do you think Stephen King really reads all the books he blurbs?,"I love Mr. King just as much as the next guy. However...

If you are in the habit of buying (or simply looking at) newly released thriller/mystery/horror novels, you have probably noticed that one of the most frequent blurbers is King himself–and he never fails to be anything other than enthusiastic and generous in his praise. Of course, being (arguably) the most famous and successful living American author, his name is going to appear front and center on the jacket 9/10 times if he has been kind enough to lend a sentence or two. 

It is commendable that King agrees to do this, especially in the case of up and coming authors whose sales stand to receive a considerable boost from a King blurb. 

However, potential problems arise when you realize how often King does this–and it is quite often. I don’t know if there is an official count out there, but I would wager that he is  the most frequent blurber in the literary world. Is there anything wrong with this? What’s the big deal? 

Well, I have happened to take King at his word more than a few times, as I do have a great amount of respect for the man, and I have more often than not been disappointed with the experience. His effusive praise often doesn’t match the actual product at all. 

One such example is Nick Cutter, who King said was a practitioner of “old school horror at its best.” That got me pretty excited so, like the trusting fool I am, I immediately went out and bought copies of The Troop and The Deep. 

Neither of these novels was terrible, but they weren’t anywhere close to being “old school horror at its best.” I’d elaborate a little more, but that would clutter up my post. 

All this is to say that I just get the feeling that King doesn’t actually read a lot of the books he so enthusiastically recommends. How could he possibly have the time to read so many new titles when he continues to keep up such a prodigious work schedule? Maybe he reads a few of them and assigns the rest to his assistants. Maybe he doesn’t read any of them and just gives out praise to authors he personally likes, because he is a really nice guy who understands the influence he wields. 

I’m just talking about King here, but this likely applies to any moderately to immensely successful author who is inundated for requests to put their names on new books. How much can we trust what they say? I have essentially learned (and maybe this took me way too long) not to put any faith in what authors say on jacket copies. 

In the end, it’s better simply to read full reviews from official publications that you trust and to perhaps consult user reviews as well, as an additional resource. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8fv7aq/do_you_think_stephen_king_really_reads_all_the/,2018-04-29 23:23:17,44,37,books
gynx3a,The Stormlight Archive: A Masterpiece,"Such a coalescing of storylines and themes. Supreme character development, from Dalinar to Shallan, from Kaladin to Moash, from Jasnah to Teft. 

Containing explanations for the main mysteries in an appropriate manner which isn't forced and feels natural.

And then that one quote in The Way of Kings, which is Dalinar thinking to himself, that emotions shouldn't be ignored, but if they control you you're no better than a child. And then that idea progressed in a physical manifestation of Odium and the big conflict by the end of the Archive.

4v54np,Is Stephen King the greatest living author?,"I think he might be. I believe that ""It"" is the greatest book ever written. The character development is so well done. You really feel what they're feeling and you empathize with them so strongly. They really feel real.  

Not only in ""It"" but in King's writing in general he can really make you feel things. It's why some of his books are so scary or unsettling. It's not like horror movies that rely on cheap jump scares to startle you. Its hard to explain exactly what I mean but he makes you feel scared in a way I've not experienced with other authors. 

The number of books he's written that are widely considered classics is unparalleled by other writers. He has created some of the most iconic characters in pop culture history.

whyyvy,Bad fantasy novels hurt the most and the longest,"Is that how it goes for anyone else?

For me, a bad romance novel is forgotten within minutes to hours. Even the good ones I forget sometimes, but the bad ones are gone instantly. Even while still reading it, I'll sometimes just forget I was reading it and move on to something new.

I can't even name a bad manga or graphic novel. It's just gone. 

Bad mystery? I'll try to remember the name of the author so I don't read another one, but there's no specific memory that lingers.

But bad fantasy novels haunt you. I still remember reading Wise Man's Fears and not loving it. Dinosaur Lords... Being disappointed by the last two ASOIAF novels.

There's a certain pain for me with reading and not enjoying epic fantasy. Scars that reopen and bleed whenever someone mentions the book or the author. 

I want to put it down to the time spent on it, but there are long horror novels and long sci fi novels too that don't affect me the same way if I don't like them.  I don't like half of Stephen King's books for example, and The Stand was so long, 40 or 50 hours, but it still isn't something I'm haunted by. I never swore to myself ""Never again!"" while shaking my bloody fists at the sky. I was just like ""okay.""

So why do epic fantasy books hurt the worst? Why do you  feel so betrayed when people don't finish a series? Fantasy is the only genre where I even care about whole series in the first place and I feel like fantasy authors who never finish stuff should be banned from doing any other books until they finish 🤣😖. Like they should have a warning on their Amazon page at the very least...

Meanwhile, I very much don't care about unfinished romance series at all. Even if I like the first book I might just stop reading the series for no real reason at all, even if I already bought the sequel.

Anyone else? Sorry for rambling, but I think I just noticed my double standards for reading, enjoying and reviewing fantasy novels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/whyyvy/bad_fantasy_novels_hurt_the_most_and_the_longest/,2022-08-06 21:38:38,43,10,books
yfy9tq,How was They Both Die at the End so good and the prequel The First to Die at the End so bad?,"The writing is just so bad, even for a YA novel. The logic, reasoning, and behavior of the characters is so beyond believable and I don't mean that they weren't true to life or that the characters were too flawed, I mean they just didn't make sense. The consequences and reactions to the establishment of Death-Cast seem poorly thought out, juvenile at best. There are too many characters, too much switching perspectives, and too little actual story to invest and care about any of the characters. There were some lines that were just downright painful to read, like they were written by a high-schooler taking creative writing for the first time. Way too much ""tell"" and not enough ""show"".

I don't know if I just had blinders on when I read the original because I loved it so much, maybe it's actually of the same quality and I am just remembering through rose tinted glasses, but I was looking forward to the book ending about a quarter of the way through so I could move on to the next book on my list. Or maybe it was because the last book I read before I started this was Fairy Tale by King and that was just too phenomenal to jump into a YA novel immediately after finishing it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yfy9tq/how_was_they_both_die_at_the_end_so_good_and_the/,2022-10-28 19:30:46,16,10,books
4s9vzf,Brandon Sanderson: The Stormlight Archive,"So this post is about The Stormlight Archive and Audio books vs Print books.

A long time ago I read The Way of Kings and absolutely loved it. Once of Sanderson's best works as far as I am concerned. When the second book, Words of Radiance, I could not wait and got the Audio book rather than the physical books.

I just finished listening to The Way of Kings for the first time and everything I remembered from the series is in the first book.

12r34s4,"History of the Kings of Britain Was Almost What I Expected, And Then Wasn't","I picked up Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century pseudo-historical *Historia Regum Britanniae* / *History of the Kings of Britain* a little while ago. I'm a big fan of Arthurian legend and the Matter of Britain in general, so it seemed like even if it was a little dry, reading it would be worthwhile.

It was almost what I expected, and then it wasn't, and I want to talk about it.

**Note:** Spoilers for a 900-year-old pseudohistory ahead. Read at your own risk I guess.

I expected *Historia Regum* to be a dry chronicle of kings begetting and overthrowing and slaying, up until Uther Pendragon and Arthur, where it would get more interesting before the end. And aside from the initial plot twist of ""OK so Britain was founded by Aeneas's great-grandson now because of course it was,"" that expectation held up for the early stretches of the book.

However, for every dry spell, there was another wild or exciting chapter like the story of the warring brothers Belinus and Brennius, who end up conquering France and Rome together because they couldn't think of anything better to do with their enormous army after their mom made them reconcile. Or the story of King Leir, which Shakespeare adapted pretty faithfully into *King Lear*. The infusion of a few long-form, politically- and character-driven stories, along with Geoffrey's plain to-the-point language, keeps thing moving along better than I expected.

Then, finally, we get to Arthur. *Historia Regum* presents us with a very different Arthur than, say, *The Sword in the Stone*, or even Mallory's 15th-century *Morte d'Arthur*. In fact, Goeffrey's Arthur is really just an asshole warlord whose most notable quality is ""really good at killing people"". Which seems historically accurate based on what very little we know about the figure, but isn't as stirring a story as the later tellings.

*(Side note: I feel like I should mention that despite this, Geoffrey's text is one of the most important in establishing the canon of Arthurian legend. It's just a very different kind of story than the ones we're familiar with.)*

The Arthurian chapters do feature some notable elements of later legend; Guinevere, Gawain, Kay (here not Arthur's foster-brother, but still his seneschal), Mordred, Bedivere, Anna/Morgause, and Lot all feature, although none of them are given much of a personality. (Bedivere does get to be Duke of France for a while though, so that's nice for him I guess.) Lancelot is absent since he wasn't an Arthurian figure yet in Geoffrey's time, and Merlin is largely absent by this point in the story. It also names Arthur's spear Ron/Rhongomyniad, and of course his sword Caliburnus/Excalibur. While it has fewer of the magical and holy properties it would later be know for, Geoffrey does claim it was forged by Avalon, which is mentioned only twice and never elaborated upon. Notably absent is the Sword in the Stone fable, as Arthur is accepted as Uther's legitimate son by Igraine, who he married after murdering her husband. (What a charmer.)

As different as the story begins, the ending is very familiar. During Arthur's bloody campaign to make Rome give him money, Guinevere runs off with Mordred (here Arthur's nephew by Morgause, but not his bastard). After a short and brutal war that leaves every one of Arthur's remaining companions dead, the king strikes his son down at the Battle of Camblann/Camlann. Interestingly, rather than succumb to his wounds, he's brought to Avalon to ""have his wounds tended"", which could imply he survives, but he passes on the crown and is not spoken of again. After the almost alien accounting of Arthur, it was touching to see how gingerly his last days were preserved by authors like Mallory and White. (Sadly, Best Round Table Knight Sir Bedivere dies in Arthur's Roman campaign, and so isn't around to return Caliburnus to the Lady of the Lake.)

So the trappings are there, but it's not the story I was expecting. The weird thing is that *Historia Regum* **does** feature exactly what I expected to get from Arthur's story. Grand drama, ambition, romance, betrayal, politics, pride, magic, tragedy that makes you wonder ""Why didn't Shakespeare ever adapt this,"" it has all of that. It's just that it comes right before Arthur. It's the story of Vortigern.

A petty noble, Vortigern's manipulations bring the weak king Constans to power. Vortigern then manipulates disaffected nationalists to murder the king, only to use them as scapegoats and take the crown himself. Fearing the wrath of the Picts and Scots he betrayed, it's Vortigern who first invites the Saxons into Britain as mercenaries under the banner of Hengist and Horsa, a decision which would one day doom the land. He marries the pagan Saxon Rowena, daughter of Hengist, renounces Christendom, and earns the fury of the British nobility as he hands first counties, and then entire kingdoms, to Saxon mercenaries. He is overthrown and replaced by his eldest son (by his first marriage to a Roman noble named Sevira), only to reclaim the throne after a bloody war that ends when the young king is poisoned by his stepmother, Rowena.

Then, like any good tragic villain, the betrayal undoes the betrayer. The Saxons, upon their return at Vortigern's request, murder the British nobility at peace talks, with Vortigern giving them free reign over Britain in exchange for his life. Desperate and reduced to a single holding, even the prophet Merlin can't save Vortigern from the fate he has brought upon himself: burned alive in his castle by the brothers Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther, who return from their exile in Brittany to avenge the murder of brother King Constans.

The portions featuring Aurelius and Uther are great too, but the Vortigern section really stands out. After finishing it, I couldn't believe that I hadn't seen more treatments of the story. Many of the other figures—Belinus and Brennius, Hengist and Horsa, Leir, etc.—are circulated in their own ways, and I feel like Arthurian deep cuts and other period pieces generally include at least Uther and very often Aurelius Ambrosius. But Vortigern is more of a novelty. While largely fabricated (like most of the chronicle), he seems like the exact kind of figure that would inspire popular drama and literature for ages. And while it has been adapted here and there, most infamously in the form of the Shakespeare forgery *Vortigern and Rowena* by William Henry Ireland, it seems to have mostly fallen by the wayside. The fates are fickle, I guess. Or maybe I just like it more than most people.

The story doesn't end with Arthur, but what remains is largely procedural; God, Geoffrey makes it abundantly clear, has abandoned the Britons, and the land will never be theirs again. (As in, God literally straight-up says he's done with them.) The chronicle concludes with the full displacement of the Britons by the Saxons and Angles, among others, after the Black Death, with the few survivors fleeing across the sea.

So anyway, *Historia Regum Britanniae* was what I expected, until it wasn't. And I like it for that.

Should you read it? You probably already know the answer to that question. Does it sound interesting to you? Then you should probably read it (it's surprisingly quick). Does it sound boring? You'll probably find it boring. It's what it says on the tin; just with a nice prize you weren't expecting wedged into the middle.

That's all. Just wanted to relate my experience and see what others think about the book. I hope it was an enjoyable read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12r34s4/history_of_the_kings_of_britain_was_almost_what_i/,2023-04-18 20:26:15,8,30,books
9ahbe8,The Stand - Stephen King. Thoughts?,"Finished this book not too long ago, and it’s one of those books that really leaves you thinking about the meaning of the ending. 

The way King portrayed the struggle between good and evil was very unique and complex. 

The characters introduced each had their own personal inner battle of good vs evil which was a nice parallel to the overall struggle.

And this is undoubtedly the darkest book I’ve read (although it’s probably tame by King’s standards, as far as I know, as this is my first book of his I’ve read)

Is this book commonly talked about here? Thoughts about the book/ending?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9ahbe8/the_stand_stephen_king_thoughts/,2018-08-26 17:34:06,39,19,books
kh6zb8,I just finished the books for the first time and I want to rank everything about them.,"
So i’m a 13yo and i decided to take in the challenge of the Lord of the Rings books. I never watched the movies so this was all totally new to me. It was one of if not the best things i’ve ever read. I had no idea a book can be so dense but also so captivating. I wanted to share with everyone everything I felt about the books. I’m going to be rating characters not how much I liked them but how much I liked reading them. I’m ranking from be at to worse. Sorry for any misspellings of misinformed things I wrote.  I also posted this in the lotr subreddit but I really wanted to see more people opinions. 


The Fellowship

Sam-Probably my favorite book character ever. The way he was so strong and brave was such amazing writing. He went from Frodo’s servant to someone who could fight for himself and his people his character development is unmatched. And i weeped like a baby in The Choices of Master Samwise. Also his song in the dark tower. 

Gandalf- He was so entertaining and his death was so amazingly sad and beautiful. When he came back I was cheering. His and Pippins relationship was so well done I was so happy to read anything involving them. He was such a great character who brought so much to the world. 

Merry/Pippin- They are ranked together because of how I always enjoyed them and they were so similar. The way the mirror each other with both of them becoming servants of a king was so amazing. When they were with the ents I was so happy to read them together. I was so upset when they were separated but their friendship was so amazing. 

Aragorn-I loved him so much. He was so noble and so kind to his followers and enemies. They way he spared the men who went against him was so inspiring. I truly felt such joy when he arrived at the Battle of Pelennaor Fields. His love with Arwen was so sweet and I loved how they showed him loving her throughout each book. He was the best king the men of Gondor could ask for. 

Gimli/Legolas- Same with Merry and Pippin I felt that they were so similar that it would make no sense for one to be above the other. Their friendship was also amazing the way it expanded their prejudices. I loved them traveling Fangorn and the caves of helms deep was so sweet. I truly felt for them when they were together and I was glad they were never separated. 

Frodo-He was a great character and I loved him and Sam together. He wasn’t always the best but he was so intriguing with the ring. Him getting corrupted by the ring was so shocking that I audibly gasped when it happened. When he left Sam to go to the Havens I was balling. Their story was so amazing and I’m glad they grew with each other. 

Boromir-I never really cared for him until he tried to kill and take the ring form Frodo. That was so shocking and I never saw it coming. His death was sad and I truly felt for the fellowship and his family. 

Other Characters

Faramir-So amazing. The minute I saw him treat Frodo and Sam with kindness was when I really started to love him. His story of finding his brothers body on the boat was what made me feel for Boromirs death. Him and Éowyn was so sweet and I really loved them together. His friendship with Aragorn was so amazing and I get chills when I read him waking in the House of Healing. He was a great captain and I understood his spillers love for him. He is of the highest quality. 

Théoden- What an amazing king. Him standing up after being a weak old man for so long was so amazing. He was a great king and his death was heartbreaking. His speeches where unrivaled and he was a great commander. I loved his love for his niece and nephew and they were such a strong family. 

Éomer-What a great king. His friendship with Aragorn was also amazing. He was strong and brave and kind and I loved him so much. His relationship with Gimli was so interesting and I love Gimlis line, “You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning.” What a great quarrel. 

Éowyn-What an awesome arc. Her going form the servant of her uncle to a brave warrior. Her slaying of the Witch King was so awesome I was cheering. Her and Faramir where so sweet and they were so entertaining. Her love of Aragorn was so sweet and I felt for her when he said no to her. 

Galadriel-The morning of which has so much love. While she didn’t have a character growth I really enjoyed her scenes. Her appreciation for Sam was so kind. Her caring for Gimli even though he was a dwarf was such a sweet scene. 

Elerond-What a good elf. His council was one of my favorite chapters and I loved how he housed the hobbits and the rest of the fellowship. 

Denethor-Such a good story. His devote into madness was done incredibly and was such good story telling. His love for his sons even if shown badly was so strong. His death was so amazing and such a good way to end his arc. 

Arwen-She was sweet but I didn’t really care for her much. I really liked her and Aragorns love and the way she gave up her immortality for him. I wish we got more of their wedding but I really enjoyed her scenes. 

The 3 Volumes

The Return of the King-Best book I’ve ever read. The battle scenes and friendships going on we’re done so beautifully. The way most of the book wasn’t even about the destruction of the ring and more about the journey was great. The scorching of the shire was the best chapter I’ve ever read. The mirroring of Pippin and Merry were so amazing and I loved every time I read about them. I wish we got to see more of the Path of the dead but I did love the story of Minas Tirth. The siege of Gondor and the Battle of Peleannor Farms ante unmatched in the other books. I loved the dynamics of the book and sped through it. All in all this book is a 10/10

The Two Towers-I really enjoyed it and loved almost all of it. I did get bored in much more scenes in this book then RotK but I still loved the dynamics. Book 3 was so good and the three hunters where some of my favorite chapters of the series. Also Merry and Pippin escaping form the orcs and meeting the ents was so awesome. Also Gandalf the white appears which was a great thing. I really enjoyed Helms Deep even though I struggled visualizing it. 9/10

The Fellowship of the Ring-By far the hardest to get through. The beginning of the journey was great but once they left Bag end it was hard for me to keep reading. The old forest was so difficult to read and it took me a week to read the chapter. And I know it’s unpopular but Tom Bomballidi completely took me out of the story. I just couldn’t care for him. It was still a very good book and the lore was great. I love all of book 2 and it was such a great journey. 7.5/10

The 6 Books

Book 5-All the battles were great and the whole entity of this book went by so fast. 10/10

Book 3-My favorite dynamic in the books with the introduction of so many great characters. I also sped through this book. 9/10

Book 6- The start was a little slow but by chapter 2 it was picking up. I loved how the main climax was in the first 3 chapters and everything after was rebuilding the world. Obviously the scorching of the shire is in here so it was a great book. It took a little while longer to read it only because I didn’t want it to end. 9/10

Book 4-I definitely struggled with this book but the payoff was worth it. The journey went slow at first but the world that was built made up for it. Gollum was such a great inclusion and his treachery surprised and didn’t surprise me. I balled at the end of the book. I took a while to read but I loved it. 8.5/10

Book 2- This book was what kept me reading. The journey of the fellowship was so amazing and I loved the council of Elrond. The way it ends made me so mad I left the other book at home. I read this relatively slow but it was how I absorbed the world. 8/10

Book 1-By far one of the biggest challenges I’ve read. The start is great but once they get to the road it drones on. I still liked it but there were lots of parts that were a bore. It took me 2 months to read this and I needed lots of breaks. 7/10

Battles

Gandalf vs the Balrog- On the edge of my seat the whole time and the conclusion was so amazing I needed to stop and think. 10/10

Peleannor Farms-This was so so amazing. Aragorn coming out to save the day was shocking. Éowyns reveal and then murder of the Witch King with Merrys help was so awesome. I cried when they listed the names of the dead. 10/10

Scorching of the Shire-While this is my favorite chapter it was not the best battle of the books. That is not saying it wasn’t so amazing. The way the travelers got the shire folk to fight for their freedom was so incredible. The death of the hobbits was so sad and I was so happy at the death of Saruman that I was cheering. 9.5/10

Siege of Gondor- This was amazing and bittersweet. The fall of Faramir and the loss of the gates made me so distressed. I loved the battle but there are others that out weigh it. 9/10

Helms Deep-I wish the battle lasted longer and we had a chance to see more of the destruction of the ents. I struggled to visualize the battle and it was hard for me to picture the wall. However Gimli and Legolas made up for all the downfalls. Their friendship is one of my favorites. 8.5/10

The battle at the Black Gates- It wasn’t really a battle but of the fighting I wish there was more of it. The fact that most of the orcs fled was disappointing but i was glad there was some death of the enemy. The mouth of Sauron was a great scene though. 8/10

All in all the story of a Hobbit becoming the person who saved the world was amazing. I’m so glad I got to read the books and can’t wait to start the movies!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kh6zb8/i_just_finished_the_books_for_the_first_time_and/,2020-12-21 01:23:49,29,52,books
9abbtu,Am I missing something about The Gunslinger?,"I’m a pretty big Stephen King fan and have read several of his books and always really enjoyed them. So whenever I say that, the Dark Tower series always gets brought up and how if I like Stephen King, I need to read this series, it’s his magnum opus, etc. After a million recommendations and hearing they were making it into a movie, I decided to collect the books. 

Since then I started grad school and didn’t have much time for them and kept putting them aside but finally started and finished the gunslinger a month or two ago and.....I feel like I don’t get it. It feels like there should be a prequel to it. There’s so much random stuff that seems like I should already know it but I don’t so it seems out of place. The overall story doesn’t really make sense and the justification for the world seems convoluted (even by King standards). And it’s really short in a way that I’d never expect from King. 

I forced myself through it, telling myself that it’ll get better but once it ended, I felt like it was a fantasy waiting for godot. Nothing happened and nothing was explained. It totally killed any excitement I had for the rest of the series since all I’ve heard is that it goes downhill from there. 

So my question is, am I missing something here or is my favorite author’s magnum opus just not for me? I hope it’s the former because the latter would just be really dissatisfying.

aosrs4,Half-way through The Stand,"I'm about 60% of the way through Stephen King's 'The Stand'. I absolutely loved the first half of the book where the story was focused on an epidemic and survival, but am really struggling with the second half so far. This struggle of good vs evil seems so overdone, cheesy and not at all interesting. Should I keep reading or quit now? Does this get better?

My background with King in general is pretty confused. I love his short stories and but didn't like the dark tower (again I found about 25% of that book really interesting, and struggled with the other 75%). I recently read 11/22/63 and loved it.

Without spoilers, after some time the protagonist recounts a past experience to other characters, then after some time the protagonist of this tale recounts a story to another character. This 3-layer story within a story had me thinking what the most layers a narrative has gone through within a book or book series.

A large number of authors from around the turn of the century seem to have been fond of these frame stories. Most of Lovecraft's works were at least two layers, and I seem to recall *At the Mountains of Madness* going to three.
