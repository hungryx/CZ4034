1616xgc,"Mistborn, the final Empire - mediocre plot and a terrible ending / resolution","My first post here, and I will probably not make many friends with this opinion. Spoilers for Mistborn, the final empire and Harry Potter. Please don’t spoiler Mistborn 2 & 3. Please excuse the rant, but I read so many positive reviews that just overlook major flaws in the plot that I just need to post this.

I hope you can show me that I am not crazy and not the only one seeing the flaws. But if you see that I overlooked something and was too harsh, I would also love to hear your opinion.

It was my first book of Brandon Sanderson. Beforehand I saw a lot of praise about Sanderson and especially that his endings and twists are on another lvl. With that expectations, I was honestly very floored at how bad the plot was in the end resolved. After reading the ending, I learned to value Voldemort as a villain. And Voldemort being set up as Hitler with magic and being beaten by 17-year-olds and a school full of children is difficult to top.

It's important to note that this is just my subjective opinion, and I am aware that I am of some things a little bit too critical for my own good . And it’s possibly some of my points will be explained in the next installments. And maybe I even misremember some things or am too stupid to see the genius behind it.

But let's start with the good things. I will only name a few of them and then continue to the bad stuff because I think that I won’t contribute anything new in that area.

# The good:

**World building**

* The World building is absolutely fabulous in every aspect.
   * The Logbook was extremely immersive and gave me I don't know why strong Oblivion (the Elderscrolls) flashbacks, and I would have loved to read more about the struggles a 1000 years ago.
* Allomancy is also absolutely amazing, and I can’t wait to read more about Feruchemy and the possible third system.

**Characters**

* Difficult for me to judge. I thought they were fine and some even very interesting.
* Except the Lord Ruler, more about that now.

# The bad stuff:

1. **The Lord Ruler's downfall was badly executed**

* The mystery about him was great, and the logbook was amazing. I almost skipped chapters just to read the next passage of him. I thought it was sad, but not necessary bad, that the Lord Ruler was not who we thought he was. Furthermore, I think it would have been more interesting to have someone good being corrupted by power, that would give us something to fear that it happens to the Protagonists in the future.
* The big problem is that he is 1000 years old and had time to encounter every form of attack and possible danger to his life and power. In his own and kelsirs words: he was beheaded, dismembered and skinned. So how does he get destroyed? By immense sacrifice and the skill of a hole crew of seasoned veterans that by them self have almost godlike power? No, all it needs is 17 year old Vin with \~ 7 months of Mistborn training. And all she does is pull on a bracelet. Yes, she shouldn’t have been able to pull it away and that's probably the teased third magic system, but everybody at every time could have done that, even without magic. Wouldn’t the same thing have happened if his arm was cut off or when someone stabs him that he cuts the bracelet?
* To defeat the Lord Ruler was in the end only one Mistborn with 7 month of training necessary. The revolution, Marsh, Kelsir etc. didn’t have to have happened to defeat him. Yes, to establish a new government that was important, but the 1000 year old Lord Ruler could have been murdered at any point by a Mistborn or even a competent Misting. They just had to take his bracelet.
* His private room is also super easy to reach, him being so vulnurable you would think that he would choose a place where Mistborns can’t casually walk to.

2. **Inquisitors & Marsh**

* It's said that there are about 20 Inquisitors in the hole empire, and they are critical to the Lord Ruler and even guard him personally, probably especially when he sleeps. Why would Marsh in a span of days / weeks be recruited and be made an Inquisitor to live a hundred years and longer to protect the Lord Ruler. You would suspect that If you hire someone for such a long term and give them so much power, there would be precautions for things like that. In any reasonably world that should be a process of years and maybe even decades.
* I also think Kelsir (being only a Mistborn for 3 years) escapes them so often and killing one of them doesn't let them look very strong and anything I as a reader have to take seriously. Feels like if some of the Mistborn of the houses (with decades of mistborn Training) with Misting (they can also be very strong, at least when they are part of the protagonists) would have mopped the floor with all of them. Especially when killing them is as banal as beheading.
   * That the secret to kill an Inquisitor is to behead them is somewhat underwhelming. If you can't kill someone by just piercing the body or even the heart, everybody would in the next step try to hit / smash the head or behead them.
* Why risk loosing one of them by sending only one to trap Kelsir? Wouldn't the Inquisitors be so or so there to oversee the execution? During the first execution, 8 of them were there. Why would you send only one of them this time, especially if you want to trap someone this time?

**3. Revolution is too clean and a plot convenience**

* From my understanding died Kelsir in the morning and during the day the hole skaa population knows he is dead and warships him as a martyr or some higher being. They take up arms and cleanly take almost every keep and the palace during the same day. And after Elend talks to them at the palace and Breez works their emotions, the hole rebellion died down and has channeled itself into productivity. There is no infighting, religions fanaticism or just anything beside a pretty clean revolution where thousands of people do exactly what the plot needs them to do and not one bit more.
* So far, it's just a big plot convenience that does exactly what the Protagonists need to reach their goal. Maybe in the next book the negative aspects and the chaos in which revolutions work will be more explored.

4. **The remaining Plot is also very convenient**

* The Lord Ruler and Inquisitors never actively chase after the protagonists, and you never get the feeling of operating under the nose of the all mighty enemy. Especially when you build your own religion and recruit thousands of skaa. The only 2 things that “happen” are random killings of some thieving crews and Marsh, but Marsh was just a cheap bait. You could argue that the Lord Ruler was so confident in his abilities, but then he should be able to back his arrogance up with something. Being able to kill Kelsir with ease doesn’t do anything if that is undoubtedly what Kelsir wants.
* Vin is, after a couple of months, strong enough to defeat 2 Mistborn and Misting (assassination attempt on Elend) and even kill one Mistborn. Similar problem to the Inquisitors. How incompetent is the rest of this world when things like this happen. Especially because Luthandel and the houses are supposed to be really competitive, and a house war is always a thread. This Mistborn should be highly trained. A couple month training and a small Atium trick shouldn’t be enough to do that. Or at least, if that is the only interaction we have with the other Mistborn you shouldn’t expect the reader to buy into the risk of the houses pose and their power.

5. **The stakes were too high for the resolution**

* If you want a 1000-year-old god like creature and raise the stakes to that level, you probably should also raise the complexity of the resolution and work for an in itself coherent ending. Don’t make the antagonist just in the right situations so arrogant and dumb that the reader can't believe how he even survived the first 100 years.
* Maybe Sanderson should not have worked with “What if the dark lord won 1000 years ago” but just told a story with an aspiring Dark Lord who is more or less on the same level with the protagonist and then some plot convenience happens, and he gets defeated. That would be way more plausible.
   * He upped the stakes of Harry Potter by x100, but the resolution is more or less on the same level. If Harry's victory isn't even more plausible and logical then Vins.
* The victory for the protagonists didn’t necessitate any sacrifice or real consequences. Besides Kelsir’s death, but that also was part of the plan and nothing out of the control of the protagonists.

I hope that I didn’t oversee something big. Maybe the next book will explain things, but for me, this should be done in the book itself. Without that, it just seems like the stakes were too high for the type of resolution Sanderson could accomplish.

# Some further nitpicks:

**Guard with the destroyed uniform in the End - Goradel**

* Vin talks to him and his 3 colleagues and he ripped the symbol of his uniform and walks in the mists, and later he can tell Elend and Dockson that he saw Vin being captured. Even so Vin walked through the palace and only was captured at the room. Should that make sense?

**Eleventh Metal**

* Maybe that will be explained in the next books, but does it only work on the Lord Ruler or why didn’t Kelsir figure out what it does?
* It feels like that was only included to let the reader doubt Kelsirs motives.

**Reen**

* Why wasn’t Reen enough for the inquisitors to discredit the High Prelan? Maybe they lied about having him or there was no option to show him to the Lord Ruler. But it feels like an overlook.

**Allomancy**

* It never felt limited in the sense of running out of metals. In no relevant situation did anyone run out or had to manage their vials with the Metal. Only a little bit with Atium, but even there, not really. I think that this should play a role for Mistings and Mistborns. How much metal do you carry with you, bottles getting destroyed if you fall, disposing vials with metal because other Mistings can track you if you carry them with you.
* Maybe they just down an ungodly amount of metals in the morning and then don't have to worry about it, but even then, it would be important to use it over the day, so you don’t hurt yourself if you clear your reserves before sleeping.

For comparison, Lightbringer by Brent Weeks did such a good job in showing the limitations and the logistic that are needed to use the Magic efficient.

# Conclusion

I loved a lot about the book and am thrilled to read the next books. But I really disliked the decisions Sanderson took in the end. I hope that the next books will weather explain some things or at least don't follow the same pattern of high stakes that cannot be resolved without breaking the coherency of the world.

I apologise for the long rant, but I am just so done with plot armor and dumming the villains down in the end, so the Protagonist can save the day without needing to do the work. If the author just raises and lowers the stakes how it is convient for his plot, it's difficult to engage with the high stakes.

I would love to hear your opinions if that just a me problem or if my points are understandable. A heads-up if you think other Brandon Sanderson works follow similar patters is also appreciated, obviously without spoilers.

Hello, all. During the month of June, the sub book club will be reading **The Final Empire** by Brandon Sanderson! Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Brandon himself will be joining us for an AMA.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

>For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the ""Sliver of Infinity,"" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier ""snapped"" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.  
>  
>Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.  
>  
>But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

g84rrx,Mistborn:The Final Empire,"Mistborn:The Final Empire brought me back to fantasy

I have just finished Mistborn:The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson, and I am in love with the genre all over again. 

I read The Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien last year, and while I enjoyed it, it didn’t make me feel as much as I would have liked. I was recommended Brandon Sanderson and the Mistborn trilogy and I am officially hooked!

One of my favorite things about the story is the story within a story with the few sentences at the beginning of each chapter. Each one brings a new aspect to the overall main storyline, but I find myself wanting to know more. I was shocked by the ending, but no spoilers here. 

The character development was amazing, to me. At first, I couldn’t figure out who the main character was...Kelsier or Vin, but I was cool with either one. I wanted to know more about each and what their motivations were. With Vin, it was easy to see where she started, but as she came into her own, I wanted to keep cheering her on! With Kelsier, each piece of his history that was revealed was a little nugget that made me want to keep digging. I wish there had been a bit more with Mare, but can see why that wasn’t explored more. 

For me, by far my favorite character was Sazed. I know he was an ancillary character, but he did so much to drive Vin forward in her development as a woman and as part of the revolution. In addition, his history is so fascinating! How his magic was different from Allomancy, but so similar. How he selflessly went searching for her when she needed rescuing. He just came alive for me. 

Marsh broke my heart. I felt so much for him, and the hurt he had experienced. I thought Sanderson did such a good job, in the few scenes he appeared in, describing his history and motivations. I’m really hoping his story is explored more in the remainder of the trilogy. 

This entire story really brought me back to the genre I am a huge fan of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g84rrx/mistbornthe_final_empire/,2020-04-26 00:36:25,50,26,books
t7ml23,Brandon Sanderson's The Final Empire is an incredible book,"That was an incredible two-month long experience. I never thought I would be willing or able to finish a 600+ page book, but Sanderson made it possible. Even more amazing since this is the first novel I've read for leisure since middle school. I am still shocked about what happened in the climax, and I have so many thoughts, questions, and a few nitpicks.

***Strengths:***

* **Vin and Kelsier:** These two were definitely the highlight characters. They had extremely interesting arcs, and have an incredibly heartwarming and inspiring dynamic. Vin is very relatable and was a joy watching her gain confidence, trust the crew, and find love in Elend. I've recently felt like I'm too afraid to take chances, or to express my emotions, or even to form a deep bond with someone(romantic or platonic). I want to be stronger than I am. I could see Vin within myself and wanted to see her grow as a person and Allomancer. But I also fell in love with Vin's flaws. She always lost sight of herself as Valette, and it made her arc that much more memorable. Kelsier is probably my favorite character between the two. As the book progressed he definitely expressed darker traits, like pitting Demoux and Bilg against each other using Allomancy, or making a religion out of himself, but I still admired his goals and understood them. His ideology, shades of gray, and ability to keep smiling and hoping and inspiring others tore through my pessimistic heart. Many of his quotes now stick with me, I will miss him very much.
* **The magic system:** Whenever I heard about Sanderson, his hard magic systems were always brought up as a pro. I am glad to say those claims ring true. Allomancy is an incredible magic system that harkens back to the boundless praise I give Hunter x Hunter's Nen. It is logical, consistent, each metal has strengths and weaknesses, it connects back to the worldbuilding, and I expect it to get deeper as the series goes on. Allomancy exposition was subtle, dense, and easy to understand. Feruchemy is a fascinating system and I am shocked at how it connected to the Lord Ruler.
* **The action:** The Final Empire's action scenes remind me of an anime or a top-quality Western action cartoon. They were all fluid, tense, vivid, and Kelsier vs Inquisitor might be one of my favorite fights ever. For me, it is one of my main reasons it should be adapted into an animated series.
* **The worldbuilding:** Scadrial has to be the best world I have seen since Gargoyles. From the gothic and ash-coated landscape of Luthadel, the hollow vibe of the mists, the persecution of the Terris people and skaa, the mystery and tragedy of the epigraphs, and Allomancy's connection to the Empire's structure. I never got bored learning about the Empire or the logbook. It helped me root for Kelsier's crew and desire the Lord Ruler's downfall, and drove me to learn about ancient Scadrial's mysteries.
* **The prose:** It might have been simple, but sometimes simple is the best way. Sanderson's simple prose made The Final Empire's cluster of information easy to digest and memorize, and the fights very memorable.
* **THE SANDERLANCHE:** Heard about this term in my previous Mistborn posts... OH MY GOOOOODDD!!!!! The Sanderlanche flipped my expectations at a 180 degree angle and shattered them with a pewter-enhanced obsidian axe. The glorious fights, the incomprehensible dread of the Lord Ruler, the simultaneous red herring and success of the Eleventh Metal, the twist with the Hero and the packman, Marsh coming back.... Not forgetting this anytime soon. I could gush about it all day.

***Weaknesses:***

* **The side characters:** Kelsier's crew members were not bad. They were fun and I appreciate their love for Vin and Kell. But aside from Sazed, and Elend on the other side of the spectrum, they were not memorable. I hope the next book fleshes them out and gives them more relationships to bounce off of.
* **The noble balls:** My problem with the balls is tied to the side characters. I understand the balls' importance, the setting's focus on Luthadel, and loved Vin's bond with Elend and her conflict with the Valette personality. But they often felt lackluster because there were no interesting noble characters except Elend, Straff, and Shan. The noblemen and women felt like a source of information and skaa oppressors, rather than characters with differing agendas or even opinions about the Empire.

**Questions(*****oh boy*****):**

1. What even is the Well of Ascension and the Deepness?
2. How and why do the Ashmounts and mist exist? The Hero's logbook didn't mention anything about ash, mist, or even Allomancy.
3. How the fuck is Rashek both a Feruchemist and an Allomancer????? HE BROKE THE RULES!!!
4. How is Rashek such a fucking strong Allomancer????? HE BROKE HIS CPU!! Maybe it's the millennia of experience...
5. WHY DID RASHEK TORTURE HIS OWN PEOPLE??????? He was a nationalist who loved his people, and then he treated the Terris like puppets 💔💔💔
6. How in the Survivor's name did Vin hack her CPU to break Allomantic rules as well????? That was a Deus ex Machina but I have an eerie feeling there's another secret.
7. Is there a deeper reason Vin can break the rules of Seeking?
8. Were the Lord Ruler's last words those of a jealous and desperate deposed despot, or those of a man trying to protect mankind? I vote the former lmao 😂😂

**Theories:**

1. The distant pulsing Vin sensed was the Well of Ascension.
2. Rashek spent his reign holding back the Deepness.
3. Rashek was the first Allomancer, and gifted his long-dead allies with the power of Allomancy. He used the mists as the medium to bestow Allomantic power, but did not create them.
4. The mists are sentient, and that's why the Deus ex Machina was possible.
5. The mist spirit is the ancestor of the mistwraiths and kandra.
6. Mistwraiths and kandra were not created from the Lord Ruler's rise to power.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/t7ml23/brandon_sandersons_the_final_empire_is_an/,2022-03-06 00:16:14,17,7,books

lnv6wy,The Final Empire: First Impressions (Mistborn Saga),"As the title states I've read the first 150 pages of this book by Brandon Sanderson. I came across it because of a youtuber I follow who has a sort of book club and posts podcasts every three weeks or so discussing what's been read. I am a huge fan of the Fantasy genre (naturally started with Tolkien and RPG's), which can very easily be put into the ""it's just for children"" category by some people.
I have to say, this book hooks you since page one. It is written in a very modern English, it flows nice and easy and, thus, very quickly. The story feels modern because of its word-usage, but it maintains that true lived-in (dare I say, rusty) atmosphere in its lore that is so enticing.
Tolkien books are absolute masterpieces, but might come across as a bit more challenging because of the language that is being used (which I adore by the way, but for new, non-native speakers might present some problems). The Final Empire, however, seems more akin to a contemporary reader.
I absolutely recommend this series, and might update this post as I keep on reading. I'm looking forward to having this saga on my shelf (I take a weird liking on having book sagas well organized and in a row).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lnv6wy/the_final_empire_first_impressions_mistborn_saga/,2021-02-20 00:53:38,10,19,books
kq5laz,Reading The Final Empire (Mistborn book 1) and frustrated,"I'm about halfway through this book. The story is pretty good, but a few things are just bothering me so much. 

The absolute worst thing: these people live in a society where it's well known that there are people who can turn on super hearing. AND THEY JUST WALK AROUND IN PUBLIC CASUALLY TALKING ABOUT THEIR REVOLUTIONARY PLANS!!! 

Like, come ON. They just take zero precautions towards secrecy EVER. When they go on missions they don't wear masks, yet they're constantly going undercover. They walk about saying ""Kelsier"" constantly when he's INFAMOUS as the guy who escaped from the lord protector.

Like how hard would it have been to write them as being just SLIGHTLY careful to not be conspiring in public, and have them wear face masks on missions? 

The other thing that bugs the shit out of me is this Elend guy. She talked to him once for 2 minutes and now like every 5th page she's thinking about him. Like jeez I get it she's a randy teen but we really don't need to be reminded every damn second that she's got the hots for him after they exchanged 3 sentences. We kinda figured it out when he first came up.   

Anyway those things are just absolutely bothering the crap out of me. The talking in public thing is really making it hard to suspend disbelief. Like seriously, imagine KNOWING people have super hearing and just casually chatting about your treason at a party with hundreds of people (all of whom are the demographic that are most likely to have super hearing AND most likely to report what you're saying). It's just absurd.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kq5laz/reading_the_final_empire_mistborn_book_1_and/,2021-01-04 09:46:03,16,6,books
srr3tb,Thoughts on The Final Empire until Part 2,"I've been reading The Final Empire since December, as my first experience with Brandon Sanderson's work. This is also been one of my first leisurely experience with novels since middle school. I'm 38% through The Final Empire and been loving most things about it. Vin's character arc has been beautiful and relatable, Kelsier's character has been consistently engaging, Vin and Kelsier's dynamic is also beautiful, and Allomancy might end up becoming the best magic system I've seen since Nen.

I've seen a lot of people criticize Sanderson because of his simple prose, but here I definitely think it's been a strength. Imo it has allowed him to craft engaging action scenes and exposition. Speaking of which, those two things have been done very well so far. Kelsier fighting the Keep Venture hazekillers, Vin and Kelsier's training fight, and Vin running away from the Inquisitors kept me glued to the page. The Empire's worldbuilding and Allomancy mechanics have been very dense, while still being easy to understand; so you grow to hate the Lord Ruler and understand why Allomancy is so powerful. The lore surrounding the epigraphs has peaked my interest. So excited to see what this book has in store during Parts 3 and 4.

&#x200B;

My theory is that the Lord Ruler was the Hero of Ages, the person who wrote the epigraphs. I theorize he was the Hero driven mad by the pressure of his duty.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/srr3tb/thoughts_on_the_final_empire_until_part_2/,2022-02-13 19:45:10,1,4,books
vjpjva,"[Book Club] ""The Final Empire"" by Brandon Sanderson: Week 3, Part Four - Chapter 28","[*Link to the original announcement thread.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uxnalc/the_rbooks_book_club_selection_ama_for_june_is/)

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the third discussion thread for the June selection, *The Final Empire* by Brandon Sanderson! Hopefully you have all managed to find the book but if you haven't, you can still catch up and join in on a later discussion; however, this thread will be openly discussing up though (and including) **Part Four - Chapter 28**.

Below are some questions to help start conversation; feel free to answer some or all of them, or just post about whatever your thoughts on the material.

1. What are some of your favorite characters, parts or quotes? Which parts did you find confusing?
2. In what way, if at all, does Feruchemy complicate Allomancy? How do the magics relate to one another and how might their mechanisms reveal more about the innerworkings of the world? How are their threats to the Lord Ruler and Empire different?
3. What are your feelings on how Kelsier perceives nobility vs Vin? Where do your sympathies lie and do you feel the nobility could be used, rehabilitated, or serve a purpose post revolution?
4. How culpable do you feel Kelsier is for the actions and loss of the army? 
5. What other questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Which unanswered questions are the most interesting to you?

Reminder that fourth and final discussion will be posted on Friday, July 1st and will cover everything in the book. Then the AMA with Brandon Sanderson will be at **8pm ET, July 7th**.

Note: the announcement post for [July's selection](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vc6b1z/the_rbooks_book_club_selection_ama_for_july_is) has gone up so be sure to pick up the novel ahead of week one!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vjpjva/book_club_the_final_empire_by_brandon_sanderson/,2022-06-24 14:19:51,5,21,books
5rb8gv,Mistborn The Final Empire is overrated,"Of course this is just my opinion, but I feel like the book was meh, wasn't really drawn into it nor did it move any of my emotions. I felt that it was filled with cliches and over all it was just okay at best. I read it because it supposedly suppose to be similar to GoT but found the only similarity between the 2 is the genre. Anyone else feel the same way? Or am I missing something lol

Update: Just finished the Trilogy and gotta say I really like it, I'm really glad I decided to finish it. The ending is pretty amazing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5rb8gv/mistborn_the_final_empire_is_overrated/,2017-01-31 21:45:34,21,12,books
8uemyc,The book Mistborn: The Final Empire revived my love for reading [spoilers],"For a little background, I used to be massive reader of novels when I was in elementary and high school but when I started University I stopped reading as much and got into a lot of psychology and self-help. I barely read any fiction books over the past 4 years. Recently, I started growing tired and worn out from the entire self-help genre and wanted to read something that was light and easy. At first, I just reread a lot of fiction books I read when I was younger. I think I was afraid of getting disappointed by something new. Reading for me felt like a time-consuming and difficult activity. If I wasn't ""productive"" or didn't enjoy it, I would be wasting a lot of time and effort. However, I got recommended the Mistborn series from a youtube channel about books and decided to check it out almost on a whim.

I started this book not knowing what I was getting myself into. It was a little bland at first and maybe the only reason I continued was because I really liked Kelsier's character. I found the powers a little ridiculous and every character other than Kelsier a bit boring. As I continued to read, I got more and more into it. I think when all the group's plans started falling apart I was basically in the mentality of ""I can't stop reading this,"" because I really wanted to see Kelsier succeed. 

My favorite part of the book was definitely that fight between Kelsier and the  Insquister. 

*Kelsier ignored the question. “Why only one of you?” he demanded.*

*The creature’s smile deepened. “I won the draw.”*

Something about this fight made me feel like a kid again. I was cheering him on the entire time and when he actually managed to kill the Insquister I was pretty much ecstatic. 

The book definitely wasn't perfect. The first maybe 75% was intriguing but not great. I do get why some people don't like this book. But for me, it was good enough. I had completely forgotten how it felt not being able to put a book down. I don't know if I will read the rest of the series but I will definitely read more fictional books!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8uemyc/the_book_mistborn_the_final_empire_revived_my/,2018-06-28 00:04:10,15,8,books
3i1jc8,"Do I continue with Mistborn, The Final Empire?","So I'm currently 200 pages into Mistborn, The Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson, and in all honesty I'm not really enjoying the book that much. :(

I just find the writing style a bit too simple, repetitive, and unprofound. Almost similar to the Shannara books by Terry Brooks (which I LOVED as a teenager, but probably wouldn't enjoy as much now). 

If I haven't enjoyed what I've read so far, should I cave in? Or is it worth holding out for a good payoff later on?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3i1jc8/do_i_continue_with_mistborn_the_final_empire/,2015-08-23 03:26:13,13,2,books
1sg0m8,"Convince me to keep reading Mistborn: The Final Empire, whats the deal with it?","I'm on chapter 3 and I keep cringing at many of the writing techniques. I've heard good things but it's like he never finished editing it. A little bit more insight on my concerns:

1. The characters are like mannequins on a chess board. Seriously, I feel no attachment to any of them. I'm not invested in the main character Vin at all. It gives very little detail on their thoughts and emotions, and very little development. Inner dialogues with a long gone half-brother just don't cut it.

2. The dialogue, oh god. The character's say things that no person would ever say, they say their motive flat-out, and there is no subtext. They all speak in the same manner and conversations don't converse, they just point things out or explain concepts. Case and point:

*""We’re thieves, gentlemen – and we’re extraordinarily good ones. We can rob the unrobbable and fool the unfoolable. We know how to take an incredibly large task and break it down to manageable pieces, then deal with each of those pieces. We know how to get what we want. These things make us perfect for this particular task.”*

What did I just read, this sounds like a highschooler's essay on leadership and teamwork.

Not dialogue, but I also like this one:

*""But, such power . . . she thought, looking in at her Luck reserve.""*

How are you **looking** at your luck reserve?? It's inside you, all other mentions to it were feeling it, now she is **looking** at it **inside** of her. How do you look at something inside of you?? How...what...I just don't know. I know this is little but it bother's me so much, I mean you're a well known published author, how do you fuck that up?

There's many more, just the one's I could find right now.

3. So many random breaks in the story to explain a concept. There not even fluidly integrated with Vin's train of thought. I understand this is necessary sometimes but when it happens three times in a chapter it's not ok. Example:

*“Why’d he pick you to be his twixt, anyway, Vin?” Ulef asked. “Did he say anything about that?” That’s what the crew assumed—that Kelsier had chosen her to be his contact with Camon’s . . . Milev’s...crew. 
There were two sides to the Luthadel underground. There were the regular crews, like Camon’s. Then there were...the special ones. Groups composed of the extremely skillful* blah blah blah...... three paragraphs of explanation.

That was so jarring I think I lost a tooth.

Oh, and when Kelsier tell her that she is a Mistborn, this is how they relate Mistborn to the world:

*Mistborn. Vin had heard the term before Kelsier had mentioned it to her, of course. Who hadn’t? Yet, the rumors about Mistborn made stories of Inquisitors and Mistings seem rational. It was said that Mistborn were heralds of the mists themselves, endowed with great powers by the Lord Ruler. Only high noblemen could be Mistborn; they were said to be a secret sect of assassins who served him, only going out at night. Reen had always taught her that they were a myth, and Vin had assumed he was right.*

This is informative and nothing else. All the great fantasies are sprinkled with legends and stories within them, to give a frame of reference of how common magic is, how powerful it is seen, and what most people think of it. This is the equivalent of looking up Mistborn in the dictionary, just god dammit.


I'm sorry for this rant, and to whoever enjoyed the book. But does it get better or should I stop now if its bothering me this much. Is it worth it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1sg0m8/convince_me_to_keep_reading_mistborn_the_final/,2013-12-09 05:53:13,25,7,books
8xspu6,The Final Empire is a wonderfully refreshing take on the genre.,"Only a couple of chapters into it and I’m very excited for my Uni work to clear up so I can sit down and tackle it properly. 
   I’ve always been a huge fan of fantasy, but never really delved into books beyond my early teen years. Recently I decided to delve back into the genre to aid my own fantasy writing efforts and, whilst I could do without some subject matters (sexual themes presented thus far haven’t been as subtle or intricate as I feel they should have been) and some characters feel a bit flat so far (Vin mostly) I certainly understand the appeal. Allomancy is a fascinating concept, as are the inquisitors.

4o3tug,I just finished Mistborn - The Final Empire. Here are my thoughts (spoilers ahead)...,"So...
I just finished Mistborn 1 and for the most part, I'm pretty satisfied. The magic system in the book worked really well and was unique from other fantasy books.

The story itself was really well done I felt. Having multiple stages of the rebellion exectued over the course of the book was really cool way to tell a story, and the different characters, while I may not have been as connected to them as characters in other books, still did a good job of telling the story.

My main big question coming out of the book and moving onto the second one is Kelsier. When Kelsier died, I really didn't expect it to stick, and he would return a chapter or so later. But he didn't. I feel like the way he went out was a little anti-climactic, and I really enjoyed his character, so I'm sad to see him go.

I'm interested if the next books in the series keep the tension and sense of mystery as this book? I'm not sure how they are going to play out without Kelsier, as I feel he was a major player in this book, and it would not have worked without him.

Well, those are my thoughts surrounding this book. Definitely an enjoyable ride for the most part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4o3tug/i_just_finished_mistborn_the_final_empire_here/,2016-06-14 21:33:33,12,8,books
yb61u,Elantris or The Final Empire?,"Any Sanderson fans out there? I've never read a fantasy book before (except The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit), and I want to give one a shot. The works of Sanderson seem appealing to me, so I'm deciding between Elantris or The Final Empire. 

I'm on a non fiction reading diet at the moment, so I only want to read one fantasy work. Elantris seemed like the ideal novel, but The Final Empire also seems to be able to be read as a self contained novel, and if I really like it there is the rest of the Mistborn series to go through.

So, any advice? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yb61u/elantris_or_the_final_empire/,2012-08-16 07:26:03,1,1,books
oyh1vo,The Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson,"I finished the first trilogy and was blown away by the ending. Branderson is a legendary world builder. What I loved the most about the books (other than the story itself) was the magic system. It was almost scientific with all the rules carefully given to us throughout all the books. The epigraphs were a nice addition. Overall the series gets 4 out of 5 stars from me. 
(SPOILERS AHEAD!)


# Book 1: The Final Empire

The Final Empire was definitely a good book as it draws you in with the detailed world and deep lore. Lots of action and adventure which I enjoy immensely. Kelsier was my favorite character in this book mainly because he was kind of morally ambiguous but still unquestionably a hero. The dialogue felt a little awkward and stilted at times but other than that I don't have any other complaints. (I really liked the concept of the Inquisitors and they get even better in the last book.) 

# Book 2: The Well of Ascension

I have mixed feelings about this one. We see Vin growing in power and some new interesting characters are introduced. Other side characters are also brought into focus, mainly Sazed. I thought that this book dragged a bit in the middle with all the politics and other stuff. It still had many impressive moments here and there. I would say the ending redeemed this book. What an explosive ending! I immediately picked up the third book 'cause I couldn't wait. Sazed was the best character in this book for me.

# Book 3: The Hero of Ages

This is the best book in the trilogy. All loose ends are resolved. It blew my mind how even the most insignificant detail from book 1 fell into place. You could tell that Branderson had planned ahead and he wasn't just making things up on the go. The ending in this one was even more explosive. Although the 2 major characters died, it was still a satisfying end. My complaint is that I didn't really connect to the characters. It was confirmed when I didn't get as much of an emotional response I thought I would when Vin and Elend died. It was more like a general sadness than anything else. Needless to say, it was the plot that made me like this series more rather than the characters. But it was enjoyable anyways.

I plan on reading Six of Crows next even though I haven't read the Grisha trilogy. People have told me you can do that with not many problems.

wr77c4,I just finished my goal of reading all of the Hugo award winners for best novel (including retros),"For a few years now, I've been trying to read all of the Hugo award winners. It was an easy way to read great books and experience a wide variety. I like how it removed choice from the matter. Thought folks might appreciate my random awards/observations:

**Favorite book(s)**: *Dune, Ender's Game, Way Station, The Three-Body Problem, The Graveyard Book, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, The Fountains of Paradise,* and *Dreamsnake*.

**Least-favorite book(s):** *The Yiddish Policemen's Union* and *Neuromancer*

**Most sexist book:** (sci-fi books going back to the 30s have a lot of sexism): Conjure Wife - The premise is that all women are witches who use their powers to help their husbands' careers. 

**Most unique aliens:** Giving this to author Vernor Vinge. Both *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky* both had really unique and strange aliens that the author really made you feel that strangeness.

**Best series:** *Remembrance of Earth's Past* \- the series which *The Three-Body Problem* is in.

Finally, some general thoughts on sci-fi the genre. I've realized it's a silly genre. Sci-Fi spans a huge gamut of types of books. The only reason they're connected is because they're in space. For example, *A Memory Called Empire* easily could've been set in 15th century Europe without too much change. It's pretty much just a book about palace politics. I never would've read it if it were set in Earth's past. But, now that it's in space, I like it!  I don't know why this matters to me and if it means I should give more genres a chance.

Overall, I really enjoyed working through this list and would recommend this approach to all sci-fi lovers.

I admit, I approached this series with caution after coming across reviews that labeled the first book as a slow burner. However, I'm thrilled I took the leap. Michael J.

z8vbz9,What Book(s) Did You Consume The Fastest?,"I am the type of person who forces himself to start something before he enjoys it, be it exercise, books, or even movies. I generally have to spend effort to continue something and not give up halfway from boredom or laziness. With that being said, sometimes I start something, get hooked and at that point I consume it like a madman. I started reading this book series once called ""Ascendance of a bookworm"" and I immediately got hooked, I finished the first volume in a day, something that I have never done before, I started the second volume the next day literally the moment I woke up. My addiction didn't stop and I spent the next 12 days reading all 20 volumes. At this point in my life I had never read this much. At that time, I was on break from school and college was way off, and so I spent every waking hour reading. 

I sorta miss that feeling of being completely engrossed on one thing, I get distracted easily, and was looking for a similarly addictive series. I have heard only good things about Brandon Sanderson and so I started reading Mistborn sometime in the last two months. I finished with The Final Empire and The Well Of Ascension, and while I certainly did enjoy them and think the series is pretty good, I didn't consume them nearly as fast as I did when I was reading Ascendance Of A Bookworm.

w082ac,"So, I just finished reading The Way Of Kings By Brandon Sanderson. WOW.","The only other Book I read by Sanderson was The Final Empire and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So coming into The Way of Kings I thought I had a good indication on what to expect. I was wrong.  The first thing that stood out to me was the world building in this book. It was so well realized compared to The Final Empire. Just how much detail went into this world was astounding.     The magic was very interesting. I really thought that Sanderson did a great job creating Characters with different voices. Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, Wit, and Jasnah just to name a few. They all had their own unique voice.  I would be lying if I didn’t say that Kaladin wasn’t my favorite I have a soft spot for unexpectedly strong leaders. Sanderson also made me enjoy the flashback chapters. I’ve never been a big fan of flash back chapters. But the ones in this book really felt like they were important and not just written for the sake of word count. Even though it was a 1,000 page book it didn’t feel like that at all. I was worried a little because Stormlight is a pillar in the community and is beloved by so many people and I was thinking that what if it doesn’t click for me. That wasn’t the case I’m a huge fan . The interludes was another part that I looked forward to. Even though we didn’t spend that much time with Szeth I felt like he was a in the book more than he actually was. His arc was one of my favorite parts. 

I’m a bit sad that I didn’t get Sanderson’s kickstarter, I didn’t want to invest $200+ for a author I wasn’t fully sure I would like his writing. Hindsight is 20/20.

16k0zui,The book that got me into fiction,"I’ve never been much of a reader. I would usually pick up a book, read a few pages and feel like hours have passed and put it down. Whenever I've read fiction it's mostly because of my love for an adaptation of its (Game of Thrones, Dune). But reading those books I felt like I was cheating. It was as if I had crutches for my imagination because of having seen the tv show or movie. I had given up on ever expeirncing that feeling everyone talks about of being able to make up complex worlds and settings in their head from the author's words. But it FINALLY happened to me!

The book that did it for me was The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson!

I was into it right from the first chapter. And I felt an immense sense of accomplishment when I understood the magic system and could pciture Kelsier flying across rooftops steelpushing on coins. This book did that thing everyone talks about! It transported me to a new world and made me feel like I was actually there!! 

I'm so happy that I got to experince that. Thank you Brandon Sanderson. I'm waiting for the second book which will get delivered to me soon and I can't wait to read it.

The Wallfacer program and ETO counter program Wallbreaker were very cleverly designed, as it made the characters mysterious, kept the story fresh and then explained their masterplans. A big plus was the jump in time which gave the reader a view into the future and the protagonists the consequences of their actions. The story had such epic proportions, I now cannot stop thinking about The Great Ravine, The Battle of Darkness, The Dark Forest theory and where the surviving two space ships will end up (hope that will be answered in 'Death's End').

oakc5c,Mistborn vs. The Fifth Season: A surprising number of similarities.,"When I went on vacation a few weeks ago, I happened to pick up both *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson and *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin. They are both highly acclaimed, but I didn't realize they had so much in common. I'm not going to type out all of my thoughts about how the two compare; that would be quite a wall of text. Instead, I'm just going to list a bunch of parallels and differences to try to generate discussion. 

I'll spoiler tag, but I don't think anything in my lists would ""ruin"" the reading experience of either.

**Similarities**

* ""Hard"" fantasy with definite rules for magic powers. 
* No spells or scrolls, just innate abilities similar to superpowers.
* Powers are usually inherited, but not in a predictable way.
* Obvious slave-and-master relationships integral to society.
* Lots of ash and volcanoes.
* The apocalypse has already happened - Just now in The Fifth Season, and 1,000 years ago for Mistborn.
* >!Empires in decline. Sanzed is still powerful, but seemingly more as a cultural force than a military one. The Final Empire still has total control in theory, but iirc the distant plantation nobles have been gaining independence for hundreds of years. !<
* >!The Empires both fall. Sanzed at the beginning of the book, The Final Empire in the end (sort of). !<
* >!Lots of dangling threads of lore encouraging you to read the sequel: steel inquisitor spikes, the deepness, mist wraiths, stone eaters, obelisks, the facet, the Moon. !<

**Differences**

* Guardians vs Steel Inquisitors
* Orogenes vs skaa
* Powers for slaves vs powers for nobles
* Power from self into Earth vs power from earth (metals) into self. (I know orogenes actually use kinetic energy from ambient heat for most of what they do, but it does make them tired, and they can do it at will instead of needing to drink little bottles of metal shavings.)
* Faceless bureaucracy of Sanzed and Guardians vs The Emperor
* Father Earth vs The Deepness?
* >!The Moon vs The Deepness? !<
* >!Whatever the fuck the socket was vs. The Deepness? !<
* >!Alabaster vs the Emperor (they both chose to destroy the world) !<



P.S. I've only read the first books, so please spoiler tag anything related to sequels. 

P.P.S. I liked the Fifth Season more because the prose was more varied and interesting, basically more fun to read (second person narration?!).

The original 3 books of Isaac Asimov's foundation series (Foundation, Foundation's Empire, Second Foundation) are among my favourites.

The format these stories helps with their enjoyment greatly. Each story helped to set up logical, worldbuilding consequences of where the last story left off, and chronicle a natural evolution of societal institutions and how they would lead to the reemergence of a post-dark age society. 

While they introduced new characters and their struggles against the institutions that were failing their specific eras, the real fun was in seeing how each individual crisis was solved through the clever thinking of the viewpoint character.

Each of these stories was meant to represent such logical progressions in patterns of history, that it was capable of being predicted for well in advance by the mathematics of a pseudo-messiah.

While not necessarily a hard sci-fi, until the crisis of the last book, which involves an unaccounted for anomaly in the form of ESP, the series is pretty grounded in realistic worldbuilding. 

The fundamental pretense of being about to predict history in advance via mathematics may require a suspension of belief, but I could defend that with enough historical records and meticulous advances in social sciences, it isn't impossible to form a unifying theory of group behaviour that could be contingent on statistical probabilities.

The last two books (Foundation's Edge, and Foundation and Earth), written far later in Asimov's career (and as told in the forward of the former, for a boatload of cash) followed a different format. They were long-form narratives following two (later three) specific characters, as they journeyed across a series of locales in their investigative work, first to hunt down a conspiracy affecting the new galactic government, and then later to find Earth, as it remained a loose end in the viewpoint character's mind.

Foundation's Edge was good, not great. Part of it is a story of two diametrically opposed social institutions being forced into battle with one another, and ultimately falling prey to a wildcard third one. The third institution is somewhat contrived, but the story still had some interesting intrigue.

They also introduce a character who feels a little too ""male fantasy"" for my liking. A psychic hivemind woman who's primary descriptions and actions imply that she is very attractive, who exclusively (and suspiciously) is romantically compelled by the somewhat elderly, professor character. I don't wish to say this is unrealistic or unfeasible, but part of this felt a little too much like a self-insert ""getting the babe"" for my liking.

The story also leans further into ESP, though does so in a way that is at least fascinating. The form which the hivemind takes was different than most other media depictions (like the Borg, Zerg, etc...), and so it was at least intellectually interesting. This drifted the story away from the grounded worldbuilding I spoke about prior, but at least it had something going for it.

There is a conclusive end to the series here, in the form of a decision the main character is forced to make about which institution to rule the galaxy. I find the forced decision contrived as an end for a series about the natural progression of history, and felt a little more like how I would expect a ""choices matter"" videogame to conclude.

Which brings me to Foundation and Earth. I forced myself through two fifths of this novel, and I have finally just given up and read a summary of the rest. 

The inciting incident is weak. It was merely that the main character had an 'intuitive feeling' that there is something important on Earth. The rational being that it is still a mystery to him, the other characters, and the historical record. 

The format of the story is largely the just moving from planet to planet while the protagonists try to gather clues on the location of Earth.

This 'episodic' format isn't necessarily bad, but it is missing the kind of lore that made me fall in love with the original trilogy. 

Where I finally got sick of this series was when they go to a specific planet with a lot of sexual repression. The main character ends up being detained by a woman who appears to be a Spartan-like bureaucrat, but the conflict is resolved with hot, freaky sex. 

Hot freaky sex without nuance too, I might add. Most of the viewpoint character's thoughts are about how rockin' that bod is for an older lady, and more serious psychological exploration into this situation never really comes about.

Despite having deep respect for Asimov's work, and for his impact on culture at large, when I got to this point in the book, I felt like I was reading the work of pervy old man who was untouchable by his editors.

I tried reading past this point, but after a few more pages of what felt like maid-and-butler dialogue, I finally decided that this is too much fluff when I have many other books to read, and just gave up.

Despite my stern dislike of this last book, and my general qualms with the previous one, I haven't seen many opinions online which have shared my viewpoint.

With two other serialized sci-fi series that I love (Dune, and Ender's Game), there are very strong opinions about where to stop reading the series. Yet I have seen much less discourse on the matter about the Foundation Series.

I'm curious as to other people's insights on the series.  Did I miss out on any really interesting pieces on dropping where I did (including skipping the prequels), or did I miss a general consensus to finish after the third book?

764oj0,Mistborn Books - why doesn’t the plot progress?,"I’ve finished The Final Empire but I felt in the first half of the book the plot didn’t even move. I almost quit reading, but that ending was fantastic. Now I’m reading The Well of Ascension and the exact same thing is happening. Halfway through and the same situation exists since the beginning of the story. I find myself less and less interested. 

What about other Sanderson books? I’m considering not reading Stormlight or other Mistborn books because of this. I’m hoping things get better though. 

On the flip side, the Kingkiller Chronicles is a slow series but the plot actually moves along so it keeps my interest and feels like a much better series, even if the plot meanders a bit.

>Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home and see red sails on the horizon.  
>  
>The Empire of Masks is coming, armed with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru’s island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She’ll be exactly what they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her people free.  
>  
>In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru will need to untangle this land’s intricate web of treachery - and conceal her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.

177mova,What Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher,"I’m three chapters into T. Kingfisher’s *What Moves the Dead* and I’m struggling a bit. The vibes are great, opening line was great. Love the tags, the representation. But there’s something about the voice that bugs me. Let me share some examples.

> “[My ancestors] finally settled in Gallacia, which is near Moldavia and even smaller. Presumably they settled there because nobody else wanted it. The Ottoman Empire didn’t even bother to make us a vassal state, if that tells you anything.”

> “Denton was a tall, lanky man with silvering hair, probably approaching fifty if not over the edge. He wore his clothes as if they were clothes rather than symbols of rank, and his mustache was too long for fashion… Ah. American. That explained the clothes and the way he stood with his legs wide and his elbows out…”

> “I mentioned that we were a fierce warrior people, right? Even though we were bad at it?”

I thought the introduction to Eugenia Potter was fine, but just about every other moment has something off. The narrator can feel a bit pretentious, and sometimes it sounds like they’re doing a voiceover for a bad movie. I don’t know.

I’ve never DNFed a book, I don’t want to. I see praise here and elsewhere, I want to like it. But these moments really take me out of it. I want to know, for those that finished this, does it keep going like this? It seems like it’s limited to introduction s maybe?

lmqj56,Finished The Well of Ascension. Quick query about The Hero of Ages.,"I just finished off The Well of Ascension and on the whole rather enjoyed it. I don’t think it was as good as The Final Empire. After an interesting opening and set-up it feels like it spends around 300-400 pages in the middle of the book effectively spinning its wheels a bit, I feel it could definitely have done with a pass to edit out some of the fluff. The ending though is pretty nuts and it ramps up so much in intensity for the last 100 pages which made the whole thing easily worthwhile.

It has enough of a cliff-hanger to make me really want to launch straight into the third book but with it being another lengthy 800 page I need to know: **is there is less Teen angst / melo-drama in the third book?** The love triangle that developed in book two was completely unnecessary and made me actively dislike the protagonist never mind her constant ‘DOES HE LOVE ME, PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME’ internal monologues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lmqj56/finished_the_well_of_ascension_quick_query_about/,2021-02-18 16:24:08,5,8,books
169b8eo,A (very late) review of the 58th annual Nebula Award novel nominees,"I decided this year to read all the Nebula Award nominees for best novel (still working on getting my hands on all the novellas), and I wanted to share my thoughts even though it's a little late seeing as the awards were announced.

*Babel* by RF Kuang: Obvious winner. Well-written with extreme attention to historical detail; if you've ever had to read Said's *Orientalism* or anything by Olaudah Equaino, this book feels remarkably familiar. Kuang did an excellent job of capturing early 19th century colonial England with a fantasy twist to really drive home the anti-colonial ideas of the book. The co-opting of the languages of colonized peoples for magic was an inspired fantasy twist. Definitely a more intellectual/academic read that deviates quite a bit from typical fantasy; I found the footnotes delightful.

*The Mountain in the Sea* by Ray Nayler: This one took me a couple tries to get into it, but it was strong once I did. An excellent near-future dystopian focusing on corporatocracy and environmentalism. The exploration of alien intelligences was also strong. I particularly liked the way Nayler wove the different storylines together.

*Nona the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir: well-written and enjoyable; a good addition to the Locked Tomb series. However, I don't think it's the strongest in the series, even. Sort of an *Empire Strikes Back* situation; I feel like it was the build-up for the payoff in the final book. The plot pacing and suspense were excellent, however; definitely a series to read if you haven't.

*Nettle and Bone* by T Kingfisher: I always enjoy a twist on an old fairytale or legend, and this book had that feel despite not trying to re-imagine a particular story. I'm a big Kingfisher fan, and this one will scratch that itch for anyone in the same boat. But it was a little predictable if you know her work. A good read with some fun wordbuilding and a strong female lead, but it's also not doing anything we haven't seen before in other feminist fairy tales.

*Spear* by Nicola Griffith: my second place pick for the award. It's a clever and well-executed mashup of Arthurian legend and Celtic folklore that's further enhanced with a queer re-imagining for the protagonist. Quick and easy to read, but readers familiar with the originating stories will appreciate Griffith's new version.

*Legends and Lattes* by Travis Baldree: Easily the weakest of the set; it's a cutesy D&D fanfic that doesn't worry too much about details like consistent characterization or believable plot developments. It's a light and easy feel-good novel if you don't think about it enough to start asking question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/169b8eo/a_very_late_review_of_the_58th_annual_nebula/,2023-09-03 23:03:29,20,75,books
169zorj,Mythology Reading Group Upcoming Reads: 'The Aeneid' by Virgil and 'Republic' by Plato,"Over at r/AYearOfMythology we are getting ready for our **next group read: 'The Aeneid' by Virgil.**  


'The Aeneid' is an epic poem written by Virgil in Roman times but it was inspired by Homer's epics - 'The Iliad' and 'The Odyssey'. 'The Aeneid' follows Aeneas, a Trojan prince and a warrior who fought during the Trojan War. Aeneas made a few quick cameo scenes in the Iliad, but here we follow him as he leaves Troy and tries to make a new life for himself in Italy after the end of the war. Even though the 'Aeneid' was written centuries after Homer's works, it ties in with them almost completely and is seen as one of the 'big three' epics based on Greek/Roman mythology.

 'The Aeneid' is also really interesting historically speaking because it acts as a bridge between the Ancient Greek and Roman empires. The Romans used the myth of Aeneas to connect them directly to the Greek mythology, using it as a founding myth for their own empire. 

  
**We will be starting on the week of 10/09/23 and will be reading two 'books' (aka chapters) per week until 21/10/23.** We will be posting reading discussions every weekend, with the full posting schedule being as follows:

xux9l1,The Divine Comedy is really bothering me.,"\*Contains spoilers for a book written in the 14th Century.\*

This book keeps getting recommended to me so I finally decided to dive into it. At first I really enjoyed it, the descriptions of the different parts of Hell and Limbo were really interesting and the prose was beautiful to read. Then I started getting in deeper towards the inner circles. I kept expecting to find really bad sinners who were being punished for horrible deeds. But mostly everyone in Hell, even down the the 8th circle, were being tortured in the worst, most terrifying ways, for the most trivial of crimes - for all eternity.

For example, in the 8th circle, in one of the Bolgias, I have encountered the worst punishment yet - people who are being tormented by darkness and terrible boils which make them unable to move, and thirst which is unquenchable. One of the guys is in there for counterfeiting coins, which, yeah, was pretty bad since he almost single-handedly brought down the economy of Florence, but there is another guy next to him, receiving this harsh and unjust punishment, who just so happened to be on the wrong side of the Trojan War. He even complains about it to his partner, but I guess nothing is to be done. Dante REALLY hates the Greeks because Virgil is his bro and he wrote about Aeneas founding the Roman Empire, which Dante also approves of (he thinks of himself as a Roman descendant). 

So this brings me to the thing that bothers me about this book: Everyone that Dante doesn't like is getting punished for all eternity for merely existing in the wrong circumstances. Did you fight against the Trojans in the Trojan War? Hell. Did you rebel against the Roman Empire? Hell. Are you from somewhere that is not Florence, and lied to someone one time? Hell. Are you a Florentine but from the wrong political party? Hell. Do you have a different religion that is not Catholicism? Probably Hell - unless you were a Roman or a Trojan or something, then you get a pass. Spoiler alert: Mohammed does NOT get off easy. 

I'm having a really hard time relating to these protagonists when they seem to see these terrible punishments as Justified and Right in the Name of God. Every time Dante expresses discomfort or pity for the poor sinners who can't catch a break, Virgil reminds him that it is WRONG to feel bad for them because this is God's Divine Will. He even runs across one of his best friends who is being punished for being a homosexual, but he's not supposed to pity him or help him in any way. It just seems so unfair. I just can't bring myself to finish the book because of this. 

So tell me, does it get better? Is there something I'm missing? I know this was written in the Middle Ages, but not everyone in Florence at that time was super hard-core religious (you can tell because Dante makes them have their skin ripped off or something like that), so I'm having a lot of trouble forgiving the author for being so self-righteous and unjust to his sinners. Why is Dante so great that he gets this grand and enlightening tour of the Afterlife, but everyone else has to live in a tar pit, or have their feet burned off forever? I can't see the justice in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xux9l1/the_divine_comedy_is_really_bothering_me/,2022-10-03 22:19:06,47,16,books
il8gs8,"Hi, I’m Ryan Van Loan, debut fantasy author of THE SIN IN THE STEEL, Book One in The Fall of the Gods series. I’m a former infantry NCO and lifelong foodie, traveler, and reader of ALL things books-related. AMA!","Hey r/books! As a fellow redditor (longtime lurker, occasional poster) I’m excited to hang out and talk about...well whatever you want to ask me :-) 

My debut fantasy from Tor Books, THE SIN IN THE STEEL, is the story of Sambuciña ‘Buc’ Alhurra, the compellingly chaotic heroine who is part Sherlock Holmes, part young Indiana Jones and ALL herself. The first private investigator in her world, Buc’s too smart for her own good with a razor-sharp blade hidden up her sleeve and an even sharper tongue. She’s finally landed the case that will set her and her partner-in-crime solving, Eld, up for life...if they survive. With her wit and Eld’s sword they’ll have to best pirate queens, mages, and uncharted seas to solve a mystery empires have failed to uncover.
 
Unfortunately for Buc, the gods are involved and they have other plans.

Unfortunately for the gods, so does Buc.

Think Pirates of the Carribean meets Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes!

In a prior life, I served six years in the United States Army Infantry (PA National Guard) as an NCO, including a combat tour in Eastern Afghanistan. You’ll find that experience influences my writing quite a bit. I think folks dig my action scenes, but I’m far more interested in the beat that comes AFTER the action. What impact it has on the characters, on the plot, and the consequences of violence. 

These days I work in nonprofit healthcare innovation and when I’m not writing (I started in 2009 and am wrapping up my 11th book, the final book in The Fall of the Gods series) I love traveling and eating. I’ve been everywhere from the Caribbean to Europe to the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Obviously, it being 2020 none of that is happening for the foreseeable future, so I’m coping by planning all the places I want to go to next when we find a vaccine. Inshallah.

1ar0spo,The Will of the Many by James Islington is incredible,"I got this audiobook (which is incredibly done by the narrator, btw) and binged it in a few days. I just finished it a few moments ago and needed to come straight here to discuss it with someone, anyone!

I am finding it hard to discuss in a concise way what makes this book so incredible, so here are some bullet points of what impressed me: 

- The Roman-Empire-inspired setting evokes a very distinct country and social structure that strongly impact the world these characters live in.
- The characters are all well-fleshed out and feel very much like complex, real people stuck in difficult situations.
- The author doesn't handhold you when it comes to describing the worldbuilding or the magic system, but expertly feeds you information so that you learn it at the same time as the main character, Vis, learns it or you learn it from Vis directly himself (which gives a sense of how smart and capable he is as a leading character).
- The book has really strong themes about ... colonialism isn't the right word, but how culture and the identity of a country and its people can be demolished and  ""civilized"". The trauma that comes with this, the resentment of the oppressed, the entitlement of the oppressor... all of that plays major themes in this book. To me, it works as a great metaphor for how the common man suffers under late-stage capitalism, too, which made the book feel very relevant in this day and age. 
- While the story has very adult content (in terms of human suffering, evil human actions, gore, violence, and horror), it also manages to set the latter half of the book in a school with a final exam (so to speak) that feels almost hunger games-y? But it's done in such a way that feels very mature, with very high stakes, and not YA at all. I was stressed for Vis every time he had to spy or sneak around to uncover mysteries. The consequences he faces if he were to be caught are realistic for the setting, which makes the tension high and the consequences that he and other students face feel very real. 
- While there were moments where I could predict what was happening in the story, much of it felts so original that I was at the edge of my seat wondering what Islington would do next. 
- The climax of the story is very well foreshadowed, leads into a really satisfying outcome that is slightly cliff hanger-y. Despite the cliff hanger, I feel satisfied that I got what I needed out of this story and I'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series. Cliff hangers normally leave me frustrated, like the author is trying to use a ""gotcha"" to make you come back for the next book. But this book actually earned its cliff hanger and I'm eager for book 2. 
- Vis's backstory is revealed throughout the story bit by bit and I really felt for everything he went through.  The author manages to toe that line between writing a tragic backstory and making his character go through trauma porn (that has no real reason to be that extreme).  I really like Vis, who is a realistic, smart, capable guy with a strong set of morals. I would trust this guy as a leader. 

I'm sure there are so many other things I could talk about that make this book excellent, but I'm just buzzing from how awesome this book made me feel while reading it. Like I'm coming down from a book high or something! 

This is the first book I've read from this author and I feel like I should go read his other books now while I wait for book 2 to come out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ar0spo/the_will_of_the_many_by_james_islington_is/,2024-02-14 23:14:53,14,34,books

wbcyja,>!Spoiler!< The Curse in The Last Temptation of Christ,"I am reading the Last Temptation of Christ by Kazantzakis, and I'm on the 12th chapter so far. There is a confusing ""character""- if we may call it such- of whom I don't get the meaning or interpretation. The character is called ""The curse"". As Jesus finally decides to go and seek God, he gets out of his parents' home and sets out towards a monastery near Capernaum. While he is travelling. He keeps hearing the sound of feet following him, yet when he looks around he doesn't see anyone. Along the way he keeps trying to reach the monastery, but at some moment the thing that was following him finally reveals itself. It has a woman's body, wearing an armor, but with head of an eagle. Jesus says he knows what she is, he calls her ""the curse"". But what curse? Is it the curse of him having to bear the fate of crucifixion? Is it the curse of the suffering of his people?  Also the armor and the eagle head maybe reffer to the roman empire  but I don't see why is it a curse who's following Jesus specifically. At another moment when Judas doesn't kill him, Jesus looks at the curse and tells her he is sorry, not today. Meaning he appologises to her for not dying that night.

103f112,Connecting Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson to the song Rule #4 by Fish in a Birdcage,"**!Light spoiler warning for Mistborn!**

I am currently rereading Mistborn, and I heard this song again and thought that there was a connection between them. I’ve shared the lyrics to the song below as well as my thoughts as to how the two fit together. 

### Rule #4 - Fish in a Birdcage Lyrics

*I'm a fish inside a birdcage*

*My brother always sings me songs*

*With his beak he tries to soothe me*

*He makes me feel that I belong*

**Note:** **The** ***fish*** **is Vin in this case, and the** ***brother*** **is Kelsier. The** ***cage*** **is the Lord Ruler’s reign, and his oppression of the skaa. Kelsier makes her feel that she** ***belongs*** **by adding her to his crew.**

*He has a wild imagination* 

*And tells me things That must be true* 

**Note: Keliser is perceived to be overly ambitious by the other characters, aka having a** ***wild imagination*****. But they, including Vin, follow him regardless.**

*Like there's a world where I can take flight*

*where I can freely move*

**Note: Kelsier teaches her about Allomancy, and helps her learn to** ***fly*** **with her abilities.** 

\[Chorus\]

*So carry me from these walls,*

*Brother of mine,*

*Show me this world outside,*

*It has to be true,*

*I'm counting on you,* 

*To be my wings and my eyes*

**Note: Vin comes to rely on Kelsier to help her leave her past life behind, and to raise the skaa above their oppression. For the first time she truly trusts someone.**

*As I breathe into our silence*

*There's a voice that comforts me*

**Note: This part fits with Sazed and the rest of the crew, who help** ***comfort*** **and support Vin as they befriend her over the course of the plan.**

*It's a voice of understanding*

*It's the voice of empathy*

**Note: You could also say the voice of** ***understanding*** **and** ***empathy*** **could be Elend as well, considering his role in Vin’s character arc.**

*Wings of feathers, tails and fin tips* 

*We feel the world so differently*

*You brought me more than I could ask for*

*indistinguishability*

**Note: The skaa and the nobleman experience the final empire so differently, so teaching Vin to become** ***indistinguishable*** **from the nobles was a task within itself.** 

**Her time with the nobles and the crew helps her find her true self as well, which ends up making her very distinguishable in the end.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/103f112/connecting_mistborn_by_brandon_sanderson_to_the/,2023-01-04 21:05:31,1,0,books
146p7a,What are your favorite book series that are longer- minimum 5 books in the series,"I know there have been threads about peoples' favorite series before, but this one is for longer ones.  I love nothing more than getting into a great series because who doesn't love a series that keeps you up until the early morning and then makes you get out of bed to find the next one and continue the story.

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, but from there, it's pretty original world that he creates.  There's a minor issue in that book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder, more fantastical elements.

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone, but I think guys are more likely to like it.

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, I'm messing up the term) who is captured by Danes who raise him.  He loves the Danes and follows their beliefs.  But he becomes a warlord of Alfred the Great, who is responsible for creating the idea of England instead of separate kingdoms.  Uthred is another great character.  He's fun to listen to, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, his uniting of the Mongol people, and their conquests.  Later goes on to follow his descendants.  Really good historical fiction.  First book is a tad slow for a little bit, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship, accuracy, and detail.  7 books take you from 110-27 BC.  Very long books that are pretty dense.  But the time period is well documented and she does a great job with it.  There are plenty of real characters that she uses that are all fascinating.

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period, this is what you want to read.  Great books.  Must reads.  Hornblower gets a nod, but O'Brian's series is better.

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain, but they go all over the Empire.  Pretty good to the historical record for the most part.

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good, plots interesting, and it shits all over something like Dan Brown in terms of a light read that is actually good.

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books, all really good.  Read it.

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

w9ik0e,"Hi, I’m Ryan Van Loan, fantasy author of The Fall of the Gods series from Tor Books. I just completed the trilogy with my latest book, THE MEMORY IN THE BLOOD that hit shelves this month. I’m a former infantry NCO & lifelong foodie, beekeeper, traveler, & reader of ALL things books-related. AMA!","Hey r/books! As a fellow redditor (longtime lurker, occasional poster) I’m excited to hang out and talk about writing, finishing a series for the first time, books, food, you ask, I’ll tell. 

My series tells the story of Sambuciña ‘Buc’ Alhurra, an autodidact streetrat who is part Sherlock Holmes, part Arya Stark and ALL herself. Buc’s too smart for her own good with a razor-sharp blade hidden up her sleeve and an even sharper tongue. She and her swordsman partner-in-crime-solving, Eld, are the first private investigators in a world controlled by trading companies and empires and Gods caught in an endless war. Determined to upend their corrupt society, Buc and Eld find themselves facing off against pirate queens, mages, uncharted seas and eventually the aforementioned Gods themselves. 

It's adventure fantasy with heart and there’s a lot of comparisons to Scott Lynch’s Lies of Locke Lamora meets Pirates of the Caribbean vibes. I’ll take that. The series began with The Sin in the Steel, put Buc and Eld through the ringer in The Justice in Revenge, and has Buc with her back against the wall rallying her ragtag group of found family for a final stand in The Memory in the Blood.

In a prior life, I served six years in the United States Army Infantry (PA National Guard) as an NCO, including a combat tour in Eastern Afghanistan. You’ll find that experience influences my writing quite a bit. I think folks dig my action scenes, but I’m far more interested in the beat that comes AFTER the action. What impact it has on the characters, on the plot, and the consequences of violence. The series is also known for its worldbuilding and magic systems (plural). Ultimately though, it comes back to the character and we see everything through Buc’s eyes and hear it through her (rather profane) voice.

hahyqm,STAR WARS: HEIR TO THE EMPIRE - re-reading the legendary Star Wars novel published 30 years ago,"I started re-reading the original *Star Wars* Expanded Universe novels, starting with HEIR TO THE EMPIRE by Timothy Zahn, which kickstarted it all and inspired George Lucas to come back and make more movies (since the Zahn trilogy shot to the top of the charts, becoming a bestseller and showing Lucas there was still tons of interest in the galaxy far, far away).

I am both reading the book and listening to the audiobook. Before I get into the paperback book, I will just say this about the audiobook—it is, by far, the greatest reading of any book I have ever listened to. Marc Thompson does impeccable impressions of Luke, Han, Threepio, all of them, and there are sound effects and even John Williams’s music in the background. Jesus Christ, it makes you wish these had been films instead.

Now to the book. Re-reading this book series, I was afraid it would not have aged well. I could not have been more wrong. Not only did it age well, it excels where so many modern sci-fi and fantasy stories fall short. It is not just fantasy, it is HEROIC FANTASY with a truly excellent cast and plot.

So let me enumerate all the reasons this series still holds up, and stands above all other Star Wars novels, and why it has some people saying it is the best SW story ever told, perhaps even above THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.

**The characters:**

THRAWN:  What a villain. Inspired by Sherlock Holmes, none of Grand Admiral Thrawn’s chapters are written from his point of view, but rather Captain Palleon’s POV (the same way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never wrote a story from Holmes’s viewpoint, only Waston’s). As with Watson, we get to be the outsider wondering about the genius of Holmes/Thrawn, how he came to a conclusion with so little information, and then get a delicious description as he lists the details, clearly delineating the logic that allowed him to conquer our heroes. He can dissect the combat capabilities of other sentient species just by studying their art—a concept I’ve never seen in fiction before—and though he is in control of the last remains of the Imperial Remnant, he is giving the New Republic hell, and all by himself he is poised to take back control over the galaxy.

It would have been easy to make another Emperor-type Force-user as the main villain, but Timothy Zahn instead went with a tactical genius. And man, is Star Wars better for it!

MARA JADE:  A mysterious woman who has a dark secret that I won’t reveal here, and who utterly despises Luke Skywalker, also for mysterious reasons. But she is strong in the Force, even has a little training perhaps. She’s also cunning, and able to one-up Luke without using the Force.

LUKE, HAN, AND LEIA:  Like any good sequel, the characters feel the exact same…and yet they have grown. Luke is becoming much the monk, with a few doubts about how well he’ll be able to train future Jedi (he even gets a final visit from Obi-Wan’s ghost in his opening chapter, telling him, “You are not the last of the old Jedi…but the first of the new.” Which immediately sets Luke upon a quest of self-discovery). Han is as irascible as ever, but rather than hiding his love for Leia as he did in the films, they are now married and Leia is pregnant with twins. They butt heads still, such as when Han tries to keep her out of danger, but it is done out of LOVE now, and not just two people being stubborn. Leia has never been more capable as a character, with so much agency she leapt out as a new favorite character of mine BECAUSE of these books. She’s learning the ways of the Force, while ALSO being a diplomat, while ALSO worrying about her twins-to-be, while ALSO fighting off attempts by Imperials to kidnap her.

LANDO:  Lando is Lando, and God is it good to see him again in this way. Suave, savvy, and always gambling and taking risks, always with a mind towards profit and skullduggery.

TALON KARRDE:  A new smuggler and “infochant” that has sort of filled the void of power left in the underworld after Jabba’s death. He’s slick, and he knows something about Mara’s past, and her hatred for Luke Skywalker. He employs Mara and raises her to his second-in-command. He also has a couple of pet vornskrs (but I won’t ruin it by telling you what those are).

JORUUS C’BAOTH:  I won’t give this one away, either, except to say he is the only villainous Force-user in this entire trilogy and has both the menace, cunning, and madness to threaten Luke in a way he’s never been threatened before—by making Luke wonder if he’s even on the right track with the Force.

OTHER RANDOM & INTERESTING CHARACTERS:  Rukh and his Noghri assassins, who have a strange loyalty to Thrawn that gets revealed later, and is both interesting and tragic. Captain Palleon, an Imperial who remembers the downfall of the Empire at Endor, and who at first is flummoxed by Thrawn, even angered at times, but then comes to look up to him as a means for the Empire’s salvation. Borsk Fey’lya and Bothan intrigue…just…yessssss! Admiral Ackbar gets framed for something (oh no!), but by who, and for what purpose? There is just so much going on.

**The story:**

Where to begin. Our heroes and villains travel all over the galaxy to wonderful and interesting new worlds, on both diplomatic missions, combat missions, and investigations. Thrawn is conducting hit-and-fade attacks across the galaxy, and though at first his strategy appears to be pointless…his Grand Design finally begins to emerge, and the New Republic knows they’re in deep doodoo! As a reader, you will have the dawning of, “Oooooooh, wow! What an interesting plan!” (Minor spoiler: Thrawn uses captured asteroids in a very cunning way to throw the New Republic’s capital into disarray.)

There are interesting worlds with interesting properties, something every sweeping fantasy epic should have—for example, the planet Myrkr, with the strange creatures called ysalamari that have an interesting effect on Jedi; the planet Nkllon, which roasts in its sun’s light, so you have to fly your ship into the shadow of a massive “shield ship” that takes you down to the mobile city on its surface, a city which LITERALLY OUTRUNS DAWN ON MASSIVE LEGS AND TREADS; the planet Weyland, which has dark secrets left over from the time of Palpatine’s Empire; and, oh yeah, this book series is also the first appearance (or even mention) of the planet Coruscant. You get to visit the city-planet a lot!

There are all sorts of nail-biters throughout. A particularly juicy part is in the second book where Luke is in his X-wing and barely manages to escape a tractor beam, damages his ship, and jumps to lightspeed…only to have his hyperdrive go out on him in the middle of friggin’ nowhere! While his X-wing just sits and he begins to run low on supplies and oxygen, he uses his Jedi training to go into trances, conserve air and food, and when he’s awake, he and R2-D2 get to work on the X-wing—it’s almost like a tiny “The Martian” type of story here. A story about survival in space.

**My conclusion:**

This is a book series that really needs to be read by not only fans of Star Wars, but fans of great “sci-fantasy.” I cannot believe Lucas or Disney never tried to make these into films. Every chapter is teeming with new worlds, new species, fresh takes on space combat, attempted kidnappings by mysterious assassins, new allies, double-crosses, and all with one tantalizing question at the end of each chapter: “What is Grand Admiral Thrawn actually up to…?”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hahyqm/star_wars_heir_to_the_empire_rereading_the/,2020-06-17 02:11:06,42,90,books
o27qfz,The Last Emperox,"I just finished the final book, 'The Last Emperox' by John Scalzi. Overall it was a good series, but I feel like it ended too soon, the books are a little lightweight. In my mind all three books together equal one Star Wars movie for example. 

Things I was hoping for: seeing the Dalasyslans show up as part of the 'Rebel Force', Chenevert flying around being the mobile seat of the Empire, the battle for End-or, etc.

Who knows, maybe we'll get another book(s) to tell the next part of the story...

Alright, so thinking about the Interdepency, I think it is more correctly called the Codependency. And it is a lesson in the importance of being self-sufficient first, then combining your strengths with others to build on top of that.

f6huev,"[Review] I was recommended Brandon Sanderson, as someone who enjoyed GoT. So I read the Mistborn trilogy. Some thoughts.","First thing I'll get out of the way - it's not quite like the Game of Thrones. It's more traditional fantasy. There's a bit more of a young-adult vibe.

I don't have a problem with that or want to scare off potential readers... the books are enjoyable. 

What it means in practical terms is... there's absolutely no sex, and no swearing. There's some violence, which can get graphic, and I think that's a just a funny quirk of USA culture. We're OK with describing someone's head exploding, but uncomfortable describing someone's nipples getting sucked.

There are times where I feel like this becomes the proverbial elephant in the room. A young woman sits on a guy's lap, kisses him for a while, then makes some comment like ""let's not get distracted"". Or a character is described as ""swearing colorfully"". This did bug me at times, because there's always going to be less impact in hearing something like ""he made a lewd suggestion"" vs. [something like this](https://youtu.be/sjSMAlwlqWw?t=82) (1:22). There's also just a whiff of Twilight in there, as we have a young wallflower who suddenly becomes the (literal) belle of the ball. Some paragraphs are devoted to her picking out gowns and realizing that all the popular rich people are talking about the mysterious pretty new girl.

-----

OK, so that being said... here's a quick rundown of the plot, spoiler-free.

We learn about the world (known as the Final Empire) through the eyes of Vin, a timid teenage girl who's part of a thieving crew. They live in harsh, medieval society with strict class lines - you're nobility, or you're skaa. Life for the skaa is shit - they're peasants and slaves. Our first glimpse of their lives bring to mind images from US history: barebacked workers on a plantation, being whipped by an overseer on horseback.

This system has been in place for 1,000 years... created and enforced by the rarely-seen Lord Ruler. He's a mysterious god-king who rules from his keep in the capital city, and lets his Obligators (bureaucrats, basically) handle the day-to-day tasks of enforcing the law and facilitating trade. If there's a problem, he has a large army/police force at his disposal, and a handful of deadly Inquisitors. 

Inquisitors, by the way, are a terrifying (and gruesomely badass) concept: grim, powerful wizards with [massive spikes driven through their eye sockets](https://www.17thshard.com/forum/uploads/gallery/category_4/gallery_10646_4_17833.jpg), who somehow still live and can see. Think Agent Smith meets Voldemort.

It's made clear that for skaa, there's no fighting the system. They can't beat an army when they don't have weapons or training, and even if they could... the nobility can inherit specific magical abilities through their bloodlines... e.g. the ability to move metal, which effectively turns coins into bullets. Inquisitors possess magic that's even stronger, and the Lord Ruler's got unique abilities that are stronger yet, and he cannot be killed. So the situation is thoroughly hopeless.

Naturally, there are people who believe otherwise. 

Enter Kelsier, the charismatic leader of a more heavy-duty thieving crew, who has accepted a job from the skaa underground to topple the final empire. Ostensibly they do this for a big payoff - Kelsier spent part of his life mining the precious rare metal Atium, before escaping from the pits, and is convinced the Lord Ruler has a huge stash of the stuff. But he's also taken on this job because he hates the system, and has a personal grudge with the Lord Ruler. And Kelsier might just have a chance, because he and his friends are some of the rare commoners with access to magic. Kelsier subcontracts Vin's crew, and she gets dragged into a world of conflict and magic that she never even knew existed.

-----

To describe the later books would somewhat require spoiling the ending of the first book, so I'll just say that their plan has all sorts of unintended consequences... there's a reason the Lord Ruler's empire has been stable for so long, and we find out his role goes beyond just preserving the class system. Threatening him, indirectly threatens the whole world.

----

Things I liked: 

• The magic system is interesting and complex. It has fairly specific rules. The ability to use it is inherited, and you either get one specific magic ability (out of 10 or so) or you get them all. Only a handful of people get these powers, almost exclusively nobility, and they won't know about it until they 'snap'... meaning they go through some huge trauma that awakens the ability.

Using these powers consume metal, which is ground into powder and ingested in a liquid. The necessary metals range from common-as-dirt steel to incredibly-rare atium. Some abilities are incredibly useful (increased strength, speed, agility, and healing... all from pewter) and some... not so much (e.g. gold lets you see the past). 

Magic is never really ""free"" and the Allomancers who use it must manage their metal reserves carefully, and be aware of negative side effects. The most powerful players in the books, are the ones who can somewhat break the rules or discover a new way of using their abilities.

• There's a lot of hidden lore that gets gradually revealed over the course of 3 books... the source of the Lord Ruler's power, where magic comes from, the creation of certain magical races, the role of the metals, and some alternate methods of using magic. There's a lot of interesting backstory that keeps the book from being just ""good guys with magic vs. bad guys with magic"".

• The characters are memorable and distinct. You can tell when a book's characters need work when you read their name and go ""which one was that again?""... that's not an issue here. Kelsier is charming and sort of swashbuckling, but is quick (maybe too quick) to kill nobility and make ruthless choices. Vin is furtive and wary... her life has been one of privation, beatings, and betrayals. She trusts nobody, but part of her wants to. Marsh is grim, humorless. He has none of the charm of his brother. He tried for years to enlist Kelsier in the skaa rebellion, and now that it's finally happened, he doesn't trust Kelsier's motives.

• We go through some plot twists and the author shows he's willing to kill off major characters. It keeps things fresh.

• Just when you think they're winning, you realize there's more work to do, and the hardships have just begun. The author does a good job of making sure things never feel too easy, and manages to avoid abusing that sort of deus ex machina you see in other fantasy novels: ""and then the hero drew on their power really hard, harder than ever, and blew up the bad guy"". The good guys lose, get hurt, and are forced to run.

• We get some small hints that this world might be somehow related to our own, but the author avoids some common fantasy tropes. It isn't alternate reality medieval england. It isn't the distant future. The sky is red. The plants are brown. There's perpetual mist at night. There aren't guns, magic swords, or steampunk trains. There's giants, but no elves or dwarven blacksmiths or dragons. The world is unique.

-----------------------------

Things I disliked:

• Sometimes the author does that thing where characters seem to be made deliberately stupid... missing stuff that is obvious to the reader... so it can feel like a great triumph when they figure it out. For example, at one point Vin is stuck with a servant she doesn't want. The servant did something that bothers her, and she takes it out on them... speaking rudely to them, trying to ditch them, calling them by their race instead of their name, etc. When the servant responds in a less-than-enthusiastic way, she asks ""why do you hate me?"". Duh.

There's also a key revelation about how some powerful magic works, and the main characters take forever to figure it out. In fact, one of the important ones NEVER quite figures it out, someone else has to 'show' them. I gotta keep it vague for spoiler purposes, but just know that if you read this series, there will be times you're gonna want to yell at the characters. At times, it's like that feeling you get when the dumb disposable characters in a horror movie go into the dark haunted cabin. ""OH COME ON!""

• The books can get bogged down in boring discussions of politics, or warfare. Maybe they're just boring to me. I think it's more interesting when the characters are moving, like they're on a quest or exploring a new area. It really slows down when the main characters are at their base in the capital city, and dealing with problems like supply lines, lack of food, elections, etc. It's clear their fate hinges on some crucial magic stuff, some hidden ancient lore. So all that mundane stuff feels like it doesn't advance the plot. Of course, the same could easily be said about GoT.

• There's a ton of time spent on the protagonists, not so much invested in the antagonists. The Lord Ruler is not fleshed out, he's just this ethereal, invincible guy with an interesting backstory. The backstory is explained in bits and pieces, as if we're given a handful of sentences from a history book. But it would have been nice if we a switched perspectives to the past, and got to live through his rise to power and great betrayal. There's another evil force at play too... something that influences the lord ruler... and that force is given a personality. The personality is, unfortunately, straight anime-villain. 'oh child, did you really think you could defeat me?'. There's a whole mythology here (including a powerful force for good) and all we're really told is this evil force destroys because that's its nature. There's a powerful force for good, too, and that force is given no personality at all. I feel a little cheated, there.

tl;dr: despite the occasional young-adulty vibe, which I might not have noticed 20 years ago, this is a pretty interesting series with some care put into the plot, the lore, and the role of magic in their society.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/f6huev/review_i_was_recommended_brandon_sanderson_as/,2020-02-19 21:37:40,73,28,books

It's just in a simple note on my phone, nothing fancy, but it's really fun for me to finish a book and mark it down! It's also motivation to keep picking new things up.

I find that I now have 2 books going on my kindle as well as an audio book for when I'm getting ready for work in the mornings. Reading is so much fun and I can't believe I lost interest for such a long time.

iqpqyo,After few month I just finished Asimov's cycle from the robot to foundation,"Hi all,

Few month ago I decided to read Asimov's cycle.
I started with the robot, followed by the empire to end with foundation.
Today I finished it, I don't have anyone to share this with so here I am.

Tldr in the end

From best to worst ( there isn't one tome that is bad, I just enjoyed some better imo) :

Robots 
Foundation 
Empire

Here is a little feedback from my point of view, first of all even though Asimov himself said the last tome of foundation can be read alone I wouldn't recommend it, I would advise to read the Robots cycle and the fourth previous tome of foundation.
The empire cycle can be left appart as it doesn't brought anything important to fully understand the ending of foundation. However it's only 3 books that can be read fast, so if you enjoy his work go for it.

Robot cycle is the one I enjoyed most, you are first introduced to the cycle with novels mostly connected (I only recall one with jupiter being not related to the rest of the cycle) it build up the world we will later see evolve and the psychology of the robot are imo very interesting, I found myself thinking about how things could evolve through each reading time. Then there is few roman directly connected to each other, the characters are well written and I got attached to them (special shout out to my man... Robot Giskard) the story is slowly build to something which will be the foundation of the late tome of foundation.

Empire is good to read with great story, I enjoyed it less because I failed to see the connection between the Robot cycle to the empire, which I found while reading Foundation, before the final tome of foundation I wondered what was the point of the empire cycle in the global cycle. Nonetheless it's well written and isn't a loss of time.

Foundation, I first decided to go through all the cycle to read foundation and I dislike to pick up a book when it's connected to other without knowing what happened before. The first 3 tome are amazing the travel it brought us through space is awesome. The depicted humanity is on point. The science fiction is based mostly on science ( off course there is a lot of fiction in the science part) and can be appreciated as much by a scientist mind or a literary one. The 2 last which he wrote later in life are also great book I would recommend. You apparently can read both without reading any other book from the cycle, I fail to see how you could appreciate those two without knowing the galaxy he created before, so as said above I would recommend to go through at least all foundation book.

What is likeable about Asimov's works is the cinematography, with little details you can picture most of the scene, dialog, planet, spaceship.
It can be a good introduction to reading for those who don't particularly enjoy it, it's in the same time we'll written without being complex (maybe a few scientific words here and there but overall easy to read). It's sci fy so off course it's what you will mostly get however there is a bit of polar vibes throughout all the cycle and specialy in the robots.
It's humorous but never too much.

I am glad I went through all the cycle from start to finish, it was an amazing travel through space and time.  I will now put Sci fi on the side for a while and keep going with philosophy, French literature for a while then back to fantasy/Sci fi to relax.

Tldr : Asimov's cycle is great I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a bit of Sci fi without it being too hard. I just wanted to share my appreciation for his work.

Thanks to those who read all my text.

For those who went through the complete cycle or even some of it, how did you enjoy it? 
I am particularly curious about those who only rode foundation, how did you apprehend the ending? 

Ps: sorry for some repetitive sentence, I just finished reading in my native language and switched back to English to wrote that.(yes still easier to read in your mother tongue even though there is a loss in translation)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iqpqyo/after_few_month_i_just_finished_asimovs_cycle/,2020-09-11 12:45:21,6,22,books
1ar77my,Review for Empire of the Vampire - and should i pick up the next one?,"Oh god… this book…

Alright, let me start this review by stating that, unlike many other readers who gave this book a low rating, I was able to somewhat enjoy the read. To a certain extent at least. Edgy, gothic, vampire stories are my guilty pleasure and I have a certain fondness for the cringy emo vibes the writing style gives. I’ve also read this book in a big vampire binge. I’m playing a Curse of Strahd game, which I am impossibly obsessed with, and I had just finished watching Castlevania (the animated tv show). So when I stumbled upon Empire of the Vampire, I was in the perfect mood for the kind of story I thought it would tell and I might’ve tunnel visioned my experience of it to satisfy my cravings.

I had fun with the general aesthetics and world building, and took interest in how the author explore the vampire mythos. I especially enjoy when vampire stories link the creature to nobility like EotV does. The different Vampire houses were an interest premise and I thought some of the quotes landed well when you don’t mind Kristoff’s emo writing style.

“There’s no misery so deep as one you face by yourself. No nights darker than the ones you spend alone. But you can learn to live with any weight. Your scars grow thick enough, they become armor.”

“But more, and truer still, there’s just no one with more to prove than the boy at the bottom of the pile. You feed a man your table scraps, he grows hungry long before he grows thin.""

That being said, there’s still A LOT to criticize about this book…

SPOILER WARNING for both Empire of the Vampire and the Nevernight trilogy ahead.

First off, Empire of the Vampire isn’t very original. Now, that’s not always a bad thing, it doesn’t necessarily  mean that reading it is boring or unpleasant, but it sure as hell feels like a lot of the overall plot was recycled from other works. The author himself said that it’s heavily inspired by Interview with a Vampire and The Name of the Wind, and it shows. There’s also a plot twist at the end that’s basically copy pasted from The Last of Us and when you think about it, the whole concept is also pretty similar to his Nevernight trilogy:

An edgy main character with unique abilities who’s of a rare species/kind with dark hair and pale skin and loves to smoke and swear goes into some kind of cult like organisation situated in a weird church to be trained as killers. The MC has a quirky companion who most people can’t hear and who often comments or advise the MC on their quest in a world where the day and night cycle is fucked up. There’s at some point in the book a sapphic relationship with somewhat explicit sexual content between teenage girls, one being a viking inspired character and the other being a very skinny, spiteful young woman. And finally, the storytelling is told as if from a book or memoir and there’s often comments from the narrator(s).

So yeah… that’s that for the originality…

Second, EotV is the book that was most clearly written by a middle aged man I have ever read. Without even addressing the blatant misogyny, the general way women characters are written is clearly to cater to the male gaze. All woman are hot, they're usually describe in way more details than man characters and this goes not only when they are introduced. When they speak, when they move, when they enter a scene, there’s almost always a comment on how they’re dressed, how their limbs move sensually, how their lips are blood red, their skin milk white, their figure curvy, etc… The violence - because this book is very violent and gory - feels likes it’s described differently when women are the victim. The narration focuses way more on the description of their wounds, their screams and/or their bodies than it does with men (though there is exceptions, just talking generally here). There’s one of the antagonists who’s whole gimmick is slaving young virgin girls, using them like animals and shields. There’s at least 4 named female characters who are raped (and many more general mentions of different degrees of sexual assault). Not to mention the fridging of the main character’s mother, sisters, wife and daughter, the overall misogynistic setting, and the countless “your mom” and prostitutes jokes.

Now, I’m not saying misogyny can’t or shouldn’t be portrayed in a story, a setting or a character. But EotV uses misogyny as an aesthetic. It’s there to make the world edgy, to portray the characters as assholes (sometimes in a quirky kind of way). It’s not necessarily portrayed as a good thing, there’s clearly an underlying implication that it’s a bad aspect of the culture and setting, but it’s never adressed more deeply than once or twice by a #girlboss character who throws a line like “girls aren’t just tits on legs”. Wow. Feminism at its finest…

There’s also a constant presence of oversexualization of any female character, especially, and uncomfortably so, underaged ones. I’ve already mentioned the focused descriptions and the sexual jokes, but it goes way further than this. There’s plenty of explicit sex scenes between minor characters, the book even starts with one. In the two timelines where the book takes place, first one following teenage main character and second one following the MC in his thirties, most of the explicit sex scenes take place in the underaged timeline.

There also random sexual descriptions or instances that happen in moments where I really feel is tonally inapropriate. For exemple, there’s a scene at one point where a vampire just starts to touch herself mid-combat, for no reason at all except that I guess there’s blood that has been shed? It didn’t bring the scene further, didn’t provide anything for the story or to the characterization of said vampire (who I believe we never see again).

“She ran her tongue along her teeth, bloody fingertips across the gaping wound at her throat, roaming down the hourglass of her body and pressing hard between her legs.”

To top it all, the main character is constantly struggling to keep it in his pants. Him being a pale blood supposedly makes him super horny and his inner dialogue is often reminiscing on how he’s hot and hard for whoever’s in front of him, on how his blood is boiling from the desire and so on - which becomes really weird when you remember he’s actually saying all of this out loud to some vampire who’s writing it all down on paper.

So yeah… as much as I felt enjoyment while reading it, the more I think about it, the more the experience sours. I read this book in 2021, before I started to put conscious efforts into analysing my reads and diversifying what I consume. 3 years later, I’ve very much developped (or so I hope) my critical thinking and I’ve now consumed more diverse stories. I know now that to enjoy a good story, I don’t have to turn a blind eye to what feels wrong. You want a good gothic vampire story? Read A Dowry of Blood by S.T. Gibson, Silver Under Nightfall by Rin Chupeco or even Woman, Eating by Claire Kohda. These are stories who succeed in being gothic and macabre, epic and/or edgy, without forcing misogyny or bigotry on the reader. They might explore these themes, but they never use it as an aesthetic to make the setting dirtier.

Anyway! If you read until this point, props to you! That’s all I have for EotV. I’m still debating whether I’ll read the sequel or not. I’m still curious about the plot, but I dread having to go through another 700 or so pages of this r/menwritingwomen script… anyone read an ARC of it and has thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ar77my/review_for_empire_of_the_vampire_and_should_i/,2024-02-15 04:32:57,3,0,books
6v09e1,(Spoilers) The ending of Asimov's Foundation series,"I've just finished the 5 main books to Asimov's Foundation series*, and I must say that, for the most part, I enjoyed it.

It's a well written series and I could see why one could rave about it, especially for a reader who prioritises concept. However as character is far more important to my reading experience, I found the first few stories actually quite dull. 

What kept me going through those first few stories was wanting to see the Seldon plan through to the End. However, with the introduction of characters like the Mule and Bayta etc. I got much more into it, and particularly enjoyed the clandestine 'war' between the first and second foundation.

The reveal that the plan wasn't in fact perfect and required modification and guiding influence from the second foundationers was fantastic, brilliantly explaining how the improbable nature of one man's prediction could consistently come true.

But then with the final 2 books we have a total disruption and ultimate discarding of the plan in favour of Galaxia. I'm quite ambivalent about this. I had become so invested in the Seldon plan that I really wanted to see it through to the end, and finally have the pay off of the second, new and improved Great Galactic Empire . And yet, further stories of Seldon crises and resolutions would have been monotonous and a let down, especially after the introduction of the Mule's plan-disrupting mentalics.

Galaxia so is an adequate 'twist' ending to the Seldon plan. But again the conclusion we are left with, Earth's rediscovery which hides the universe guiding influence of Daneel, a quasi robot-deity, isn't thoroughly satisfactory. Mostly this due to the final few pages themselves, where Trevise clearly has misgivings about Fallom being host for Daneel and becoming the most powerful being in the galaxy. This was perhaps with the view to set up future sequels, that ultimately never came, as Asimov could not see where to take the story.

That being the case, I think a few small adjustments are required in the final chapter to leave us feeling more optimistic about Fallom-Daneel and the Galaxia plan. And finally we need  a brief epilogue, 1000 years from the Seldon plan's implementation, where galaxia now reigns supreme, perhaps with a view to expand or defend itself from the surrounding galaxies. It's the pay off that readers deserve having followed the series through to the end, and it's a shame we didn't get it.

olpzf9,JG Ballard and Empire of the Sun plus complete short stories continued,"I posted awhile back about the Complete Short Stories collection. I had only got through 10 at the time. Some replies reccomended Empire of the Sun during the discussion.

Now I have completed the full 100 stories and went onto Empire of the Sun. I previously read Crash and High Rise and I will move onto the Autroicity Exhibition when I go back to his works.

So the short stories were just incredible as a whole. I had assumed that as the stories progressed I would see a glimpse of more car crash sexualisation. What I wasn't prepared for was his actual fascination with flying and aviation and violence mixed with this.
The notion of time as a construct was his fixation in his early work and then space, society and how much space people can have or how people are restricted within their movements in a post apocalyptic type world. I didn't love all of the works after the 70s, my favourite stuff was the more philosophical aspects or an individual focus on instantly compared to the fixation with aviation and violence. (However I did like the story of the husband thought he was a pilot who would save his wife from cancer but she had actually divorced him. I am also not averse to violent stories in general).

So when I read Empire of the Sun, and a brief biography of his life, it all finally made sense. I know the story wasn't his exact experience in Shangai during the war but the cramped living conditions, the interest in aviation, his own career paths before he became a full time writer. The description of the internment camps. It all just clicked into place.

I have seen comments that people thought this was a lovely heart warmer or perhaps its based on the Speilberg film version, but I found this book so desperately sad. As its based on true life events how he managed to survive at the end had to be wrapped up a bit conveniently as Jim's story as a child on his own strayed from the fact if JGs experience. If this wasn't based on true events I would be tempted to contemplate at the end as Jim himself starts to go mad was he actually dead. ""They don't need to kill us, we're already dead"" type explanation. My heart burst for Jim. The exposure to death, cruelty, manipulation, illness and starvation and all taken in the stride of a child desperately clutching to the fact he would get back to his parents. The parts where he had a photo of an adopted family amongst other things all culminated for a bleak reality. I felt the family reuniting was anticlimactic, not because it wasn't wasn't right thing but just the hopelessness of war, where do they even go from there after living through such trauma.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/olpzf9/jg_ballard_and_empire_of_the_sun_plus_complete/,2021-07-16 21:02:37,1,8,books
kih4g7,"Just finished The Mistborn Trilogy, my thoughts (spoilers)"," I was recommended Mistborn a while back, and I figured 'Probably just another meh fantasy, but I'll try it out.' A month later, I've come to the conclusion that it's my favourite fantasy series ever. I've read better individual fantasy books before, but the overall story, characters and world-building in this series is something else. I avoided the sub till I was fully caught up, so I'm curious if I've got any controversial takes.

First up is **The Final Empire,** probably my favourite in the trilogy but I'm not totally sure on that yet. I remember the exact moment I was hooked too; when Kelsier claimed they were going to overthrow the Final Empire, and kill what is basically God in this world. I'm a sucker for grand heist stories, and that's what exactly what this felt like. Ah Kell, that madlad. He was the clear MVP of the book; he had this intense charisma about him, yet he wasn't treated like some flawless character either. I admit I choked up a bit when he died, though he went out like a boss at least. Inquisitors had been hyped as these unkillable beasts for the entire story, and Kell just barely takes one down using all his strength. It's rather small scale feat compared to what Vin accomplishes later, but at the time I was jumping out my seat reading that.

The other hook for me was the magic system: Allomancy. The variety of abilities allows the author to get really creative when it comes to fight scenes. I even found myself coming up with ideas in my head for how the Push/Pull system can be exploited in battle, and more often than not I'd find that exact idea in a later fight. I also liked that Mistings were better in their individual areas than Kelsier was. It's natural for a jack of all trades to have less expertise in a particular area than a true master would. It also gave Vin an excuse to interact with the rest of the crew

I was actually pretty surprised when they beat The Lord Ruler at the end; I was so sure it was gonna end in complete failure and the next two books would be they recovering from the loss and then trying again. But I like the sense of progression this gives to the rest of the trilogy. And if I had paid closer attention to the foreshadowing, maybe I would've figured it out. Sanderson writes them so well that they're obvious in retrospect. Why is the Lord Ruler so different from the logbook writer? Because he's not the write, he's the asshole packman that killed the writer and took the power for himself. Meaning he knows Allomancy and Feruchemy. Meaning he's no God, just using both powers to extend his life. Meaning all Vin has to do is rip his bracelets off and boom, gg Lord Ruler.

Moving swiftly on to **The Well of Ascension.** I have the distinct feeling this is considered the weakest of the three, but I don't agree. Yeah there's not as much happening in this one, but it's more slow-burn, character-driven story as opposed to the rollercoaster plot-driven story of TFE. And I'm also a sucker for fantasy politics, so this works out nicely for me.

The loss of Kelsier stings, sure, but we get some new characters to keep things fresh. Zane is the classic rival character that I knew we were bound to get at some point, but he's handled well enough I feel. He represents what Vin could become if she didn't have her friends to keep her right. This also allows her some deep introspection as to what being a Mistborn means to her, since she doesn't wants to be like Zane or Kelsier. And come on, that plan with switching the Kandra was pretty damn genius from Zane. Who would expect a Kandra of being an imposter?

That leads me to our favourite dog thing OreSeur, or uh, Tensoon I guess. RIP OreSeur. I swear, this Sanderson dude knows all my likes, because I have a soft spot for animal characters also. He gives us a look into an entirely new race of species, which is expanded upon later, and learns that not all humans are bad through his relationship with Vin. There's also Tindwyl, who at first was just there to speed up Elend's character development a bit lol. I thought that's all she'd be there for, but of course she had to make mah boy Sazed fall in love with her before dying. RIP Tindwyl.

But I agree, not a lot happens in this one, and the story told here doesn't really deserve the 700+ pages it's given. But the lowest of lows are luckily followed by the highest of highs. When Vin returns to Luthadel and tears through the koloss like a one-woman army, I was incredibly hyped. When Vin shoots down from heaven like some angel assassin and cuts Straff in half with a massive koloss sword, my hype was through the roof. When the battle is over and all the enemy leaders are caught, and Vin doesn't say anything, she just *points to the fucking ground* and they all get on their knees and beg for their lives, I was done. It was just too much badassery for me to handle, I had to put the book down and go for a walk to clear my head.

And then she had to go mess it all up and let Ruin free lol, but I can't really blame her, he played his cards well. Another one of Sanderson's brilliant twists. Why does the mist spirit want mah boy Sazed to focus on a particular part of the prophecy? Because it's a lie, Ruin re-wrote it to lead Vin to the Well to do what she did. As much fun as I had reading this series, it's going to make for a great re-read someday with all the information we know ahead of time.

And finally, **The Hero of Ages.** This was probably my least favourite, actually. Not that it's badly written or anything, it's just that the previous two focused on elements I was particularly fond of, which this last one doesn't really have much of either.

Firstly, I'll mention Elend. I like his journey, from lazy noble to would-be king to warrior Emperor. It's solid character development, and you can see how he retained the important character qualities that make him unique while also growing to who he is now. What I didn't like, so much, was that he's Mistborn. It felt tacked on, and the story didn't really call for him to need those powers much (except when and Vin attended the Fadrex dance, I admit that was baller move). Also he didn't think about Tindwyl as much as I would've liked considering she was the main driving force behind his growth in TWoA.

The side story with Spook in Urteau was pretty fun. Felt like a mini-version of the TFE, with Spook trying to live up to the role of Kelsier and overthrow a corrupt government. Spook is a madlad just like Kell, running through burning buildings and whatnot, so it's a good fit. I was happy to see him get a chance to shine after being in the background for the series up till now. Breeze is here too, though it was revealed earlier that's he a lazy tsundere so he's happy to let Spook lead. When he started hearing the voice of Kelsier, I immediately called that shit as Ruin and I'm so damn happy I caught one of these twists for once!

The only thing I was afraid of was that the Urteau story wouldn't connect to the main plot thread, but luckily Marsh made sure it did. And oh boy, Marsh, his life is just pure suffering. At least he managed to do some good in the end, but damn, Ruin screwed him over good. Speaking of Ruin, his whole thing with Preservation still throws my head for a loop. I know that the real big bad had to be basically God since Vin already killed a pseudo-God in Lord Ruler, but this books throws so much info at you and reveals so many important plot points that I felt like I was getting one massive revelation after another near the end, and it was difficult to keep it all straight in my mind. I couldn't go through all the reveals here because I'm sure I forgot some, but this isn't a criticism of the consistency, which as far as I could tell is solid, just at the volume of info I need to consume.

Maybe I just read it all too quick idk, I was pretty excited to see the ending. And man what an ending. All but like six named characters dead. Damn. But on the bright side, mah boy Sazed is now MAH GOD SAZED! Seriously, should've just let him go to the Well to being with and everything would've been fine. Vin is the best when it comes to fights (that fight against the Inquisitors, goddamn, what a battle) but Sazed is the one everyone relied on for wisdom and moral support. It was just depressing to see him lose his faith in this one, but I kept my faith that he would pull through in the end, and he sure did. So the moral of the story for me is; if you're ever feeling down, look to the Sazed in your life, and they will provide you the answer to your troubles.

That's all for now, but just remember; there's always another secret.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kih4g7/just_finished_the_mistborn_trilogy_my_thoughts/,2020-12-22 23:43:33,29,36,books
3g35d8,Econoquist Recommended Author of the Day: J. G. Farrell,"Farrell is a British writer whose novels focus on the tragedy and comedy of the British Empire. His three novels are often called collectively The Empire Trilogy but are otherwise unlinked.

The Siege of Krishnapur takes place during the 1857-1858 Indian Mutiny and chronicles the siege of a fictional British garrison.  The action is in many ways a composite of events at various locations in India but probably most closely parallels the siege at Lucknow.  As with all his books one can sympathize with characters on all sides of the events and their blend of concerns both petty and universal makes the story gripping and human.

The second book Troubles tales place in post-WWI Ireland just as the eponymous Troubles are heating up.

The final volume and the longest is The Singapore Grip which begins in 1939 Singapore on the eve of the Japanese invasion and is wonderful story telling rich in atmosphere.

The Hill Station, also set in India was unfinished at his death and published posthumously.

Along with Paul Scott (The Raj Quartet), Farrell is one of the premier post-colonial writers taking a a critical look at the British Empire but with a human sympathy for those carrying it out in the field.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3g35d8/econoquist_recommended_author_of_the_day_j_g/,2015-08-07 03:14:23,0,3,books

When 18-year-old Zetian offers herself up as a concubine-pilot, it's to assassinate the ace male pilot responsible for her sister's death. But she gets her vengeance in a way nobody expected—she kills him through the psychic link between pilots and emerges from the cockpit unscathed. To tame her unnerving yet invaluable mental strength, she is paired up with Li Shimin, the strongest and most controversial male pilot in Huaxia​. But now that Zetian has had a taste of power, she will not cower so easily. She will miss no opportunity to leverage their combined might and infamy to survive attempt after attempt on her life, until she can figure out exactly why the pilot system works in its misogynist way—and stop more girls from being sacrificed.|/u/phanton97

mgu0qe,Book review - The History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell,"**Knowledge of external things must be by the mind, not by the senses - Rene Descartes**

This was one of the most difficult books I've ever read and it was a relief to turn the final page of this book. Bertrand Russell is a renowned philosopher, polymath and a Nobel laureate in literature. This book is a treatise on the history of Western Philosophy. I'd be doing this book a disservice if I called it boring. To be more accurate, it was a dry read about the history of Western Philosophy, along with Mr Russell's take on some of those theories. It's a very heavy read and has detailed theses (sometimes even verbatim) of some of the important work of certain philosophers.

The reason I started this book was to understand the mindset of thinkers across history and effected massive and sometimes long-lasting social changes (Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Hegel come to mind in these categories). And whoever wants to read how philosophers and their philosophy had a cause and effect relationship to social life should read this book. I feel the best part about this book is distilling the thoughts of various philosophers across generations and ensuring that there's a certain flow and order to these thoughts. 

The book is divided into three books: Ancient Philosophy, Catholic Philosophy and Modern Philosophy (until early 1940s when this was written). But be ready for repetition since a lot of these philosophers built upon and repeated the work of their predecessors. And philosophers either love Plato or hate him, but can't seem to ignore him (similarly for the Greeks and the Romans). A lot of them have a grandiose sense of their importance (and philosophers in general). It also talks in depth about philosophy and papacy, which were almost inseparable before Reformation and how philosophy changed its course during and after the industrial revolution. 

Talking about the author, Russell tries to take an impartial view of all theories, but I can't help but notice that he talks about England as if the nation and its philosophers are the epitome of rationality, unfazed by emotions. As someone who is overly critical of Prussia and Nazi Germany (with great reason), he never seems to have an issue with the British Empire. In a paragraph about Nietzsche, he says that it never occurs to Nietzsche that **those who do not fear their neighbours see no necessity to tyrannize over them**. I wonder if he never felt that about his England terrorizing the world for over 300 years. 

Most probably, I won't be reading this a second time, but if you're taking this book up and go beyond the halfway mark, you're a braveheart. But don't take this up unless you really have a hankering to read the history of Western philosophy in depth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mgu0qe/book_review_the_history_of_western_philosophy_by/,2021-03-31 00:31:47,19,11,books
x4njxo,"The Moontide Quartet - Almost a Game of Thrones rival, held back by inconsistent characters and plot contrivances.","The book series Moontide Quartet is very very close to being good. 

For the most part I enjoyed the series, which is why it is even more annoying that the problems keep piling. A mug with a small crack can still hold water but if the cracks are everywhere it starts leaking. 

Major spoilers going forward so if you are interested stop. 

It starts with stuff that is core to the books world: the tide bridge. It is made out to be the most important thing in the world that everything revolves around, yet there are airships right from the start that do kinda ruin it. If the empire really really wanted to, they could just send non stop soldiers over with air ships, which is basically what they did at some point anyway. So really the main plot of making the tide bridge permanent is nonsense. 

But the real core problem of the story is this: the love stories. Or rather the characters and their interactions. 

Easiest example is Kazim. At first he is so madly in love with Ramita that he stalks down the grand magus and kills him to finally free her and be with her. Then when she tells him to go away cause he killed her husband (that she grew to love maybe 3 or 4 pages before that point), he doesn't spend a single sentence being sad or heartbroken. Instead he is too busy doing magic at that point. And later on he and Elana get super stockholm syndrom when he tries to kill her and she imprisons him for 6 months. And then they have most purest loving relationship that even transcends magic and reality! Its not good.

Not much better is Alaron and Cym. From the start Cym tells Alan that she's not interested in him and wants ""a man like a lion"". Alan is still pursuing her, stalker style, and even rescues her from tribal men that captured her, where she again tells him to sod off. Which if it ended there might have been funny, but after that the entire story around Cym starts to torture her for not siding Alan. She finally does get her ""man like a lion"" in the form of a shapeshifter that kills mages to sustain himself. The 2 also get stockholm syndrom love (notice a trend?) but not really. For one she gets an abortion to get rid of his child, and secondly the magic symbiosis Kazim got with Elena never happens between them. The longer you read Cyms story the more it reads like someone who got rejected in the past and is now having revenge on this character they created. That is ofc just speculation but it certainly feels that way reading it. 

And I am going to not even mention the Lesbian princess that is forced into a violent marriage (I think its a fetish at this point). 

So yeah. That certainly held the books back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x4njxo/the_moontide_quartet_almost_a_game_of_thrones/,2022-09-03 06:30:33,0,7,books
6u4zya,What are your thoughts on the popular fantasy/dystopian books? Here are mine! (No spoilers),"Over the last six months or so, I started realizing my love for fantasy and dystopian-based books. Like many of you, I grew up on Harry Potter and still to this day think it's my favorite book series. However, after listening to the audiobook series (Stephen Fry) for 30+ times (not a typo), I decided that I should try to find books that were similar.

With that in mind, I hope this list helps anybody looking for a fantasy or dystopian-based book in the future. Also, if you read this list and think that I would enjoy a different book not listed, let me know!

________

**The List and My Thoughts**

* **Harry Potter Series** - Grade: 10/10

I mentioned above, but this is still my favorite book series of all time. A good portion of my value comes from nostalgia since I was roughly the same age as Harry while I was reading it. I have seen multiple people mention in this sub that they've tried reading it as adults and really didn't like the the series was very ""kid-like."" I can definitely sympthasize with those comments.

I'm not going to break down my thoughts on these books any further since most of you read them already and have your own opinions, but here is the order of which books I liked the most in case you were curious: 6,7,4,3,5,1,2

* **Hunger Games Series** - Grade: 4/10

What started as a great idea, the series was completely destroyed to me by the end. I really didn't like the last book as I felt like the ending was rushed. Also, I unfairly compared her writing style to J.K. Rowlings and was left feeling like I was reading a script versus a detailed book.

* **Divergent Series** - Grade: 5/10

I really liked the concept, but the story and her actions didn't fully resonate with me. Also, it baffles me that anybody reading this book series, especailly the first one, thought it was good for a movie. Hunger Games was action-packed and most of the feelings I felt were external, while the Divergent Series was all about her internal struggle in this society. Two completely different styles.

* **Red Rising Series** - Grade: 10/10

Anybody looking for a new book series should definitely give this series a chance. The character development and depth in the writing style are incredible. I strongly recommend the audiobook version by Tim Gerard Reyonds. He's fantastic. While the book gets somewhat predictive at times, I felt like the story line, unique characters, and internal monologue by Darrow was tied well together. I can't wait for Iron Gold to be released in January. 

* **Ready Player One** - Grade: 10/10

I loved this book. For somebody that played D&D back in the day and other old school video games, this definitely hit home. The mystery aspect in a virtual setting surrounded by real world complications made it a very fun read.

* **Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas** - Grade: 6/10

I felt like it took time for the humor in this book to develop. It was also hard at times to follow the characters. If you are a big Star Trek fan, which I admittedly never fully got into, I can see you enjoying this book a lot more than I did.

* **Mistborn Series**

Halfway through The Final Empire. I like it so far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6u4zya/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_popular/,2017-08-16 20:47:11,22,8,books
cimzmw,Impression of The Mote in God's Eye,"[Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100365.The_Mote_in_God_s_Eye)
> In 3016, the 2nd Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to faster-than-light Alderson Drive. Intelligent beings are finally found from the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud. The bottled-up ancient civilization, at least one million years old, are welcoming, kind, yet evasive, with a dark problem they have not solved in over a million years.

This book came up in a discussion on /r/space. I thought the synopsis was interesting, so I decided to give it a try.

I found the start to be very slow and cumbersome. The author uses a lot of new terms without clearly defining it leaving me to derive understanding from context. This has the result of me fully understanding oncepts late or never at all.

However, once the book starts going -- mainly by the first meeting with the moties -- the story speeds up greatly and becomes vastly more interesting. This is what drives the whole book: the developing relationship between humans and moties. 

The authors did very well in developing an interesting alien species with strengths/weaknesses and they also did well in developing the human cast. They also did well in creating a complex plot wherein there weren't clear/obvious villains, but instead, everyone simply working for their own interests and hindered by their own natures.

If I have any real complaints, I might complain that the sheer number of characters meant development was spread thin. Aside from perhaps two or three characters, I didn't feel like I ever came to truly know anyone beyond a superficial level. 

On some level, that's forgivable. The moties had a 'mystery' thus they couldn't be delved into much to keep it up, but the same issue was present on the human side. Curiously, I thought the authors spent a lot of time on one character -- Horace Bury -- and he came to be very well developed and I felt I understood him intimately. That confused me for a time as to why what seems to be a side character was getting so much development, but it turns out there's a very good reason for that (no spoilers here).

Overall, I feel like the book was a good read. Currently, I just started reading the sequel (Gripping Hand) and it's been a while since I read a book series with continuity, so I'm hoping the sequel is good too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cimzmw/impression_of_the_mote_in_gods_eye/,2019-07-27 21:08:39,24,34,books

3pep5a,Recommended Author of the Day: Susan Howatch,"Susan Howatch is an author who went through three distinct phases over the years as author.  Though her book editions tended toward the drugstore rack paperback pulp model, there is some very interesting stuff hidden under those blandly sensational covers.

She started in the 60's writing pretty much genre gothic suspense. It is competent of its kind and worth reading if you like to dip back into fads of the past occasionally. Titles include April's Grave, Call in the Night, Dark Shores, and The Shrouded Walls.

Her next phase is much more intriguing. She wrote of number of historical fiction family sagas, with a twist.  The characters and their stories are pulled from actual historic figures with the basic outline of their tales set in new eras and settings.  For example, The Rich Are Different is the Tale of Caesar and Cleopatra set in 1920-30's Wall Street and the story is continued in Sins of the Fathers which looks at Caeser's heir Augustus in the form of a man inheriting his great uncle's financial Empire.

The others in this mode include Wheel of Fortune which re-imagines the Black Prince Edward and John of Gaunt in pre-WWI Welsh family.  Edward I, II and III bride relive their tale as the scions of an 18th century Irish lords in Castlemara, and Henry the Second and Eleanor of Aquitaine and their sons of Lion in Winter Fame are recreated in a 19th century Cornish tin mining empire in Penmarric. 

Her final phase produced what personally find are her most compelling books.  The series is known collectively as the Church of England series, and consist of three sets of three books.  The first set are written from the point of view of three different charysmatic but flawed priests in the church of England in 1930's and 40's, following their worldly and spiritual struggles.  The next set returns to these same three in late fifties-60's and looks at them through the eyes and struggles of their children and wives.  The last three are set in 80'-90's and look at where the children are as they approach middle age and struggle with their parent's legacy.  If found most of these books very compelling reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3pep5a/recommended_author_of_the_day_susan_howatch/,2015-10-19 21:45:48,2,7,books

To help kick off the discussion:

* What do you think was going on in Enyo-Enyo?

> I was the living text of my mother's existence, the other bodies said. That was why the keepers saved me...But knowing that did not make me any more beautiful.

* What do you think this says about our idea of beauty? Do you think people prefer to stand out or fit in?

> She rubbed the brow and fingered the braided hair and wondered how a people so like hers could do what these Heroes had done. She had thought them monsters from some other star, but the face in her lap was not so different from the man who had sacrificed himself to power the ship, not so different from hers.

* Why do you think Yousra imagined that the Heroes would have been very different from her and her people? 

> As she watched smoke rise up from the dead forests surrounding the camp, she wondered why the Heroes had not destroyed them as she was doing. Perhaps, after decimating the man's people, hers were not considered a threat. And why would they be? They had no ships, no cities. Just death and disease. No, the Heroes had done something more terrible to them. They had toyed with them, as if they were nothing but insects or rodents. Murdering Yousra's people would have been too easy. The game was in watching them slowly suffer and die.

* Do you think the actions of the Heroes were justified by the goal they were trying to reach, 'lifting up' Yousra and her people?

> Would you have chosen differently?

* So what would your choice have been?

> It's like, you think you're brave, so you carry out your orders. You do it even if you know what the outcome is going to be. You do it because you always wanted to be a hero - you wanted to be on the side of light. It's not until you destroy everything good in the world that you realize you'r not a hero...you're just another villain for the empire.

* Where you think the drive to be a hero comes from?

* Is a future without soldiers possible? Or is that too hopeful?

* Do you think Hurley was succesfull in writing stories in which the future is *really different*?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d9jro2/fourth_discussion_thread_for_meet_me_in_the/,2019-09-26 13:38:42,7,5,books
t3lx0s,My Good Friend Gave me one of her Favorite Books 'The Falconer' by Elizabeth May... And I Can't Stand It,"She said that the series gets better as you get further into it.

Regardless I am about 240 pages into the book The Falconer by Elizabeth May, and I really dislike it. Perhaps someone else has read it and has something to say to the merits of the book.

I find the story to be extremely stagnant. There is clearly a set of stakes that are there but the stakes aren't developing. The plot isn't advancing in an interesting way, they have given a very vague sense of some sort of overwhelming force that's about to wreck havoc on the world, and they have done a very poor job of making that force feel like an actual threat. 

The main character is so stagnant and boring to watch. She starts by just ranting this internalized monologue about how mad she is. And ""oh, believe me, I'm so full of rage, and I'm so full of vengeance, and I'm a monster, and a killer."" And it's becoming almost pathetic. WE GET IT - WE GOT IT ON PAGE 1 - WE GOT IT ON PAGE 20 - AND WE'VE GOTTEN IT WHEN YOU'VE MENTIONED IT ON WHAT FEELS LIKE EVERY SINGLE PAGE SINCE. 

There's another character that I thought could've been quite interesting as a mentor but of course is the love interest, which I will say actually feels like a good character choice. Her drilled in anger suits that she would like the enabler to that, but it is still just not interesting to watch. It's so much ""he's so distant. And he's a fae, he doesn't care about me. But he looked at me weird? Maybe he does care, but no he absolutely can't. Oh he's so beautful, NO, I can't think that, I hate him, and he doesn't care for me... but... look at him he's so beau-"" OH MY GOD - DEVELOP THE RELATIONSHIP OR KILL ONE OF THE CHARACTERS OR BOTH - just do something. 

The world building is riddled with little things that have major logical flaws. Like how the fae kill people all the time, and there are constantly people just being found dead mutilated in alley ways, and then they're like ""it's cause of the plague"" about people that died

A) in a particularly weird spot

B) weren't sick with anything... and then they just... dropped dead?

The prose is very Young Adult - it is Young Adult prose done fairly decently, and this is probably where I have the least issues with the book, but it is still just very simple without much to really appreciate. 

I think the plot is constructed poorly, with no sense of momentum, the stakes feel dormant because there hasn't been any application to what it means more globally other than ""they're gonna kill everyone."" But they're all too busy hunting our main character who has a thick layer of plot armor to start effecting the world around them. As well, for a creature that is supposed to be insanely hard to kill, great immortal beings who are supposed to be beyond power understood in human comprehension... they sure are easy to kill. A single envenomed crossbow bolt... she kills them by the dozens. And she gets in battles so often that when these things show up they get no reaction from me. They don't feel threatening, and when one is there it is not for the sake of the storytelling, it is for the sake of having another battle scene. 

The plot, riddled with battles also makes the pacing painful. It's so much happening so quickly when none of it has any weight to the world or the characters. 

The world-building is anywhere from non-sensical to, at best, ideas that have been done, and done it much more inspired ways.  

The characters are frustratingly one dimensional.

But it's a close friends favorite book... In fact it's her favorite trilogy. And I feel like I have to finish the book, if not the series, cause it's her favorite. I want to stop reading it so bad. It isn't joyful for me to read it, I read slower cause I'm less moved to read on the daily cause I'm so frustrated with this book. But I have to finish it. And then I have to talk to her about it, and these books mean so much to her. I don't know what to do.

It also sucks because the other book I read that she told me to... I absolutely loved... In fact... It's one of my favorite books I've ever read. 'Circe' by Madeline Miller, I thought it was fantastic, absolutely fantastic. 

What have other people thought about this book? Why do people like it?

I can't risk a second book I'm not gonna enjoy cause that will put me in a reading slump. What sucks about this is that I'm being taken out of me reading HIGH that I've been in with every single other book I've read this year. It's been great, Gentleman bastards into Misery by Stephen King into Mistborn: The Final Empire, with some other books, and it's all been consistently pretty good to quite fantastic. 

So what should I do about ""The Falconer"" by Elizabeth May? Does it get better? Does it make itself worth it? Do the characters and story become more interesting? What do people like about it? Should I even bother?

And what should I read next? 

My current top pick is ""Children of Time"" by Adrian Tchaikovsky. But I don't know much about it, I just find myself enamored with the concept and wanted to know if people here would vouch for that book.

Other options I'm considering are

The Well of Ascension

Little Women

The Last Argument of Kings

The Song of Achilles

hy5q28,Finished reading the Daevabad Trilogy,"**Books: The City of Brass -- The Kingdom of Copper -- The Empire of Gold**

Two years ago, wandering around a bookstore in Kolkata, I happened to come across a shelf on which sat The City of Brass. I don't like reading book jackets, so I flipped open the first page.

A couple of lines in, I could strongly feel the environment of a con-artist sitting in her fortune-telling tent in 1700s Cairo. I had previously read few fantasy books, and even less with a female protagonist. I drew up a stool and read the first chapter, after which I decided to buy the book and check out the rest of the story.

Fast forward to 2020, a couple of weeks ago the last book of the trilogy was published. I decided to re-read the previous two books before reading the last one. And overall, it was quite an enjoyable experience!

I do have some thoughts on the series, so I decided to write about the series in a categorized way - where I'd first talk about what worked for me (**The Great**), what I thought was fine (**The Acceptable**), and finally what didn't work for me (**The Not So Great**).

&#x200B;

\############################

&#x200B;

**The Great :**

**--->** The immediate charm of a fantasy setting is the world-building, and I found the world-building aspects of the series to be quite enjoyable. Basically there's a four elements structure to the existence of all living entities. Humans are non-magical in this world, and are creatures of the earth. *Djinn* are magical creatures of fire, and they are the main group around whom the plot revolves in this trilogy.

Then there are the super rare *Peris* (magical air creatures) and the probably mostly extinct *Marids* (magical water creatures). These later two creatures are so much more rare and powerful compared to djinn or humans, that they are revered almost as Gods. We get to see djinn interact with the concept of *Peris* and *Marids* throughout the trilogy, which is pretty interesting.

Otherwise most of the story is about the djinn, and specifically their political capital *Daevabad*. We get to see djinn from different races, leading to a greater complexity of the world. We get to see some races a lot more closely than others, which also opens up the possibility of future books in this world setting.

Additionally, there are half-blood djinns (with djinn and human parents), who get discriminated against by pure-blooded djinns, which contributes to the political plots of the trilogy.

As you can tell, there is a lot going on in this world, and the author does a pretty good job laying out the complexities in the world-building elements.

**--->** The world-building leads naturally to complex political structures, and throughout the trilogy we get to see the rise and fall of different powers, and the fight of the oppressed and discriminated. The motivation behind every political act is discussed in detail, there are lots of scenes involving people in power planning their next steps, these scenes are always a delight to read.

**--->** Most of what happens in the stories do not involve magic. Even most fights are with swords, so the lack of magic in most character interactions might actually make the trilogy more accessible to newer fantasy readers.

**--->** One of the strengths of the author is to describe conversations between people in vastly unequal positions of power. In general, getting to see more powerful people strut around and make others nearly crap themselves has a fun aspect to it, but also, getting to see less powerful people try to assess a situation, and extract as much information as possible for their own benefit, without ticking off the more powerful, all of this leads to quite engaging scenes of conversations.

**--->** The main three characters have an incredible journey. The con-artist from Cairo *Nahri* who discovers her powers place her in a very powerful position among the djinn. The djinn prince *Alizayad* who is sensitive to injustice, but being the second prince by birth, has very little power to bring about change. And the djinn from legends *Dara* with a horrible past looking for redemption. At the end of the trilogy, I reflected on the entire journey of each of the characters, and I thought, wow, what a journey each of them had. It is fascinating to see them go from where they were initially to where they finally end up, and every point of dispersion of their character is always very well motivated.

Even though Nahri has a central role throughout the trilogy, each of the characters have their own concurrent journey, and at the end of the trilogy, it does not feel like Nahri is more important than the other two. The author does manage to give each of the characters their own important place in the story, which is commendable.

**--->** My favourite character, by far, is Alizayad. From the first book, I found Alizayad to be the most interesting, watching him struggle between his sense of injustice and what the political powers around him were deciding to do, it was all quite enjoyable. In terms of journey as well, I mean damn, Alizayad's overall journey is by far the most interesting, Nahri and Dara's overall journey actually ends up seeming much more simpler in comparison.

**--->** I do like Nahri as a protagonist, and I did relate strongly to her motivations throughout the series. Sometimes, Nahri would react in ways that I would think was strange, and I'll talk about that later. But overall, the way she handles her position of power, her search for her identity, her place in the djinn world, it's really well done. Another thing I thought was really well done, was how the books handle the tricky question of forced marriage under strong political pressure. Associated with it is the question of sexual relations under forced marriages, and I think the book had a very mature way of handling it.

&#x200B;

**The Acceptable :**

**--->** Dara... is fine. He has a redemption arc, and he probably goes through the most agonizing of experiences, in comparison to Nahri or Alizayad. I... just didn't like him as a character much. I did empathize with his positions, and I do see the appeal of a handsome powerful legendary-status djinn. I guess arrogance turns me off quite a bit, but if it doesn't have that much of an effect on you, you might end up really liking him. Nevertheless, the plot of his character arc is pretty well done.

**--->** The oppressed half-blood djinns have interesting plots in the first book, but the plots ends up tapering off in the later books. The trilogy is more character-oriented, and we do not have central characters directly affected by the plight of the half-blood djinns, so that might be why. It's a little strange, because it has a lot of importance in the world and to the central plotlines. Also in the second book we get to see them acquire weapons that cause a lot of damage to full-blood djinns. In the third book, we don't quite get a resolution to the weaponized half-blood djinns fighting for their freedom. I mean, it is addressed, but not quite directly and sufficiently.

**--->** There is something *safe* about the third book. Which is fine, it's 2020, we're all going through a lot. By safety I guess I am implying that we get proper satisfying resolutions to all the important plotlines in the trilogy, and there are indeed quite a few plotlines. The characters do go through a lot, so by 'safe', I don't mean to imply that the characters have it easy. It's just, the nature of the resolution of most plot lines, are satisfactory. This point I'm making is also in line with my previous point about the half-blood revolutionaries, there's no way in my mind the half-bloods would end things on a peaceful note, there would be at least some who demand their own terms through violence. That doesn't happen, but the plots do get wrapped up.

**--->** I think there is a trend in fantasy to move from monarchy towards political structures similar to a democracy. We get to see the beginnings of a bit of this in the third book. For me, it's always tricky, why would people accept a political structure they are not personally familiar with? I would have liked to see that addressed in the world. But the third book doesn't quite get into it, it only shows the beginnings of such a possible political structure, so I guess I'm fine with that.

**--->** The third book fleshes out a lot regarding the magical elements of the world. I really enjoyed that. But, I would have also liked it more if there were threads of the magic and mythology that were not fully explained. It leads to a general feeling of mysticism, and a desire on my end to think and imagine more about those aspects of the world. I guess what I'm trying to say is, the explanations in the third book left me with less creative freedom when thinking about the possibilities in the world.

**--->** The author finished writing this trilogy pretty efficiently, which is commendable. But why are the last two books called The Kingdom of Copper and The Empire of Gold? I know where the first book gets its name, but about the latter two, I actually don't know.

&#x200B;

**The Not So Good :**

**--->** The books have a few moments of action. I'm not very fond of action in books, a lot of time I find them difficult to follow and end up quite confused. The action descriptions improve with each book, I think they are pretty well written in the last book. However, almost half of the first book does involve Nahri and Dara running away from *ifrits*, and there's a lot of action going on, and it's probably the most dull part of the trilogy. Fortunately, the first book has alternate chapters on Alizayad, which are vastly more interesting. Once the chase subplot ends, the first book ends up becoming much more interesting.

**--->** Most of the books involves conversations, which are mostly well written. Except one quirk, which would take me out of the reading flow every time. In conversations when characters feel distressed, they often react in what probably should be an honest and challenging way, but feels immature and oblivious of the power dynamics of the conversation. Any conversation between Nahri and Dara in the first book has examples of this. And this particular way of reacting, is also very similar, across different characters. Newer authors often end up writing characters that sound similar. That is not the case here in general. But in this one particular aspect, it kind of is. Otherwise the conversations are great.

&#x200B;

\############################

&#x200B;

Overall, **would I recommend the trilogy?** Yes, I would. If you like reading character and conversation-oriented stories with plotlines heavy in politics in a fantasy setting with complex world-building, I think you will like it.

**Would I re-read the trilogy again?** No, at least not in the immediate future. I did really enjoy the journey the characters go through. I think I might find myself flipping through a couple of sections of the first book, which has moments I found to be quite iconic. But I am interested in reading more fantasy, a lot of the booktubers I follow regularly recommend tons of fantasy books. I would like to try The Final Empire soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hy5q28/finished_reading_the_daevabad_trilogy/,2020-07-26 11:57:26,10,17,books
m3xqvs,Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind: Manga that will change your mind about the medium,"# This Is A Reupload - No Need To Vote 

***

## This is a post from a long-lost Reddit account. My friend asked for my thoughts on this manga so I was going to send an edited version of this. However, it took me forever to find it on Reddit. I am reuploading it only so that I can find it easier on my account if I want to reference it in the future. Please do not mark this as spam. 


Nausicaa is an examination of the nature... of well, Nature. What is the place and value of man within the larger context of existence? What does it mean to exist as a subject in relation to other subjects and objects? What do you owe them and why? What is violence, what can it be exerted on, and what are the ethics of that usage? What about war actually makes it terrible? Not in a general vague humanitarian sense but why are people dying somewhere else meaningful for me now? You are probably rolling your eyes already. These are extremely common questions that many works tackle. However, I have never seen a work explore them in the same way that Nausicaa does. Say what you will about it but it is without a doubt one of the most unique Masterpieces in sci-fantasy.

1 part Dune, 1 part Lord of the Rings, and 2 parts A Wizard of Earthsea this series combines unique world-building, noticeable but not heavy-handed philosophical exploration, a distinct atmosphere, and traditional sci-fi themes examined in unique ways. Many seem to love it or hate it, but for those who find something meaningful, it becomes an experience they will revisit for years. This is partly due to the quality of Nausicaa in each department. This was not a weekly release or a series largely influenced by a magazine's demographics as is the case with many manga series then and now. From the art, to the characters, to the framing of panels the series just seems so much more intentional than much of its competition. It truly feels as if the creator is truly in love with the story and everything around it. 

A first for me, you get to see an actual human's thoughts about a subject evolve in real-time. Not during the writing process before the final product but during the release of the final product. As the mangaka undergoes a noticeable change in worldview and outlook, it is clear the importance this has for the story and characters creating a real sense of genuine and significant growth. You could read the whole thing in six hours but you won't want to. You will likely find yourself stopping to contemplate things the series merely suggest or briefly touches on. This 1000 page epic took 12 years to create and stands as one of the pinnacles of the medium. It is worth the $40 bucks to buy the large hardbacks if you have the disposable funds.

I am sincere when I say this is an experience. I do not wish to give anything away because the plot, while important, is not really what you get from this series. So, I do not wish to say anything about the specific contents that may bias someone's entry into the series. However, I will say that when I think about what I consider to be the best of the best or a ""masterpiece"" in its medium I fall back on one thing. A certain indescribable something more that presents itself more as an emotional sense of deeper satisfaction or a state of mind that leads to serious introspection and intellectual musing. As pretentious as this sounds, I believe that most of you will understand what I mean. When you experience something truly great you understand it by the impact it has on you and your mental life. By its ability to transcribe its ""feeling"", or ""atmosphere"", and its themes into your mind in such a way that you can't help but ponder and remember them at the oddest of times. This series to both critical and popular acclaim has provided this to many.  


If you are skeptical about the merit of comics, read it. If you read comics but are skeptical about the merits of manga, read it. If you are a fan of fantasy fiction, read it. If you are a fan of sci-fi fiction, read it. If you want to read ecological fiction, read it. If you are a fan of Miyazaki's movies, read it because this is by far his magnum opus. In short, I think many people will find something to appreciate in this manga that will be deeper than they expected. But if this is not your thing more power to you. 


If nothing else, you will get a very Japanese-influenced perspective on war (very visible post-atomic bomb thoughts) and the idea of empire (yes, that bit is ironic) that is very rare in modern western stories. It also has a very interesting analysis of pacifism that goes beyond the usual naivety found in stories with the theme. All in all, you should do yourself a favor and buy the box set. If you absolutely hate it you can donate it to your local library and assure yourself that you are at least a benefactor of humanity, and then ask for a donation receipt and claim it on your taxes as a charitable deduction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m3xqvs/nausicaa_of_the_valley_of_the_wind_manga_that/,2021-03-13 03:04:59,1,28,books
7rpxkb,"Why is Tlön the ""tertiary"" world?","Last night, I finished an anthology of phantastical short stories, of which Borges' *Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius* was the final piece. Presuming that *orbis tertius* (""third world"" or ""tertiary world"") of the title is an epithet for Tlön, I am wondering what particularly accounts for the tertiality of it. Given the numerous allusions to philosophy present in the story, I am considering that perhaps this is a reference to the Fregean dictum *Die Gedanken sind weder Dinge der Außenwelt noch Vorstellungen. Ein drittes Reich muss anerkannt werden.* (""The thoughts are neither things of the external world, nor imaginations. A third world has to be recognized."" - my translation; I have here translated ""Reich"" as ""world"", as this so happens to be the ubiquitous translation of the term used in translations of Karl Popper's similar theory, but a literal translation of ""Reich"" would be ""empire"" and an acceptable compromise would perhaps be ""domain"".) It cannot be a reference to the more famous use of the term by Karl Popper, as Popper's theories invoking the term were published in the 1970s, long after the publication of the short story. What seems to speak against the identification of the *orbis tertius* with the Fregean third world seems to me to be that, while it is certainly thought up (I do not know enough about Frege to make a distinction between what he considers thoughts and what he considers imaginations, and why the latter is not a subset of the former), Tlön is quite distinctly composed of imaginations, so it is not what Frege tries to sever from imaginations as belonging into the distinct kind of the third world. 

But perhaps the ground for the name is instead wholly contained within the story itself, viz. the reasoning that the world containing Uqbar is the ""second world"", an imagination relative to the ""real world"" (of course, the real world of the story is already an imagination relative to *our* real world), wherein Tlön exists as the ""third world"" relative to the real world of the narrator. Such conscious reference to multiple layers of fictional containment seems to fit in with Borges' character as expressed by the themes he touches elsewhere in his works. 

Does anyone have any remarks on the matter, other speculation or perhaps even well-grounded information? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7rpxkb/why_is_tlön_the_tertiary_world/,2018-01-20 11:39:00,3,16,books
fi3ww2,"Just finished ""The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"" by Anne-Marie O'Connor and it was amazing!","I have wanted to read this book for years, ever since I found out about the movie that somewhat recently came out to tell the tale of the beautiful WWII era painting that the book is named for; I did the unthinkable and watched the movie first, only to realize after the fact that it was based on a book, and immediately added it to my TBR. It took me a couple years, but I finally got around to it and I am so happy I did. This post will not contain any specific spoilers, though it's an overall exultation of wonder at the beautiful book and the historical topics it touches on, so anything spoiled will be vague and in reference to well-known world events.

Non-fiction isn't normally my thing, I openly admit that. I run a huge book club server on Discord and non-fiction stuff is probably less than 10% of the books and authors people discuss on a daily basis; while that's not a bad thing per se as everyone has their own interests, I've made it a personal goal of mine over the past couple years to increase the amount of non-fiction I read to ensure my whole life isn't *just* amazing books about magic and futuristic space empires. I picked up ""The Lady in Gold"" thinking it'd be similar to the movie I'd seen, focusing entirely on a single famous painting and the legal battle that happened within the past 15 years to get it back from the Austrian government/art museums and into the hands of the descendants of the family that originally owned it - I was so very misinformed.

This book spends the first 75% talking about the time before the second World War, the high society families that lived in Austria, the painters that rose to fame (and sometimes infamy), and then lead into the Nazi regime's rise to power and Hitler's hyper focus on art as it pertained to Jewish painters or Jewish subjects in paintings. I started this book with the high level knowledge that Hitler had tried to be an artist early in life and failed, but I knew nothing more than that, and this book taught me everything about it and showed just how much that failure seemed to motivate many of his actions.

When finally getting past WWII and into life after the war, this book shows what the idea of reparations can mean, and the hurdles to provide such a restitution to victims of terrible crimes; as an American who has heard the idea suggested of reparations for the many years of slavery that occurred in our nation's past, it was so powerful to see a different kind of reparation discussed, sought out, and ultimately distributed (in some cases, not all). Imagining that on a scale here is mind boggling, and I don't know that it could ever happen, though more than ever I really wish that in some way it could.

I rambled this long to boil it down to this - if you're seeking a non-fiction book to pick up, and are at all interested in the WWII era or especially in the world of art, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Be prepared for a deluge of details, but know that they are so worth knowing. With much love and respect for the beautiful Adele Bloch-Bauer, I wish you all the best. <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fi3ww2/just_finished_the_lady_in_gold_the_extraordinary/,2020-03-13 18:05:21,5,9,books

**The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe** 

* **Plot:** An epic four book fantasy series chronicling the adventures of Severian of the Torturer's Guild. 
* **Page Count:** 
   * *The Shadow of the Torturer:* 304
   * *The Claw of the Concilliator:* 303
   * *The Sword of the Lictor:* 302
   * *The Citadel of the Autarch:* 330
* **Awards:** 
   * *The Shadow of the Torturer:* 1980 World Fantasy Award
   * *The Claw of the Concilliator:* 1981 Locus Fantasy and 1981 Nebula
   * *The Sword of the Lictor:* 1982 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: Yes, but it's an investment.
* **Primary Driver:** **Plot, World, or Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Both Technobabble and Fantasybabble in moderate quantities.
* **Review:** There is no denying that these books are remarkable. The attention to detail is astonishing, the writing is crisp, the characters are complex. Locales have their own personalities, the world is fleshed out, side characters and side stories are both brilliant. It's an intricate and well crafted work. On the other hand, to quote one of the characters: ""...You talk about it to me as someone else might talk about the weather."" Can be dry and a bit of a slog; some of the side stories, while interesting, feel forced into the broader narrative. Books do not stand on their own at all as individual stories. In terms of quality, I would probably say: 3, 2, 4, 1.

**Lord Valentine's Castle by Robert Silverberg's**

* **Plot:** An amnesiac wanderer goes on an epic quest to reclaim his identity. 
* **Page Count:** 506
* **Award:** 1981 Locus
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** **World**, **Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Minimal.
* **Review:** Despite it's sluggish pace and constant meanders there is something absolutely engrossing about this book. Tapdances right on the border of SF and Fantasy - and successfully balances both. Character interaction and conversations are solid throughout. Remarkable establishment of side-character personalities - including minor characters having their own arcs. Excellent use of power crawl and believable evolution of Valentine from passive to active protagonist. Got pretty tired of reading about juggling.

**Timescape by Gregory Benford**

* **Plot:** The only way to stop environmental and societal collapse is to contact the past to stop it from happening.
* **Page Count:** 499
* **Award:** 1981 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Oof. Somewhat?
* **Primary Driver:** **World**, **Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** To the max.
* **Review:** I cannot figure out why I enjoyed this book, but I did... until the truly interminable final 20%. Interesting applications of paradoxes, time loops, determinism, and everything else that fits in a good time-based story. That said, it's unbelievably slow. The majority of drama and action is about academic clashes, but I was somehow invested nonetheless. Some excellent character work; this does not apply to the women, who are all philandering, repressed, nymphomaniac arm-candy for the men involved. I hope you like the word ""Tachyon"" because you're going to see it a lot.

**The Snow Queen by Joan D. Vinge**

* **Plot:** The backwater planet of Tiamat has been under the control of the Snow Queen for 150 years. Summer is coming.
* **Page Count:** 448
* **Award:** 1981 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** **World**, **Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Minimal.
* **Review:** A delightful mix of fantasy tropes with science fiction twists. Tiamat itself feels solidly fantasy; the ageless Snow Queen, The Lady who gives some people visions and helps them, the separate regimes of Summer and Winter. Yet it is but one planet - and the rest are technologically developed. It's a remarkable balance that works surprisingly well. Side characters are great; distinct justifications, backstories, history together. Protagonists are... fine. The driving motivation being, once again, cousins in love... not great. They're also quite passive, which gets tiresome.

**The Many-Colored Land by Julian May**

* **Plot:** There's a portal that goes back six million years into the past and it only gets wackier from there.
* **Page Count:** 433
* **Award:** 1982 Locus
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** **World**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** This book is delightful. The premise is ridiculous, the explanations of ""science"" to explain what happened are pretty much nonexistent... but it's just so fun. Every opportunity where this book could go off the rails it does so. The characters are fun, though shallow. This book is what happens when you throw a sack of different world-building related nouns into a blender and say, ""Sure!"" Are the rules consistent? Yes, in that there are none. I was regularly surprised by things to the point where I was laughing out loud.

* **Worth a read**: This is one of the worst books I've ever read.
* **Primary Driver:** **World**
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail(?)
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Look, he uses his chance to go back in time to have sex with proto-humans. And yes, the pacing is awful, but at least the prose is terrible. I have nothing positive to say about this one, except that I've never seen the word ""beshat"" in a book. This is one of the very few I've encountered with an African American man as the lead - and holy guacamole is it an insulting portrayal.

**Sundiver by David Brin**

* **Plot:** Somehow, the Galactics missed a species - sentient creatures living at the edge of the Sun. It's up to humanity to investigate.
* **Page Count:** 340
* **Award:** Book 1 of the Uplift Trilogy - Books 2 and 3 won awards.
* **Worth a read**: Skip this one but read the next two.
* **Primary Driver:** **World**
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Frequent.
* **Review:** At the core of this book is a great theme: to join the broader galaxy of enlightened species, populations must be ""Uplifted"" - brought into the fold via a sponsor, and civilized. There's a key question - which race Uplifted humans? All of this is fun, and well done. It is also still at the heart of the sequel, which is a much better book. The plot of this is... fine. Characters are bland, interactions are stilted, relationships unbelievable. This isn't exactly a bad book - but it has nothing on the sequel, and is not necessary reading to understand it.

**Startide Rising by David Brin**

* **Plot:** Things quickly get out of hand when a ship crewed by humans, dolphins, and a chimp stumble upon a massive armada of abandoned spaceships, escalating to galactic-level drama.
* **Page Count:** 498
* **Award:** 1984 Hugo, 1984 Nebula, 1984 Locus SF 
* **Worth a read**: All aboard the hype train! Toot toot!
* **Primary Driver:** **Plot, World, or Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Sweet kittens and milk is this thing excellent. It's not a perfect book - characters can be hard to keep track of, relationships can be forced, some parts drag, and the machina has a whole bunch of deus. But there are so many good ideas in here. Uplift is brought to the fore: that a species needs another to bring it to the galactic scene. But what does that mean? How do we recreate other species in our own image? What debts do we owe each other? What if attempts to help a species fail? It's pure delightful science fiction - a masterpiece of speculation and technology and species and politics.

**The Uplift War by David Brin**

* **Plot:** It's all-out war pitting the Earthlings (both human and chimp) and their allies against the Gubru, a race of birdlike aliens... with no sense of humor.
* **Page Count:** 638
* **Award:** 1988 Hugo, 1988 Locus SF 
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** **Plot, World, or Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Everything that makes the concept of Uplift delightful is still here. This is a good follow up to *Startide Rising* \- but not a necessary one. Quality of writing is better, but pacing fluctuates, an overwhelming cast of characters can be hard to track, and deuses jump out of machinas frequently. This does add more depth to the mechanics of Uplift, but not to the broader ideas that made *Startide Rising* so cool.

**Nifft the Lean by Michael Shea***.\**

*\*The Incompleat Nifft,* which is the original and it's sequel.

* **Page Count:** 576
* **Award:** 1982 World Fantasy Award *(Nifft the Lean)*
* **Worth a read**: Absolutely
* **Primary Driver:** **Plot**, **World**, **Character**
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate (if we're including fantasy babble).
* **Review:** What an absolute joy to read. It's classic sword and sorcery in the best way. A number of shorter tales linked together throw Nifft all over the globe - and to hell and back - allowing the reader to see all sorts of different things. Pacing is quick, humor lands well. Character tropes are used to good effect, allowing quick 'n' dirty introductions to lots of different players. That said, there are a number of truly engaging characters and surprising twists. It's a light, quick, and delightful read.

* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** **World**, **Character** \[Charitably\]
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate Fantasy Babble.
* **Review:** I loathed this book. Pacing could be charitably described as dreamy - but more aptly as between lethargic and catatonic. Characters are as plentiful as they are unimaginative and disposable. Plot is not really a feature: all of the standbys for family drama are here, from ""You're Not the Father!"" through ""A Surprise Same-Sex Encounter?!"" with a bit of ""But She's My Sister!"" thrown in for good measure. Quality of writing is decent, but some striking phrasing and evocative images are nowhere near enough to redeem this one.

* **Award:** 1982 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: No.
* **Primary Driver:** **World**
* **Bechdel Test**: ...I'm not sure. 
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** The fact that I did not out and out die of boredom while reading this is all of the proof I needed to confirm that I have, in fact, been dead the whole time. It's an epic space opera with emphasis on the opera portion (for length and pacing, that is). A hefty cast of forgettable and interchangeable characters existing in a generic SF setting coupled with truly glacial pacing made this an absolute chore to read. Even scenes that should be exciting manage to be completely bland due to style choices. A smattering of neat ideas (clever uses of mind wipes in particular) are nowhere near enough to redeem this dud.

* **Technobabble:** High but plot relevant.
* **Review:** A set of nine interconnected stories that demonstrate the power and pitfalls of Psychohistory. Generally good writing and clever twists keep things engaging. A whole lot of exposition dumps. Characters are all flat. Concept is excellent, and each story highlights a different aspect. Feels like each segment successfully treads new ground, as opposed to rehashing. Some diminishing returns by the end, but absolutely worth a read as a whole. And the stories have aged astoundingly well.

* **Primary Driver:** **World**

* **Technobabble:** Moderate to high.
* **Review:** Some interesting moments mixed with some truly bizarre choices. Plot seems to constantly be a scene where one character says, ""Ah, I knew he would do that, and instead..."" and then the next says, ""Ah, I knew you would counter that, so I..."" and on we go. I did not enjoy the conclusion of this; in a universe with a number of interesting concepts, throwing in another in Act III of another book is an odd move. I hypothesize that this won because the previous three did not. Does not add anything interesting to the Foundation Universe; instead undercuts the core concepts that make the first three appealing.

* **Review:** For a book that is about the strong women surrounding King Arthur, dang are all the female characters weak. They are almost all motivated by some mix of: love, forbidden love, lust, desire for children, marriage, envy of beauty... every entry on the ""women's reasons"" list. Characters either blend together or eventually become caricatures of themselves - especially Gwenhwyfar, whose presence makes a scene unbearable. There are some really exceptional moments here, and some genuine surprises. But too few and too far between in a 1000 page epic.

* **Review:** This book is just well and truly awful. The haughty condescension from the author about how grounded the historical aspects are clashed with some painfully bad attempts at changing the past. Mix in some truly baffling choices as to when to adhere to actual historical events and when to veer away, and you've got yourself a stew. Characters have no traits that aren't explicitly stated, and, in the name of ""subterfuge"" these characteristics can change on a dime. Pacing is abysmal - switching at random from plodding discussions to sloppy action. Fantasy elements are handled with the grace of a baseball bat to the stomach.

Unfortunately it is populated by a bland, interchangeable, and generally uncompelling cast of characters. This is a striking downfall in a survival story; tragedy and difficulty mean little if one is not invested in any of the players involved. Worth skimming at a library for a taste of the world, but that alone does not carry a novel - this felt much longer than its 270 pages.

Relies at some points on tropes, but has enough novel ideas to be worth a read - especially at this length. It's a fun afternoon. Even after reading everything else, it's nice to get a new take on alien life - which is, in its own way, an impressive feat, given just how much SF material exists already.

At the request of a number of you, I’ve written up extended reviews of everything and made a blog for them. I’ve included the links with the posts for individual books. I try to put up new reviews as fast as I read them. 

Also, yes - these are only the books that won “Best Novel” and not any version of First Novel/Short Story/Novella or anything else. I might take a breather at some point and do some short stories, but that is a task for another day.

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man. Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it provides an easy binary marker. Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years. At the suggestion of some folks, I’m loosening it to non-male identified characters to better capture some of the ways that science fiction tackles sex and gender.

fsnki2,Musings on the Epic of Gilgamesh,"# Historical Context

Imagine being suddenly transported back in time 10 centuries. The good news is any person you encounter is likely to be a relative. You have approximately 1 billion great grandparents walking around in the year 1000 CE, which is all the more amazing since there were only about 300 million people on the planet. (Translation: you are the product of copious incest.) Of course, you’d want to chat with these grandparents. After some initial convincing (no doubt involving a quick explanation of exponential growth), I’m sure they’d want to chat with you too: pinch your cheeks, feed you, and complain about great-aunt Ælthelfreda.

Unfortunately, you can’t. Sometime before your explanation reaches the definition of the slope of a tangent line, you’ll notice the bemused look on great^(x) grandpa’s face and realize that he has no idea what you are saying. Even if you happen to be in the small part of the world where Old English is spoken around the year 1,000 CE, that language is mutually unintelligible with the language you are currently reading.

Now go back another 10 centuries (try not to think about all of your great^(xx) grandparents copulating with their cousins). You’re sometime around the year 1 AD, although nobody calls it that (even if you could understand their language). If you’re located somewhere in the Roman Empire, your nearest grandparent might call it year 754, as in “754 years from the founding of the city”. Actually, Rome might be a good place to be since the “Pax Romana” just started and it looks like your chances of being stabbed to death or raped by an enemy soldier are relatively low. Ovid’s summing up the history of the world nicely in his “Metamorphoses” and some Jewish hippie is being born in the Middle East. Incidentally, for the first time in our leisurely jaunt backwards through history, a particular city in Mesopotamia actually has a population. This city, Uruk, is old and much diminished under the Parthian empire. In a few hundred years, it will be totally abandoned. Luckily, we’re not going in that direction.

For a third time, let’s skip back 10 centuries. Romulus and Remus, mythological as they are, have not yet been suckled. There is probably a Mycenean military outpost where Athens will be and Homer, legendary or not, had not yet sung of Achilles or Odysseus. David, of giant-slaying fame, is becoming king of Israel. In Mesopotamia, the power structure is shifting, not for the first or last time. Babylonia is waning and its age-old rival in the north, Assyria, is poised to reclaim its hegemony. This will be called the ‘Neo’-Assyrian Empire to distinguish it from its two older incarnations. Uruk, at this time, is in much better shape than last (next?) we saw (will see?) it. In fact, the Neo-Assyrians are going to make Uruk a provincial capital in their empire. It is around this time, according to the most conservative estimates, that a scholar named Sîn-lēqi-unninni recompiled and updated a narrative about an ancient hero (uh…I mean ancient even for Sîn-lēqi-unninni). That hero happens to have been the king of Uruk: Gilgamesh.

We’d have to hop back in our Delorean (actually, like, twice more!) if we wanted to go all the way back to the actual, historical king Gilgamesh on whom these stories were based, but if you’re like me all this time travel stuff is starting to make you a little dizzy. So let’s rest in Sîn-lēqi-unninni’s time. We’ve travelled 3000 years back to find the first complete “Epic of Gilgamesh”. Actually, almost everything in that last sentence is wrong. It wasn’t the first. It’s still not complete. And it’s not really an “Epic”. Believe it or not, this is all part of the fun of reading it. If all of this seems like a long, arduous journey to a book discussion, that’s because it is. Form follows function. Gilgamesh took an impossibly long, arduous journey to get to us. And if half the stories about his legendary virility are true, he is almost certainly your great^(xxx) grandpa. So, really, you can look at this as a kind of “Big Fish”-style family history.

OK, OK, you get the point: this story is very old. But part of the challenge of wrapping your head around it is that it also relatively young. You see, the Gilgamesh’s story should not only be defined by all that came after it, but also by all that came before. While it’s hard to find a description of Gilgamesh that doesn’t include the word “oldest”, it’s really the culmination of a two-thousand-year literary tradition. First and foremost, there were the separate tales that were combined into the original “Old Babylonian” story (i.e. the one Sîn-lēqi-unninni was updating). These were about Gilgamesh’s many adventures, but he is only one character in a complex mythology of gods and kings.[ There were some 3,000 (!) named deities in cuneiform texts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mesopotamian_deities) There were also[ several creation myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_creation_myth), lots of religious hymns and royal praise poems, and even (my personal favorite) an[ enchanted war hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharur_(mythological_weapon)) that could talk and fly! Gilgamesh is only the most famous character in a rich mythological and literary landscape.

But that’s not the only reason the story can be considered “young”. It was also only recently discovered and translated. Gilgamesh may be much older than Achilles, but the latter has been analyzed by 150 generations of scholars, whereas Gilgamesh has been read by only about 8 since being rediscovered. Additionally, it’s still incomplete in more ways than one: only about 2/3 of it has been recovered from the original cuneiform and there are an increasing number of new editions, translations, and retellings. Somehow, the “oldest” story in the world continues to be molded today.

It is with all of this in mind that we can finally attempt to approach Gilgamesh on its own contradictory terms: impossibly old but young, simultaneously historical and legendary, singularly famous despite being just one of many, literally set in stone yet still mutable.

# The Story Itself

Gilgamesh is essentially a coming-of-age story. It begins with Gilgamesh as an impetuous youth who then grows into a devil-may-care-adventurer before finally maturing into a wise king. This character arc is impressive when contrasted with other ancient heroes. Achilles begins the Iliad as a great warrior who is angry and doomed and ends it as a great warrior who is angry and doomed. Odysseus encounters many trials in his quest to return home, but he arrives there with all the cunning determination with which he set out. Gilgamesh, for all his demi-godliness, is more relatable than that. He suffers great loss, but that does not define him. He sets out on a daring task and he fails. However, he still improves. And the mechanism by which he improves, learning to accept the inevitability of death, is something we can all do. We cannot slay Hector or outsmart the Cyclops, but we can learn to make the most of our short lives. I don’t know if Gilgamesh was written for royalty or peasantry (more on that later). What I do know is that either audience, or even an ignoramus on a distant continent 4,000 years in the future, could benefit from the lesson.

There are many other themes explored in the story: origin stories for natural phenomena, humility before the gods, and the proper duties of a king. One I find particularly interesting is the conflict between wild nature and civilized society. The wild-man Enkidu is civilized through (ahem…prolonged) sexual intercourse with a temple harlot. Aside from the obvious question for less divine lovers in the audience (HOW?!?!) there is the more cerebral question of why? Why does having sex with a temple harlot civilize Enkidu? Is there some power from her religious office or would having relations with any woman have the same effect? Is there something “civilized” about the act itself (animals have sex too, yanno) or is it because he was allowed to have sex with a human (as opposed to a gazelle) that did it? Whatever the reason, once one is indoctrinated into the cult of civilization, the benefits are clear. Enkidu tastes bread and beer for the first time, and he doesn’t seem too sore about not being able to graze with his wild beasts anymore (another marathon love-making session might have had something to do with that too…though it must have made him sore in other ways...)

# Reverberations

Despite these internal curiosities, the most intriguing questions about Gilgamesh are meta. For one, who was the audience? Were they courtiers in Gilgamesh’s palace reverently listening to the great deeds of their lord? Or were these bawdy campfire tales with peasants guffawing at Enkidu’s preternatural penis? Did soldiers tell the stories on long marches to kill time or did parents lull their children to sleep with the tales after long days of toil?

The so-called “experts” are not sure if the story was definitive or adapted in each telling. Perhaps fittingly, in trying to figure out if the Epic was extemporaneously riffed on like Homer’s Epics, we are riffing on it ourselves. In the end, it doesn’t matter what the Gilgamesh story “really was” like back then, because it is still being updated today. Like a 4,000 year old version of[ The Aristocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats), it’s never really finished.

I can’t help but wonder what an ancient Sumerian would think if he could be transported to a modern reading the story. Would he collapse in riotous laughter at the absurdity of how wrongly we translated it? Or would he stare in polite bemusement[ like the Dalai Lama did when that Australian dude told him the pizza joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyuIdmA0YE)?

Can we be naïve enough to believe that he would recognize it at all? If I ever become a billionaire, I’d like to hire a team of philologists, linguists, and cryptologists (and maybe one stoner from the “ancient aliens” demographic, just for fun) who are unfamiliar with Gilgamesh. I will lock them all in a room with the[ Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription) and all of the discovered Gilgamesh tablets and see if they come up with anything like our modern translations. To add to the fun, next door I will lock a team of the world’s most brilliant Assyriologists (in a high enough number for them all to feel a bit of peer pressure) and give them a “newly discovered” Gilgamesh tablet with a randomly generated combination of words from all other discovered tablets. Wouldn’t it be fun if they came out with a coherent story?

Reading Gilgamesh is like petting Schrödinger's cat. All of the various possibilities of the story exist simultaneously. You are in the quasi-legendary court of the historical King Gilgamesh listening to a minstrel sing of the king’s virility. You’re a scribe meticulously chiseling the friendship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu in stone two millennia later. At the same time, you’re a prince watching an actor’s portrayal of Gilgamesh slaying the “Bull of Heaven” before a ceremonial feast. Now you’re cowering behind your father’s legs as he points out the bull’s shape in the night’s sky. You’re a philosopher arguing the merits of Gilgamesh’s mundane wisdom. You’re a 19th century explorer digging up an ancient flood buried in sand. You’re a scholar in a musty museum basement deciphering a spurned goddess’ diatribe. You’re a 21st century reader mourning the brevity of Enkidu’s life-and your own.

For some, the gaps in the current narrative may be frustrating. For me, they enhance the story. Like a homing beacon to humanity transmitting a faint but steady signal from beneath the desert of Iraq, Gilgamesh has always been trying to reach us. Through an unbroken genetic chain and reverberating echoes in biblical stories, he has been calling to us. The discovery of the stone tablets has only boosted his signal. I like to think of the ellipses (…) in the translations as static noise in the radio transmission and the uncertain lines \[bracketed, in George’s translation\] as warped sounds as we turn the tuner left and then right to try to pick up the signal of the important message from our god-like ancestor:

remember….

……………….GILGAMESH….

……\[loved\], LEARNED, and lost

………………………………………..\[who did great things\]

……..Remember……..

………………………………………………………..gods…………….

\[BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE\]…

bf1ble,"This time I finished ""Red Seas under Red Skies"" (Book #2 in the Gentleman Bastard series) and it was .. very good.","Disclaimer 1 – **SPOILER ALERT**  
Disclaimer 2 – I had no frame of reference for comparison in the previous book. This time I do. And I intend to make full use of the privilege. There will be multiple references to “The Lies of Locke Lamora”, hereby abbreviated TLoLL.

Disclaimer 3 - This iis a review, but it's also my thoughts on the book. The fact that it doesn't seem personable or conversational - I hope that's fine?

I started this as soon as I was done with book #1 in the Gentleman Bastard series and that’s saying something about how captivated the first book’s world building left me that I didn’t want to get out of it. This, the 2nd book in the series was very good as well. Did I like it as Much as I did Book 1? No. But it still stood well on its own. Feels familiar to how Well of Ascension was in comparison to The Final Empire (Mistborn #2 and #1 respectively.)  
If TLoLL had us following Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen solely on land, this time their time was distributed between both land and sea. The book opens to a present-scene of confrontation and double-crossing (Scott Lynch wastes no time) and then we’re taken to a time when their previous story ended and this one began – aboard a ship sailing for Tal Verrar from Camorr. As in TLoLL, here as well, we have multiple timelines being narrated – a timeline of preparation for their activities and setting the stage for the “play” they mean to enact around unsuspecting characters and another timeline 2 years hence where the trickery is afoot. The main antagonists, so to speak, are Requin & Selendri and Maxilan Stragos and Merrain.  
Initially all Locke and Jean wanted to do was hoodwink Requin at the Sinspire and escape, but they find themselves unwillingly at the mercy of Stragos after the latter poisons them and enlists them as his contractors, giving them the task of stirring up trouble from the seas and bringing back piracy to Tal Verrar, so that he, Stragos could defeat them using his navy and seem victorious in the eyes of the city, so as to seem in control as opposed to his current shunted standing. This puts quite the dent in Locke and Jean’s plans, so they have to improvise their plans to factor this new development and Locke decides to do what he does best – pretend to be a double agent, trying to gain the favors of Requin to beat Stragos, who the Master of the Sinspire does not like either.   
Following this brief bit of initial setup on land, the duo are sent to sea to pretend Captain and First Mate of a ship called The Red Messenger, assisted and directed behind the scenes by an actual seamaster, Caldris. Unfortunately Caldris dies while they are at sea and they are found out by the crew and mutinied.   
This is the first of admittedly very few hints of convenience I felt Scott Lynch exploited as he introduced Captain Drakasha and her ship, the very people who the Archon needed as pawns for his plan, into the mix, with no real struggle on Locke and Jean’s part except a few hours of sailing on a boat.   
Aside from that and a couple other mild issues, I felt the overall plot was well done and tied together. The finesse of TLoLL was missing as was a lot of the banter and Father Chains, Calo, Galdo and Bug were missed. There was also a gaping hole in the non-usage of an “ally” they picked up as they were training for their tower-jumping escapade at The Sinspire. But I’m sure **that** was a calculated move.

Locke had set himself up to be the primary antihero in TLoLL. Here we see Locke a lot in the background as compared to Jean. Then again, this can be argued to be a plot feature illustrating Locke’s mood and possible post-trauma effects inflicted upon him because of his losses and his wounds. To that end, the romance between Jean and Ezri Delmastro and the focus on their relationship was a pleasant introduction and read; not at all overly mushy as these scenes tend to be. What I also liked was how Scott gave the series a strong female character in Drakasha. I loved the chapters where was in focus and her way of balancing a ship as well as her role as a mother. The touch of insistence that a cat and a woman **were** necessary for a smooth sailing and several minute details were also very welcome.

One thing I noticed particularly was how we see Stragos’ mind at work in one of the chapters – his perspective was given importance. We’ve been used to seeing only the protagonists’ perspectives thus far. This also set the tone for Merrain as a far more important player than she portrayed herself to be, which was evident when she escaped despite Jean and Locke’s efforts and plans.   
Another thing that I loved was the consistency in the relationship between Jean and Locke; they remained thick as …well..thieves throughout, even with that one minor argument they had that they bounced back from relatively quickly, ego suppressed and all that. Well done. And Locke’s act in the final scene was lovely. Sealed the deal and all that.

I won’t tell you how the book ends for two reasons – If you’ve read it, you already know. And if you haven’t, I’d rather you discover this bit for yourself. I can’t rob you of that pleasure even if you did sign up for the spoilers.

I’m definitely looking forward to reading The Republic of Thieves for 3 reasons – The Bondsmagi of Karthain, Sabetha’s arc and to see if Locke escapes the clutches of death again.

PS – Learnt a lot about ships and nautical terms in this book. Good, that.

ftik0,Help me remember the name of this fantasy book. Hero is a sociopath with great speaking skills and reflexes. He's searching for his father.,"I barely remember this book from years ago, but I remember liking it and liking the hero. I want to reread it and any sequels.

The hero was bred from a young age with a bunch of little kids in a temple (think shaolin stuff) to be a master of intellect and to have stellar reflexes. The final exam has his old bastard master throwing a knife at the kid's face from a few feet away, the hero catches it. 

His dad was a real dick to him, if I recall, and maybe the king of some mongol-like tribe of nomads. The kid leaves, and the story opens with him as a young man tracking through the snowy woods and coming upon a swordsman. 

Other bits... there's a weird fruity all-powerful emperor (think the guy from 300) and the hero somehow insinuates himself into the empire and undermines the emperor, who is young and arrogant. He uses fancy speaking skills to make it sound like the emperor fucked up (something like ""since logically we can see a beggar is the same as the emperor..."" which the emperor knows is bullshit, but his clique sort of turns against him anyway).

The hero presents himself as a prophet to the emperor's crew and ends up moving out with their army to go fuck some people up at the other end of a desert.  At some point he screws up a predication or it's decided he's a false prophet, and based on their holy writings they bind him upside down to hang from a tree with a rotting corpse tied to him. Somehow he survives this. I think the holy writings were on a giant tree or stone held at the center of the emperor's inner sanctum.

2nd place: *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin - nominated by /u/sSlipperyPickle

>This is the way the world ends. Again.  
>  
>Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  
>  
>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

**Best Debut of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fxcbo7/best_debut_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi - nominated by /u/okiegirl22

>Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of *Homegoing* follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, *Homegoing* makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.

2nd place: *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/baddspellar

>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles.

But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.

**Best Literary and General Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g2186t/best_literary_and_general_fiction_of_the_decade/)

**1st place:** *Circe* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/honeyiamsorry

>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  
>  
>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.  
>  
>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

2nd place: *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante - nominated by /u/SinoJesuitConspiracy

>My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.

3rd place: *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara - nominated by /u/Scurvy_Dogwood

>When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.  
>  
>Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

**Best Mystery or Thriller of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g684bn/best_mystery_or_thriller_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Gone Girl* by Gillain Flynn - nominated by /u/johnnywash1

>Marriage can be a real killer.On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge.

**Best Short Story Collection of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gag0qp/best_short_story_collection_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Tenth of December* by George Saunders - nominated by /u/rjbman

>In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of *Tenth of December* are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.

2nd place: *Exhalation: Stories* by Ted Chiang - nominated by /u/amyousness

>This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate,"" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ""Exhalation,"" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""  
>  
>In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

3rd place: *Homesick for Another World* by Ottessa Moshfegh - nominated by /u/ApollosCrow

>There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. *Homesick for Another World* is a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and *Homesick for Another World* is her *Everything That Rises Must Converge* or *A Good Man is Hard to Find*. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources, and the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp. The needle hits the vein before we even feel the prick.

>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In *Annihilation*, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's *Southern Reach Trilogy*, we join the twelfth expedition.  
>  
>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman's Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.

3rd place: *My Best Friend's Exorcism* by Grady Hendrix - nominated by /u/leowr

And as the strange coincidences and bizarre behavior start to pile up, Abby realizes there’s only one possible explanation: Gretchen, her favorite person in the world, has a demon living inside her. And Abby is not about to let anyone or anything come between her and her best friend. With help from some unlikely allies, Abby embarks on a quest to save Gretchen. But is their friendship powerful enough to beat the devil?

**Best Non-Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0jyb8/best_nonfiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman - nominated by /u/TriangleTingles

>In the highly anticipated *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.  
>  
>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will transform the way you think about thinking.

2nd place: *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI* by David Grann - nominated by /u/GanymedeBlu35

>  
>Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.  
>  
>In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.

>  
>In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ""unicorn"" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.  
>  
>For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at *The Wall Street Journal,* got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the *Journal* were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors.

npyicr,My Review for The Hellborn King by Christopher Brenning," [https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/01/the-hellborn-king-christopher-brenning/](https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/01/the-hellborn-king-christopher-brenning/)

""There would be time enough to mourn for his love, but it would’nt be now, Gareth Bethard had decided. Now would come a time of blood, and death, and hate.""

So what’s the book about?

The North wants to reclaim their land after a massacre of their people and now Damien Dreadfire is bringing together an army of disparate people to stand against the kingdom. The fate of the North culture and the entire nation depends on the outcome of the battles in the kingdom, but warriors are in short supply. Damien can count on the help of his friend Einarr, who is becoming more and more divided by his friend Damien’s actions. For he carries out atrocities to get closer to his goal and will stop at nothing. The attacked kingdom, however, has its own problems, for a king who only devotes himself to alcohol, rules the country. Or his son, the crown prince Gareth, who is unable to find his way in his role. As Gareth tries to become a better successor to his father, he gets caught up in more and more conspiracies and has to fight his own family in the process. Therefore, the kingdom faces not only the enemy from the north, but also itself.

Why I wanted to read this series?

I received a copy of the book from the author himself, which I am very happy about, in exchange there is an honest review about the book. I would also like to say thank you very much here again. When I received the request, of course I immediately searched on Amazon for the book to read the blurb of it. When I got the search result, I was first very surprised about the incredibly beautiful cover of the book. Then I read the blurb and was immediately thrilled. Because this one sounds like war and intrigue and that’s what I particularly like. I felt reminded of The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie and since this is one of my favourite books, I was of course enthusiastic!

These aspects attracted me the most while reading.

This story takes you into a cruel world, full of atrocities and barbarians – and that’s the kind of story we all want to read! For the world is not only cruel because of its enemies from the north, but also because its own empire is crumbling. The king is a drunkard and wife-beater, the son who can’t get anything done either, and the siblings who make things even more complicated. So an exciting intrigue is built up within the kingdom, in which everyone plays their own game and you experience many surprises. And the fighters from the north don’t make things any easier for the king either. But even if you expect the king to move against the attackers here, you have misunderstood something. For the realm of Betanthia is not at all interested in the Nordic people slaughtering their own people, but simply let them go. Only a few fighters oppose them, which makes the situation seem even more hopeless. For the nobles of the empire are more interested in their own game for the throne than in standing up for the common people, and so everyone has to look out for themselves.The story is told very slowly and at first, you don’t know what each of the main characters is supposed to do for the story. However, this builds up an incredible tension because at first you get to know all the characters in detail, you know their weaknesses and faults and their dreams. You feel very connected to them and can understand their suffering. Nevertheless, each character in this story has a very individual experience that completely changes the story around the character. Thus, a separate arc of tension is built up for each character and not for the whole story, which has strengthened the connection to the character, but you also don’t know how everything will come together later. You are plunged into different adventures with each individual character, and you don’t even know which one is the most exciting. You get intrigues, fights, but also the inner struggle with oneself is fought out with the characters and thus the tension is always kept high on different levels.In this book, there is a role reversal between the typical gender characteristics – the women here are ambitious, show strength and also have a will of their own, whereas the men have to fight with themselves, don’t want to fight against others at all and care more about love or friendship. The typical image of women or men does not come from anyway and that is why I find it all the more exciting to read when these character traits are simply changed. Often in books there is always a strong woman or an effeminate man, but here everyone has really swapped roles, although in this world you find the typical gender roles, such as men fighting and women having children. And through the book it is shown that there is nothing wrong with what gender you are and despite that can behave differently than society dictates, because women make it to positions that women would have only dreamed of back then and men can show their feelings even if they still get setbacks.Lucetta is actually a completely unworldly princess who you can tell has never lived outside her society and yet I was able to take her to my heart and she became my favourite character in this book. Because Lucetta changes after she sees the completely run-down capital and has to see how the poor have to live there. From there on she changes, because she wants to change something in this world, even though she has never lifted a finger herself. Moreover, from then on, the girl, who at first only lives lonely in her privileged world, changes and becomes a ruthless adult who stands for her goals and ambitions. Lucetta has the most exciting part of this book, because she doesn’t have to fight for her goals alone.

So what are my final thoughts about it?

This is a cruel and very serious story, reminiscent of Joe Abercrombie’s world. Because nothing is as it seems, the characters experience an incredible development through the first part, thanks to their also incredible, even partly disturbing, experiences. This story is very character driven and I have to say that every single character is interesting and I enjoyed reading it. Even though Madelyn came across as a little too generic at first, she was able to convince me so much towards the end that she made up the most exciting ending for me. The book is also more of a low fantasy story, with more of a focus on politics and combat and only a hint of fantasy, but this made me identify with the world much more, as the magic that is present does seem very real. The only negative point I could find are the time jumps at times, which took away from the rythm of the story. This is a story that not only brings war to the kingdom, but the kingdom itself is at war. The ending was so exciting that I can’t wait to read the next volume!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/npyicr/my_review_for_the_hellborn_king_by_christopher/,2021-06-01 16:49:22,0,1,books
gcetbb,So I found this old travel guide to Syria-Palestine at a flea market in Ohio. Is there a way to know if the owner ever took a trip to that region?,"I actually posted this in a different subreddit awhile ago, but got no answers. With me currently not doing much of anything right now, I figured I'd give it a shot here. I hope, even if nobody can come up with anything, that you can enjoy the read.

So, this thing's been bugging me for the last 5 or so years since I've gotten it. I'm gonna need to give some context that I've been able to dredge up, so strap in. Sorry if this is a bit long-winded. What I've got (and I can post pictures if that helps, just don't know exactly how to do that) is a copy of John Murray's ""Handbook for Travellers in Syria-Palestine"", from 1879, so that's what I'm thinking the earliest possible starting date is for her journey. I was able to find that went to Cornell University from \~1876-1880, so maybe she went on a trip after graduating? On the first page, it's signed by someone named Alice Evelyn Rose, who, according to her, lived at what was then 971 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio. That would line up with her being the daughter of a mayor of Cleveland, William Grey Rose, and living on what was apparently called ""Millionaire's Row"". The book itself has, on the one of the beginning pages, places listed in small handwritten ink letters ""Constantinople"" and ""Athens"", with names of places within them listed respectively, like ""Con. : Mosque of Eyoub..."" etc. and ""Athens : Theatre of Bacchus..."" etc. It seems like this was written at the same time as when she wrote her name in the book, as these are the only places with ink in them and the ink quality seems similar. The majority of the book is clean and untouched except for the portion on Jerusalem, which has a pencil-written ""x"" at the top of every page. I figure she took special interest in that region in particular. The very back page of the book has a list of dozens of locations written in what appears to be pencil, from Smyrna to Damascus, finally ending at Port Said. A Greek monk I work with at a little church here in town told me it matched up quite well with where she might've traveled, going from the Ottoman Empire to Egypt. I know at least that her family is no stranger to travel, because I found a book by her mother published in 1901 about travels in Europe and North Africa. He guessed that Alice might've bought the Syria-Palestine book in Constantinople since it was one of the cities the book was published, which explains why that portion is written differently in the front. Is there anyway to find any kind of travel logs or registers that could let me know whether she actually went on this journey? Is there some better place I could go about asking this? I know it seems very strange and roundabout to be so obssesed this kind of thing, but I'm a Library/Information Science grad student and was a history major in undergrad, so I find books with weird, mysterious histories to be really interesting. Thank-you for any help anyone might be able to give.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gcetbb/so_i_found_this_old_travel_guide_to/,2020-05-02 21:58:22,6,34,books
dilwdq,"[Discussion] Finished reading Gardens of the Moon, by Steven Erikson ! Spoilers Inbound!","  

!!!**SPOILERS**!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today I finished reading the book I of “Malazan Empire of the Fallen”, titled “Gardens of the Moon”, penned by Steven Erikson. I would like to talk (okay, rant) about this book and would love to hear your opinion about it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. what I loved

&#x200B;

a. An awesome character roaster! So many characters and so many backstories, all interesting enough to remember them even after finishing the book.

b. Non-generic characters, even though the jobs they do are fairly generic (assassin, mage, soldier, spy etc.)

c. Kruppe! What an awesome character! Seriously, his awesomeness hit me like a wall, how unexpected to see a gluttonous, greedy, talking about self in third person, arrogant fatboi, be so awesome!

d. Rallik Nom, and overall workings of an assassination guild. I have played many assassins creed games, and I realized what was irking me in these games while I was reading this book – the assassin jobs are immoral, and often the targets are innocents. Hence, they are called assassins and not some romanticized bounty hunters. Rallik’s charater and the inner workings of his mind made me realize how watered down Ezio’ character was, lol.

e. Subtle details and small insights in even the minor characters, like Circle Breaker, Murrillio, Coll, Quick Ben’s awesomeness etc.

f. There are no explicit villains, simply men and women following different paths. I could not hate anyone, maybe except Laseen, but she was such a faraway person, just a name really. I think it really reflected reality well, where truly evil people are rare, and even the most tyrannical nations are just faceless organizations manned by normal people.

g. The way paths of main characters cross, characters who are not related by any means, and not even supposed to know each other! I thought it was a great achievement of storytelling how organic it felt. Like true wtf moments, where the characters are as baffled as the reader.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2. what I disliked

&#x200B;

a. a bit infodumpy. I get that we are thrust in a living breathing world alien to us, but sometimes too many things were introduced too fast, for e.g. the T’lan Imass, and the Jaghut history. I liked that after a while, not bad, but at times it did dampen my interest.

b. The frigging poems that begin each chapter! I may be totally out of touch whn reading poetry, but I could not make a head or tail of the poems. Like I get that they are supposed to refer to history and foretell what is to come in the chapter, but personally I found them infuriatingly inept. Yes. Perhaps anyone could enlighten me?

c. Some points only click after passing thorough fair bit of the story, but meanwhile I couldn’t recall a lot of finer detail from the past, so I am sure I will catch may things if I read the book again from the beginning. Which means I couldn’t appreciate a lot many things in my first reading.

d. Took a long while for me to finish the book. :/ 

e. While the story is good, sometimes deus ex machina comes in play, like the assassins of Crimson Guard, or kruppe being The Eel which is very convenient and a little hard to believe even after the book telling us so openly.

f. Most frustrating – the unnecessary addition of the “Finnest”, and the thing that finally imprisoned the Jaghut Tyrant – Azath. What happened there? Why did Lorn plant the “Finnest”/acorn in Darujhistan? Did she want to bait the Tyrant? May be, but how come that acorn grew to be the Azath, the thing that ended the Tyrant?

g. Inexplicable things, like the forced role of Paran in stopping/ slowing down the Tyrant. He simply vanished from one place and arrived at the edge of the lake, far away from where he was before, did the deed, and was teleported back as quickly as he was taken? If this is not a glaring and weird Deus Ex Machina then what is?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. Why this particular title – Gardens of the Moon? What’s the connection? I gather that it is connected to the Moon’s Spawn, the floating city/mountain, and the large part the Lord of the Moon’s Spawn plays in the book… but then again it doesn’t really connect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

4. Finally, I like the book, a lot. I found it first recommended at r/books and took it up, and I knew it was based on D&D campaigns. I am no stranger to fantasy genre, but I have never before read something like this. It felt, I don’t know, real, like I was reading a piece of history (apart from above mentioned flaws). I would really like to hear your opinions about this book, since I have no one around me who might have read this book and discuss it :/ It took me like 3 months to read it lol but for sure I am going to read the next books in the series!

TLDR: Read “Gardens of the Moon” by Steven Erikson. Loved it enough to decide on reading the next book!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dilwdq/discussion_finished_reading_gardens_of_the_moon/,2019-10-16 07:36:44,9,11,books

2nd place: *On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, by Ocean Vuong*. Nominated by /u/coolyikes

>*On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South in the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called The Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides ""physical, intellectual and moral training"" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become ""honorable and honest men.""In reality, The Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors, where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear ""out back."" Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr. King's ringing assertion ""Throw us in jail and we will still love you."" His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked and the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble.The tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at The Nickel Academy.Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, *The Nickel Boys* is a devastating, driven narrative

And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time.

It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.It was everything.She knows she’s made mistakes.

**Best Non-Fiction of 2019** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ebl4ov/best_nonfiction_of_2019_voting_thread/)

**Winner:** *Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Nothern Ireland, by Patrick Radden Keefe.* Nominated by /u/candlesandpretense

>In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville’s children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress–with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe’s mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past–*Say Nothing* conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.

2nd place: *Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, by Ronan Farrow.* Nominated by /u/candlesandpretense

>In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood's most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family.All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance they could not explain -- until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood to Washington and beyond.This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, *Catch and Kill* breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook our culture.

3rd place: *Permanent Record, by Edward Snowden.* Nominated by /u/spitfire8125

>In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, *Permanent Record* is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, *Permanent Record* is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.

>What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal.

Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?

And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

**Winner:** *They Called Us Enemy by George Takai, Justin Eisinger, Steven Scott, and Harmony Becker.* Nominated by /u/ME24601

>Long before George Takei braved new frontiers in *Star Trek*, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's -- and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future.In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten ""relocation centers,"" hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard.*They Called Us Enemy* is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the joys and terrors of growing up under legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future.

**Winner:** *Shout, by Laurie Halse Anderson*. Nominated by /u/CrazyCatLadyForLife

>Bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson is known for the unflinching way she writes about, and advocates for, survivors of sexual assault. Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel *Speak* was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Searing and soul-searching, this important memoir is a denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #metoo and #timesup, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts. *Shout* speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.

ha2ncz,The Trigger: Taking the Journey that Led the World to War - Tim Butcher,"Just finished this.

This is a remarkable book for many reasons. All at once, it is a travelogue/travel guide that makes you want to backpack across Bosnia, an incisive socio-political analysis of the Bosnian War and the tragedy that it has left in its wake, and a riveting historical account of Gavrilo Princip, and the circumstances that made him a ""murderer""/""liberator""/""socialist hero""/""terrorist"". 

The book is a narrative of the author's trek across Bosnia and Serbia. He is following the route taken by the teenaged Gavrilo Princip from Obljaj in rural Bosnia, to Sarajevo for his secondary education, on to Belgrade (where he is radicalised), and back to Sarajevo to commit the act that immortalised him. On this trek, the author is constantly trying to put himself in the shoes of Princip, who, until then, had never left the confines of his native village, let alone travel all the way to the Sarajevo or Belgrade. He explains how Princip began to see the yoke of imperial oppression at the hands of the Habsburg dynasty for what it really was: an extractive regime based on the suffering of the South Slavic people, which was no different from what the Ottoman Empire had done until a few decades ago. Based on primary sources, the author portrays Princip as a voracious reader with a taste for socialist literature, but also a pragmatic revolutionary with a keen desire for Slavic liberation. 

While tracing Princip's route is a great way to write his history, it is certainly not novel. What sets this book apart is that in addition to Princip's own journey, there are two more narratives that the author traces: 

1. 1940s: The journey of the Communist Separatists (led by Tito) who were fighting against Nazi occupation, spurred on by direct British aid, especially in the form of experienced personnel (for eg., Fitzroy McLean). 
2. 1990s: The author's own journey through those very towns and villages as a foreign correspondent during the Bosnian war, accentuated horribly by the ethnocide that was unfolding before his very eyes.

Both of these narratives add layers to the book, and enhances its value as a comprehensive work on the modern history of Bosnia, seen through the eyes of conflict. 

The research undertaken by the author preceding his journey is rich in detail, and he has used it to good effect in writing this book. Sifting through a century of lies and misrepresentations that have accumulated in Princip's wake, the author has finally managed to portray a factually accurate account of Princip's  eventful (albeit brief)life.

But the author’s trek itself (on the trail of Princip) adds directly to the corpus of research only at two points: the author's meeting with Princip's last living relatives in Obljaj, and Princip's hitherto unexplored academic records from the Merchant School in Sarajevo. These are the only two novel contributions of the author to the research on Princip's life.

But the real contribution of the trek was that it enabled the author to explain the manner in which Princip's often forgotten legacy lives on in Bosnia and Serbia. Using interviews and informal chats with guides, innkeepers, and a variety of other locals as he trekked across the mountains of Bosnia, the author explains how the factors motivating Princip’s actions have regularly been interpreted and reinterpreted to shape popular sentiment and have been leveraged by successive ruling dispositions to suit their whims.

The most proximate factor in the assessment of Princip's legacy is the Bosnian war, and the brutal way in which it split the three ethnic groups in Bosnia. This schism, and the ethnic loyalities it produced, have to be kept in mind ""when dealing with any local assessment of Princip"". The way the author has managed to navigate the local identities, and has managed to interpret their coloured stories of Princip amidst a shocking but expected lack of objectivity, is what makes this book a remarkable work of history. As a conflict reporter who was in the thick of things during the Bosnian War, the author is uniquely qualified to comment on this subject. He is not exactly a disinterested and neutral observer, but at the same time, he does not feel the survivor’s guilt that plagues many Bosnians, and prevents them from opening up about the horrific consequences of identity politics in their country.

This book is about change and it is also about stasis. As a reader, you will get the feeling that in the Balkans, history frequently trips over itself. By the author’s own admission, “\[h\]istory does not rest easily in Bosnia”.

Ending on a slightly less sombre note, I feel that this book should  it should be advertised as a travelogue in addition to a work of history. Needless to say, I do not intend that as a criticism. I feel like it would add to the popular appeal of the book, and ensure that more readers pick it up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ha2ncz/the_trigger_taking_the_journey_that_led_the_world/,2020-06-16 12:02:41,0,4,books
lti7yo,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes Review (No Spoilers),"Tl;dr Its very good.

Recently I bought the highly anticipated and much discussed prequel novel to the Hunger Games Trilogy, “A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” (I’ll refer to it hereafter in short as Songbirds and Snakes.) Over the course of two days, ranging from long reading sessions well into the night to bite-sized bouts in downtime, I’ve since finished reading it. I know I’m late to the party, but it ain’t over till the Mockingjay sings.

You probably don't know, but some months ago I posted my worries about Songbirds and Snakes on the Hunger Games Subreddit , saying that these kinds of prequel stories to popular franchises only tend to confuse and anger fans through muddled worldbuilding, unneeded callbacks, and trying too hard to capture lightning in a bottle. See: Star Wars Prequels, Fantastic Beasts, Hobbit Trilogy (I know the hobbit novel was written before the lord of the rings novels, but the Hobbit film was made AFTER the LOTR films, and as an explicit prequel, so it counts.) But to get back on track, I was worried that a similar occurrence would happen with this novel, especially upon finding out that it would be focused on a teenage, presumably hot, Coriolanus Snow, and that he would be mentoring a tribute, a girl from district twelve. All of this seemed poised to at best disappoint, and at worst anger. Which is why I’m proud to say that, for me personally, it has done neither. Instead, Songbirds and Snakes is a tale that’s every bit as riveting, thought-provoking, and inspired as the original trilogy of novels. It has it’s up and downs, it’s interminable flaws that keep it down, and maybe I’m simply buzzing from the fact that I’ve finished it, so in truth only time will tell how it holds up. But right now, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a more than worthy addition to the world of the Hunger Games.

My fears that the story would be too simple and reductive were assuaged as the novel went on. Suzanne Collins has lost none of her talent in weaving together character decisions and ethical dilemmas, as our intrepid young protagonist is forced to make truly impossible choices. Love or survival, preservation of the self or a clear conscience, personal want or personal need, what will he choose? The characterization of Snow puts us in his headspace, the head of someone desperate to not just survive, but acquire the status he feels he deserves. The prose of Collins has shifted accordingly, from that of a young, rash, blunt teenage girl to that of a young, calculating, and two-faced teenage boy. Snow straddles the line between sympathetic and not, intelligent and impulsive, a man who’s a product of his environment desperately trying to break from it, and a man who willingly makes choices to help solidify his standing in it. This grey area is where the best characters thrive, and being in his head throughout the whole novel, we slowly but surely understand the psyche of the man who became an unflinching, remorseless, dictator.

Snow is but one part of the story. The other most important character of the story is his tribute, the district 12 girl, Lucy Gray Baird. On her, I must admit, I was conflicted but not on her characterization. She’s a fascinating individual of great artistry and deep feeling, an excellent foil to our calculating, pragmatic central character. At first I thought it was odd how little she changed considering her circumstances, but then I remembered that she’s used to dangerous situations, and like Peeta, is the eternal optimist who truly believes in the inherent goodness of people. My issue resided on her place in the story and in the history of Panem. Knowing that she’s a female tribute from district twelve, I wondered if it was a too obvious allusion to the future girl on fire, and felt it somewhat detracted from Snow’s hatred towards Katniss, making it too personal. However, I’m also reminded that the method of tying characters and their place in the story to larger, overarching themes is a favorite, and effective, tactic of Collins. Will Katniss choose the boy with the bread, the one full of innocence? Or the boy who’s a hunter, full of fire? It’s a similar story here. Lucy Gray is the fire to Snow’s ice, no pun intended, the one who brings out the best in him, and there's a truly special connection there. But the world of Panem is cruel, and the two must make choices with irrevocable consequences.

Speaking of which, the excellent world-building of the first three novels is in full swing here. Songbirds and Snakes expands on the history and locales of Panem, filling in the voids that were left unexplained in the trilogy, while tantalizingly making even more history of it’s own. Not only that, but like any prequel worth it’s salt, it slyly plants the seeds of bigger things to come, ranging from the mechanics of The Hunger Games to the aforementioned personality of President Snow. Some prequel stories have the issue of being too similar to their forthcoming source and not being interesting as a result. Take Solo: A Star Wars Story, the origin of Han Solo. The writers of that film saw “origin story” and thought only of surface level stuff. “Alright, where did he get the falcon, where did he get his jacket, where did he get his gun, ummmm, we need more stuff for him to get, oh, how about his name? Where’d he get his name from?” leaving no room to develop his personality. He starts that story as a charismatic, rogue-ish smuggler, and ends it as a charismatic, rogue-ish smuggler with the millennium falcon and a walking carpet. This issue also extends to the world it presents, which is not too dissimilar to what was shown in the original trilogy: a used future full of criminals and stormtroopers, fighting the empire. Not so in Songbirds and Snakes, where the Capitol is instead a very different place than what it will eventually become in 64 years, and even the Hunger Games will evolve into something more advanced, and as a result, more nightmarish.

If there’s one place I have to dock Songbirds and Snakes on, it’s in it’s ensemble cast of characters. There are standouts, like the righteous Sejanus and cold-hearted Dr. Gaul, but in my opinion there are too many of them and are also not distinct enough. Most characters range from dull idiots to insufferable high-asses, and the rest lie somewhere in the middle. It’s unfortunately a far cry from the diverse and electrifying cast of thousands from the original trilogy. I don’t blame Collins, there’s only so many archetypes to draw from, especially after three, now 4, lengthy novels, but this goes through to even their names. So many of them are unpronounceable and ridiculous. I can live with Heavensbee and Abernathy, but I draw the line at Hilarius and Highbottom. And no, pointing out that it’s ridiculous doesn’t excuse it. Ok, it excuses it a touch, but still!

Also, I know music has always been a big part of the Hunger Games, but there are way too many goddamn songs in here, and with the way they’re formatted, Collins must have fattened out the page count by a decent length with just how many songs are sung. But to be perfectly fair, they do advance the story, reveal character, or add to the history of this world, not just to their past, but also their future. If you read the novel, you’ll know what I mean.

Finally, the ending. I won’t spoil it, but I’ll say this: the way things came to a head was fantastic. It’s some of the best writing I’ve seen in years, it ratchets up the tension like no other, and is a different type of climax than you would expect from these novels. It also leaves you wanting to read the whole book again, picking up on subtleties you may have missed before. I’m a bit worried that the situation presented might be taken at face value by some readers, (and unfortunately some people on the hunger games subreddit have proven me correct) but over time I think most will see the poetry between the lines. If nothing else, it’s proof that Collins treats her readers with respect, leaving them to work out the details.

All in all, I was pleasantly surprised, thrilled, and engaged by Songbirds and Snakes. It does everything a good prequel to a popular franchise should do: fill in the gaps left behind by the original source, be a compelling story in of itself, and not be filled with member berries. Well, maybe a few here and there. Ultimately, like all good tragic stories, it makes you believe that maybe, just maybe, our protagonist will overcome their flaws and rise to the occasion. But there’s no satisfaction of that nature here. Instead, it's the satisfaction of witnessing the birth of an ongoing, fascinating, never-ending ballad, of songbirds and of snakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lti7yo/the_ballad_of_songbirds_and_snakes_review_no/,2021-02-27 06:36:49,17,38,books

Thankfully she has the other outcasts of the summer program, Team Misfit Toys, and even her twin sister Pauline. Together they ace obstacle courses, plan vigils for missing women in the community, and make sure summer doesn’t feel so lost after all. But when she attends a meeting at a local university, Perry learns about the “Warrior Girl”, an ancestor whose bones and knife are stored in the museum archives, and everything changes. Perry has to return Warrior Girl to her tribe. Determined to help, she learns all she can about NAGPRA, the federal law that allows tribes to request the return of ancestral remains and sacred items. The university has been using legal loopholes to hold onto Warrior Girl and twelve other Anishinaabe ancestors’ remains, and Perry and the Misfits won’t let it go on any longer.|/u/DrNutmegMcDorf

That is, until she begrudgingly agrees to play in one last charity tournament and inadvertently wipes the board with notorious ""Kingkiller"" Nolan Sawyer: current world champion and reigning Bad Boy of chess. Nolan's loss to an unknown rook-ie shocks everyone. What's even more confusing? His desire to cross pawns again. What kind of gambit is Nolan playing? The smart move would be to walk away. Resign. Game over. But Mallory's victory opens the door to sorely needed cash-prizes and despite everything, she can't help feeling drawn to the enigmatic strategist....|/u/Claim-Constant

She is a genius scholar and a meticulous researcher who is writing the world's first encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people. She could never make small talk at a party--or even get invited to one. And she prefers the company of her books, her dog, and the Fair Folk.

**Winner-TIED**|Happy Place|Emily Henry|They broke up six months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends. Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most. Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It’s a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week… in front of those who know you best?|/u/86rj
**1st Runner-Up**|Romantic Comedy|Curtis Sittenfeld|Sally Milz is a sketch writer for ""The Night Owls,"" the late-night live comedy show that airs each Saturday. With a couple of heartbreaks under her belt, she’s long abandoned the search for love, settling instead for the occasional hook-up, career success, and a close relationship with her stepfather to round out a satisfying life. But when Sally’s friend and fellow writer Danny Horst begins dating Annabel, a glamorous actor who guest-hosted the show, he joins the not-so-exclusive group of talented but average-looking and even dorky men at the show—and in society at large—who’ve gotten romantically involved with incredibly beautiful and accomplished women. Sally channels her annoyance into a sketch called the ""Danny Horst Rule,"" poking fun at this phenomenon while underscoring how unlikely it is that the reverse would ever happen for a woman. Enter Noah Brewster, a pop music sensation with a reputation for dating models, who signed on as both host and musical guest for this week’s show. Dazzled by his charms, Sally hits it off with Noah instantly, and as they collaborate on one sketch after another, she begins to wonder whether there might actually be sparks flying. But this isn’t a romantic comedy; it’s real life. And in real life, someone like him would never date someone like her...right?|/u/jellyrollo

**Winner**|The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder|David Grann|On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They were survivors of His Majesty's Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain. But then . . . six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes - they were mutineers. The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were life-and-death--for whomever the court found guilty could hang.|/u/Guilty-Pigeon
**1st Runner-Up**|Poverty, by America|Matthew Desmond|The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow.|/u/apageinthestacks
**2nd Runner-Up**|A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan's Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them|Timothy Egan|The Roaring Twenties--the Jazz Age--has been characterized as a time of Gatsby frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic charlatan named D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he’d become the Grand Dragon of the state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows – their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman – Madge Oberholtzer – who would reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan to their knees. |/u/baddspellar

But it's all we dream about, the hideously slim chance we'll survive to make it out the gates and improbably find ourselves with a life ahead of us, a life outside the Scholomance halls. And now the impossible dream has come true. I'm out, we're all out. Ha, only joking! Actually it's gone all wrong. Someone else has picked up the project of destroying enclaves in my stead, and probably everyone we saved is about to get killed in the brewing enclave war on the horizon. And the first thing I've got to do now, having miraculously got out of the Scholomance, is turn straight around and find a way back in.|/u/MorriganJade

On a furious hunt for answers, Chloe discovers she’s not the only one Shara kissed. There’s also Smith, Shara’s longtime quarterback sweetheart, and Rory, Shara’s bad boy neighbor with a crush.

With three exceptions: My friends, Sony, Neo, and Coeur, a little gang of rebellious, dying kids. Before death inevitably knocks down our doors, my thieves and I have one last heist planned.

**Winner**|*Book Lovers*|Emily Henry|Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.|/u/LittleDollGames

She’s fine with being a “mere” ER doctor. And every minute she spends with Daniel and the tight-knit town where he lives, she’s discovering just what’s really important. Yet letting their relationship become anything more than a short-term fling would mean turning her back on her family and giving up the opportunity to help thousands of people. Bringing Daniel into her world is impossible, and yet she can’t just give up the joy she’s found with him either. With so many differences between them, how can Alexis possibly choose between her world and his?|/u/No-Strawberry-7657

On impulse, Rachel inquires about a management position at a brewery hotel on an island in Lake Erie called Kelleys Island. What she finds on Kelleys Island is Mason, a handsome, moody man who knows everything about brewing beer and nothing about running a hotel. Especially one that’s barely more than foundation and studs. It’s not the job Rachel was looking for, but Mason offers her a chance to help build a hotel—and rebuild her own life—from the ground up.|/u/jellyrollo

But every animal is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world. This book welcomes us into a previously unfathomable dimension--the world as it is truly perceived by other animals. In An Immense World, author and acclaimed science journalist Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. Because in order to understand our world we don't need to travel to other places; we need to see through other eyes.|/u/baddspellar

In perhaps no other book ever written would a sentence like, ""The video for 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was not more consequential than the reunification of Germany"" make complete sense. Chuck Klosterman has written a multi-dimensional masterpiece, a work of synthesis so smart and delightful that future historians might well refer to this entire period as Klostermanian.|/u/walliewasright42o

Winner|*Beach Read*|Emily Henry|Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast. They're polar opposites. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She'll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he'll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously).

1st Runner-Up|*Take a Hint, Dani Brown*|Talia Hilbert|Danika Brown knows what she wants: professional success, academic renown, and an occasional roll in the hay to relieve all that career-driven tension. But romance? Been there, done that, burned the T-shirt. Romantic partners, whatever their gender, are a distraction at best and a drain at worst. So Dani asks the universe for the perfect friend-with-benefits—someone who knows the score and knows their way around the bedroom. When brooding security guard Zafir Ansari rescues Dani from a workplace fire drill gone wrong, it’s an obvious sign: PhD student Dani and ex-rugby player Zaf are destined to sleep together. But before she can explain that fact, a video of the heroic rescue goes viral. Now half the internet is shipping #DrRugbae—and Zaf is begging Dani to play along. Turns out, his sports charity for kids could really use the publicity. Lying to help children? Who on earth would refuse? Dani’s plan is simple: fake a relationship in public, seduce Zaf behind the scenes. The trouble is, grumpy Zaf’s secretly a hopeless romantic—and he’s determined to corrupt Dani’s stone-cold realism. Before long, he’s tackling her fears into the dirt. But the former sports star has issues of his own, and the walls around his heart are as thick as his... um, thighs.|/u/Klutzy_While_3950

While their on-screen performance improves, the media spotlight on Jasmine soon threatens to destroy her new image and expose Ashton’s most closely guarded secret.|/u/chchchcher

And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.|/u/CrazyCatLadyForLife
Winner TIED|*The Guest List*|Lucy Foley|On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed. But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.

The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist, Adrian Tomine's funniest and most revealing foray into autobiography, offers an array of unexpected answers. When a sudden medical incident lands Tomine in the emergency room, he begins to question if it was really all worthwhile: despite the accolades, awards, and opportunities of a seemingly charmed career, it's the gaffes, humiliations, slights, and insults he's experienced (or caused) within the industry that loom largest in his memory. But as those memories are delineated in excruciatingly hilarious detail, a different, parallel narrative plays out in the background. In between chaotic book tours, disastrous interviews, and difficult interactions with other artists, life happens: Tomine fumbles his way into marriage, parenthood, and an indisputably fulfilling existence. While mining his conflicted relationship with comics and comics culture, Tomine illustrates the amusing absurdities of life and how we choose to spend our time.|/u/Groodfeets

Winner|*Axiom's End*|Lindsay Ellis|A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora hasn’t spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government—and with him in hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father’s leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him—until she learns just how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial presence has been on Earth for decades. Realizing the extent to which both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter, becoming the first and only human vessel of communication.

On this Earth, however, Cara has survived. Identified as an outlier and therefore a perfect candidate for multiverse travel, Cara is plucked from the dirt of the wastelands. She works—and shamelessly flirts—with her enticing yet aloof handler, Dell, as the two women collect off-world data for the Eldridge Institute. So long as she can keep her head down and avoid trouble, Cara is on a sure path to citizenship and security. But trouble finds Cara when one of her eight remaining doppelgängers dies under mysterious circumstances, plunging her into a new world with an old secret.

1st Runner-Up|*Piranesi*|Susanna Clarke|Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house. There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.|/u/warpedlucy

# Best Nonfiction of 2020

Place|Title|Author|Description|Nominated
-|-|-|-------|-
Winner|*Promised Land*|Barack Obama|In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.|/u/pineapplesf
1st Runner-Up|*The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz*|Erik Larson|On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Adolf Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally--and willing to fight to the end. Erik Larson shows how Churchill taught the British people ""the art of being fearless."" It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. |/u/candlesandpretense
2nd Runner-Up|*Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents*|Isabel Wilkerson|Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.|/u/mleftpeel

72sq0n,"The Malazan Series, Dan Carlin, and the Roman Empire","I've never posted to r/books and don't label myself as a reading/history expert by any means. What I'm about to say may be totally wrong in its analysis because I'm the one making these connections. And using such a strong preface to show my ineptitude, I will continue.

I started the Malazan Empire series by Steven Erikson last week and it has hooked me. I'm on the second book now, about halfway in, and I just had to post about this. 

For those who haven't read it, I would suggest it as one of the better fantasy reads I've encountered in my short life despite only being two books in. In my opinion, within the series is a lot of DnD type encounters. Mages and warlocks and sorcerors battle alongside warriors in order to attack their enemies. But deeper within that, is a historical connection I find so fascinating and amazingly done by Erikson. 

It seems to me while reading that Erikson has made the Malazan Empire in the likeness of the Roman Empire. 

Listening to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast episode ""The Celtic Holocaust"" a few weeks ago allowed me to make such a connection. First off, I'm not saying it's like the Roman Empire simply because the Malazans call their military units ""legions"". It's much deeper than that.

In Carlin's episode, he points out many different facts of the Roman Empire armies that I believe Erikson uses for the Malazan Armies. The most interesting, in my opinion, is Erikson's creation of the people within the army called ""sappers"". Within Carlin's episode, he describes the Roman Armies' ability to have soldiers who are also like construction workers. These construction workers/soldiers built defensive and offensive fortifications while on the battlefield to help their conquests. Sappers do the same thing in the series. They construct fortifications for the Malazans and fight when necessary (they also handle explosives, but that's beside the point). 

For Erikson to make this connection is so unique and interesting and a powerful homage to the Roman tactics. No one during the Romans' time (or really, from what I know, during any time) really did that. Most fortifications in armies that I know of are prebuilt and transported instead of built on the field. Erikson focuses on the importance of the sappers and their ability to change the game on many different battlefields for the Malazans. These sappers change the game for the Malazans and make them a reason they're so formidable in battle.

While I could talk forever about this, I really wanted to go into detail on the sapper connection. I find it fascinating.

Here are some other more obvious Roman empire connections:

The first emperor is assassinated by his own people

The second emperor takes over and changes her name (much like Octavian does to Augustus)

They travel across seas to desert-like terrains in order to conquer those people (Like Romans taking over Egypt and other African/Middle Eastern countries)

The gods in the series resemble those of the Greeks/Romans

As mentioned before, the military units are called legions.

For those who read the series, what other connections do you see? And what do you think their relevance are? Doesn't have to just be Roman Empire connections.

I hope this post is worthy of r/books. I may have said too much/analyzed too much, but I had too.

1svvpd,"Readers of Dismantling the Empire by Chalmers Johnson, what are your thoughts on the book?","I read it for a US Foreign Relations class and found that it presents strong arguments toward the many problems US global hegemony faces.

However, the final portion of the book discusses what he believes are potential solutions to the problems labeled in previous chapters; these key points that Johnson makes aren't supplemented with any explanations for how to go about producing these changes.  It left me feeling like the book didn't nail the message home.  

I am curious to see how other people felt about the book, both positive and negative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1svvpd/readers_of_dismantling_the_empire_by_chalmers/,2013-12-14 20:17:49,0,3,books
