uxnalc,Is The Final Empire also known as Mistborn (the first book in the series)?,bionicbuttplug,2022-05-29 13:09:27
uxnalc,"FYI - the goodreads links in the OP is to All Systems Red, not The Final Empire!",bionicbuttplug,2022-05-29 13:08:52
uxnalc,"Yep, the original title was Mistborn: The Final Empire but some publishers ended up dropping one of the two parts.",LewsTherinTelescope,2022-05-29 15:00:12
g84rrx,"Ooooo I’m really excited now! The ending to The Final Empire honestly shocked me. Like, it was kind of predictable but at the same time my mind was entirely blown!",booksmeller1124,2020-04-26 00:53:10
t7ml23,"From what I’ve learned from these comments the Mistborn trilogy is interweaved to the point Sanderson foreshadowed from the start, and the sequel books answer all your questions. Considering how hard the Allomancy system is, there is definitely something deeper going on with (book one ending spoilers) >!The Lord Ruler’s Allomantic skills and Vin being enhanced by the mists!<

I have to stop to what you said about Vin’s skills. >!The Final Empire made it extremely clear to differentiate talent from skill. Vin was very talented in steel and iron, but her skills were inferior to Kelsier and all the Misting crewmembers. Even with bronze she doesn’t know everything. It took a trick and Shan’s arrogance to beat her.!<",BigMom_IsABeast,2022-03-06 18:27:30
v99si3,"I'm really enjoying Mistborn / The Final Empire so far. I love the heist element of the story - it feels very fresh to fantasy. The characters are compelling and well-drawn, and the exposition is trickling in at a digestible pace.

On a prose level, it's nothing special, but it's functional and clear, so I have no qualms.

I really like the light horror elements interspersed in the story so far (the mistwraith and the Steel Inquisitors come to mind). 

I feel simultaneously brought into the setting and unclear on it. I think the descriptions of ash-covered buildings are very evocative, but so far I don't have much of an understanding of how large the world is, how people get around it (at one point a character says a city is ""about an hour outside Luthadel"" but didn't stay ""by foot"" or ""on horseback"" or anything like that), or what your average citizen of the world looks like. I assume this will come with time.

I like the magic system - it's very easy to understand. However, I will say that I am already a little sick of phases like ""she burned pewter"" or ""she flared iron."" I kinda hope that fades a bit, or maybe I'll just get used to it.",bionicbuttplug,2022-06-10 17:36:20
v99si3,"**The Way of Kings** is a different series so it is feasible you could read both at the same time, though it is significantly longer than **The Final Empire** and may be a struggle if you feel you are a slower reader.",XBreaksYFocusGroup,2022-07-06 20:45:57
vedbfs,"About halfway through the book, and I'm still not really digging it. It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but I'm not gonna be lingering on it. I don't feel as though the plot's picked up, and I still think that the characters fall short in a lot of ways. I think it's because I'm not vibing with the book, but for as big a world as this is, it feels pretty empty. There's a lot of characters, and a lot of scenes, but nothing's been really engaging for me. I usually find it hard to *not* think about a book, even the ones I hate. Feels weird to not have that.

I feel like a lot of what I have to say is just negative, and I *want* to like this book, so one last thing-- the writing's been really frustrating to me. There was a scene where Breeze and the crew were influencing emotions in a room, but there were serious talks of the morality of religion sentences before that. Kelsier goes to Kredik Shaw to go into a room that I've never heard of nor understand the importance of (and which felt like a really dumb move, because he's, y'know, in the middle of a very sensitive plan to overthrow the entire empire). Both took me by surprise and felt really out of the blue. Is this really necessary? What's the point of this? Maybe I'm just not good at reading into the purpose of those moments/scenes, or maybe I'll realize the point of them after the book progresses.

I *will* say that the history of the Lord Ruler and the Final Empire are still interesting to me, though. Looking forward to eventually learning what the Deepness is and what happened, how we got to where we are now. I'll also admit that Sazed's my favorite character so far, but not for any real reason other than I think his history (and the lack of what I know about him) is interesting. The metalmind aspect is interesting, too, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else can be done with it.",homelikeplace,2022-06-18 02:58:11
vedbfs,"I read ahead a bit, so I don't feel I can give untainted answers to most questions - I guess with that in mind I will answer question six!

**If you were to cast for a The Final Empire movie or television show, who would you want as each character and who to direct or showrun?**

Kelsier: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

Ham: Dave Bautista

Vin: I pictured Ellen Page but I know that this would no longer work (although it still could I suppose!) - no insensitivity intended with my language, I just don't know how else to put it

Sazed: Naveen Andrews

Clubs: Jeff Bridges

Dockson: Tom Hardy

Elend: Timothee Chalemet or Tom Holland

&#x200B;

DIRECTOR: Peter Jackson, obviously",bionicbuttplug,2022-06-17 14:36:48
lnv6wy,I just finished The Final Empire.  I loved it.  Starting The Well of Ascension today!,HerrBrewster,2021-02-20 19:26:21
5rb8gv,"I've always found that 'overrated' is the least useful criticism because it's basically like saying 'I don't think people should like this as much as they do'. 

Also, The Final Empire is nothing like GoT. Like, not even remotely. ",,2017-01-31 23:50:07
8xspu6,"I really liked the latter half of the final empire the first few chapters were a bit shaky for me but after that the book really hooked me. If you are looking for sexual themes, final empire is the wrong place to look for them.",,2018-07-11 04:23:25
8xspu6,"Fantasy is getting a lot of good shots of new stuff in the last ten-fifteen years. Interests have shifted away from ""traditional"" sword-and-sorcery stories to much more complex worlds and systems that actually make sense and follow internal logic, rather than being nebulous or hand-waved.

There are a lot of authors making good money off of fantasy series with rules and logical realism applied to them, as audiences are eating it up. Similar goes for Sci-Fi. If you like *The Final Empire*, you'll find lots of other stuff to enjoy like *The Powder Mage Wars* or *Shadow of an Empire*.

The shift *is* causing some friction with some old-school traditionalists of fantasy, but for the most part that's pretty minor. There's a lot to enjoy out there, and more coming every year!",vikingzx,2018-07-10 21:03:29
8xspu6,"The Final Empire is only his second published novel, as far as I can tell. Character certainly isn't his strong suit, but he's done nothing but get better. 

I don't even think the characters are bad, necessarily. They're just kind of stock. Vin's story follows the hero's journey pretty closely. The books are still fun, though. ",SentrySappinMahSpy,2018-07-11 01:31:28
yb61u,The Final Empire is fantastic.  I highly suggest it.,Phunny,2012-08-16 07:31:31

z8vbz9,"Off the top of my head:

* The Red Rising trilogy
* Leviathan Wakes
* Texicalaan duology
* The Final Empire. (Really struggled with next two. I did not enjoy the Dragonball Z power up everybody got.)
* Every book from Thursday Murder Club series.
* The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
* This Is How You Lose a Time War 
* The Shadow of the Wind
* Small Things Like These
* All the Lights We Cannot See
* A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet
* Record of the Spaceborn Few
* A Gentleman in Moscow
* Jade City
* The Kite Runner",kaysn,2022-11-30 18:06:26
oakc5c,"I had the same thought which is why I'm digging up this thread. Also, in The Final Empire, aren't there mutilated Soothers throughout Luthadel, just like the lobotomized Orognes quelling earthquakes in The Fifth Season?",Lopsided-Ad7657,2022-01-06 22:41:46
6tpcf7,"Sanderson as a writer seems to get better with each book he puts out, and the Final Empire was one of he earlier books, so to answer your question, yes they get better. ",Fimus86,2017-08-14 21:29:49
6tpcf7,I thought The Final Empire was the best book of the 3. The series takes a big shift in how it's presented after that. You may end up enjoying it more if you were down on the first book.,TawneyBomb,2017-08-14 22:17:13
kih4g7,"Interesting, I have them ranked in reverse. I thought Hero of Ages was the best, Well of Ascension was 2nd, and The Final Empire was the weakest IMO.

Great trilogy though all in all.",L_E_F_T_,2020-12-23 17:14:35
kih4g7,"I read about half of The Final Empire, got a bit bored with it and put it down to read something else for a while.  That was about nine months ago, I'm not sure I'll ever get around to finishing it.  High fantasy just isn't my thing.  Particularly the trope that some people are just born with some awesome ability they didn't have to earn somehow, they're just winners of some genetic or mystical lottery.  While I can see this is not particularly unrealistic, in the real world success in life is hugely influenced by choosing one's parents well, but it nevertheless conflicts with my sense of fairness.  I know the real world is not remotely fair, but I want my fictional heroes to succeed by hard work and sacrifice, not sheer good luck.",DanTheTerrible,2020-12-23 03:35:07
t3lx0s,"I read the first two books in “The First Law” and absolutely loved them. I also loved The Final Empire and feel confident I will like both those books.
Would you suggest I give up on The Falconer? Despite my friend loving it? I just can’t stand it at all. 
And thank you for just being someone who shares with me I’m not liking the book",Elakery,2022-02-28 18:37:02
