aikhd4,I loved Artemis Fowl as a child (especially the first one). And I have to admit that the trailer for the movie made me want to read it again. But I still think that that trailer looks fairly atrocious.,Ashur_Elf,2019-01-22 07:35:39

It was an absolutely lovely time reading, and an even more so one actually coming up with a theme park for the book. I wasn’t able to put down any of the subsequent books, they were so good.

Then, when I was older, my family ended up getting a library card and i’d spend time reading up on old series I liked. I found the Artemis Fowl series. I’ve read almost every single one except the newer books, and I love them. 

They’re just so full of charm, and they’re really written well enough they anybody can enjoy them. 

I love the relationship between Holly and Artemis, and how they change throughout the series. ",CCtenor,2019-01-22 15:57:44
aikhd4,"I Read the artemis fowl series multiple times throughout my pre-teens and teens and after watching the trailer my hopes arent very high but goddamn it do i want it to succeed. It would be amazing to get to see it come to life!

aikhd4,"When I was a kid Airman by the same writer, Eoin Colfer, was pretty good. If you're into cool pre WW1, peak of the adventurers era then you'll love the setting. It basically takes place right as the 1800s come to a close on what is basically an alternative universe version of the Saltee Islands where they're rich with diamonds.

The plot is about the son of an adventurer who trains to become one himself studying science, shooting, swordfighting, etc with the king who is his parents best friend. One day someone kills the king and he gets framed for it so the plot is about his time in prison and how he eventually sets up a plan to over throw the now corrupt government since the king is dead. It's pretty heavily foreshadowed from page one that he has goals to be one of the first people to fly without using a hot air balloon so his designs and plans for his ""flying machine"" is a major part of the plot.

It's a bit more mature than the Artemis Fowl books in my opinion when I read them all those years ago but it's still good. People get killed and bad things happen to characters but it's not like super graphic or anything.",forgottt3n,2019-01-22 17:26:54
aikhd4,"I didn't read Artemis Fowl (maybe the first half of the first book) but I have fond memories of taking the school bus with one of my good friends and exchanging notes in dwarvish (the secret code found at the bottom of all the pages in the 1st book). We both learned the whole alphabet by heart, folded our handwritten notes into a tiny squares, and then handed them off in band class or on the bus.

aikhd4,"You know, the funniest thing about the film is the casting call for artemis fowl. 


https://www.backstage.com/casting/artemis-fowl-183830/


At first, i was kinda mad about the description of his personality. They described him as ""warm-hearted"" and concludes by declaring he ""loves life."" Its basically the opposite of what artemis fowl is supposed to be in this film.


But then i realized.


What parent would willingly bring their child to a casting call for a potentially psychotic bond villain? Like, who would want their child to be cast as a kidnapping, conniving mastermind?

The whole Artemis Fowl series is fantastic, and if you have the chance, read the whole series. It's a really great tale of a kid understanding the importance of a other society, developing humanity, and kicking some fairy ass. Plus, the entire thing has a huge repituaor of monsters, goblins, and fairies and the way they're incorporated and fun and sorta educational for those who don't know a lot about fairy-tale creatures.

aikhd4,"Yep. One of my first books, or at least, the first book I read, liked, and are reading from to time again even now. And there's a whole eight of them now.

I've always said they would make great film material (fancy setting, some good action moments, and not too long to fit into a movie). After reading the ~3rd of the series, I even googled to check whether there might be a film. Only found indications that the movie rights had been sold.

aikhd4,"Yeah, I just read it because my friend told me I'd really enjoy it.

It's all right. If I were a kid or young teen? Yeah, it would be great. As an adult, though, it feels more than a little childish at times. 

The trailer for the movie looks awful, but I feel like it's not actually that far off. It's a children's book. So of course the movie will have childish themes.

I often wonder, though, if this is a sign of the times or if tastes have just changed. For example, The Hobbit and LotR are young adult/children's books. Just like Artemis Fowl is. But if you were to ask my opinion, I would say they're not even comparable. LotR and The Hobbit have a much more serious writing style that conveys a much more serious tone. They don't feel like children's books to me.

Whereas AF does. I don't know if this is my own bias because I read LotR as a kid, or if AF is just legitimately childish.",HolycommentMattman,2019-01-22 11:11:44

But I kinda see your point about children's books being a bit more 'childish' today. I think that that is true for all ages though. The picture of Dorian Gray reads way more earnest than the Name of the Wind. And Pride and Prejudice is way more solemn than Outlander.

F. hands down) Commander Trouble, and my most hated villain (besides Umbridge) Opal Kaboi whose last name I totally don't remember how to spell right. 

Good times, thanks for bringing back memories. And for bringing wider attention to the series!

o9y0aj,"I agree 100% with this assessment, an overall great series that declined a bit in Time Paradox and Atlantis Complex but managed to recover with the Last Guardian.

Badass characters all around with Artemis Fowl, Butler, Holly, Foaly, and Mulch being some.of the most interesting characters in literature in my personal opinion. They each grow and develop in ways that are both radical departures from the first book but still feasible given all the circumstances.

I did myself wondering throughout the entire series about just how dangerous would be for The People and Humanity to meet. I mean I get why The People are so skeptical and dare I say scared of being discovered by humanity after they were forced underground, but a lot of the actual danger seems to come from Fairies themselves wanting to wipe out humanity.

Yes there are people like The Extinctionists who would want The People wiped out for... reasons I never really understood and Jon Spiro who might be a danger or threat to the People, but the vast majority of the real danger comes from people like Koboi and other Fairies who want to retake the surface. I think The People might be surprised by just how far Humanity has come since they were forced underground and how willing Humanity might be to reconciliation and peace if given a chance. I mean yes Humanity is destroying the planet and wiping out who knows how many species but I think Humanity might be willing to reconsider and start fixing the messes once they/we realize we're not the only thing on this planet that can be considered sentient.",La_Volpa,2021-06-29 11:16:59

These books were great when I first read them and are definitely worthy of a revisit or two. However, I found that there was a definite shift in style between the first six books and the last two. Excepting obsessive completionists, I would be tempted to encourage readers new to the series to stop at book six. (And read the Artemis Fowl Files, which includes a code to the Fairy alphabet, so you can decode the writing along the edges of the pages of all the original hardcovers. Which I most certainly did not do as a teenager...)

(Also, while you're at it, I recommend you read ""Airman"", which is another great YA novel by Eoin Colfer.)

I also enjoy the Eragon movie.  
They're terrible adaptations of fantastic books. If they had just called the movies something else and not tied them to the books, maybe they'd be more appreciated. I'm not much of a critic, though.  


I watched the movie for Artemis Fowl before even knowing of the books. Eragon was the other way around. I feel the same way about both movies, though. I'm mainly disappointed that it's likely to take a long time before anyone gives it another go, and a sequel would need major course corrections for me to even consider it worthwhile. The Percy Jackson movies tried with middling success, imo.

o9y0aj,"Haha, I was going to post, don’t watch the movie, you WILL regret it.

I actually missed out on the Artemis Fowl books when I was younger. I decided to read them when they announced the movie. I really enjoyed them. They weren’t kids books. I categorize a kid book/show as just loud noises and shiny colors where they’re just trying to catch the kids attention. These books are way more than that.

The major characters all go through pretty solid arcs, especially the main two of Artemis and Holly. 

I really hated that the movie invalidated all their struggles and changes in order to be more PC and please everyone. I think that’s always a mistake, because kids aren’t dumb. They like a good story as much as an adult, they just like different content. The nothing stories are just shinies that they watch, move on from, and never think about again. Solid stories like these are the kind that are remembered fondly, generate new sales later on when people buy new copies when they wear out the old ones or buy them to read to kids, and they’re the built in fan base that will spend money on the movie and paraphernalia.

They're *really* bad with video game movies, where they seem to have a purposeful goal in cheerfully obliterating.

> I mean, look at Tomb Raider. The most recent one. Tomb Raider‘s story and characters are fantastic. The script is full of poignant lines, great setpieces, characters charming and chilling, all about the beginning of Lara’s journey to being the Tomb Raider the audience is familiar with as she winds up shipwrecked on an island swarming with strange ruins and a cult of shipwrecked madmen.

> Literally all they needed to do was just adapt it 1:1 for the screen. Great characters, great plot, great story.

> But no, Hollywood had to “improve” it. Friend characters? Gone. Replaced with one token character. Cult? Well, that’s creepy, but how about an evil paramilitary group? Audiences haven’t seen that before! Oh, and the whole crux being Lara’s growth as she tries to escape the island with her crew? Better have it be her fighting for a sample of an ancient virus that’ll wipe out all life on earth the paramilitary group wants so they can kill everyone and kick off their fascist regime! It’s a wrap! Print it!

Hollywood has proven time and time again they just can't *adapt* something most of the time without butchering it in a number of ways. *Artemis Fowl*, *Tomb Raider*, *Dark Tower* ... the rare adaptation that works is few and far between.

When making film adaptations of these books, were the authors even consulted once? This must feel like an absolute slap in the face.

fcjjom,"Artemis Fowl is supposed to be many things:
- A manipulative sociopath
- An evil genius
- A greedy thief and conman
- An antisocial 12 year old with vampire vibes
- An arrogant douchebag
- DISNEY DONE SLATHERED A COAT OF PIXIE DUST ON MY BOY

In the first book, he already knows about the elves, he studies their bible so he can learn about them, and then kidnaps Holly Short and holds her for ransom so he can be the first human to separate the elves from their gold. THEY ARE NOT BEST FRIENDS OFF TO SAVE THE WORLD IN AN ADVENTURE!!!

Julius Root is Holly’s commander. His nickname is “Beetroot” because of his notoriously explosive temper that causes his face to turn a dark shade of red as he is screaming at the top of his lungs. Judi Dench could not be more of a polar opposite of that character. She is a kindly old woman with the most British, soft-spoken voice ever.

In short: the trailer is horrible, pure and utter garbage. The movie is going to be an abomination and Kenneth Branagh should be ashamed of himself. The books are amazing and they deserve so much better than this.

And in case you’re wondering, yes I am quite angry and bitter about this. Because of course, this isn’t the first time this has happened. This is just the latest murder of a book series in a decade-long pattern in Hollywood.

In no particular order, here is the list of children’s books and YA books that have been butchered by Hollywood, sometimes because the director/studio simply did a HORRIBLE job or in the case of Artemis Fowl, because they think kids are dumb and only want simple, dumb movies and not dangerous adventures with complicated plots and flawed characters.

fcjjom,"This is worse than Tom Holland Spider-man (let me finish). For me, Spider-man is about a young guy who has a lot of power, but has to be smart to actually accomplish what he wants. the odds are always against him, but he finds a solution and succeeds. I call him the King of the Second Round because most villains knock him out and get away, then he goes and invents something to take them down after that. This new movie Spider-man doesn't make his own solutions. He doesn't learn from his mistakes (in the same way). He is given inventions and then has to earn the right to use them. That's a decent superhero story, but it's not Spiderman. Not the one I grew up wanting to be.

Artemis Fowl is a spoiled rich kid, who uses his genius to become a super-villain, and then a hero after that. Everything he has apart from money, he creates himself. He knows about fairies because he did the research and tracked them down. He gets the fairies as allies because he makes himself useful to them and forces their hands. This Artemis? He's just Artemis Fowl junior. Everything is handed to him. He's looks smart, I *guess.* But it's already hard-wired into the story that everything we saw Artemis do in the books, his father has done here in the movie before he even got there. He's not a self-made man in a child's body, he's the spoiled rich kid you'd think he was at first glance.",tehKrakken55,2020-03-03 15:15:26

The whole premise of the first book is Artemis is alone 2nd the family fortune and reputation is in tatters.

fcjjom,"Man, I'm looking at the actor for Butler, Nonso Anozie. What is it with that dude and being in movies that strip all the character and complexity of book series that I loved as a kid? First he did it in Ender's Game, now Artemis Fowl.

Obviously, I know it's not \*\*his\*\* fault alone. But I remember sitting in the theater, watching the Ender's Game movie, determined to keep hold of my waning optimism that ""this movie will get better, any second now,"" and this one scene with Anozie in it, broke my spirit so hard, with its cringey desperation to be wholesome and fun, that I reflexively face palmed with so much force that my also-waited-for-an-Ender's-Game-movie-since-we-were-children friend sitting next to me, heard the sound, and turned and offered a ""yeah man, fuck this movie,"" as we both gave up hope that the movie was going to get any better.

I basically had that same moment happen watching this trailer at the moment Anozie, as Butler, poses for that shot with Artemis as they look toward the camera looking cool in their shades, with that same desperation to be wholesome and fun as that scene in the Ender's Game movie which felt so out of character compared to what I loved about that book.

And so, despite knowing that it's completely unreasonable to blame the actor, I still feel the need to pout and ask ""why do you have to keep doing this to me Nonso Anozie, whyyyy :(""",bitty_blush,2020-03-03 20:17:44

You come from a medium to another one, you'll get some change whatever happens.

Don't know for you, but I can't see many book that I read that could be as enjoyable under 100 pages. 

Same goes for video games, which is even worse because what's enjoyable in a video game isn't what's enjoyable in a movie, which means it's not only a time constraint, but also a content constraint.

Hester Shaw is meant to be an horrifically ugly girl with one eye, no nose, and a monster scar right across her face. The girl in the movie is pretty with a little scar on her cheek. Almost exactly as described on the cover of Pennyroyal's book.

I remember when the first talks of a film were announced I was still in primary school and the first few books were at the height of their popularity. Everyone was ecstatic. Every other day there was a new rumour spreading in the schoolyard, probably the biggest of which was that they were currently casting Artemis and needed to find a young Irish boy to play the part. I don't know if even that was ever true, but it eventually evolved to include the fact that they were going to be holding auditions in local schools and that any day now they would show up at our school and give one lucky boy the opportunity of a lifetime! None of us were actors or even had any interest in acting, but of course every ten year old that year wanted to be Artemis Fowl, so it did a hell of a job capturing our imagination. Of course nothing ever materialised of any of those rumours, but it always stuck with me.

The fact that the actors looked wrong and were way too old made The Lightning Thief a completely different story with little resemblance to what we all had in our imaginations when we read the books.

Then it came, and it was ok. Not the best, but it made amends to the damage. You could also sense that Colfer was wrapping up. The key about Time Paradox is that there was no finality to it at all. Though the series should not have continued for what had happened it did. 

Then came The Last Guardian, which finalized the series on a semi-sweet note. You knew it was done, you knew that no more would come of it. 

Time Paradox should have spelled the downfall of Artemis Fowl, to most people it was not worth continuing. But continue it did, and the last two made up for it.

nc8wfc,"Yes and no.

Targetting kids is not an excuse for being shit. Not an excuse for movies, shows, games, or books.

There are countless examples of creative books, shows and movies aimed at kids or teens that are well done, engaging, and consistent.

You don't get a free pass on plotholes, one dimensional characters, poor pacing, etc. because your target audience is ""whoever can't see this is bad""

Yes, there are topics that are meant for children, you shouldn't expect to fall in love with the premise ""10 year olds run the world for a day"" or something along those lines, or something edgy meant for teens like ""this one quirky, very special, one of a kind person doesn't fit into their oppressive society"" thats fine. If you aren't hooked by those that is ok, just doesn't appeal to you. But you can still spot good and bad writing. 

I hadn't heard people speak badly about Artemis Fowl, well about the movie perhaps, and I am not familiar with Eragon. But, divergent is a pretty silly and flawed story. It is not wrong to call it bad regardless of whether you fit the tatget demographic or not.

I think more important to remember is that you are allowed to like, even love, bad media.

For example twilight and 50 shades are pretty much universally hated and memed on by the internet. And yet, a lot of people still like them, love them even.

I didn't put myself through the books but my girlfriend likes 50 shaded and we watched the movie. Not a very good movie, but we still had fun.
I also have guilty pleasures. The DC shows forb example. The flash makes no sense, is extremely poorly paced with stupid one dimensional characters and nonsense pseudoscience that has no level of consistency. Still watched it all because the drama is serviceable and the high points are very fun to see.
I would not call it a good show, but I still love it.

We can agree that something is not that good and still love it above things that you know is better.

So you love a bad book, or loved it when you didn't know better... so what? 
We can still call out bad content that is clearly only aimed at children or teens becsuse it is bad, without ever judging the readers that liked it.",GsTSaien,2021-05-14 17:05:20

No. Whether a book is good or bad isn't constrained by of it was meant for me. Robert Munsch books are for children but they are still good books. Brian Jacques Redwall is preteen and still good. I dislike the Song of Ice and fire series because everyone is a dick BUT it is still good literature.

Criticizing Artemis Fowl for failing to do ruthless psychological realism is like criticizing Moby Dick for failing to include any song and dance numbers. If as an adult you want something that deals with the human psyche in a more nuanced/complex/realistic way, that’s literally the whole point of literary fiction. Artemis, as a character, is an homage to and subversion of the “evil megalomaniac billionaire genius villain” trope. If Lex Luthor was real, he’d probably spend a lot more time in board meetings and a lot less time hatching sinister plots to kill Superman.

That said, watching the movie to me was like I was having a bizarre dream after reading the first two books. The plot was a nonsensical macguffin hunt with a villain who was never confronted or properly revealed and whose plan disintegrates under the barest scrutiny. Rules are invented arbitrarily with no internal logic and the theme so badly wants to be Irish folklore in the beginning and seems almost disappointed to be handed a high-tech underground civilization. It genuinely feels like the source material and the director's vision are at constant war and there's absolutely no character development.

Essentially, it could have been its own original concept if it had just stopped wearing the flayed skin of the book series as a mask and asking people to call it Artemis Fowl.

h8bta4,"So the big thing that made the series unique and not a cookie cutter “kid saves the world” type series is that Artemis Fowl is not a good person. He is a bad guy. A criminal.  He crimes.

He finds the fairy world by tracking down a fairy and then literally poisoning her and not giving her the antidote until she gives him her book of fairy rules and history.   His entire initial contact with the fairy’s is to kidnap one of them and hold her for ransom. 

He eventually becomes a genuinely good person but it takes like four or five books.    Him becoming a good person is basically his entire character develop. 

As far as I’ve gathered from the trailers because I refuse to watch the movie, they basically skip all of that and make him and his father good people from the start.   Fuck that

When you’re a kid both seem awesome and great. Because for that demographic they are! But as an adult I feel Artemis Fowl fumbles a lot.

I loved AF as a younger man and still do (Atlantis complex is the best, I’ll fight you on that) however...going back to reread it can be a bit disappointing. You get fart jokes from mulch, lots of cringey non-funny puns. And a lot of Artemis’s actions make no sense as adults when they were awesome as a kid.

Percy Jackson I feel stands up much better. It’s world to me is much more interesting. And while I’d admit that the MAIN cast of AF are good and very well developed (Butler, Artemis, Holly), I’d argue that Riordan writes a larger cast far better.  

I mean, I can’t remember most of the side characters in those Fowl books. I remember a bit about Juliet? Opal is the only interesting villain. But stuff like Artemis’ brothers? They’re one note characters. One’s a regular kid and ones a mini-Artemis.

But in Percy Jackson I can remember a lot about each character and their backstory, goals, and character relations. Just from the main original 5 books, you have the main 3, Nico, Thalia, Clarisse, Charon, and many gods are much more entertaining if just as one note as the AF side characters.

h7oggq,"Read it when I was younger and just reread it about a year or two ago. Partly because of the release of a sequel series. I really enjoyed the story before, but at that time, I skimmed a fair bit of descriptive paragraphs. I think that's one factor that sets it apart from the other books you've listed (I can only speak for Hunger Games and Alex Rider). Compared to its counterparts, Artemis Fowl series takes the times to delve into lengthy descriptions and I think that's a strength. It really made the fictional world that more realistic and grounded in its own rules. Also, Artemis Fowl starts out slower; it definitely didn't hook me right from the start. For me, Hunger Games was extremely captivating but it just fell off for me in the last book. Alex Rider was much more consistent but the premise didn't appeal to me as much as Artemis Fowl.

Of course, I'm extremely biased but the characters in Artemis Fowl were simply more interesting to me. Witty dialogues and eccentric personalities were a huge draw. And after the recent reread, I'm so glad that it has stood the test of time (at least for me). Nostalgia definitely plays a huge role but I have reread other series from my childhood and this aged better than most.

Also thought there were plenty of what seemed to be original parts to it like moving pictures, sorting hat, house elves, quidditch, horcruxes, and countless other things. The fact that it's set in a school is perfectly fine with me as Hogwarts is a fairly unique school and allows us to identify more with the drama and relationship stufff that goes on that we're all familiar with.

 You are right that it did mainly focus on Harry, and i do think it would have been nice to have a bit more focus on others but i have to say that there was only one time in the entire series that was tough to get through for me and that was the beginning of book 5 where Harry has to go to court for using a patronus charm off campus.
