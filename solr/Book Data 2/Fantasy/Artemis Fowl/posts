aikhd4,Just finished Artemis Fowl,"What a lovely story. I thought it had plenty of wit and charm and told a short but very entertaining tale. I adored it. It's about a dastardly 12-year-old criminal genius who kidnaps a fairy named Holly and holds her for ransom in hopes of getting his hands on fairy gold. Artemis Fowl is basically the 12-year-old version of Sherlock Holmes - just as clever and twice as conniving. His dear Watson is his bodyguard, Butter. He's a ruthless giant of a man who will do anything to protect the Fowls. The main characters are basically the villains here, which is interesting, but I liked all the characters and secretly wanted everyone to succeed.

I don't know, these are just my random thoughts on the book. Not a full review or anything. It's meant for younger readers, but still worth checking out. I thought it was fantastic.

Also, I'm a bit conflicted on the upcoming movie trailer. But maybe I should save that for another discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/aikhd4/just_finished_artemis_fowl/,2019-01-22 07:30:07,724,6057,books
o9y0aj,A mighty fine series: Artemis Fowl,"While not the best books in the world, the Artemis Fowl series is among my Top 10 favorite reads. I would strongly recommend it if you want to feel like a kid again. It is somewhere in the middle of a kids fairy tale book, and an adult's fiction novel. 

Written by Eoin Colfer (I don't know how to pronounce it either), Artemis Fowl is a series of 8 books about 12 year old named, well, Artemis Fowl. He is a genius, having the highest IQ in Europe, is a multi-millionaire, and is a criminal mastermind, running the Fowl corporate crime enterprise. He becomes fascinated with the existence of fairies when he is trying to raise funds to find his lost father, believed to be dead when his transport ship blew up in Russia. 

Read the book. You will not regret it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o9y0aj/a_mighty_fine_series_artemis_fowl/,2021-06-29 01:22:50,328,2086,books
fcjjom,Artemis Fowl movie trailer makes me so sad,"When I was young I was a huge fan of the Artemis Fowl book series. So I was really looking forward to the upcoming movie. After I watched the trailer I feel so disappointed and sad.
The trailer has nothing to do with the book I read and loved years ago. I mean the coolest thing about it is, that Artemis is a 12 year old cold-blooded villain. The movie just looks like a bad disney mix of spy kids and Men in Black where ""Artemis"" (the boy from the movie has basically nothing common with book-Artemis) works together with the characters he fought in the book. 
After the terrible eragon and Percy Jackson films, Artemis Fowl is just another great young adult book that got completely screwed by the movie industry.

nc8wfc,"Books have target audiences too! If you read a YA book for teenagers and hate it it's not because the book is bad, it's because it's not meant for you (Eragon, Divergent, Artemis Fowl, etc.)","As a book lover I've lurked this sub for awhile now and people really should check what age group the book was written for before reading them or making posts about how bad they are. Eragon, Cirque De Freak, Artimis Fowl, Divergent, Twilight, the list goes on and on. These books are meant for Young Adults and Teenagers. It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.

They aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on. Books have demographics just as much as TV and movies. An adult doesn't go to see the Wiggles and expect to have a good time (although they are surprisingly enjoyable) or critique their children's Saturday cartoons or their teenager's cringe  werewolf romance drama show for being simplistic and predicable. It's great to them because it's for them. It's crap to you because you're never expected to watch it anyway. That's okay. There's really no need to tear those things apart in a reddit post.

Obviously there will be some adults who will still love YA books, shows, and movies. If that's you, please keep recommending them to people. It's not your fault if someone neglects to notice the YA or TV14 tag and ends up hating it.

Edit: I'm not saying ""you're not the target audience"" is an end all excuse so you can never say something is bad. Some books are indesputably bad. I believe that if you hold an opinion that contradicts what is widely accepted as true, then it's probably more about your personal preference than something being inherently bad. For instance, I hate Avengers movies and think they are full of crudely written dialogue and oversized casts where no character actually matters. Obviously the world disagrees with that opinion. I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.


Edit 2: The comments are pretty fun you should check them out. Admittedly most of them say I'm wrong and an idiot lol. But the others are filled with people saying a book is horrible and then others saying the same book is great. The only constant is that Divergent and Eragon seem to be hated by almost everyone, it's like a 9/1 ratio. Artemis Fowl is nearly 50/50 which is cool. Take a look and find other people opinions, there are some gems in there.

I'm not even an adult yet but seeing that trailer made me realize it's been a while since I read a book. Which is surprising since that's the only thing I used to do around 2-3 years back. Heck I'm going to read them again.

n0wmcf,I feel Artemis Fowl is way better than Percy Jackson,"Along with other books, I feel that after reading Artemis Fowl, I think the books are better than Percy Jackson and that it deserves as much recognition as PJO and more than the stupid movie it got. Even if Artemis is seen as the bad guy, I felt he was more interesting than Percy Jackson, along with other characters like Holly, Juliet, etc. They are written with more wit and cleverness than the characters in PJO and even more maturity, compared to how juvenile the characters and tone PJO is like. I also feel the angle Colfer approached to depict elves and trolls are more interesting than how Riordan depicts the Greek Gods and Goddesses as these parodies that make me groan. Like Poseidon wearing a fisherman's hat and a Hawaiian shirt? Give me a break and don't get me started on those cringy ""Dam"" jokes. I just feel that Artemis Fowl overall is not only better than how the movie depicted it but also better than PJO.

nt0uh0,I just re-read Artemis Fowl. Holy fuck are those books good,"I had read them first about 5 years ago. Back then I was a so into reading that I finished the whole book in about 2 days and started Alex Rider the next day. Because of that I did not realise how good those books were. The plot and the setting was fantastic. I mean a world of fairies who can mind control people and do magic are discovered by a teen super-criminal. The whole thing is so good. But for me personally the thing which made it better were the characters. The interactions between Holly Short and Artemis, or between Artemis and Butler or every other character were just wonderful.

6tx71i,I found the first Artemis Fowl book to be much better than all of the Happy Potter series,"I just finished the first Artemis Fowl and the best way to describe how much I liked it, is by comparing it to the most famous of its genre, Harry freaking Potter, which I never liked. After all, nowadays every early teen novel is compared to that overrated series and most are labeled as Potter clones, even if some have close to no similarities despite belonging in the same age demographic. 

Instead of the most of the plot being about going to the exact same place in every book and spending a big chunk of the plot in aimless magic lesson nonsense, Artemis constantly travels around the world and we are told some interesting historical and political facts in every place he visits. Meaning, instead of wasting our time in Harry Potter with useless magic mambo jumbo taking place in a school, the most overused and unimaginative of all settings, Artemis Fowl is both educational for children and keeps things fresh by showing new places all the time. It is also not sugarcoating many sociopolitical situations, such as wars, famine, whale hunting, and so on.  

Because of the above, Artemis actually bothers to explain with science how each of his plans work, instead of using a verb with an “us” at the end to signify it’s a spell. When he wants to surpass security, he will tell us what chemicals he used to counter what defenses. Not simplify everything to “stupefyius”. Same goes with the elves, who despite using supernatural means, still use science to explain their tricks. This makes everything far more creative and distinctive, since it makes everything far more than archetypical elves and wizards. It doesn’t insult the intelligence of the reader either, as he is given an actual explanation. And I am not saying the science is very accurate or something; just better than “immobilus”. 

Because of the above, Artemis is way more cerebral than Harry. He is a boy genius who uses his talents to overcome challenges, instead of an undeservingly idiot who is constantly validated for things he never achieved personally (the boy who lived, as if it was Harry the one who killed Voltemort with the spell). Artemis is also never over-praised by his peers for breaking every rule, nor is he constantly rewarded by the very teachers whose rules he constantly breaks and social structure he constantly insults. Artemis is a criminal mastermind, he breaks the rules for his personal gain and nobody on the side of the law cheers him for that. He stays in the dark, with no thousands of kids around his age clapping in excitement around him.        

Another thing I liked over Harry Potter was the status of his family. No asshole foster parents who are constantly bullying him, and flawed parents who are not deified by everyone for sacrificing their lives in the name of good or some crap. No good wizards versus deatheaters, just a boy trying to score big and some elves doing their job. It is a far more believable situation, instead of shameless over-dramatization of one-dimensional heroes and villains, aiming at the lowest common denominator. 

And a last thing which will seem negative to some, is how despite being the protagonist, Artemis is not in the spotlight for 90% of the book. Most of the secondary characters get an almost even amount of pages, se we see the plot unfolding through multiple points of view, each one with its own morality code and objectives. It is far more multi-layered this way and helps a lot in fleshing out the cast, although it takes away the empowerment fantasy most of the audience is looking for through the protagonist.

q3flhh,I just finished re-reading the Artemis Fowl series for the first time in 18 years. Here's my ranking of the books.,"So, as the title states, I recently did a re-read of the Artemis Fowl series, written by Eoin Colfer. I had read them when I was much younger and thoroughly enjoyed them, so recently I decided to read through them again. Plus, there was a couple of them that I hadn't read before. Here's how I would rank books 1-6, considering that I don't have books 7 or 8 and didn't feel like buying them. 

1) The Eternity Code - This one really starts to mark the change of Artemis from a kid into a teenager and he faces a tremendous amount of adversity in this book. His relationship with Holly, Foaly, and co. really starts to change into a true friendship by the end of the book. He has to come up with the ultimate heist plan in order to outsmart his enemy at the end. 

2) The Opal Deception - I thought Opal was a great villain and sort of the fairy world's version of Artemis, with extremely evil intentions. She's probably the smartest foe that Artemis ever faced, considering she out maneuvered Foaly and Artemis for most of the book.  

3) The Lost Colony - The idea of the demons being this long lost family of fairies that have been existing outside of time for thousands of years was really cool. N01 was a great character. I thought the ending was also exciting and probably the strongest part of this book. 

4) Artemis Fowl (The original) - Such a great start to the series and an awesome self-contained story that exists perfectly if you read just this one, but is also a great stepping stone into the rest of the universe and the story. 

5) The Time Paradox - I thought this one was solid but not quite as good as books 3-5 for me. 

6) The Arctic Incident - For whatever reason, I just didn't connect with this one as much as the others. It comes in at the bottom of the list for me out of books 1-6. 

For those of you who have read the series, what are your thoughts on these books? How are books 7 and 8? All I've done is read a quick synopsis of them and I probably won't go out of my way to read them, but I would be curious what others thought. 

Also, P.S., I finally watched the movie towards the end of my re-read. It was just as disappointing as everyone said it was. Such a shame.

3m71mj,I just finished reading Artemis Fowl. Does it get any worse?,"I don't want this to be a book bashing thread. I want to be honest.


I've heard of Artemis Fowl from a number of friends. All things suggested this was a great book that any fantasy fiction fan should read. I had very high expectations.


I borrowed the book last night. Before the first chapter ended, I realized this was meant for a much younger audience. A lot of the dialog seemed forced and hackneyed. I hated every trite remark, every ""joke"" that was told, etc.


I can't remember one moment when the narrative made me smile. Throughout the painful process, I kept asking myself ""why am I still reading this?""


From a worldbuilder's perspective, Eoin did a terrible job. His ""fairy world"" was just modern day America (or Ireland? I don't know but it didn't even feel Irish) with humans in different skins. 


I clearly picked the wrong book. It's been a terrible day for my reading. I haven't hated a book more.


Strangely, I want to know what happens in the next book. It's weird. I doubt I'll pick up another book in this series.
