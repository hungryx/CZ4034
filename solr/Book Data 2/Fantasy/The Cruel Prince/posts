vflcmb,I'm 80% through The Cruel Prince and just begging it to get to whatever the point is.,"I was really oversold on how interesting this book is. 

Do people not know that women want power and can be driven to attain it? Why was this MC's perspective sold as so dynamic and fascinating.


Ugh, It's just very very very frustrating to be 7 hours into a book and realizing that nothing is unfolding. It's already unfolded. There's nothing clever or edifying going on with the writing. It is just a story.

1amjtnb,"In The Cruel Prince fantasy world, why do faeries hate humans so much?","Disclaimer: I'm on book 1 and have read up to chapter 13.
Please if you could answer this with no spoilers that would be great 🫶🏽

Idk if I missed the explanation or if it's going to be explained later on but why do faeries and the other creatures in the fae world hate humans so much? I know that faes see humans as less than because they are mortal and don't live forever. When I asked Google all it told me was that faes hate humans because they see them as less than cause they are mortal. (So basically the same thing).

I get the whole magical creatures finding humans to be less than and all, that makes sense to me. But there are some scenes where the behaviors of the faes/creatures are coming from a place of vengeance or something of that sort, like when Jude had her finger bitten off because that creature hates humans. I feel like the hate that the faeries have for humans in this fantasy world is from way more than just seeing them as less than, while reading I thought maybe the faes had been wronged by humans in the past or something.

I feel like there is something else maybe, something that humans do or have done to them that makes them hate them the way they do.

I'd just really like to understand the book better, so far I'm enjoying it. 
If the answer is going to be answered later on in the book or the series then let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1amjtnb/in_the_cruel_prince_fantasy_world_why_do_faeries/,2024-02-09 08:48:54,17,49,books
10ujur0,The cruel prince,"This book wasn't what i expected it to be.I am not saying that i expected romance i knew it would be about politics but it just wasn't what i had in mind and i didn't really enjoy it.

First of all it was weird to me that Jude and her sisters were staying with the person who killed their parents.I haven't seen anyone mentioning that but it just didn't sit right with me.Besides that i couldn't emotionally connect with the characters they were all somehow uninteresting to me.The book also didn't really have a plot,things started happening towards the end after Balekin killed his family and I don't understand people who say that the author mastered the ""enemies to lovers"" trope.How?Cardan was bullying Jude for basically no reason,then it turns out he was obsessed with her and at the end they kiss?that definitely wasn't an enemies to lovers, more of a failed attempt.

Sometimes the first book of the series isn't the best but it should be good to keep u interested in reading the other books of the series so i am not sure if i should start the second book,i don't want to be disappointed",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10ujur0/the_cruel_prince/,2023-02-05 18:41:35,10,0,books

13rdk9j,"The Cruel Prince, by Holly Black - Here are my thoughts. What were yours?","I am pretty torn over this book.

On one hand, the first half I hated. I thought the plot had potential, I just strongly disliked the author's writing style. On the other hand, it had a kind of.. addictive quality to it. Especially into the second half, I found myself needing to know what happens next.

The author does include some folklore. And I appreciate that she actually took time to research and what is included is relatively accurate. Additionally, after a certain point I just found myself needing to know what happens next. I didn't care for Jude's love interests or the weird tournament she entered or her immature bullies and especially not for Cardan. But, without giving any spoilers, I felt things beginning to mature towards the end. It was more about fantasy politics opposed to an annoying MC being bullied by her classmates.

In the first few chapters, the main character's parents are murdered. And it's so boring. There is no emotion, there is nothing to make you empathise with Jude as she's witnessing this tragedy. It's not written like a tragedy at all, and that doesn't feel intentional. And this continues for a lot of the book, it just makes it pretty boring.

There's no proper set up for the world Jude finds herself in. In my opinion, a good book is one that is able to explain a world within the plot, in the first few chapters. For me, a good example of this is Shadow and Bone, this book sets up and explains the magical world very well, but without going out of its way to do it. That book incorporates this explanation into the plot, while The Cruel Prince doesn't. This book doesn't explain some key & reoccurring concepts until about halfway through. Black seems to just throw the world and its characters at the reader without much explanation or context, and expects us to go 'oh yeah that makes perfect sense'. In my opinion, even plot twists shouldn't be entirely out of the blue. This was one of my initial introductions to the fantasy genre, but I had read a lot of mystery. And in most of these books, the big reveal or realisation is a massive penny-drop moment - but you had enough clues and small details throughout that it makes sense. It makes you go 'Why didn't I see that coming?', whereas this book just makes you go '...what?'.

Also, I despised Cardan. I've seen so many comments and reviews saying they love him, but I hate him with a burning passion. I cannot stand the hot bully love interest, and Cardan is no exception. He treats Jude awfully the whole way through the book, and as soon as HE needs something, he starts treating her a little better but still like an entitled jerk. Abusive and problematic men being treated as the ultimate love interest is just gross to me. Now, I have since read the two sequels to the trilogy, and it gets a bit better - especially in The Queen of Nothing. And yes I know it's the whole character arc thing, but it's still gross.

And finally... there was very little substance. Until the last few chapters, I felt very little actually happened. A lot of a human girl being bullied, and that weird, boring tournament I completely forgot about until writing a review... but towards the end it did hugely improve. >!Spies, murder & plotting.!< More like fantasy politics. And I liked that.

Of course, this is just my personal opinion and I would love to hear others, no matter if you agree or disagree. At the end of the day, this book wasn't bad. I did somewhat enjoy it towards the end. And the two sequels were incredible in comparison. I genuinely loved The Queen of Nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13rdk9j/the_cruel_prince_by_holly_black_here_are_my/,2023-05-25 10:03:53,22,17,books

That scene was so horrible, and then all of a sudden we're told that Cardan likes Jude, which is supposed to be the reason that justifies his actions.!< I'm not that familiar with the enemies-to-lovers trope, but is it always like this?

I fear I have missed something big, or accidentally read over a huge plot-line and I would really appreciate someone telling me why they loved this book! My reasons for not being fond of it is because I found it quite confusing, with parts of it seeming skipped over or rushed. (ie.

iqt69f,The Cruel Prince’s Writing?,"Hi everyone,

So I finally picked up The Cruel Prince after everyone recommended it. I haven’t read a YA in forever and was super excited for it as it had all the YA cliches I’m a sucker for: enemies to lovers, bully male lead, fantasy, normal heroine grows strong.

But . . . I just got bored of the writing. I didn’t feel like the world was detailed out enough for me to really feel the faerie realm. Scenes felt like a sequence of she said, he said, she did this, he did that. Nothing felt like it had emotion.

19dwci5,the atlas six and why i disliked it :),"i just finished this book and man, was it a hard read.

i first saw this book in my local bookstore, read the blurb and nearly bought it right then and there, the only reason i didn't, was because i wanted to buy the hunger games ballad of songbirds and snakes first.

anyways, i read the book online and am so glad I didn't waste my money on it 😭

the idea of a secret society of magicians thst have access to indispensable knowledge is fascinating, and the ""knowledge is carnage"" part in the corner would draw anyone in, but the book itself was so poorly executed that the only thing i really enjoyed were the illustrations and cover.

There are four main points I'll be touching about this book that, there are many others but these are the ones at the forefront of my mind

WARNING: There are spoilers in this post so please don't read if you intend on keeping the surprise <3

I apologise in advance for any spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, it's 1am and I am exhausted:P

WHY I STRONGLY DISLIKE THIS BOOK:

1. Pathetic World Building
As a predominantly fantasy reader, I am used to intricate world building and lore, for example: The Cruel Prince and Hunger Games, beautifully executed worlds that made me want to read more.

Calling TAS a fantasy book is honestly disrespectful to genuine ones because of the unenthusiastic world building.

We are told that this is not present day , because of the dying planet and large population, but apart from a few instances where there are mentioned, almost nothing is ever brought up about the world the characters live in itself.

Moreover, the setting is hard to grasp and visualise, for example, the Library house thing itself, I had a hard time trying to imagine it using only the sparse description we were given right when the characters walked in. Apart from the brief introduction to the setting in the beginning, we were given no description or acknowledgement of the surroundings and environment to the point where the characters may as well have been floating in an endless void.

There was also a disappointing amount of sensory information, the descriptions we did get were almost always (if not always) visual. A combination of the senses would've been much more immersive and interesting to read imo.

2. Annoying Characters
I did not like any of these characters, period.

Normally, there is atleast one character is vibe with or am rooting for, but with TAS, all I was doing was desperately waiting for the end of one chapter so I could start another.

The characters were all all so dramatically overbearing with their given tropes; Parisa the femme fatale, Lobby being an anxious, OCD nerd, Nico and his obsession with protecting Gideon, Callum a cold sociopath and Reina just plain unbothered and blunt.

The only bearable character was Atlas himself, but we got so little of him that it was barely enough for me to like the characters as a whole.

The writing of the characters was also shallow and alot of the chapters were mushed together in the sense of the voice of characters because of how little distinction there was between them. 

There were SO many instances where details were so dramatically overstated-- like Libby's anxiety and Tristan's cynicism-- but rarely ever acknowledged in the character's own POV$ that it just felt like unenthusiastic afterthoughts 

 wtf is Dalton??? why is he necessary and what is happening with the relationship between him and Parisa?

Why did they hate eachother so much? 

How did they go from hating eachothers asses to suddenly teaming up to find Libby (whom they also hated) 

Overall, the characters are just shallow and plain boring, end of discussion.

3. Half-Assed Plotline
This book felt like it was written in one sitting with no previous planning whatsoever. 

The plot meanders so much that half the time, even I didn't know what was happening. I had no clue what the storyline and what the characters were working towards was until the last few chapters which is frankly disappointing.

The plot jumped so many times from being initiated into the Society, being liked by other members, killing/be killed to saving the world? It felt like a series squished into 400 pages but also felt so unnecessary at the same time.

Moreover, there were so many unanswered questions and random plot holes and half thought of details in this book. I understand it's part of a trilogy but the amount of plot holes made it sooo not enjoyable to read.


4. Random Tangents + Confusing Details?
The characters in this book often went on long boring tangents about philosophy or science to the point where they sounded like pretentious try hards, sorry not sorry.

For a book that talked so much about the physics and laws behind the magic, it felt so confusing as a reader, and the lore they talked about what little lore there was, the more confused I got. 

The long winding paragraphs about philosophy were also mind numbing, sure it may be because I rarely read philosophical texts, but in what universe is pages upon pages of random jargon interesting? At that point, just pick a book about Quantum physics or something, it'll be of more use 🤷‍♀️

The characters also went on for pages about unnecessary stuff that barlt added to the plot that the only thing I could think of while reading was... spinach.
Like when you can put a giant bunch of it into a pan for it to end up barely a handful when cooked
...yeah, that's how i felt about the writing. So many words but hardly anything said.


Although TAS had a few merits, like the somewhat interesting mechanics of the character's powers, the weaknesses greatly outweigh the strengths, which is why, I'd give The Atlas Six a 1.5/5 
I doubt I'd read the sequels unless I had absolutely nothing else to read, and considering the reveiws of those, I doubt I'd finish both of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19dwci5/the_atlas_six_and_why_i_disliked_it/,2024-01-23 19:16:24,7,0,books
hwxy7u,Spoilers for the entirety of The Last Unicorn. Peter S Beagle's portrayal of magical creatures is Amazing,"The Last Unicorn is a book that depicts the magical creatures within it as genuinely inhuman. It explores the difference in nature between a mortal, human being, and immortal magical/fey being. The book begins telling the reader what unicorns are and their nature.

&#x200B;

>Unicorns are immortal. It is their nature to live alone in one place: usually a forest where there is a pool clear enough for them to see themselves‌—‌for they are a little vain, knowing themselves to be the most beautiful creatures in all the world, and magic besides. They mate very rarely, and no place is more enchanted than one where a unicorn has been born. The last time she had seen another unicorn the young virgins who still came seeking her now and then had called to her in a different tongue; but then, she had no idea of months and years and centuries, or even of seasons. It was always spring in her forest, because she lived there, and she wandered all day among the great beech trees, keeping watch over the animals that lived in the ground and under bushes, in nests and caves, earths and treetops. Generation after generation, wolves and rabbits alike, they hunted and loved and had children and died, and as the unicorn did none of these things, she never grew tired of watching them.   

The first paragraph establishes that they are outside the cycle of life and death, and since they can't experience the cycle of life, she is an observer. The story begins with the unicorn overhearing that there are no other unicorns in the world, and she sets out to find them. Her only hint as to their fate comes from a butterfly who tells her, ""They passed down all the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind them and covered their footprints."" The unicorn leaves her timeless forest and enters the world to find the other unicorns. When the unicorn meets a human magician, the book begins to contrast between the unicorn and humanity. 

&#x200B;

>Unicorns know nought of need, or shame, or doubt, or debt‌.

We also learn some lore surrounding their magical nature. When a harpy, another magical creature, is attacking the unicorn advises the magician:

&#x200B;

>“You must never run from anything immortal. It attracts their attention.” Her voice was gentle, and without pity. “Never run,” she said. “Walk slowly, and pretend to be thinking of something else. Sing a song, say a poem, do your tricks, but walk slowly.”  

However, the book does not focus more on the capacity of magical beings to feel. Although sapient, immortal creatures like the unicorn, do not experience the same emotions as humans. This is first illustrated in a scene where the magician laments the death of a woman killed by the harpy.

&#x200B;

>“The poor old woman,” he whispered at last. The unicorn said nothing, and Schmendrick raised his head and stared at her in a strange way. A gray morning rain was beginning to fall, and she shone through it like a dolphin. “No,” she said, answering his eyes. “I can never regret.”   He was silent, crouched by the road in the rain, drawing his soaked cloak close around his body until he looked like a broken black umbrella. The unicorn waited, feeling the days of her life falling around her with the rain. “I can sorrow,” she offered gently, “but it’s not the same thing.”

Even primal feelings such as fear are not in the unicorns nature. Beyond being incapable of human emotions, she does not experience the same drives as animals which by nature have a fear response in order to avoid death. Yet, the unicorn does not fear anything.

&#x200B;

>The unicorn had never been afraid of anything. She was immortal, but she could be killed: by a harpy, by a dragon or a chimera, by a stray arrow loosed at a squirrel. But dragons could only kill her‌—‌they could never make her forget what she was, or themselves forget that even dead she would still be more beautiful than they.  

The unicorn first experiences fear when she meets the Red Bull. A creature older than the unicorn who herself is ancient. Characters describe the Bull as a ""demon"". The unicorn states that the Bull recognizes her in particular as it's query when they meet it did not know her. It does not recognize her beauty. Later, we learn from King Haggard, the Bull's apparent master that. ""He serves anyone who has no fear‌—‌—‌and I have no more fear than I have rest."". The Red Bull then is a great old one, a primal force of pure fear that can only be mastered by one who does not feel fear. However, by its nature everything fears the Bull.  King Haggard is an exception because he is emotionally numb. Unable to feel anything, joy or pain. He is empty and restless. The only thing which ever made him happy was seeing a unicorn so he bayed the Bull gather them for him. When the Bull comes for the unicorn, the magician changes her into a human girl.   As she slowly gains humanity the longer she stays human, the inhumanity of unicorns is highlighted again. When rebuked for being cruel by ignoring the prince who becomes infatuated her she responds:

&#x200B;

>“How can I be cruel? That is for mortals.” But then she did raise her eyes, and they were great with sorrow, and with something very near to mockery. She said, “So is kindness.”  

Over time, as she becomes more human her capacity for feelings grows. That is what it means to be human. The unicorn herself is aware of what she will lose if she becomes a unicorn again, how her nature will change. Telling the prince, who she has come to love, that:

&#x200B;

>“I will not love you when I am a unicorn, and you will love me only because you cannot help it. I will be more beautiful than anything in the world, and live forever.“

&#x200B;

However, the fact she was human once has changed her. When the unicorn returns to her true form and faces the Bull again, the Prince gives his life attempting to protect her.  The unicorn now knows what it is to love, and can now feel the full weight of grief.  

&#x200B;

>Prince Lír leaped into the path of the Red Bull. For a moment, he disappeared entirely, like a feather in a flame. The Bull ran over him and left him lying on the ground. One side of his face cuddled too hard into the sand, and one leg kicked the air three times before it stopped. He fell without a cry, and Schmendrick and Molly alike were stricken as silent as he, but the unicorn turned. The Red Bull halted when she did, and wheeled to put her once more between himself and the sea. He began his mincing, dancing advance again, but he might have been a courting bird for all the attention the unicorn paid him. She stood motionless, staring at the twisted body of Prince Lír…   Suddenly the unicorn screamed. It was not at all like the challenging bell with which she had first met the Red Bull; **it was an ugly, squawking wail of sorrow and loss and rage, such as no immortal creature ever gave.** 

&#x200B;

The implication here is although immortals can feel sorrow, no immortal being ever felt what the unicorn does at that moment: rage, loss, heartbreak. These are human feelings.   Overcome with these emotions, the unicorn no longer feels fear and can defeat the Bull and free the other captive unicorns. She uses her magic to resurrect the fallen Prince, but cannot stay with him. She is a unicorn again, forever, and cannot belong to anyone or be with anyone.However, the experience of being human has changed her forever.

&#x200B;

>I have been mortal, and some part of me is mortal yet. I am full of tears and hunger and the fear of death, though I cannot weep, and I want nothing, and I cannot die. I am not like the others now, for no unicorn was ever born who could regret, but I do. I regret.”  

Through the books exploration of what mortals experience and what immortals do not, Peter S. Beagle brings to life an inhuman protagonist who feels otherworldly and portrays her as fundamentally 'other'.  

  
Many fantasy books feature intelligent magical creatures who feel like they are just like human characters that happen to look like something else and have magical abilities. It is a safe choice because readers want to be able to relate to characters, and writing characters that act like people is a prerequisite for that. However, in ""The Last Unicorn"" Beagle manages to craft a story with a protagonist that the audience will not relate to, by design, but can love all the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hwxy7u/spoilers_for_the_entirety_of_the_last_unicorn/,2020-07-24 08:11:41,5,72,books
bq85u4,"What is ""Machiavellian Politics""? Using the book ""The Prince"" to actually explain the term.","So many times in conversation, people will use the word Machiavellian, but they don't mean much by it. People use it without reading his book. On Google, it is defined as trying your best to maintain power. I thought this was interesting, because that was the face-value reason he wrote ""The Prince"", but not actually a summary of it's contents.

Generally, when the word comes up in conversation, it means something along the lines of ""deceitful politics"" or ""cruel politics"". I want to use his book to try and let people know what Machiavellian politics actually are.

I will give a kind of bulleted list describing what he considered to be good politics. I will also take the liberty to ""translate"" ideas into a modern setting (For example, I will say states, not principalities). It is also important to note that ""Machiavellian Politics"" as defined in the Prince, specifically addresses parties of great power, It would apply more to the President or a Saudi leader than to a member of the US House.

---

Chapters I-III - Discussing the types of states, not referenced when someone says ""Machiavellian Politics""

**How Machiavelli would handle politics are described after this point.**

Chapter IV - There are two types of administrators under you, people appointed by you (Ministers), and people appointed to power before you were (Nobles).

Nobles are fickle, **it is easier to turn peoples of power who have held that position for a long time to your cause**. But they won't support you in the long term. **Your appointed bureaucracy will help you rule effectively if you appoint them after attaining power.**

Chapter V - How to conquer free people, not relevant to the definition.

Chapter VI - **Setting unattainable goals is good.** Because the hard work you will do to achieve them will be of benefit.

Acquiring a position of power with skill is the hardest way, but the best way.

Chapter VII - Acquiring a position of power through luck or money is the easiest way, but the hardest to maintain.

**Before taking power, you must set up the roots of people loyal to you.** Do this by making friends and eliminating enemies. **It is much harder to create loyalty when you already have power.**

Chapter VIII - Acquiring a position of power with criminal acts is the worst way to do it.

However, if one needs to use criminal means for power, **all criminal acts must be done all at once to achieve power**, then **use your gained position in a manner somewhat consistently benevolent.** Constant crime won't let you rule forever.

Chapter IX: **It is much better to have the support of the lower class than the upper class.** The upper-class desires too much, the lower class just wants to be left alone.

When delegating power to Magistrates close to the common folk, the common folk will like the magistrates more than the ruler. **Delegation of power should be done in positions far from the commons.**

Chapter X - **You must be charismatic and hopeful towards the commons during wartime.**

Chapter XI - Satire about religious governments, not relevant.

Chapter XII - **Using your army is always better than using the army of others.**

Chapter XIII - Not using your army may seem good in prosperous times, but time is fickle and it will fail eventually.

Chapter XIV - **War is the most important thing for a leader to study.** Because you cannot have the ""armed"" men in your nation loyal if you are not ""armed"" yourself. And they have the power to break you.

Chapter XV - **The standard moral compass is wrong.** The dichotomy of Condemnation vs Praise is usually thought of in terms of virtues (compassion, faith, craftiness, and generosity) and sins (Cowardice, cruelty, stubbornness, and miserliness).

**The true dichotomy that makes a man good vs evil is Doing what is Good for your state vs what is bad for your state. If an act of stubbornness is used to safeguard the state, then it is morally good.**

Chapter XVI - **Generosity is bad.** Eventually, you will run out of money, and retracted generosity is received worse than never having any.

**Stinginess is good**, because saving money will eventually be perceived as generosity, by building public works and maintaining low taxes for example.

XVII - There are two types of cruelty. The cruelty that makes men fear you. The cruelty that makes men hate you (Taking land and abusing women are listed as examples). **You should be loved and feared**, but being feared is better than being loved if a choice is to be made.

**One should never commit cruelty that makes one hated.**

Chapter XVIII - **A ruler should always keep the facade of benevolence and trust.** Do not act menacingly or untrustworthy. However, **one should always break a promise if breaking it benefits you**. Determining if a broken promise will benefit you is a great skill, and hard to achieve.

**Men are fickle, do not trust them.**

Chapter XIX - Never be hated by your people. **Force other people in the Bureaucracy to implement unfavorable laws, only implement favorable laws yourself.**

Chapter XX - **Having an armed population is great for trust. Disarming a population is terrible for trust.**

If these arms are the subject of revolt, a leader should incite revolt to oust them from hiding, and put them down quickly.

Chapter XXI: **Gain reverence by waging war, avoiding neutrality, having allies weaker than you, public displays of rewards and punishment, and my letting the common folk be, maintaining low taxes.**

Chapter XXII - **It is best to advise yourself.** If you are uneducated in a situation, having helpful advisors is acceptable. **But not recognizing you need advisors makes you a useless ruler.**

Chapter XXIII - Have useful advisors, **flatterers are useless.**

Chapter XXIV - Not relevant (Current state of Italy)

Chapter XXV - Half of one's ascension to power is luck. **One must adapt to luck as best as possible**, like men build dikes before a river floods. **If you continue to make the same decisions that got you power in the first place, and never adapt, you will lose it.**

First off we would like to thank everyone who participated, by either nominating and/or voting, in our Best of the Decade Vote. Below you will find the top 3 voted on books in every category. I would, however, recommend you also check out the nomination threads as quite a few great books are mentioned in there.

**Best Science Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ft7kaj/best_science_fiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *The Three-Body Problem* by Liu Cixin - nominated by /u/Speaker4theRest

>Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.

2nd place: *The Fifth Season* by N.K. Jemisin - nominated by /u/sSlipperyPickle

>This is the way the world ends. Again.  
>  
>Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.  
>  
>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/Aglance

>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.  
>  
>Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.  
>  
>After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first.But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

**Best Debut of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fxcbo7/best_debut_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi - nominated by /u/okiegirl22

>Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of *Homegoing* follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, *Homegoing* makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation.

2nd place: *The Song of Achilles* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/baddspellar

>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. By all rights their paths should never cross, but Achilles takes the shamed prince as his friend, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.  
>  
>Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.

3rd place: *The Martian* by Andy Weir - nominated by /u/TheItalianDream

>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.

**Best Literary and General Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g2186t/best_literary_and_general_fiction_of_the_decade/)

**1st place:** *Circe* by Madeline Miller - nominated by /u/honeyiamsorry

>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.  
>  
>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.  
>  
>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

2nd place: *My Brilliant Friend* by Elena Ferrante - nominated by /u/SinoJesuitConspiracy

>My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.

3rd place: *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara - nominated by /u/Scurvy_Dogwood

>When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.  
>  
>Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

**Best Mystery or Thriller of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g684bn/best_mystery_or_thriller_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Gone Girl* by Gillain Flynn - nominated by /u/johnnywash1

>Marriage can be a real killer.On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife?

>Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students—a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.Not much later, Jake’s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane—and insanely possible—mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.

3rd place: *The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton - nominated by /u/mercutio_died

>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her.

**Best Short Story Collection of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gag0qp/best_short_story_collection_of_the_decade_voting/)

**1st place:** *Tenth of December* by George Saunders - nominated by /u/rjbman

>In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of *Tenth of December* are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.

2nd place: *Exhalation: Stories* by Ted Chiang - nominated by /u/amyousness

>This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In ""The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate,"" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ""Exhalation,"" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects,"" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: ""Omphalos"" and ""Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.""  
>  
>In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.

3rd place: *Homesick for Another World* by Ottessa Moshfegh - nominated by /u/ApollosCrow

>There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. *Homesick for Another World* is a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and *Homesick for Another World* is her *Everything That Rises Must Converge* or *A Good Man is Hard to Find*. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources, and the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp. The needle hits the vein before we even feel the prick.

**Best Horror of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ger39o/best_horror_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer - nominated by /u/Bennings463

>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In *Annihilation*, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's *Southern Reach Trilogy*, we join the twelfth expedition.  
>  
>The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

2nd place: *The Fisherman* by John Langan - nominated by /u/ifthisisausername

>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman's Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.

3rd place: *My Best Friend's Exorcism* by Grady Hendrix - nominated by /u/leowr

>Abby and Gretchen have been best friends since fifth grade, when they bonded over a shared love of E.T., roller-skating parties, and scratch-and-sniff stickers. But when they arrive at high school, things change. Gretchen begins to act….different. And as the strange coincidences and bizarre behavior start to pile up, Abby realizes there’s only one possible explanation: Gretchen, her favorite person in the world, has a demon living inside her. And Abby is not about to let anyone or anything come between her and her best friend. With help from some unlikely allies, Abby embarks on a quest to save Gretchen. But is their friendship powerful enough to beat the devil?

>  
>But on the day that life begins, would he even notice? Does it start at 21 when he meets the girl of his dreams? Or at 11, when he has his first kiss? Is it later in his life when his first son is born? Or earlier when he might have found his voice as a writer?  
>  
>Each day in Brás's life is like a page from a book. Each one reveals the people and things who have made him who he is: his mother and father, his child and his best friend, his first love and the love of his life. And like all great stories, each day has a twist he'll never see coming...

**Best Non-Fiction of the Decade** \- [Nomination Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0jyb8/best_nonfiction_of_the_decade_voting_thread/)

**1st place:** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman - nominated by /u/TriangleTingles

>In the highly anticipated *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.  
>  
>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will transform the way you think about thinking.

2nd place: *Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI* by David Grann - nominated by /u/GanymedeBlu35

>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.  
>  
>Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.  
>  
>In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.

178nql,"1356 by Bernard Cornwell- a review.  ""Bernard Cornwell does the best battle scenes of any writer I've ever read, past or present.""-G.R.R Martin","If you're into historical fiction, then you most likely know Bernard Cornwell who is well known for his Sharpe, Saxon Stories, Warlord Chronicles, and Grail Quest series.  This is latest book.

The book revisits Thomas of Hookton from the Grail Quest trilogy.  At this point, Thomas is known as The Bastard and commands a small war band, the Harlequins, that terrorizes the French countryside during the Hundred Year War.  Thomas is intelligent and uses the longbow to its full advantage while playing on the French noble's hubris.  He's a relatively morally ambiguous character; he has enemies within the Church and pillages for a living, but he doesn't allow rape and tries to do good when he can.  The climax of this novel is the Battle of Poitiers, which would prove to be one of the most famous of England's military victories and a crushing defeat for the French.  The English are led by Edward, Prince of Wales, also known as the Black Prince.

Martin is completely right when he says that Cornwell writes amazing battle scenes and there are plenty in this book.  Lots of ambushes set and skirmishes and raiding to be had and it's all done in a way that is interesting, visceral, realistic, and just fun to read.  If you like any kind of action in books, then this is a good read for you as is Cornwell in general.  

There's another part of the book where an ambitious cardinal and Thomas are both searching for **la Malice**, the sword of St. Peter that he used to defend Christ and was admonished by Christ for doing so.  There's a slight fantastical element to the series were the relics might be real (while most are fake); the sword (in the prologue; not ruining anything for you) proves to be a formidable weapon despite its age and lackluster appearance.  Thomas wants to stop the French cardinal from acquiring it and using it to control men and to lead the French in battle.

Really, if you like historical fiction or action packed books, I highly recommend this book, but you probably want to read the Grail Quest series first.  Lee Child of the Reacher books and Vince Flynn of the Mitch Rapp books are both also fans of Bernard Cornwell.  The book reads quickly, never drags, Thomas and his band of men are great characters, the Church is good (priests and monks) and evil (the bishops and cardinals), nobles are rich and well educated but many are fools or cruel, and Cornwell is pretty accurate.  There's a 7 page historical note that tells you what changes were made to the actual historical record (or in the case of Poitiers, which side of the debate Cornwell believes) and he writes down what books he used for research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/178nql/1356_by_bernard_cornwell_a_review_bernard/,2013-01-25 05:12:00,11,14,books
8hpkwm,Adults who have re-read/read Harry Potter recently - how would you rank the novels? What are your thoughts reading them as an adult?,"Like a lot of people on this sub, I grew up reading HP and was pretty much the same age as the characters as each book came out. HP was a huge part of my life and was instrumental in developing and growing my love of reading to more serious and diverse literature.

I recently re-read the novels and would rank them as such:

1. Half-Blood Prince: I don't often see this one as anyone's favourite but I've always loved the really mysterious and brooding atmosphere in this one. It's fairly low-key for being the penultimate book in the franchise and I enjoyed the detective-like story of discovering Voldemort's past and finding the Horcruxes. The sequence in the sea cave where Harry and Dumbledore encounter the Inferi is probably favourite set piece in the entire series. Also, Dumbledore's absolutely fucking wrecked me, as it did pretty much everyone who was 

2. Prisoner of Azkaban: The best self-contained story in the series imo. The Dementors have never been as scary as they are in PoA and the time-travel mechanic is cool af. Also introduces Lupin and Sirius, 2 of the best characters in the franchise. Also the Marauder's Map, one of my favourite magical concepts Rowling created

3. Deathly Hallows: Yeah, it drags a bit in the middle but I actually liked how it almost felt like 2 books in one - the first part a slow, grim chase that escalates into the epic battle for Hogwarts. This book has 2 of the coolest scenes in the series - the first being Harry and Hermione's detour to Godric's Hollow and then the Gringotts dragon escape. I didn't like the epilogue but I thought the conclusion was satisfying otherwise

4. Goblet of Fire: The 4th book is also the middle of the pack for me as far as the series as a whole is concerned. This is when the narrative started to come together as a continuing story. The triwizard tournament sequences were fantastic - especially the 2nd underwater challenge, and the twist with Barty Crouch Jr blew my mind when I read it

5. Chamber of Secrets: I appreciated how dark this one got for being a simple ""children's tale"" as the first 2 books were designated. The voices from the walls and the students turning to stone are both really creepy, and the final encounter with the Basilisk is pretty awesome. I didn't like Gildeory Lockhart though, and there were one too many info dumps explaining events from the first book

6. Philosopher's Stone: Ah, where it all started. I still get a massive dose of nostalgia every time I think about this one. It's still pretty fantastic, albeit a little simplistic and sparse, as it really is just an introduction to Rowling's universe

7. Order of the Phoenix: I remember this being a bit of a slog when I read it the first time, and although I liked it more at 27 than I did at 13 when I first read it, it's middle third is not the greatest and Harry is frankly an annoying twit for most of it. Umbridge is absolutely fantastic though and pretty much carries this book. I really wish we could have some Quidditch though as I've loved always reading about the matches. Sirius' death is still as painful as it ever was, although the DUmbledore vs Voldemort battle wasn't as epic as it could have been

Reading through these books, although the prose is just functional (much better in the later books though) and if you really wanted, you could nitpick the hell out of the plot holes in the worldbuilding, it really struck me once again at just how vital and creative Rowling's imagination was. I have read hundreds of books across all genres since I finished Deathly Hallows 10 years ago, but I don't remember ever coming across a universe I wanted so much to be real and be a part of. I think that's really the greatest strength of these books - you so very much wish that Hogwarts and the magical world were real and that you could be a part of it. 

Rowling also wasn't afraid to add real darkness to her books, especially in the last 3, which became increasing bleaker and grimmer as they went replacing the whimsy of the first books. You could almost see this as an allegory for growing up - life gets harder and the world seems more cruel but you keep fighting. The depth and detail in the narrative is astonishing and other than Middle Earth, feels like the most fleshed-out fantasy kingdom I've ever read about. That's not even mentioning the amazing characters, the wonderful set-pieces that the movies could never do justice to as much as your own imagination and the sheer joy of making the discoveries along with the characters.

IMO the series has held up very, very well, and it will absolutely be one of the first books I will be introducing to my own kids when they grow up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8hpkwm/adults_who_have_rereadread_harry_potter_recently/,2018-05-07 18:07:58,51,50,books
39lltk,"I want to talk about: The Sum of All Men, Runelords #1 by David Farland","[The Sum of All Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sum_of_All_Men) Is an epic fantasy series that I discovered in my local library several years ago.

 A few quick basics (taken from wikipedia because I'm at work) The main magical system of the series relies on a system of attributes which are inherent to every living creature. These attributes are transferable to and from both man and animal, so brawn from a dog can be transferred to a man. Once an individual gives an attribute to another, the giver loses that particular attribute until the death of the recipient. Each person can only give one endowment in their lifetime. Endowments include brawn (physical strength), grace (physical dexterity), wit (memory and clearness of thought), metabolism (speed at which the body's processes operate), glamor, voice, stamina, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, talent, will, bloodlust, and pain. 

Endowments are transferred with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast of a rare material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, is part of the duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, the facilitator invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The facilitator touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute.

**Spoiler Alert**

A dedicate must give up his attribute willingly; the simple act of touching him with a forcible is not enough. However, unscrupulous Runelords can threaten a potential dedicate's friends and family to force cooperation. Dedicates are normally selected from individuals whose attributes are strong; one selects a strong man to dedicate his brawn, a person with excellent vision to dedicate sight, and so forth.

The story follows Prince Gaborn Val Orden of Mystarria who is trying to go ~~bone~~ marry princess Iome of friendly King Jas Laren Sylvarresta , but then this guy named Raj Ahten (who is like silver age superman) shows up with an army and shoots a single arrow and then using his hundreds of glamour and voice endowments, sweet talks King Jas' ENTIRE FREAKING ARMY INTO LETTING HIM IN! King Jas and Princess Iome are forced to give Raj endowments while Prince Gaborn escapes through the back door with the Earth Warden, a person granted control over the earth element (kinda like a earth bender, but probably more powerful).Prince Orden's personal bodyguard, Sir Borenson, is given orders to kill all of King Jas' dedicates so that it will rob Raj of his new gained powers, also Gaborn is told of a race of underground demon-termite-spider things called reavers that will kill everyone.

Prince Gaborn returns to the castle and rescues Former-King Jas and Princess Iome, Gaborn takes Iome with him to go find his father King Orden to snitch on Raj, but Raj is going straight up to King Orden to fight Ole King Orden. Prince Gaborn is told to go to a nearby castle by his father to gather reinforcements, only for Gab' to realize that his father just wanted him away from the coming slaughter between his forces and Raj's forces. King Orden creates a *Serpent Ring* which is basically a daisy chain of speed, wherein the last man in line can move like 20 times faster than a normal human, but alas it was all for naught as Raj Ahten is more powerful than imaginable and he easily slays the king and the *Serpent Ring* Raj leaves one man alive to tell Pring Gaborn that Raj fucked his whole world up and is just walking away, Sir Borenson (a serious badass incase you haven't realized) kills King Sylvarresta on his own orders, Gaborn mourns his father and the Earth declares him an Earth King (like the avatar but only with earth power, but still incredibly OP)

**Spoiler Alert Ends**

So that's the 1st book. I did it absolutely no justice what so ever. First off I want to say that the magic system with endowments is incredibly cool and unique, it allows the characters to be super humans without the age old ""It comes from thee olde blood that floweth through yonder veins"" junk.

Also the characters are amazing and fleshed out really well, Raj Ahten is just as cruel as he needs to be and Gaborn has some amazing character development over the course of the series. Later if I talk about the other books in the series I'll get deeper into Gaborn. Borenson is kinda like a ser Jorah kinda guy for you ASoIaF and GoT peoples, even princess Iome is a great character.

This series really likes to take normal fantasy tropes and turn them upside down or rework them completely, its almost the anthesis of the Shannara series with all of its happy go lucky all's well that ends well endings.

So have you read it? What did you think? Are you interested in reading it now that you have read this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/39lltk/i_want_to_talk_about_the_sum_of_all_men_runelords/,2015-06-12 16:20:49,7,4,books
npyicr,My Review for The Hellborn King by Christopher Brenning," [https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/01/the-hellborn-king-christopher-brenning/](https://thereadingstray.com/2021/06/01/the-hellborn-king-christopher-brenning/)

""There would be time enough to mourn for his love, but it would’nt be now, Gareth Bethard had decided. Now would come a time of blood, and death, and hate.""

So what’s the book about?

The North wants to reclaim their land after a massacre of their people and now Damien Dreadfire is bringing together an army of disparate people to stand against the kingdom. The fate of the North culture and the entire nation depends on the outcome of the battles in the kingdom, but warriors are in short supply. Damien can count on the help of his friend Einarr, who is becoming more and more divided by his friend Damien’s actions. For he carries out atrocities to get closer to his goal and will stop at nothing. The attacked kingdom, however, has its own problems, for a king who only devotes himself to alcohol, rules the country. Or his son, the crown prince Gareth, who is unable to find his way in his role. As Gareth tries to become a better successor to his father, he gets caught up in more and more conspiracies and has to fight his own family in the process. Therefore, the kingdom faces not only the enemy from the north, but also itself.

Why I wanted to read this series?

I received a copy of the book from the author himself, which I am very happy about, in exchange there is an honest review about the book. I would also like to say thank you very much here again. When I received the request, of course I immediately searched on Amazon for the book to read the blurb of it. When I got the search result, I was first very surprised about the incredibly beautiful cover of the book. Then I read the blurb and was immediately thrilled. Because this one sounds like war and intrigue and that’s what I particularly like. I felt reminded of The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie and since this is one of my favourite books, I was of course enthusiastic!

These aspects attracted me the most while reading.

This story takes you into a cruel world, full of atrocities and barbarians – and that’s the kind of story we all want to read! For the world is not only cruel because of its enemies from the north, but also because its own empire is crumbling. The king is a drunkard and wife-beater, the son who can’t get anything done either, and the siblings who make things even more complicated. So an exciting intrigue is built up within the kingdom, in which everyone plays their own game and you experience many surprises. And the fighters from the north don’t make things any easier for the king either. But even if you expect the king to move against the attackers here, you have misunderstood something. For the realm of Betanthia is not at all interested in the Nordic people slaughtering their own people, but simply let them go. Only a few fighters oppose them, which makes the situation seem even more hopeless. For the nobles of the empire are more interested in their own game for the throne than in standing up for the common people, and so everyone has to look out for themselves.The story is told very slowly and at first, you don’t know what each of the main characters is supposed to do for the story. However, this builds up an incredible tension because at first you get to know all the characters in detail, you know their weaknesses and faults and their dreams. You feel very connected to them and can understand their suffering. Nevertheless, each character in this story has a very individual experience that completely changes the story around the character. Thus, a separate arc of tension is built up for each character and not for the whole story, which has strengthened the connection to the character, but you also don’t know how everything will come together later. You are plunged into different adventures with each individual character, and you don’t even know which one is the most exciting. You get intrigues, fights, but also the inner struggle with oneself is fought out with the characters and thus the tension is always kept high on different levels.In this book, there is a role reversal between the typical gender characteristics – the women here are ambitious, show strength and also have a will of their own, whereas the men have to fight with themselves, don’t want to fight against others at all and care more about love or friendship. The typical image of women or men does not come from anyway and that is why I find it all the more exciting to read when these character traits are simply changed. Often in books there is always a strong woman or an effeminate man, but here everyone has really swapped roles, although in this world you find the typical gender roles, such as men fighting and women having children. And through the book it is shown that there is nothing wrong with what gender you are and despite that can behave differently than society dictates, because women make it to positions that women would have only dreamed of back then and men can show their feelings even if they still get setbacks.Lucetta is actually a completely unworldly princess who you can tell has never lived outside her society and yet I was able to take her to my heart and she became my favourite character in this book. Because Lucetta changes after she sees the completely run-down capital and has to see how the poor have to live there. From there on she changes, because she wants to change something in this world, even though she has never lifted a finger herself. Moreover, from then on, the girl, who at first only lives lonely in her privileged world, changes and becomes a ruthless adult who stands for her goals and ambitions. Lucetta has the most exciting part of this book, because she doesn’t have to fight for her goals alone.

So what are my final thoughts about it?

This is a cruel and very serious story, reminiscent of Joe Abercrombie’s world. Because nothing is as it seems, the characters experience an incredible development through the first part, thanks to their also incredible, even partly disturbing, experiences. This story is very character driven and I have to say that every single character is interesting and I enjoyed reading it. Even though Madelyn came across as a little too generic at first, she was able to convince me so much towards the end that she made up the most exciting ending for me. The book is also more of a low fantasy story, with more of a focus on politics and combat and only a hint of fantasy, but this made me identify with the world much more, as the magic that is present does seem very real. The only negative point I could find are the time jumps at times, which took away from the rythm of the story. This is a story that not only brings war to the kingdom, but the kingdom itself is at war. The ending was so exciting that I can’t wait to read the next volume!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/npyicr/my_review_for_the_hellborn_king_by_christopher/,2021-06-01 16:49:22,0,1,books
156q7gd,The Mother Doesn't Have a Name: The Thoughtful Cruelty of Robin Hobb,"In the comments of my admittedly too-mean critique of Sarah J Maas and *A Court of Thorns and Roses*, several people suggested that I write about a series that I actually *ENJOY,* rather than works that make me wish for a gardening spade in my cerebellum. I wasn't planning on posting anything after my unhinged manifesto on Fae and their lack of transparent taxes. Still, I had a lot of fun writing it and interacting with people in the comments, even over on the SJM subreddit. So why not? I can try a *gushing* rant instead of a spiteful one. And who better than an author that ALSO caused me pain? Except, she did it in a way I liked.

The Realm of the Elderlings is probably my favorite work of fiction, EVER. While it's true that something like Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere will occupy the conversations with my friends for years to come, Robin Hobb's 16-book masterpiece will forever remain, at least in my mind, the greatest work of fiction since *The Lord of The Rings*. It's that damn good.

Before I get into why I hold this monstrous series on an altar of obsessive worship, I should mention; I will be spoiling the entirety of the series. Farseer, Liveship Traders, Tawny Man, Rain Wilds Chronicles, and The Fitz and The Fool. All 16 books. This is not something you want spoiled if you're planning to read it. Cool? Alright.

You can probably skip spoilers if you just jump right to the ***Conclusion.***

Perhaps more importantly, there are dogs in this series. Not all of them make it. Thought you should know.

As with my previous post, I will devolve in coherence as I go. I apologize.

***CYCLES***

Here's the basic rundown: FitzChivalry Farseer is a bastard son of the oldest prince, the one set to take the throne. While not an official member of the royal family, he does have his uses to his grandfather and uncles. He'll be trained as a royal assassin. But Fitz has power in him. Power that he shares with his royal kin but also another from his commoner mother. One that will make him afraid to truly open up to anyone and be his authentic self.

That's how it starts, anyway. But it's about more than that.

Robin's work is about cycles. Cycles of history, of abuse, of nature, trauma, cycles that must continue, cycles that must stop, cycles that need to begin, and cycles that need to come back. She begins this all-encompassing thematic mammoth with an orphaned royal bastard and ends it with the restoration of nature and the destruction of the cancer that nearly doomed everything. It is at the same time deeply personal and universal. It's something I think about almost every day.

This post is going to be LONG and I guarantee I will not cover everything there is to talk about in this series. For the sake of some kind of order to my scrawlings, I'll be talking about these cycles in three categories: Trauma, Change, and Acceptance.

Yeah, let's start with the fun one.

***TRAUMA***

If you've read ANY book in this series, you know that Fitz doesn't exactly have the best time. Neither does Althea, the Fool, Nettle, Burrich, Malta, Bee, Paragon, Molly, Wintrow, there is no end to this list, that is the joke, the list is over and so is the joke.

Nearly every major character, whether they're protagonists or antagonists, is the victim of some past trauma. Many often pass that trauma onto others as the series goes on, continuing a cycle of abuse that never sees an end, only a longer chain of victims. Like Scrooge and Marley creating the weighted chains that hold their souls on earth, so abusers beget future abusers and weigh down the collective soul of the world. That was a Charles Dickens metaphor. Please think I am smart.

Fitz, while being trained in the use of his *Skill* (that's the name of the power, it's like telepathy but cooler, he can break a person's entire mind or heal their body if he wants, it's crazy), is subjected to verbal and physical abuse by his instructor. He's humiliated in front of the other students and at one point is nearly brainwashed into throwing himself off the training tower. Fitz is a young man when this happens, in his early and mid-teens. That kind of thing sticks with someone for life. And by the end of his, Fitz is inflicting that same trauma onto someone else.

Married, in his 60s and with a sickly newborn daughter, Fitz finds a fledgling apprentice to his old assassin mentor attempting to leave a note in his daughter's crib. Flexing his old skills, he surprises the young apprentice (maybe around the same age Fitz was when he began) and forces him to empty his pockets. And then, knowing from experience that there are more subtle methods of concealment, he forces the boy to strip so that Fitz can thoroughly search every single article of clothing himself. The boy stands across the large room by the fire as Fitz checks every stitch of his clothing, removing knives, herbs, bottles of medicines, poisons, all the tools of his old trade.

Keeping the weapons, he returns the apprentice assassin's clothes and sends him back to his old mentor.

In the moment, we understand why Fitz is doing this. An assassin, albeit an inexperienced one, just tried to break into his sickly infant daughter's room. His rage is more than warranted. But it eventually becomes uncomfortable and even pitiable. We can see that he's inflicting the same kind of trauma he suffered onto this young boy. Humiliating him not just in private, but sending him back to his teacher without any of his tools, making his failure obvious and any explanation embarrassing. And while Fitz didn't give him the ole ""suicide brainwash"" trick, the trauma suffered is still very real.

In the same book, we see the boy return nearly in his 20s as the tutor for Fitz's daughter, Bee, as well as the children of the house servants. It does not take long for him to very publically humiliate Bee in front of her peers, passing on the same hurts Fitz passed along to him.

One link in the chain creating another. Or to be less pretentious and use Robin's own metaphor, a wheel continually turning in a rut, forced into a disastrous path.

This is especially apparent in the longer history of Robin's world. The Farseer Trilogy's largest threat to the Six Duchies (excluding Regal) is the attacking Red Ship Armada raiding towns and villages and taking away parts of the people's minds. Anyone that falls victim to a Red Ship raid is ""Forged"" and left as a dangerous mess of immediate, selfish desires, unable to feel empathy for anyone, even their friends and family members. They aren't zombies or rabid animals, they can still think and speak, but they are unable to think beyond themselves and their immediate needs. A Forged person will beat their best friend to death for a coat if they felt a slight chill.

Becoming Forged was an idea that totally unnerved me. A prisoner in my own body unaware of the pain I could be inflicting on those I used to love. The raiders in their Red Ships were committing horribly unspeakable acts. Why?

Because the Six Duchies had done something similar to them. They were condemning people to a life stripped of happiness and empathy, turning friends and family members into deadly psychopaths, as retribution for attacks and raids that had been done to them in the past. And the truly ironic thing? The Six Duchies do it again to win.

Spokes on the wheel of history coming around again, stuck in the same rutted path.

God, it's so beautiful in how bleakly depressing it is! But that's not all!

Keffria is the victim of her husband's misogynistic culture, oppressing women, warmongering, and slave trading for centuries. Every book in the series mentions how destructive and awful the nation of Chalced is.

Those with the *Wit*, the ability to communicate and bond with animals, are trapped in a cycle of persecution, one that Fitz's Uncle Regal exploits at the expense of innocent lives. Those hunted and traumatized victims return in later books for well-justified retribution.

There's, Jesus, SO MUCH more trauma to draw from to make this point. I haven't even mentioned Captain Kennit yet and he can fill a psych ward by himself. But you're smart people, you get the point, we got other stuff to talk about.

Let's *change* it up!

And yes, I no longer have any respect for myself.

***CHANGE***

Of course the obvious solution to these traps of generational despair is, in simple terms, to change. In fact, changing the course of history onto a brighter path is an entire religious mission for The Fool, our resident cryptic, gender-fluid, hopeless romantic and Prophet. He goes by many pronouns but seems to use he/him most of the time so that's what I'll stick with for the remainder of this gargantuan thesis.

The Fool is a White Prophet, so named because of his race's ghostly pale skin. And I mean ""race"" in that he's not really human, not the stupid demarcations of melanin that idiots are obsessed with. The Fool was still an adolescent at 40 years old and routinely goes through a sort of molting process when he gets closer to achieving his destiny. So, y'know, not exactly typical.

To the Fool, Fitz is a Catalyst, a person that when guided by a White Prophet can cause massive changes to the world. However, those changes are not always for the better. To make sure their actions won't make matters worse, the Fool chooses a goal that he believes will ultimately benefit the world. People will die, societies will forever change, and nations will collapse before he is done.

Fitz and the Fool will restore dragons to the world.

Oh yeah, this series has dragons. They're selfish, arrogant, hypnotizingly beautiful, terrifyingly powerful, and succumb easily to clever flattery and ego-stroking.

They're the best dragons in fiction. Every other dragon is worse for not being one of these. That's just facts.

Obviously, this would change EVERYTHING. Humans would no longer be the dominant species, able to tear through nature at a whim. Dragons choose humans to bestow gifts of magic and long life onto. Nature would once again humble humanity.

However, dragons as they used to be aren't good enough. They must change as well.

Dragons were similar to someone who's been Forged; only thinking of themselves, unwilling to lend aid to most humans and even other dragons. They literally eat the weak, absorbing their memories into themselves as well. (Memory plays a MASSIVE role in this series but I'll touch on that more later).

Throughout the Rain Wilds Chronicles, these giant, acid-spitting cats with scales (that's what dragons are, let's be honest) it's obvious that these new dragons have been born weak, unable to survive without aid from human handlers and each other. The absolute pettiness that these dragons sling at each other and their handlers is delicious, wounded pride and arrogance turning them into high school mean girls.

They dig at each other's looks, abilities, how their humans look, it's hilariously sad to see these majestic creatures reduced so low.

But near the end of the series, one of the dragons is wounded and dying in the wilds. Another finds her and she fully expects that he's waiting for her to die so he can eat her. She's all but accepted her fate until the other dragon leaves, finds a suitably meaty animal, and plops it down in front of her. He tells her to eat and he'll show her the way to safety.

The dragons learned altruism.

It's a small moment, one that doesn't get a ton of attention in the wider scheme of the books but it is SO IMPORTANT. It's a pebble that's going to be the beginning of a rockslide, altering the entire landscape of the world.

And the first stop is Chalced. Remember, misogynistic warmongering slave traders? Yeah, an entire flock of dragons flies over the royal palace and MELTS IT WITH ACID. Armor does not protect you. It will melt through brick and mortar almost instantaneously. It is painful. And it is cleansing.

Don't mistake me, not everyone in Chalced is evil and deserves to, y'know, melt. In fact, there's a reform movement being led by the women of Chalced and they are BADASS. But as an organized nation founded on such horrific practices, it cannot continue. Chalced's is a cycle that must end and never return.

In the bubbling rancid ruins of the palace, something new, something kinder can be built. Just as the dragons learned altruism, so too do they destroy an institution of cruelty.

God, this series is so damn cool.

Of course, our boy Fitz tries to change at many points in the series as well.

But change isn't always a good thing.

***ACCEPTANCE***

In the Farseer Trilogy, when Fitz was but a young lad being stabbed, ostracized, and beaten to death, he placed some of his more difficult memories and feelings into a magical stone. He was trying to make a dragon. Look, it makes sense if you read it, ok?

Anyway, he thought his life was going to be easier if he rejected his trauma. On the surface of it, that makes sense. Anyone who's gone through something horrible would love to never have to think about it ever again. It's a common defense mechanism and sometimes it works. However, after Fitz rejects those memories, life holds much less for him than it once did. It isn't until over 15 years later when he takes those memories back that he realizes just how little of life he was actually seeing. Because in rejecting those awful memories, he rejected what he learned from them as well, the emotions he felt.

The lesson isn't about letting your tragedy and pain define you but accepting that it happened. It is a part of us and as entwined in our being as all of the happiest moments we'll experience. They don't define us but they do contribute to our shape.

Reject them and become like Captain Kennit.

Kennit might be the top contender for 100% worst childhood in this series. I'm not going to get into everything this guy went through but DEAR GOD, he is broken. When we first meet him, he is a paranoid psychopath. He cannot believe anyone would help him or someone else for a selfless reason. Any praise or credit he receives is met with suspicion and sometimes violence. He keeps his MOTHER on an uncharted island BY HERSELF with her TONGUE cut out because he doesn't like what he remembers about her!

Kennit does so many terrible things and it's all brought on by what he experienced as a child. It would have screwed anyone up, but he made it so much worse. He took a page from Fitz's book and poured all of his trauma out, numbing himself of those emotions. Near the end of the Liveship Traders, he repeats what happened to him onto one of our main characters without a hint of remorse. It's one of the hardest scenes to read about but a mile.

What I love about this series and Robin's understanding of pain is that this is treated the same as pouring his trauma out to the memory stones, with even more destructive results. The person Kennit abused now has the same hurt Kennit carries but rejects inside of them. Later, this character is offered to have the pain taken away. They initially decline, saying that she won't give up a part of herself. But the person making the offer replies that while those memories are hers and that they will be with her forever, that pain wasn't hers to bear. It doesn't really belong to her.

It was something Kennit was trying to push onto someone else.

UUUUGGGHHHHHHH, I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH.

This entire series is an exploration trauma, of the lasting consequences of the hurt we carry and pass on to each other. And one of the primary ways we can heal and put the world on a better path lies in acceptance. Not just accepting our own pain but in accepting those who are different.

The *Wit* can be an allegory for a myriad of different people but is a fantastic stand-in for the LGBTQ+ community. Innocent people persecuted through violence, misunderstanding, and fear for something about themselves they cannot control.

The tattooed former slaves in the Liveship Traders face discrimination because of prejudices others have about their past.

The people of the Rain Wilds have mutations that render them unpleasant to most outsiders who look upon them.

The character Thick is neurodivergent, opening him up to abuse, ridicule, and torment from most common people.

Eventually, the series gives more typical LGBTQ+ people direct representation, giving them a primary role in creating a more open and welcoming society.

The Fool can only ever open up and truly be himself to Fitz and a few others and that feeling is reciprocated.

By the end of Fitz's life, he and the Fool have fundamentally shifted the world towards kindness, altruism, understanding, and acceptance.

And goddamn it, isn't that beautiful?

***The Mother Doesn't Have a Name***

Because I'm a pretentious dick, I titled this post almost identically to my harsher post about Sarah J Maas. Luckily for me, Fitz's mother actually doesn't have a name so it actually works. But where I accuse Sarah of being lazy in not giving Feyre's father a name, Robin is being thoughtfully cruel in her omission.

Fitz is separated from his mother at an early age, around 6. Even though he should be old enough to remember her, he can never recall more than some fleeting feelings or dreams. There are some theories about these gaps in his memory but the result is the same; there is part of himself that he's missing.

Her absence has meaning, a fundamental effect on his upbringing and his outlook. Like his painful memories, those with his mother helped shape him and now he is incomplete. Just because he has no trauma to carry doesn't mean that he isn't worse off.

Absence is it's own kind of pain.

***CONCLUSION***

The Realm of the Elderlings is massive, totaling 16 full books as well as a collection of short stories. It isn't always a pleasant read and because of that some of the happiest moments will make you cry like a blubbering mess. Characters are going to frustrate you, they'll make you cheer, and cry, and scream, and look, you'll get dragged through the emotional gauntlet.

And you'll be thankful for every second.

But I promise, at the end of every hardship, you'll feel more alive and fulfilled than ever. Robin Hobb is thoughtful in her cruelty, generous in her insights, and lovely in her kindness.

I have no doubt this post will get far less attention than my previous one. This is an overly long rambling gush that isn't nearly as entertaining as screaming about how much I hated a fictional world of horny yet insufferably boring Fae. But I hope it either resonates with those who have already enjoyed Robin's work or gets some curious to try it out for themselves.

I would love to hear about a series that made you feel more complete as a person after reading it. Something that made you feel like you could understand life's full, true beauty, even when it broke your heart. I don't care what author or what series or even if it was Sarah J Mass. As long as it enriched your soul, I want to hear about it.

Thanks for putting up with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/156q7gd/the_mother_doesnt_have_a_name_the_thoughtful/,2023-07-22 17:35:30,124,344,books
13adgn3,The Gloom Between Stars by Piper CJ Rant Review,"Accidentally deleted the original post, so here it is again. 

\--

So, we start where TSAIS left off; yet again, there is little to no recapping. Nox & Co. are chasing after Amaris, who has been kidnapped by Nox’s father, King Ceres. Ceres believes that Amaris was born to be his tool to start a war with Queen Moirai since she’s the one who cast the illusion spell over his people and is the reason he lost his wife and child. The writing with this is incredibly convoluted because, in book one, we’re told that Ceres believed he had a son, then in book two, we’re told that Daphne(Nox’s mother and Ceres’ lover) had switched out her daughter for a son with her <I>husband’s</I> complexion. The husband is <I>not</I> King Ceres, so why did the Raascot fae ever suspect that Daphne’s alleged ‘son’ was Ceres’? She spread the rumor that the boy was her nameless husband’s in an attempt to hide the truth from him, but he found out anyway and killed the boy and beat Daphne to death.  So, somehow, this nameless husband has vanished after murdering both the princess and her son, and yet nobody seems to be aware of this? We never learn what happened to this guy, and Queen Moirai has literally been acting as if there is a Crown Prince, but it’s an illusion. So who is the Crown Prince that she’s conjuring? Is it the nameless husband? Is it the child who’s really dead? This is why Piper needed a developmental editor because none of this makes sense. 

As Nox and her companions follow after Ceres and Amaris, Nox is fuming, hating everyone, and blaming them all for what happened to Amaris. To help, Malik leads her into the woods and goes down on her.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  This is the first chapter. As this is happening, Nox thinks longingly of the days she was a sex slave and used to suck men's souls out through their dicks. Nox admits to preferring women, but Malik is the exception—and again, as I stated in my last review, this was so poorly done. Nox has been depicted as someone who is repulsed by the touch of men and has been desperate to escape them so that she can be with Amaris, yet Malik does the bare minimum, and she is all for him. It doesn’t make sense. He didn’t do anything to earn her trust; he just was there. There are no meaningful conversations between them to give us the inclination that they might have feelings for each other. It’s just horniness and sensory details. After this, they try and figure out the fastest way to reach the army—why this didn’t happen in the first chapter instead of Nox getting head, I don’t know. But anyway, Yazlyn and Nox bicker, preparing us for their inevitable enemies-to-lovers arc. Honestly, a lot of this reads like Piper didn’t know wtf to write, so she jumped ahead and never came back to fix any of it. Honestly, that’s what the whole book reads like. 

Eventually, they catch up to the army, and they’re attacked by mud demons, but nobody ever does <I>anything</I> useful to defeat them. Gadriel fucks off to go try, and reason with Ceres, who refuses to listen to reason—which, I get, but the way it’s written is just <I>so</I> absurd.  They’re fist-fighting and sword-fighting while Ceres’ people are being massacred around them. The others realize that the demons are blind and have super hearing and start <I>shouting</I> to one another that they should be quiet(LMFAO, idiots) and are like, “Sound is our enemy!”. Can anyone think of who might be incredibly useful in this type of fight? I can. Fucking Amaris. Who has a sonic boom power. Gadriel never once considers finding her and having her use her abilities to help defeat these monsters. Not a single person ever considers using sound to their advantage, and these are supposed to be people who are trained in tactics and monster hunting. Yet none of them can come up with a plan to fight the demons. Like, wtf? I think Piper wrote herself into a corner with the whole ‘demons can’t be killed’ thing because we get scenes like this, with people fapping around, looking like absolute morons. There are five pages of Nox freaking out as she tries to cross a river because she’s a demon who can’t cross running water. 

At some point, Malik finds a fae who can apparently control the demons. Again, the magic in this series has absolutely no rhyme or reason. The fae have no designated powers; the only thing we know is that the Raascot fae have powers associated with nightlife. And so far, that has been shadow magic, sucking souls out through sex, night vision, can get your neck broken and not die, can warm your body, can fly, etc. (what do any of those have to do with the other?) Why is Yazlyn so much weaker than her fae comrades? She does the same sort of exercise, does she not? Obviously, she has a different build than them, but there’s no reason why Yazlyn can’t be buff af too. Anyway, Malik stops the fae who was controlling the demons, Amaris got burned and is in a ditch somewhere, Nox finds Gadriel with her dad and is like, oh hello, father, and then he finally realizes that Gadriel was right all along, and instead of, idk, trying to make amends, or maybe help his kingdom he just is like ‘omg I fucked everything up here, take my kingdom!’ And kills himself. This was the clumsiest handling of suicide I have ever read. Not only does Piper give us a tw for ‘consensual breathplay’ (again, it was not actually consensual), but she <I>doesn’t</I> give a tw for suicide. Now, while I don’t believe that every book requires tw, I do understand why they’re there and considering Piper set a standard for including them in book 2, they should be included throughout the entire series. But again, doing the actual work is too hard for Piper, apparently. 

So, Nox’s father kills himself for shock value and as a lazy way to thrust her onto the throne. They call his death a sacrifice, making it into something noble and historic when it’s not that at all. The way suicide is handled in this is just beyond insensitive, and once again, WHERE ARE THE SENSITIVITY READERS, PIPER? 

After this little battle, we return to the Raascot castle. For the next three hundred pages, <I>nothing happens.</I> They hang out in the castle, they train, they talk, and they have poorly written sex. Nothing of substance happens whatsoever. I’ll tell you what does happen. Nox and Amaris reunite for the third time, and instead of being separated by physical circumstances, they have a really stupid fight. Nox, obviously, is traumatized after witnessing her father’s suicide, but Amaris, once again, is thinking all about her horniness and starts trying to make a move on Nox. Nox is like, uh no, wtf stop and Amaris, as usual, can’t handle rejection. They haven’t had a single conversation about what happened during their separation, they have only ever made out during their reunions, and now that they actually have the time and safety to have this discussion, Amaris is more interested in losing her virginity. Nox drops the bomb on Amaris that she is really the manifestation of prayer, and Amaris’ reaction is, WOW, HOW CRUEL ARE YOU TO SAY SUCH THINGS, NOX? Now knowing that Amaris was created solely for Nox, Nox is questioning if their feelings are real. And here is how Amaris chooses to respond. 

*<i>”You feel confused? You, who has been such a constant in my entire life, even when I’ve had crushes on boys or liked men and spent years questioning what this relationship meant to me, only to finally accept that you are my exception. I love you, Nox. You’re the only woman I’ll ever want. Meanwhile, if the kingdom’s rumors are to be believed, you’ve been off fucking anyone and everything………..You’ve spent your whole life knowing the goddess made your heart for women, haven’t you? That wasn’t me, Nox. Do you know how confusing it’s been for me? I grew up liking boys! I like men. I do. I like fighting with them, I like training with them, I like wrestling and flirting and spending time with them. I’ve tried and failed on more than one occasion to create something with a man. And here you’ve been, destroying my feelings and twisting my head for years. You’ve had years to experience the world, you’ve let goddess knows who into your bed—but you were it for me. I thought that made this special, Nox. Finally, after all this time, I want the same thing you’ve always wanted. But the instant it was my choice in return, you turn me away. Do you know how fucked up that is?… We’ve had our whole lives to adjust! We’ve had two decades of time! Meanwhile, I still can’t get rid of my goddess damned maidenhood while you—”</I>*

SO basically, Amaris is a fucking hypocrite. She called Nox a whore, and Amaris wants to lose her maidenhead REAL BAD. “You’ve had years to experience the world” She was locked up in a brothel as a sex slave, Amaris, while you fucked off with the reevers and learned to fight. Are you really that mad that your brothers-in-arms didn’t want to fuck you? Also, confirmation that Nox is a lesbian with an exception for only one man. And Amaris is straight, with an exception for only one woman. That’s not bisexuality, Piper. “You were it for me” You…. literally tried to fuck Gadriel. And Ash. You lying sack of shit. The way Amaris is mad for being rejected and not at all concerned about Nox, who just watched her father die in front of her, learned she was heir to both kingdoms and is now a queen to a kingdom she has no business or knowledge of how to run. Nox deserves far better than Amaris, and I hope this series ends with her(Amaris') death. Because that’s the only way I’ll be satisfied. 

After this fight, they decide they can’t be together until Amaris breaks the curse, and they can find out if their love is real. In the meantime, Nox assaults Yazlyn by shoving her forearm against her throat and <I>then</I> asks if she wants to fuck. The sex scenes are described uncomfortably, where the line of consent is incredibly fuzzy. But this is not the first time Piper has had issues with consent in her books, so I shouldn’t be surprised. Also, the written sex is <I>gross</I> It’s written as if the author has never actually been intimate with a woman because I can promise you it is not a bunch of  “puddles and wetness and soaked sheets”. You’re not just squirting the whole time. I don’t think Piper has any concept of how to actually write spice because all these are a bunch of flowery metaphors. And then, of course, Amaris and Gadriel are still doing their choking/finger bang sessions because her power is tied to her sense of arousal. WTF? There’s also that last scene with Malik and Nox that will haunt me til the end of my days. ‘The complementary cream that frosted his muscles.” Are you fucking KIDDING?

The fae that Malik caught turns out to be an extremist who thinks the world needs to be purified of all fae creatures with human blood. She doesn’t mind humans as long as they don’t dally with the fae. She calls Ash a mongrel and calls Nox ‘it’. Kinda like how the author calls Nox ‘it’ in her first book title. “The Night and <I>its</I> Moon.” Now, this nazi fae is from Sulgrave, which has been depicted as East Asia…(wow, Piper) (also, how is Gadriel South Asian if his parents are from Sulgrave?) They literally end up treating this racist like a little pet. They give her a special room, give her books when she’s good, call her lovely and adorable and then give her some ‘exposure therapy’ by forcing her to hang out with Ash, who is both half-fae and white. And then….they fall in love. And it makes no sense at all as to why. All we know about Tanith is that she’s a racist zealot, and then she’s depicted as this little flower who needs to be rescued by Ash all the time. There’s a scene where Ash’s dad, Elil, goes apeshit and tries to kidnap the nazi because she’s an ‘enemy of the continent’, and Ash literally calls the statement deranged. Bro…he’s right.  Honestly, the fact that I’m siding with the person meant to be depicted as raving is wild to me. Because he is right that Tanith is a danger to them all, and they’re being absolute morons by treating her the way they do. If it were to come back and bite them in the ass, Elil would be completely justified in being like, ‘told ya so’. Like, Ash legit tells his dad the nazi’s life is worth more than his dad’s. By the end of this, they behave as if Tanith has overcome her racism by being with Ash, but there is no evidence of that anywhere in the text. Nox even expresses that she hopes that Ash can ‘turn her’ with his lovemaking skills. Like, oh, you can just stop being racist if you fuck the person you’re prejudiced against! Do you think she’s changed because she asked Ash to stay with her after he rescued her from his dad? That could literally be tactical. She simply learns to tolerate them and hide her prejudice. Both Nox & Ash even say that they doesn’t think Tanith has shown any distance for her radical beliefs, but it’s okay because now she’s their friend—she’s not evil, Ash loves her, he would die for her, but she’s still a zealot.… Nox takes Tanith shopping to buy her a fancy new cloak, and they let her play ‘paintball arrows’ with the rest of their group; Ash falls in love with her in .2 seconds after she says ‘I’m sorry’ for nothing in particular and then crawls into bed with him. He buys her basically a promise ring of her favorite gemstone. Wtf? There were like four POV chapters from Ash with Tanith, and nowhere was there any room for romantic development or even character development from Tanith. Nowhere was there any de-radicalization of her racism. It reads more like the author is telling us we should be sympathetic to racists because they don’t know any better, and we should just be kind to them and befriend them, and eventually, they will learn to tolerate the people they are prejudiced against. But, uh, no. That’s not at all what anyone should be doing. We are <I>told</I> that Ash hated Tanith and then grew to like, then love her but it is never shown on the page at all. Just suddenly, they’re in love and Tanith is still racist. 

Three hundred pages of dithering around until some action *finally* happens. Amaris, Malik, Yazlyn and Gadriel are sent out to kill Queen Moirai. Three hundred pages of reading about Amaris and Nox screwing other people and not having a single conversation discussing what the other has been through, but they make up anyway right before Amaris leaves to kill the Queen. I’m not entirely sure how anyone is meant to see an actual romantic relationship between these women when there is absolutely none present. The first book was a lot of longing on Nox’s part but none on Amaris’. The second book was more of the same, but Nox found a new beau who would eat her out, so she stopped thinking so much about Amaris. Now in book three, they barely think about one another. This is not the star-crossed bisexual romance I was promised. Anyway, they’re sent to Farleigh to ensure that the convenient manufactured items they were given will block the curse, only to find out that Agnes, the Gray Matron is a racist. She calls Gadriel and Yazlyn demons and seems more disgusted by their wings than anything. This is funny, imo because not only was Nox described as having bronze skin(but then later told she looks like her mother, who was white), so why wasn’t she treated with the same disrespect? She is clearly not a white person from Farehold, I’m pretty sure that Agnes was there when Nox was named, so she’s well aware that her name was Nox so she wouldn’t forget the night. So why the fuck is she suddenly racist towards the Raascot fae? Why did she suddenly seem to forget why Nox was named Nox and who Nox actually was? Because there’s no way she didn’t know. It doesn’t make any logical sense that she wouldn’t. Also, Amaris can call Gadriel ‘demon' and get away with it, but when Agnes does it, it’s racist…. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  Come on, Piper. 

Amaris has mastered her persuasion ability off-page, apparently, because now she’s persuading everyone without issue. To get into the castle, they decide to have Malik drive, and Amaris sits in the back with Gadriel and Yazlyn and then rips off Star Wars by pulling a ‘these are not the droids you’re looking for’ moment. On the carriage ride, Gadriel tells Amaris she’s the most amazing person to exist. ‘You are the most beautiful creature on this earth. You are the most talented assassin I’ve ever met. You are brave, you’re intelligent, you are quick on your feet, and you are incredibly capable.” I can provide text evidence to refute every one of those points. Amaris is an idiot and a coward. She literally goes into the castle with no plan at all. And spends the entire chapter explaining what everyone else is going to do. Like, ma’am, please stop.

Gadriel also says no other man is allowed to touch her, but apparently, it’s fine if Nox does it. Honestly, I fucking hate men like that.

The last sixty pages were the most exciting part of this book. Moiroi has invited all the nobles to her castle to lure Raascot’s sneaky task force to Aubade so that she can send all her forces to Gwydir. While Amaris & co. are trying to infiltrate Aubade, Nox & co. are being attacked by Farehold soldiers led by The Hand & The Hammer. The Hand is none other than Millicent, the brothel owner with the slithery reptile death hand, so she’s named after her disability…nice. The Hammer is some random buff dude with a spiked mace. Nox faces off against Millicent who tells her she killed Emily with no prompt whatsoever—honestly, I forgot about Emily because so did Nox. Nox throws Chandra and even though she’s sucked at it this whole time, she manages to hit her target and cut off Millicent’s death hand and then that’s done. Ash lets Tanith out of her binds(because even though she’s still a racist zealot, she’s not evil apparently, and Ash would die for her), and she incinerates a bunch of soldiers and Ash’s dad(even though Ash’s eyes were closed during this scene he somehow sees everything that happened, huh.) 

Meanwhile, Amaris has been spending time trying not to repeat her past mistakes by whispering to every guard in Aubade to stand down if any fighting happens, but this ends up backfiring beautifully when an army of ghouls shows up to kill everyone. I thought this part of the book was very clever, but once again, it’s overwritten, and the reader’s hand is held throughout the entire thing. While Amaris chases after Moiroi, she’s unable to harm her because she has a ward protecting her. Instead of having Amaris figure out herself that the ward is her crown, Yazlyn literally shouts the answer to her while Moiroi stands there listening and gaping like, ’oh no! They’ve discovered my plan!’ Amaris then stands there for another few minutes debating on how to remove the crown from her head when she could literally throw a dagger and knock it off. But apparently, the All-Mother gave her the gift of shock wave specifically to knock the crown off her head. What? There are several more pages of Amaris agonizing over how to knock off the crown/summon her shock wave without being horny, and then Moiroi calls Amaris a witch, but isn’t she also a witch?

Oh my god, so we finally get the answer about the illusion of the Crown Prince. Moiroi has been creating an illusion of the boy she thought was her grandson this whole time to keep the people together. Idk that seems a bit ridiculous, imo. Did she not care about her daughter disappearing/dying? What happened to the husband who killed them both because Moiroi allegedly knows about him? That’s what I want to know. We also learn that Daphne was pregnant before Moiroi cursed Raascot, so how long after the curse was she married off? How far along in the pregnancy was she when Moiroi cast the curse? And how was it that Moiroi wasn’t present when Daphne gave birth? When royalty gives birth, it’s typically a whole affair with midwives and the lot, so how did no one but Agnes and the Temple Priestess know that she had a daughter? And also, considering Moiroi believed the grandson to be the nameless husband’s son, it also refutes the whole plot point in book one, where the Raascot fae were searching for King Ceres’ son.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  This is why you needed a developmental editor, Piper. Also, can I say that the dialogue in these books is absolutely atrocious? Nobody talks like this. At all. 

Why is everyone in this book gagging? Is it because they’re as disgusted by Piper’s writing as I am? This book should be the last one with Amaris lingering on the precipice of death, and then she should stay dead. The End. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13adgn3/the_gloom_between_stars_by_piper_cj_rant_review/,2023-05-07 05:02:41,3,8,books

I’m a little late to the party but so glad I picked up the whole box set of these books. Tithe was probably my most reread book when it first came out and reading this series is bringing back a wave of nostalgia.


I just finished the second book and yes the ending made me glad I didn’t start reading these until the whole series was out.

But can we talk about how Jude is 1000% watching Yuri on ice in the epilogue? “watching the cartoon skater fail to land jumps and fall in helpless and probably unrequited love with his coach.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/swn243/holly_blacks_the_wicked_king/,2022-02-19 23:34:26,6,20,books
axcxwt,The joys and dreads of stay-up-all-night books,"I’m reading a new series for the first time, and it’s one of those books you can’t put down. The best and worst part about it is that I can’t get it out of my head. I’m consumed by the story, but, I don’t know, part of reading it so fast means I lose the story. I want to finish the first book to get to the second and third (and the novella); but I don’t want to put down the book or the story so fast.

p2kq34,"R. Scott Bakker's ""The Darkness That Comes Before"" is one of my favorite books ever.","I don't know how many here have read it, so I might just be speaking into void, but by golly is it good. The review that sold me on it basically described it as ""Nietzsche meets Tolkien"" which was absolutely weird enough for me to give it a go. 

The first read-through I was overwhelmed by how *brutal* it was. Not it's combat (of which there's actually very little), but it's plain honesty about why people do the things they do, from the high to the low, the kind to the cruel, benevolent or monstrous. Which is kind of the point of the novel, the ""Nietzsche"" part. 

Some truly nasty things happen in the book, or are implied, which can be worse in a way.

I put it down and didn't touch it again for a year, but always it's lingered in the back of my mind. The ideas within are compelling. 

So I picked it up again recently on a whim and the Tolkien part shined through this time. The worldbuilding is immense, unapologetically so, and I could appreciate it's grandeur better on the second reading, and I'm now primed and ready to read the rest of the series. 

The problem is that I want to recommend it to others, but there's one thing in particular that holds me back. The treatment of women in the book is absolutely brutal. 

I wondered whether this was something worming into the text from the author's heart, but I think, on the second pass, it is simply the world he created. A medieval world just barely crawling out of ancient past, bloody and battered. Patriarchal society, with all the brutality implied. The two female characters given ample screentime are well-written, struggling with their inner turmoil (like everyone else) with little help from the world they inhabit. 

Gross things happen to them! They *do* gross things! 

But every damn character in that book is a facet of the larger point embodied by the man who seems both a protagonist and a villain. Everyone, *everyone*, is tossed in the currents of what everyone around them thinks of them. Their very psyches wrestle with the fact. The Schoolman is a tottering fool. The prostitute and the concubine are worthless harlots. The barbarian  is rejected by his warlike people no mattet how great his fighting prowess. Even the Emperor and his court are unsure of their positions, their ploys, their power. 

I'm rambling now. The point is there's a lot to love and think about here, if one can get past some of the more brutal language and themes. Not to mention that the prose itself is gripping, if sometimes heavy on exposition. Would you all recommend the book to others? How would you go about it? 

TLDR: The book is awesome but full of misogyny among other brutal things. Worth recommending? How to do so?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p2kq34/r_scott_bakkers_the_darkness_that_comes_before_is/,2021-08-11 19:54:40,33,31,books
1szxku,On The Grapes of Wrath - A personal view [Potential Spoilers],"Today I finished The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, it was the 101st book I've read this year, although that doesn't mean anything to anybody else. I feel, something, I'm not sure what. There's a place in my sternum which doesn't quite feel whole. Steinbeck has ripped something away from me and not given anything back.

There is something about the book which resonates with me. I'm young, I've never been through such a struggle. I've never been worried about what to eat or where my life is going in any general direction. I've never seen my hopes are dreams dashed over and over again. Taken up and smashed against the wall by the cruel heartlessness of life.

The book isn't subtle and that is to its credit. It forces you to confront opinions you may hold about yourself. It is a devastating critique of some forms of capitalism, not along economic or efficiency grounds but upon a call to the better part of human nature. Are we willing to let others starve to make more money? To kill them? To smash a skull in with a pick axe handle just because a man is angry he can't feed his family?

This isn't a review, a review mentions pros and cons, assesses the authors style and serves as a critique.

This, is a personal note I wanted to share. The Grapes of Wrath changed something in me. I've read many books this year which have resonated with me. But they have all resonated in a positive manner. The sheer humanism of Seneca's Letters from a Stoic touched me and helped me accept my part in life. But The Grapes of Wrath instead made me angry, made me despair for the human condition as nothing has really changed since it was written.

I would love to hear others experiences. I'm still in shock and having trouble digesting it.
