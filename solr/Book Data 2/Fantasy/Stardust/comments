133gbih,"He‚Äôs absolutely one of my favourites. His world building and ideas are incredible. He has the ability to take something mundane and infuse it with magic somehow that I don‚Äôt find in many other authors. He sometimes says something that‚Äôs extremely scary or magical but says it in such a normal nonchalant way.

His only minor flaw is kind of flat main characters, but that might be part of the magic for the rest of the writing to work. 

Stardust made me feel nostalgic and still makes me feel like a much younger version of myself when I read it. Shades of Princess Bride.",DylanLars,2023-04-30 05:38:39
133gbih,"Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors and Stardust is the book of his I didn‚Äôt see coming. It just has a heart and warmth that, while similar to his other novels, struck a different chord for me. I adore it.",MidwesternTransplant,2023-04-30 10:22:47
133gbih,"I love this book. It's my favorite to recommend to people who don't read much. It's a great way to show someone how a book can be special. How you might need to mourn that you finished the book and no longer get to visit that world. 

I like Gaiman as an author a lot. He crafts a world that's easy to fall into. A couple years ago, I tackled American Gods. It's one of his most renowned books. I think that it's not as good as Stardust. The pacing of Stardust keeps you locked in, while American Gods is kind of sluggish throughout a much longer book. 

I saw this movie before I had ever read the book, the book is better, but I love the movie. Not only does it have a star-studded cast it gets the feel of this whirlwind adventure that the book creates. 

I also love everything to do with the airship in the movie. Robert de Niro really steals the show for a bit there. In my mind they are two friends' retelling of the same story, each embellished a little differently here and there. I enjoy both.",Yes-GoAway,2023-04-30 12:34:27

It blends mythology, history, religion, folklore, and its own lore in a incredible way.",selloboy,2023-04-30 13:11:03

133gbih,"Neil is always involved in the writing and re-depiction of anything he has created. He doesn't tend to just sell his intellectual property to the highest bidder. It took two decades to get Good Omens made because he (and Terry) didn't want it ruined by cheap production. Same deal with Sandman.

MTV: And you became a producer.

Gaiman: Also by accident. What I did with Matthew was this thing you must never do. Don't do this; it is very, very wrong: I gave him the option for nothing. I phoned him up and said, ""OK, 'Stardust' is yours."" I really trusted him, and you don't run into that very often. He offered me the script, but I said, ""No, I wrote the novel, but this is your film, your vision. But I will help you."" The first thing I did was find him a writer, Jane Goldman, who hadn't written a script before but I loved her novels, I loved her journalism, and she got the book. I was involved with the casting and set locations too.",disusedhospital,2023-04-30 13:03:53

bxviyn,"This highlights a critical element when converting books into movies.  Many books have a very distinct ""feel"" to them, with Stardust (and His Dark Materials) being very prominent examples.

Stardust (the movie) manages to beautifully capture the FEELING of the book, you get that same sense of beauty and wonder and magic that springs forth, so adhering directly to the storyline isn't required.

In contrast, The Golden Compass (the movie) can SO CLOSE to capturing the book, but didn't quite make it, so some of that feeling is lost in the movie, making it fall a little flat.",deranjer,2019-06-07 18:24:15
bxviyn,"I had this fun conversation with a cab driver related to the book and the movie. When I stepped in slightly tipsy, ""Rule the world"" by Take That was playing on the radio. I hummed along until the cabbie said that he'd give me a free ride if I was able to answer five questions he asked related to the song if not for which I had to pay double.

I had no choice but to acquiesce, given the inveterate love I have for all things trivia.

Cabbie: I'll start with an easy one. Which movie is the song from?

Me: It's technically \*not\* from the movie but part of its original soundtrack. Stardust.

C: Can you name three people that star in it?

M: Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes and Mark Strong

C: You missed someone who I'd relate the most to.

M: Oh yes, Robert De Niro!

He stopped his questions after that and asked me to pay the full fare.",,2019-06-07 20:54:00
bxviyn,"I completely agree with you. I think as book readers we can get caught up in the idea of wanting the film to be word for word faithful to the book but that doesn't always make the best film. *Stardust* tells the story slightly differently, but it is still the same story and the fairytale aspect that makes the book so great is maintained.

Completely different genre, but *The Girl With All the Gifts* is another book to screen adaptation that I think made just the right changes. I think it helped that Mike Carey wrote the screenplay so knew exactly what it is that made the book what it is and was able to transfer that to the film.",satanspanties,2019-06-07 15:17:04

I'll say this about Mr. Gaiman, I'm not sure where this subreddit falls on audio books but I love listening to them when I go running and Neil Gaiman reads a lot of his own works. They are simply fantastic. He does such a wonderful job. I just finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane and I loved it.",icepickjones,2019-06-07 21:10:38

bxviyn,"For me, it's Devil in a Blue Dress. The book and movie are both good, but the movie streamlines the plot in a way that makes it a little tighter and more focused, and makes changes to the third act and climax that make for a more dramatic, and I'd argue satisfying conclusion, though it still manages to stay faithful to the overall tone and events of the book. Plus it has the main character (whose supposed to be solving a mystery), find certain things out on his own, rather than stumble on to them. The book is still well-written and well plotted, but the movie is just a little better. I appreciate both though.

A notable difference is that Easy and Mouse seem to be on friendlier terms in the movie. In the books, Mouse is a violent psychopath just looking for an excuse to kill someone, and Easy always seems afraid of him (with good reason). In the films, Mouse is still a violent, unpredictable murderer, but he's more charming and likable (which may in part be because he's played by Don Cheadle), and he and Easy seem to have a genuine friendship.

As far as Stardust goes, I actually like the movie better than the book. Especially since it's got Captain Shakespeare. And Michelle Pfieffer. Plus, it's just more fun. The book is a bit more solemn and atmospheric, whereas the film is more about the adventure.

DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS SPOILERS

Also, in the film, Easy and Joppy aren't as friendly towards each other, and Easy actually gets to confront Joppy over the death of Coretta. In the book, Easy finds out, but he doesn't see him again until the climax where he's killed in the shootout.",Redditer51,2019-06-07 19:59:52

Like _The_ _Princess_ _Bride,_ the author of the book, Peter S. Beagle, also wrote the screenplay for the movie. As such, both versions are imbued with something wondrous, yet dark, a rare feeling of true magic. If you enjoyed _Stardust,_ I think you'd like it.",SponJ2000,2019-06-08 12:26:53

I discovered Neil Gaiman maybe 4 years ago, and went through a phase of reading a lot of his books in quick succession.

There are levels of suspension of disbelief that reach a ridiculous point, but the story itself is so charming that you don't really care that you need to make them.  Everything gets explained away by: ""There's this magical pocket dimension beyond the wall"" and it's just wonderful.

When the movie came out, I enjoyed it too despite the differences. Most book to movie adaptations irritate me when they do unnecessary changes, but the changes they did on this movie were quite good. I loved DeNiro and his portrayal of the Captain. 

It‚Äôs this movie that made me just watch and enjoy movies as different entities to their book versions. Some things just work better a certain way when done in film, and other things just would not be as funny on screen.",MorpheusTheEndless,2019-06-08 04:47:08
bxviyn,"I often have a better experience with films based on books when I haven‚Äôt read the book first. I have no expectations for the film to live up to what I‚Äôve already imagined and can appreciate it firstly as a self-contained story, then the book adds the details. However, it can ruin the twist element of a book, and casting/character descriptions don‚Äôt always match up. But yes, I think it‚Äôs important to understand they‚Äôre two different mediums with their own pros and cons. I just hate when the movie which is meant to be based off a book tells a completely different story (eg - my sisters keeper).

Also, you keep mentioning quicker/it was too slow and I fail to understand why you believe a TV show must be fast paced.

The narrator could have made some quips and what not to add more humor, but that wasn't what they wanted from the narration.  Also, the idea that it is god narrating while they're all wondering what her plan is always sits in the back of your mind while watching and makes you chuckle.

I don't know, I'm definitely biased as so view worka stick close to the source material and usually suffer for it that I really enjoyed this show excelling and sticking to it.

I think perhaps the movie was a little more innocent and family-friendly, and the acting throughout was superb. I think perhaps Gaiman‚Äôs prose doesn‚Äôt fit my tastes either, which is a shame as I constantly hear good things about him and his works. I‚Äôm glad to have experienced at least one of his stories in an enjoyable medium.",RobTheWriter64,2020-09-11 16:35:00
iqo2zo,"I‚Äôve enjoyed his writing sooo much. I also find that while he has his own style, his books are all very enjoyable on their own; each of them gives me the feels in a different way, if that makes sense.

I‚Äôd be extremely hard pressed to list a favourite, but I‚Äôd say The Ocean at the End of the Lane comes very close to that spot, and although nothing like Stardust thematically, it would be the next one I‚Äôd recommend to someone who enjoyed the later.",user_name_declined,2020-09-11 21:45:34
iqo2zo,Stardust is one of the very few films I absolutely LOVE! I only realised the film was based on a book yesterday and I was so excited to read it. This post is only intensifying my urge to buy this book immediately and lock myself in my room until I‚Äôve read it.,-unbelievable-,2020-09-12 16:08:44
iqo2zo,"I bought American Gods, Good Omens, and Stardust to get into Gaiman. Now I've finally got time to read them, I started with Stardust and it was so good. It was just a short, whimsical, fun book. Looking forward to reading Good Omens and American Gods next.",,2020-09-11 16:27:53
iqo2zo,"They're both excellent, but forewarning: American Gods is rather different. It has little of the whimsy or silliness of Stardust and Good Omens, and is fairly dark in tone. He also wrote it relatively early in his career, and if you've read his later works, it shows in the comparison. It's still an excellent book, and as steeped in magical realism as his other works.",crashlanding87,2020-09-12 00:55:06
iqo2zo,Are any of his other books similar in tone to Stardust?,,2020-09-12 00:58:58

Stardust is straight up my favorite book. If I won I don't think I could return it.",,2016-12-11 09:41:03
8voym7,"I grew up reading fantasy, but, overtime, began to shift more and more away from the genre. None of my favorite novels are fantasy nowadays; except Stardust.

Whenever I go back to the novel I gain.. hope. That may sound dramatic, but it's what the novel does. It shoves you into this very adult world, but one filled with wonder and dreams and magic. It's a fairy tail for adults. I'm glad you enjoyed my favorite novel of all time.",l3radrocks,2018-07-03 05:08:11
8voym7,I also recommendGood Omens cowritten with Terry Pratchet. American Gods is also good. The movie Stardust was fun too.,Stormystorm97,2018-07-03 03:35:09
8voym7,"I love Neil Gaiman, and Stardust especially! The Fairy Market is the stuff of my dreamscapes, I'd love to magick myself right into Wall/Stormhold. Yvaine & Tristran are such a beautiful couple üëë‚òÑ, I was also *quite* relieved he didn't end up with Victoria.

In addition to American Gods and Good Omens (u/Stormystorm97 knows what's up), I'd also recommend The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which is more in the same vein as Stardust. Also, the film adaption is one of my favourites ever! Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Robert de Niro play out the story so stunningly. ‚ô°",yonic_south,2018-07-03 03:58:43

2gxely,"This is one of those few books where I actually preferred the film. I know some of the themes are different and the dramatic showdown ending wasn't really what Gaiman was going for, but the film just feels overall better paced than the book. Gaiman has wonderful ideas and writes excellent beginnings and great middles, but his endings don't often match up to them; they feel a bit rushed, like a new idea had come to him and he just wanted to stop writing and move on to the next thing. Not bad, but not up to the standard of the rest of the story. *Stardust* felt about four pages shorter than it should've been.

I did like the book though, it really did feel like a fairy story. Did you read the text-only version or did yours have all the gorgeous illustrations?",satanspanties,2014-09-20 08:00:20
21hdo7,"If you didn't like the ending to the book don't watch the movie, they made it 100 times cheesier. 

Personally I liked the ending, it fit the whole fairy tale feel that he had going throughout the story.  a friend of mine had the same problem you did, she basically was expecting ""something darker"" because it was Neil Gaiman Stardust isn't a typical Gaiman book, it is lighter and happier than most of his others.

rybgx,"I am crossposting this to books because I would love to hear the opinion of those that have read Stardust the book, and perhaps Princess Bride, as well. 

I still plan on reading the book, as a cursory glance at some of the wikipedia synopsis of it tells me there is much more detail and plot within. ",Jackson3125,2012-04-07 20:59:35
rybgx,Princess Bride. I watched Stardust and plan on buying the book soon. ,Jackson3125,2012-04-08 04:29:30
2ktxax,"You should give Stardust a read... It's honestly like a fairy-tale for adults. The version I had was only 250 pages, and I read it in less than three days! It's a super fun, quick read, but it's still a fairly deep adventure into the land of Faerie. I'm almost sad that I read it so quickly, but impressed at how quickly and smoothly the story moves along.

Ditto on feeling lonely. I know the feels man. Books are awesome. I'm currently re-reading The Sandman again, such an awesome, awesome story! :D",n0ahhhhh,2014-10-31 01:52:00
