133gbih,Stardust by Gaiman,"I just finished reading this very lovely little book. I don't know what it is about Gaiman's writing, but something about it just resonates with me. It flows so beautifully, and reads a bit like a fairy tale. I also love the depictions/setting of England.

I loved how this fantasy incorporated elements involving fae, as I've been looking for a fantasy about faeries/fae for a while. It definitely helped introduce a sort of eerie/mysterious/mystical aura to the story. I would love to read a longer/more developed story about these ideas, but I think that this book made for a very low-stakes, nice, light read.

I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts about this book!

Editing to add something I was going to write but forgot to: something about this book reminds me a bit of the cartoon Over the Garden Wall. Not sure if anyone else feels similar but I just thought I'd mention that :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/133gbih/stardust_by_gaiman/,2023-04-30 05:03:32,165,1063,books
bxviyn,Stardust is one of the only book/movie combos I've experienced that I actually appreciated both for what they are.,"I saw the movie Stardust several years ago and really enjoyed it, and have since watched it a few times since then. After reading Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman, and realizing he also wrote Stardust (and realizing it was also a book) I decided to read it. Even though I already knew the story I loved the way Gaiman wrote Stardust, and was super interested in the nuances of his version of the story. Then reflecting on the movie (I watched it again immediately after finishing the book) I appreciated how the director changed the story to better suit a film format. My favorite addition was the Captain Shakespeare storyline, which I thought added a nice background for a character who didn't get much personality in the book. Just wanted to share my thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bxviyn/stardust_is_one_of_the_only_bookmovie_combos_ive/,2019-06-07 14:53:23,514,5699,books
146gdvu,"""Stardust"" by Neil Gaiman.","So for today I finished up one of Neil Gaiman's shorter novels, this being ""Stardust"".

Tristran Thorn embarks on a quest to find a fallen star to fulfill a promise that he made to the woman that he loves. But he is not the only one who is seeking the star.

There are other individuals who are also in search of the star for reasons that are entirely their own. And the star? Well, let's just say that the star might not be what, or who, it might really be.

It's no secret that Neil Gaiman is quite influenced of fantasy ranging from the traditional fairy tales and the writings of Lord Dunsany as well as poetry and the works of Shakespeare. ""Stardust"" is a wonderful modern fairy tale. But this not a fairy tale meant for children as it is quite adult oriented (as the fact that it won the Mythopoeic award for adult literature). Though it should be brought to mind that many fairy tales of the past has an adult element to them.

But still this is an enchanting and charming novel from a great author. Though it isn't too long (at least 233 pages long), it is still a beautiful read regardless. This book, for me, would certainly be considered as a classic of fantasy.

And there are many people who would agree with me on that notion. Just a beautifully written story! Really a charmer!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/146gdvu/stardust_by_neil_gaiman/,2023-06-11 00:59:58,28,180,books
iqo2zo,Stardust by Neil Gaiman changed me,"I have been a huge fan of Gaiman eversince picking up my first by him, [Neverwhere](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere). It is a remarkable book that took a day to read but stayed with me for a good while. 

I always have high hopes and expectations when starting a new novel by him. Have to admit, I first saw the movie but it didn't discourage me from reading Stardust.

I feel like Neil Gaiman himslef patted me on the shoulder for doing so. For me it started a little dull but the way the story unfolded and the whole thing was written kept me highly excited. 

As I was hoping, a magical world opened up with plenty of unique characters that have something to teach. I loved how fearless Tristran is, and while he is acting the way he is because he feels to be hopelessly in love, he is also a little curious what maybe over the ancient wall. 

There are so many adorable parts, I can barely mention only one. 

What I learned was to be open about my feelings, never be afraid to be the real you. I qm grateful for this book and thanks to a lost of fantastic [ romantic fantasy books](https://asianacircus.com/best-romantic-fantasy-books-to-read/) that inspired me to pick this novel up, I already have a plan for the next few weeks :)

I am thinking of reading Good Omens after I finsihed my TBR list in September.  I love both Gaiman and Pratchett, so I am sure it is going to be fun :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iqo2zo/stardust_by_neil_gaiman_changed_me/,2020-09-11 10:40:21,34,158,books

f3222d,Halfway through Stardust. A question about Tristran Thorn,"Is he the biggest idiot all time? Seriously the guy doesn’t seem to have two brains cells to rub together.

Gaiman is one of my favorite authors. I know he likes to play fast and loose with logic in his writing, and I know the faerie realm is supposed to be closer to dream than reality, but seriously wtf is up with this guy?

He just does what other people tell him without question. He promises to find his “love” a Star, but upon finding an actual person, is just like “oh well I guess I need to bring her this girl.”

Then at the end of chapter five when he takes off the chain and hands it to the star like “you gotta promise not to run away.” Like bruh...

Am I not interpreting his character correctly? I’ve only ever heard wonderful things about this book, and it is wonderfully written, but this kid is seriously frustrating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/f3222d/halfway_through_stardust_a_question_about/,2020-02-13 01:33:43,13,16,books
8voym7,Thoughts on Stardust by Neil Gaiman,"I admittedly just listened to the audiobook on a long drive, but I absolutely loved this story. I was hoping maybe other people might want to discuss it too!

It has been a very long time since I'd experienced a book that was hard to put down. I spent the better part of my weekend theorizing who I thought characters were and connecting dots, Hoping the whole time that Tristran wouldn't actually end up with Victoria. This book was so much fun that I also bought the novel even though I'd just listened to the audiobook. Are other Neil Gaiman books that engaging? American Gods has been on my list for a while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8voym7/thoughts_on_stardust_by_neil_gaiman/,2018-07-03 03:27:36,17,15,books
o5wg8n,Finished Pony club secrets Destiny and Stardust,This book was written by Stacy Gregg. It was 2 books in 1 with a sneak preview of her next book at the end. It was about 512 pages long butI thought it was a fairly quick read. It is a great book for animal lovers especially horse lovers. It is aimed at about 10 year olds but I still enjoyed it and I’m an adult. It had good story lines. I don’t know much about horses but as an animal lover I enjoyed this book.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o5wg8n/finished_pony_club_secrets_destiny_and_stardust/,2021-06-22 20:26:55,0,5,books

9bligx,"Rust & Stardust - no spoilers, just a review/overview","When I read the blurb about Rust & Stardust being an influential true crime story that urged Nabakov to complete Lolita, I figured I'd like it. I gave it a sample reading and was so hooked I actually purchased the digital version (usually I wait til the library loans it to me). This book just came out and it's a really good read. The books that come to mind to compare it to kind of give away the plot points, but it's basically a fictionalized account of a kidnapping - an 11 year old girl, Sally Horner, kidnapped by a convict, Frank. He keeps her for a long time and you really get in Sally's head and see what a little girl might think in that situation. More innocent than Room (Emma Donoughue [sp?]), more realistic than Where I Left Her (the other T. Greenwood book I devoured after this one) and  if you like reimagined true crime (is that a genre?) I think you'd like it. Has anyone else read it? The author spoke in Portland last night at Powell's with the author of Sold on a Monday, about a photograph of a mother selling 4 children. Both stories took place in 1948 and are dramatized fiction centered around a real story.

2gxely,Want to talk about Stardust? [spoliers],"I finished the book today. It was sweet and whimsical. I will admit that I watched the movie before I read the book. Actually watched the movie three times in one weekend.

The book is wonderful. I have a question about the book:

* Was Tristan on his quest to bring home the star for nine years? *(He left during the once-every-nine-year fair in the meadow just outside of Wall. When he got back, the the once-every-nine-year fair in the meadow just outside of Wall was being set up.)*

The movie is also wonderful. Perfect casting! I have a question about the movie:

* Do you think Tristan and Yvaine's sons carried on the family tradition of killing each other off until the last brother left alive gets to rule? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2gxely/want_to_talk_about_stardust_spoliers/,2014-09-20 05:00:21,6,9,books

2ktxax,I've been improving my reading habits lately. Just finished Neverwhere and Stardust by Neil Gaiman! Anyone else have a hard time getting back into reading?,"I love Neil Gaiman. I love his style, his creativity, his storytelling.. everything. The first Neil Gaiman thing I ever read was The Sandman series of graphic novels. Those books were insanely amazing!

Anyways, I just recently started reading again. I'm 26, and the last time I read a book for fun was probably... 8-9 years ago. I told myself recently to try and read a book every month. (I'm a slow reader, forgive me). Since August, I've read 4 novels, all of which are Neil Gaiman's works. I've taken that quote by John Waters (I think it was him)  “We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them.” to heart lately. I read a lot of comics, but I figured I should up my non-comic-book reading game.

It's been really difficult, coming home from work and knowing that you only have X number of hours to do stuff, including cook, clean, prepare for tomorrow, etc. and to choose to sit down and read a book. Part of me hated that, knowing that I was not physically accomplishing anything. But then that other part of me loved it because I can easily open a book and be transported to another world. Honestly, when I start reading a book, I sort of make it a habit to put it above everything else in my free time, i.e. I treat it like something that needs to get done rather than something I *want* to be doing. I'm trying to change that, but I mean, it's gotten me to read a lot, so I guess it's working?

So since August I've read American Gods, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, and I just finished Stardust (I actually read that one in 3 days! That's the quickest I've ever read anything, haha).

I just want to share my excitement that I'm getting back into reading, and to tell everyone to read The Sandman, and other stuff by Neil. And to share your stories on how you got back into reading.

Okay, sorry for the rant! :) Everyone go read! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ktxax/ive_been_improving_my_reading_habits_lately_just/,2014-10-30 23:12:42,5,8,books
