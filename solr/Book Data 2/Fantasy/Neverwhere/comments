if you enjoy bbc miniseries, the bbc miniseries of ”neverwhere” was awesome!

other recommendations that fit well with ”the ocean at the end of the lane”:

11ncmdx,"One of my favourite books. A lot of his other books are equal in world building or character building or taking you on a fantastical journey, but none of them, in my opinion, manage to blend all of those elements together quite as well.

If you are looking for other books that run along the same lines of a recognizable world above but then very different and fantastical underneath that the protagonist falls through the cracks and can now see, Kraken by China Mieville, and Midnight Nation (a graphic novel) by J.Michael Straczynski are both good reads.

Also, there are a couple audiobooks of Neverwhere, one of which is actually read by Neal Gaiman, and it's wonderful. I don't generally suggest audiobooks as they don't tend to click for me, but that one did.",No-Scarcity2379,2023-03-10 05:30:49
11ncmdx,"Neil Gaiman is hands-down one of my favorite authors. The first book of his I ever read was Neverwhere, swiftly followed by the Sandman series of graphic novels. They’re still my favorites of his work, but American Gods, Anansi Boys, and Good Omens (co-authored with Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame) are way up there for me too. He just has a way of immersing you in his worlds, and he has a dark, wry, sometimes silly humor in everything he does.

American Gods is another excellent one again with a similar “secret magic world” within the normal one, but with more manipulation and politicking between the characters. But another beautifully written book that I loved.",m_ttl_ng,2023-03-10 04:50:06

Depending how old your copy of Neverwhere is there may or may not have been a short story called *How the Marquis got his coat back* if you haven't read it I highly recommend it. Just a short story he wrote to go along with it.",Earthwick,2023-03-10 16:50:46
11ncmdx,"I bought it one afternoon.

Started reading it on the bus on the way home.

Kept reading it that evening. 

Finished it that night. 

It's just an incredibly fun read that brings you into a world that is endlessly fascinating. 

It really nails that sense of adventure and a sense of adventure you feel could exist in your own city of you spend any sort of time in an urbanised environment. 

The alley that you walk past every day without thinking about it. 

What if you decided to walk to the very end of it. At the end of it, you found an old battered and stained door. 

What if you opened it? What's behind that door?

Now in the real world, that probably wouldn't go well for you. 


The thrilling thing about Neverwhere is what it's suggests about any city: that there are things about it that you don't know, places you've never been, places that you can discover if you go off the beaten path.

And that's just pure adventure.",derpferd,2023-03-10 17:01:52

11ncmdx,"Neverwhere always struck me as a dream where you wake up right before the good part. Just when the dream world is starting to make sense in a longer form, and not just in short, arbitrary bursts, it's over.

That speaks to a deep truth of the human experience, though. Setting aside lucid dreaming, the shift between dreaming and waking literally does that to dreams. Other parts of your brain start waking up and imposing an increasing amount of order - and occasionally more realistic sense impressions - upon the dream, and that very same waking-up means the dream is doomed to end.

11ncmdx,"I wasn't mad on Neverwhere tbh. But although Ive only read Gaimens Norse Mythology and this, I can confidently say Neil is a master of his own style. What I did love about Neverwhere was the notion of the under London folk being near to invisible to the surface folk and forgotten about as soon as they were out of sight. 
Incidentally what I both disliked and admired of the book was its resilience to tie up many loose threads or explain itself in many ways, but as I said, I admire this also when a writer says ""nah that's just for me to know, you're on this journey with them but youre gona remain just as clueless as Richard"" (if that was the protags name I can't fully recall).

11ncmdx,"Kinda. The story originally came about as a script that Gaimen was contracted to write for the BBC, but he wasn't happy with how the show ended up. Said it wasn't what he was imagining when he wrote it. In the forward to the version of Neverwhere I have he refers to it as ""not necessarily a bad show""...which is a polite way of saying he thought it was shit. Even during the production of the show he had already decided he was going to rewrite it as a novel because the story was being messed with by the producers. He became so disillusioned by the process that he got to the point when his publicist came to him telling him they wanted to change something else he would just say ""Whatever, I'll fix it in the book"".

The novel is him attempting to salvage the story that he liked from the TV show he didn't. So while it's technically a novelisation, it's more like he tried to write a TV show, and then decided that it should have been a novel in the first place when he was already contractually obliged to make it into a script first.

So in a way, the TV show is still an adaptation of the book...it's just that it was adapted for TV before he actually wrote it.

[Incidentally, the whole thing is on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DxPkI4J-ZU&list=PLm_I7kvbHlllJduUbq8yD8QOedYu6inmT). Do not watch it if you've not read the book, it's an obviously inferior version...I still kinda like it though despite it's 90s BCC Doctor Who production. When it came out it was one of the most interesting and unusual things on TV. It was so rare for any kind of high concept dark fantasy to make it onto TV.

Edit - You know what, I haven't watched the TV show since it came out in the 90s. I remember thinking it was incredible when it came out but I had watched a couple of clips in isolation that made it seem laughably cheap looking. But I'm two episodes into this now, and if you can get over the slightly wobbly acting and obvious budget limitations, it's legitimately great.

Also, got such a massive wave of nostalgia hearing the outro music. I forgot how amazing it was...then I noticed Brian Eno did the soundtrack. No wonder it's so good.",Ringosis,2023-03-10 09:19:22

If you haven't yet, I suggest reading *American Gods*; phenomenal book! The 'sequel' (I use that term very loosely), *Anansi Boys* is also great!

I've read most of Neil Gaiman's full novels and a number of his short stories. He may very well be my favorite author.

As far as a sequel to *Neverwhere*, I wouldn't hold my breath for too long. Reportedly he did say he was working on a book titled *The Seven Sisters* (or something along those lines) which he says is supposed to be a sequel to *Neverwhere*. However, iifc that announcement was made when he released Norse Mythology (also incredible) which was released more than two years ago. It may or may not be in the works any longer.

If you're interested though, find a copy of *How the Marquis Got His Coat Back*. Not totally a sequel as much as it is an extension of *Neverwhere*.

bkwpu6,"American Gods is my favorite of his and easily one of my top five books. Quite possibly my most favorite book ever. I liked Neverwhere but it didn't hook me nearly as hard. I think it comes down to Gaiman being terrific at making the setting of the book a living, breathing character, something that you can sink into and feel the feelings that that place evokes. 

Neverwhere felt crowded and busy and a little grimy and, well, like London, or at least what I imagine London to be like. But I've never been to London, it isn't a place that lives in my heart. American Gods does the same thing but because the location is different the feeling is different, and because America is my home and I have felt so much of it so deeply, it hits home much harder. I can feel what it's like to be driving on a straight stretch of road for 12 hours at a time with nothing but cornfields or dirt on either side. I know that lake in Minnesota, I know the local newspaper they pick up in the coffee shop. That's my home. And so to overlay the story of what it means to bring the old gods with you, but they look different and you can't recognize them, and there's no real home for them here either, it's just desolation and longing and getting overwritten by the new gods of capitalism, technology... I don't know. I love that book. It was formative for me and even thinking about it makes me have a lot of feelings, clearly.",grumpyoldowl,2019-05-05 20:56:02

It feels a bit lighter, and more whimsical, but only slightly.  Ocean at the end of the Lane would be my recommendation.  It's a creepy fantasy book that has Coraline vibes, but geared toward adults.  I'd also recommend reading some of his short story compilations.

Not just my opinion, it is widely reocgnized as one of the best comic book works ever published, and remains the best best thing he's ever done, by far. And I did love American Gods, Neverwhere, Coraline, Good Omens and others. Nothing holds a candle to Sandman, however.

bkwpu6,"Absolutely. It took me over a decade to try another Gaiman book because I found Gods so lackluster, but Neverwhere is great.

The tone struck me as a bit off at first, but I think it helps to realize that whimsical nature of it was very original when Gaiman wrote the show and book. I don't know if he toned it down after the initial 50 pages or if I just became immersed, but the purposely off-hand remarks weren't as jarring after that.",XornTheHealer,2019-05-05 19:56:41

Yet you can see, if you have read his other books, and know what to look for, a hint of what he's not so good at: his protagonists are usually pretty empty and agenda-less, and he sometimes lacks a strong, compelling storyline moving through the entire novel. Neverwhere provides both. Sometimes I think Gaiman should team up more with other writers who are good at the thing he isn't, and then Gaiman would be free to add what he does best.

Everything about it, from the story, setting, and especially the characters was a unique delight that I've experience in only a few other works.

It's one of his stories that maintains complexity in the form of simplicity and where the extent of his creativity and love for language are expressed unapologetically. 

I'm not quite sure how I feel about him writing a sequel. The is certainly worth exploring but whether or not Richard and Door's story needs continuing - in a direct and immediate way, at least.

Regardless, I'm glad you enjoyed the story and hope you take the time to reread it. Now that I've written this, I know I want to.",Rokudaime56,2018-08-19 06:26:37

Imagine my surprise when I even loved the mini-series that came BEFORE the novelization.

I've read so much of his work since then, and even his childrens books are fun and unique in ways that really only he could be.

And then, because I never really research celebrities' personal lives, I couldn't believe it when I found out he had started seeing Amanda Palmer, who I had admired since listening to Dresden Dolls back in the day!

98fia1,"See that's actually why I like *Neverwhere* - but your argument is totally valid! In Harry Potter, Harry is a *big deal*. He essentially saved the world at the age of one, and it's important to a lot of people, especially Dumbledore, that he's brought up to speed regarding his wizard skills. So the whole universe is explained to him at length, by Hagrid first, then his classmates. He is central to the whole thing.

But in Neverwhere, Richard is, at best, a somewhat useful assistant, and at worst a total hindrance. People are yelling at him for being clueless because they have *other shit to do*. Richard is not a Chosen One, he's not a Main Character in London Below until the very end. People like the Marquis or Door's family are simply operating on a much, much more intricate level of plot (The Marquis has his bloody *heart* stashed somewhere and somehow he's still alive), and Richard is in the way. Don't get me wrong, Richard is a good guy and ends up saving the day, but he's also a total pain in the arse for Hunter or the Marquis who have better things to do than babysit a random human about the intricacies of their crazy world. 

Have you ever started a position at a fast-paced job, like a hospital or a restaurant, or generally been a fish out of water in a situation that requires urgency? There's a feeling of helplessness, as people are essentially walking around you to get their job done, that *Neverwhere* conveys perfectly. You're asking around how you can help, but everyone working this job knows that it would take at least half an hour of sitting down and explaining the situation but the wedding/concert/quadruple bypass is happening *now* and they don't have time to help you. It's not that they don't like you, but you're just at the bottom of their priority list. So when you try to take charge and carry a tray of glasses/gauze and you trip on your own feet and break everything around you, people yell at you, and it's understandable why.

I would also say that I was living in London when I read Neverwhere, and the city being such an important character in itself, I think it made me connect with the book more. London itself is one of these ""fish out of water"" fast-paced situations when you land there. There are 8 million people in London, with jobs and tasks and things to do and no one is going to hold your hand on the Tube, you'll have to figure it out yourself. If you stand on the left of the elevator, chances are you'll just get pushed out of the way. It might seem mean, but many people in London don't have the time to explain to you why you don't do that, their train arrives in 30 seconds and if they miss it because of you, they'll miss their connection and they'll be late at their job. No one will tell you to mind the gap; but if you don't mind it, you *will* get run over by a train.",Calembreloque,2018-08-19 18:36:26

Neverwhere is probably the most accessible and engaging, but American Gods is smarter and richer, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane is more lyrical.

Anyway, I likewise read Pratchett before ever stumbling upon Gaiman. An expert at the bookstore highly recommended Neverwhere once I had my hands on it.

- Ocean at the End of The Lane

It’s available on Amazon and I thought most of the stories in it were pretty good, so it wouldn’t necessarily be a matter of getting it just for the one story.  

There are also a couple in there from George R. R. Martin and Patrick Rothfuss that tie in with “A Song of Ice and Fire” and the “Kingkiller Chronicle” series.

As soon as de Carabas was introduced, I was like, god no. Never watched anymore. The movie in my head was 10 times better than most anything the BBC could come up with at that time.

14imqnd,I don't know why you think it's more likely to delve into backstory. It's been a few years since I read Neverwhere and I need to re-read it so I won't comment on your issues. Gaiman doesn't really do sequels. He has written three short stories that act as sequels. Two to American Gods and One to Neverwhere. I find it hard to believe that delving into backstory would interest gaiman it's not his style but also it's hard to know what to expect as he hasn't ever written a novel length sequel. He also has not released a book in 6 years and a novel in 10 I doubt any new work is coming anytime soon.,Y_Brennan,2023-06-25 15:21:12
14imqnd,"Love the book but have not re-read it in ages.

It feels like Gaiman had this rich and fantastic world, something like Harry Potter or LotR or Dresden Files or Supernatural or some other urban or fantasy epic... and Neverwhere just feels like a tease. To me, nothing felt fleshed out or really interesting. We had the perfect protagonist who knew nothing and could be taught and be used as a vehicle to learn about London Below and instead we get a book full of characters scoffing at us and not telling us a single thing about the world itself.

That said, maybe sample it first and check - it could be hard to follow the storyline if confused by the accents and switching voices.

The differences are in the details. Richard Mayhew is portrayed as much more ""alone"" than Harry - there are no completely trusted characters aside from the main two, and the world feels much more dystopian, even though it is also wonderous at times. The sense of Neverwhere's world is that it is far more uncanny and dreamscape-ish (or nightmare-ish) than Harry's - which feels like an augmented, bigger-than-life version of our own, familiar world. The scope of events in Neverwhere is somewhat smaller, although the story is much more streamlined.

* *Neverwhere* was originally a TV mini-series. However, during the production, Gaiman became frustrated with the limitations of what could be portrayed on screen, and so re-wrote and enlarged the tale into the novel.
* His original idea was for this to be set in a much more literal version of London's homeless community.
* The character of the Marquis de Carabas was very much inspired by the Doctor from *Doctor Who* - which Gaiman would much later write for, and again experience frustration with the interpretation on screen.",GreyShuck,2019-08-17 21:02:49

What's everyone laughing about?""

It's still an enjoyable read with that great Gaiman fantasy dark fairy tale feel, but it frustrates me sometimes. Also, I feel like some parts just go by way too quickly, I'm used to longer descriptions and more action and such, so some of the stuff being resolved like one-two-done is very off putting to me.

Given that we read ""Catcher in the Rye"" in an advanced english class in 5th grade, I think this reaction to *Neverwhere* is likely the result - as the article seems to show - of a single parent reacting to something that was outside of their world view. Unfortunately, similar things did happen even in my pretty liberal hippie mountain town. There was an abrupt disappearance of fantasy and science fiction books in the Jr. High School library when a new librarian with extremely conservative religious views took over, but that was successfully overturned by a cadre of teachers and students as well as letters from the previous librarian and other staff. Years later, the same happened with Harry Potter books. Silly how many teapot tempests we make about literature.

China Miéville's *Un Lun Dun* is more of a YA-book than Neverwhere, but it's London-centric, with the same theme (average person travelling to alternate version of their own home city, etc., etc.). I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Clive Barker's Abarat is good - also more on the YA side of things, but with enough gory grown-up details for that not to matter. Heartily recomended, and I really wish he'd finish writing the third book, damn it. 

Chris Wooding's *Retribution Falls* and *Black Lung Captain* are excellent, high-paced adventures, with enough detail and grit in the world to make them engaging, without digging too deep into info-dumping and long, rambling descriptions of ancient mythology or over-complicated technology. Also, undead airship-pirates. ",frostflowers,2011-02-10 19:15:33

You might take a look at Peter S. Beagle's writing, as well as Sergei Lukyanenko's *Night Watch* series. They're a bit different than Gaiman, but REALLY enjoyable.
