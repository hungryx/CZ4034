11ncmdx,Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman,"Holy shit this book was so good. I was literally savoring it at the end, reading it super carefully and turning the pages super slowly and pausing at the end of each chapter.

I love everything about it. The unique characters, the setting (I love London), the plot, the ideas, the dialogue, the beautiful writing style. The length of the book and pacing was ideal as well. Although I didn't want it to end. Ugh I want another book just like this one. I'm thinking I'll try more Gaiman books, as I've now read this one and read The Ocean at the End of the Lane twice (and I'm about to read it a third time now). I really adore his writing style, it's just beautiful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11ncmdx/neverwhere_by_neil_gaiman/,2023-03-10 02:57:05,292,2260,books
bkwpu6,I finally finished reading Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman after a whole week,"It was the second Gaiman book I got (first being American Gods), and I was deeply sucked in! Once I started reading, I couldn't put the damn thing down! 

&#x200B;

The plot was epic, the characters were hilarious, and that ending was really good. I really really love Neil's writing style. There's just something about it that leaves me wanting for more.  I heard there was a sequel coming up (I mean was that legit?), but if there is, then I can't wait to see it!

98fia1,I just finished Gaiman’s Neverwhere and I was completely entranced. This book is fantastic.,"It’s been a long time since a fantasy book drew me in as much as *Neverwhere* managed to. Once I started, I couldn’t put it down and finished it in four days. Neil Gaiman creates such an intricate world that is a character as much as the excellent protagonists and villains he writes about, making both seem real and believable. I found myself plowing through the last two chapters because I was eager to see where Richard ends up and what he actually wanted. Gaiman’s writing style in the book is excellent; it so adeptly conveys a disorienting sense of the weird world and its illogical logic. He manages to leave just enough unsaid to weave a sense of wonder and make his characters seem alive, emotional, and complicated. I still draw conclusions about their implied feelings and futures which are neither confirmed nor invalidated; such tacit characterization is a testament to the engrossing quality of his writing. 

*Neverwhere* recaptured a lot of the same feelings I had when I was reading Harry Potter growing up, although this book is far darker and more mature. I felt like I knew these characters, and more than that, I wished I could be along for adventures in London Below. Even though I recently finished the book, I plan on listening to the BBC adaptation so I can visit it all again.

gzi5vl,"I just finished Neverwhere, by Neil Gaiman","I've always been weirdly obsessed with Neil Gaiman despite having not read his books. The way people described his storytelling as masterful and spellbinding was intriguing and I fell for the excellent marketing. I've owned Norse Mythology and The Graveyard Book for a while but never picked them up.

I don't think I've ever wanted a sequel as much as I do for Neverwhere. I could never get enough of London Below. It was nothing I expected and more than I ever hoped for.

1acon3i,"From above to below: ""Neverwhere"" by Neil Gaiman.","Finished some Neil Gaiman today with the novel ""Neverwhere"". It always feels good to read another work by an author after a little while.

The synopsis of this story revolves around a young man named Richard Mayhew who has a good heart and an ordinary life, only for it to change forever after he stops to help a girl that he finds bleeding on a sidewalk in London.

This small act of kindness has propelled him into a world that he never knew even existed. A world filled with people who have fallen through the tracks, and he has become one of them.

And now Richard must learn to survive in this literal city of shadows and darkness inhabited by monsters, saints, murderers and angels in order to return to the London that he knew.

""Neverwhere"" was a novelisation of a BBC television miniseries that Gaiman had also worked on. Never saw the series but now I have read the book. I really been enjoying the weird side of fantasy a lot lately which includes writers like Peake, King and Barker. And now, after reading a good number of his books, Gaiman. And now ""Neverwhere"" is another novel that will fir snugly within my collection, and of course I'm about to start on another one soon today!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1acon3i/from_above_to_below_neverwhere_by_neil_gaiman/,2024-01-27 23:48:25,36,86,books
xivjyt,Finished Neverwhere,"So I finished neverwhere like an hour ago and I really enjoyed this book.  

A few things of note. 

1.) It's not a literary masterpiece by any means. 

2.) Though the characters are a bit two dimensional the world building is incredible. 

3.) It's a fun derivative adventure plot that follows someone thrust into a new world that parallels his own.  

I gave it 4 starts.  It's fun, it's accessible, and it's well done.  I'd suggest it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xivjyt/finished_neverwhere/,2022-09-20 01:47:59,20,59,books
14imqnd,Hunter in Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere,"Let me start of by saying that I liked the book, the tone, the atmosphere. There is one thing that fell short for me, which is the character arc and plot of Hunter. This is mainly due to two reasons.  


1. Her death: Hunter is renowned for her ability to slay numerous beasts like the Berlin bear or the N.Y. crocodile. Throughout the story, she also effortlessly fights other characters displaying her exceptional skills and never breaking a sweat. Her sudden demise feels anti-climatic to me: ""*Hunter waited until she could see the white spittle dripping from its mouth, and as it lowered its head she stabbed with the spear; but, as she tried to sink the spear into its side, she understood that she had moved just a fraction of a second too late, and the spear went tumbling out of her numbed hands, and a tusk sharper than the sharpest razor blade opened her side. And as she fell beneath its monstrous weight, she felt its sharp hooves crushing down on her arm, and her hip, and her rips. And then it was gone, vanished back into the darkness, and the dance was done*.” How could someone who was hailed as such a skilled hunter miss such an opportunity? Just a fraction of a second too late?   
The foreshadowing of Richard charging at the beast seemed, to me, to extend beyond simply hinting at the presence of the beast. It served the purpose of creating the expectation of her failure. To me, her demise, coming so easily, does not align with the rest of her character.  

2. Unfinished story arc/many open questions: I don't think that she is truly dead. Why do I think this? 

* We don't really know what creature she is. She worked for the Serpentines at least 30 years ago (""'*I thought that they did not speak for at least 30 years.' \[...\] 'Quite possibly. But they were still talking then.'”). However, she does not age in comparison to the Serpentines (""You’ve kept your looks better than I, Hunter.*""), even though the sisters appear to be old. More directly, when asked how old she is, Hunter cryptically responds ""*As old as my tongue. And a little older than my teeth.*” Does this mean that she was carved out or created from a bone somehow?  This would also explain her connection to the seven sisters, who themselves seem skeletal and could have possibly how she might be so close to the seven sisters, who also appear skeletal and could have possibly played a role in her creation (though this is speculation).
* The serpentines show a close affiliation with Hunter, evident from their acceptance of her companions as guests (*“Her friends are my friends, child.*”). They could have a motivation to perform a ritual or provide her with a potion (as they gave Richard a reviving potion for his hangover) to bring her back to life.  When they pick her up, their faces ""*revealed no emotion of any kind, neither happy, nor sad*"". Maybe they plan to revive her?
* Lastly, I hope to learn more about Hunter. Could she potentially become a Serpentine herself? The Serpentines wore ""*remains of what looked like it had once, long ago, been a silk-and-lace confection of a white wedding dress, now shredded and dirt-stained and torn*"", suggesting a lack of natural aging. They are not depicted eating, so they might be undead. Is it possible for Hunter to transform into something similar to them? If not, can we uncover Hunter's backstory? What is the significance of her curse preventing her from going to London Above? She seems somewhat ""buried"" even before her death.

I just discovered that a sequel ""The Seven Sisters"" has been announced in 2017. I hope that it will feature Hunter, although it is more likely to delve into her backstory before being killed by the beast.

87xevz,neil gaiman's neverwhere,"very short rant as i just finished the book:

i loved ""neverwhere"", it had all of neil gaiman's ability of writing magically. loved the writing, loved the magic, loved the setting

so basically it's the usual gaiman formula of dropping magic-ignorant character (richard) into magic-filled world, except this protagonist is also a lot dumber than gaiman's other protagonists.

but i fucking HATE richard, the main protagonist. he's FUCKING STUPID I SWEAR TO GOD. i know london below is weird as shit but that does not excuse his stupidity like ffs

i like all the other characters. door was cute, she handled her grief for a 15 year old character well enough. the marquis was an eccentric & interesting character. hunter's alright

the world's interesting, the magic & how rats were significant in the world, the market etc. the book was too short for its own good, but you still get that ever-present subtlety of gaiman's magic. it's fascinating, it sucks you in as if you're actually there

but I STILL FUCKING HATE RICHARD FFS

cg53sh,Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman,"Just finished Nevewhere for the first time. I'm a big Gaiman fan and I loved it. I truly think he is one of the best fantasy writers ever and this only solidified my position more. I know he is a C.S Lewis fan and this in a weird way reminded me of his works. Main character being sucked into a world they didn't know existed (granted both stories end up being much different).

&#x200B;

I like the cast of characters and it very much follows the heroes journey but with that Gaiman dialogue which I love. I think the future of the genre is urban fantasy and this is by far one of the best i've read. I love worlds like this. The ones hidden inside of our own.

l7lz34,Why is Neverwhere so popular right now?,"So as far as I’m aware, Neverwhere (by Neil Gaiman) was originally a BBC TV show that Gaiman wrote that he later worked into a book. It looks like the book came out in 1996, but has anyone else noticed that it’s seeing a resurgence right now? I’ve seen a few book clubs pick it up recently, along with an influx of online reviews and an increase in sales at the bookstore I work at. 

I picked up a copy of the illustrated edition circa 2017. I thought it was pretty good?? But nothing spectacular, if I’m being honest. I thought it was enjoyable, but that’s about it. I felt like you could kinda tell that it was adapted from a television series because if memory serves me correctly it was very action-based (they went here; they did this) and I didn’t feel like it really made you think or feel anything special.

So why am I seeing this sudden increase in popularity? None of my coworkers seem to know. I noticed that an “author’s preferred text” edition came out recently, but could this really be what’s driving the sales etc.? 

tl;dr I’m curious as to why Neverwhere is gaining popularity again when I really didn’t think it was anything special, and I see no obvious reason for this resurgence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l7lz34/why_is_neverwhere_so_popular_right_now/,2021-01-29 06:58:04,23,15,books

While I was reading it, I kept thinking what a great setting it would make for an RPG game as well, as it had that feeling like I could do anything with the world. I know this sounds gushing, but I just felt like I had to write at least something down and tell at least someone. Hopefully this will inspire someone else to read it an enjoy it as much as I did.

72jchv,(Discussion) (Spoilers) Was unimpressed by Neil Gaimans Neverwhere.,"I recently finished *Neil Gaimans* *Neverwhere* book and was kind of disappointed by it. Some things that I noticed:

* Richards and Doors ages are very vague. In the beginning he is engaged to Jessica which hints to me he is in his mid twenties. Door on the other hand is described as ""a child"". Then they almost make out after drinking the Atlantean wine. Then the Marquis calls them both children.

* Richard is probably supposed to be an antihero character, but during the course of the book he barely does anything. The most notably exception is stabbing the beast (on command by Hunter). 

* This is a Monomyth story with Richard as the main character. In the end he returns to his normal life, changed by the experience. Then, out of the blue, he is gifted with a new apartment and a new job position ... strange that.

4x39ms,[Spoilers] What happened in the train station to Richard in Neverwhere (by Neil Gaiman)?,"I'm specifically talking about the ""ordeal"" he had to go through when at the Blackfriars Station to get the key for the Angel Islington.

I truly don't understand the ending to his ordeal but thought I had a good idea of it up until the *very* end. My theory:

The three of them (Hunter, Door, Richard) each had to go through a trial to get the key. Hunter, being a fighter, proved herself in battle. Door, being quick-witted and smart, solved the riddle given to her. But Richard?

Richard's trial was his sanity. He lived a boring life, no real purpose. He had no purpose until he was put into London Below. Up until this point, he still, ***still***, doesn't believe some of the shit he's seeing. All he wants to do is leave and go back to his world. What's he to go back to? His boring life? 

While in the Station, he's constantly told that he's talking to himself and that he's been imagining the whole thing. *That's what he's been saying to himself the whole time*. His conscious is telling him to give up. There's nothing to go back to and he doesn't belong in London Below.

Signs across the tracks start telling him to kill himself and he suddenly has the opportunity to do it but doesn't. He let's the train pass and see's the bodies of those who have died in the trial of the ordeal littering the inside of the train. He slowly starts to wonder who he even is anymore.



_________________

Here's where I'm confused. Why does he get on the train? What exactly does the train symbolize? Getting on the train let him leave the ordeal but... I'm just not understanding the metaphor/meaning. After he awakes he says to himself, ""By my crooked teeth, who am I?""

I just don't understand what it meant for him to get on. Any help would be appreciated. Not sure if my analysis of that part of the book is wrong either, that's just my interpretation.

2ktxax,I've been improving my reading habits lately. Just finished Neverwhere and Stardust by Neil Gaiman! Anyone else have a hard time getting back into reading?,"I love Neil Gaiman. I love his style, his creativity, his storytelling.. everything. The first Neil Gaiman thing I ever read was The Sandman series of graphic novels. Those books were insanely amazing!

Anyways, I just recently started reading again. I'm 26, and the last time I read a book for fun was probably... 8-9 years ago. I told myself recently to try and read a book every month. (I'm a slow reader, forgive me). Since August, I've read 4 novels, all of which are Neil Gaiman's works. I've taken that quote by John Waters (I think it was him)  “We need to make books cool again. If you go home with somebody and they don't have books, don't fuck them.” to heart lately. I read a lot of comics, but I figured I should up my non-comic-book reading game.

It's been really difficult, coming home from work and knowing that you only have X number of hours to do stuff, including cook, clean, prepare for tomorrow, etc. and to choose to sit down and read a book. Part of me hated that, knowing that I was not physically accomplishing anything. But then that other part of me loved it because I can easily open a book and be transported to another world. Honestly, when I start reading a book, I sort of make it a habit to put it above everything else in my free time, i.e. I treat it like something that needs to get done rather than something I *want* to be doing. I'm trying to change that, but I mean, it's gotten me to read a lot, so I guess it's working?

So since August I've read American Gods, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, and I just finished Stardust (I actually read that one in 3 days! That's the quickest I've ever read anything, haha).

I just want to share my excitement that I'm getting back into reading, and to tell everyone to read The Sandman, and other stuff by Neil. And to share your stories on how you got back into reading.

Okay, sorry for the rant! :) Everyone go read! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ktxax/ive_been_improving_my_reading_habits_lately_just/,2014-10-30 23:12:42,5,9,books
79m6ms,"For as long as I can remember, rumors of a sequel to Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere or American Gods being written have been spread, how likely do you all think this is and how excited would you be for it if a sequel was written?","Personally, those two books are among some of my favorite of all time so I would be ecstatic about the possibility of a sequel, for American Gods particularly with its recent TV show adaption revitalizing interest I feel there is a distinct possibility of a sequel being written at some point. But Neverwhere is one I particularly want a sequel to because I just really want another book exploring the universe established.
