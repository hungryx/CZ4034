dzgebv,"So, I didn't like Eragon. I really tried to, but it didn't click for me.

But I one time, I made the mistake several years ago of taking shit about it on reddit and then who should respond to my comment but Chris Paolini himself! He was super cool about it and basically fully acknowledged that it wasn't very good, but reminded me that he wrote it when he was 15.

I felt like the world's biggest douchebag and cowardly deleted my comment, which I wish I hadn't done in retrospect. I might not have enjoyed his most popular book, but Paolini himself is a cool dude and I have huge respect for anyone who can publicly acknowledge something like that. He also still interacts with the fans of the Inheritance Cycle, which is really cool knowing that he's otherwise outgrown it. He's a fucking hero.",mglyptostroboides,2019-11-21T15:06:03Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

dzgebv,"Every couple of months when I think about it I check on if Paolini has announced a new book, either a new Eragon or anything else. In fact, I was in Barns and Noble last week when I thought to check again and couldn't find anything about something new. 

I'm excited. I read the first book when I was in the 8th grade (I'm 29 now) and I love the series. I eagerly awaited the next book after flying through a new release. I recognize that it isn't exactly original writing and that it has plenty of faults but it was always fun to read and expect this new book to be the same.",wene324,2019-11-21T15:31:08Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
dzgebv,A lot of dislike for Eragon in here.  Was it the greatest fantasy novels? Of course not.  However I really enjoyed them.  I really enjoyed his take on magic.

dzgebv,I absolutely loved eragon as a kid but looking back on it some spots were... rough. I'm still amazed at the world building that a 15-18 year old was able to conjure it. Really interested to see how he's grown as a writer.,cpet72,2019-11-21T17:27:01Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
dzgebv,"I used to love Eragon when I was a kid, used to say it was my favorite book of all time in Elementary and Middle School.

dzgebv,"Hopefully this will be much more original. For me eragons problem was not the writing (cause I read it in middle school) but that he borrowed so much from other series without much attempt to hide it. All fantasy borrows to an extent but paolini straight up used the same names and ideas. It's basically like reading lotr combined with wheel of time,  star wars, and the belgariad. Even back in middle school I had read enough fantasy that nothing in eragon seemed like an original idea, yet the series was getting ridiculous praise and selling like hotcakes",snorlz,2019-11-21T22:23:43Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

But what struck me was how cool he was. I didn’t have any book to sign but wanted to tell him how much that book meant to me as a tweenager.  We chatted for a minute and I went on my way. 

The dude wrote and published 3 books. We all have ideas. But he executed on his vision.

dzgebv,"Yay!...  

From the Wiki:

Eragon received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having ""clichéd descriptions"", ""B-movie dialogue"", ""awkward and gangly prose."" However, she concluded the review by noting that ""for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent"".[12] School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon ""sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations"".[13] Common Sense Media called Eragon's dialogue ""long-winded"" and ""clichéd"", with a plot ""straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there.""",that_one_guy_with_th,2019-11-21T17:17:56Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

 It’s a rewrite of the eragon series- it focuses on the lore/magic of the world while bringing a truly unique perspective to medieval fantasy that I’ve never seen before. 

To put it plainly, it’s good. Really fucking good. 

The first three chapters are similar to Eragon to establish the basic plot, but once it continues it quickly spins into its own thing.

dzgebv,"I absolutely loved the Inheritance Cycle. That said, I can totally see that it wasn't for everyone. Internet culture tends to be very protective if their fandom and having Paolini himself respond to you (in a cool way) speaks more about his character than any book he's ever written.

He's about my age and I was always in awe that he could take on such a ask and write a coherent book.

I'm very intrigued with what this new story/saga. For me, Eragon and the others were great because you can totally follow along the story and not feel lost. It was engaging and entertaining. In fact, I should read it again sometime.

I hope the redditors haven't soured your interest in this author's books going forward.",sreyaNotfilc,2019-11-21T18:28:56Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
dzgebv,"I mean, bits and pieces of the series were really good! Like the Seithr oil subplot from the beginning of book 1:

* Brom tells Eragon about the chemical used to torture Eragon's aunt and uncle before killing them. In its natural form, Seithr oil is used by jewlers to polish gems, but if enchanted with a blood sacrifice, it becomes an incredibly caustic poison sought after by assassins.

* Eragon gets the idea to track down his family's killers by sneaking into the shipping records of a port city to see if any orders for the jewlers' version of the oil seem suspicious, and Brom wonders why he never thought of this before when he'd previously hunted down assassins who'd used the caustic version.

As a **plot** development, this certainly couldn't form the basis for an entire mystery storyline without adding a whole bunch of extra steps, but as a sub-plot in the middle of a book where other things are happening, this is a pretty good one :)

But more importantly, as a **world-building** element, this is astonishing :D The real world has plenty of things like Draino and aluminum foil that are harmless in their intended purpose, yet dangerous – or even deadly – if used differently (deliberately or ignorantly), but how many times has this been used for fleshing out a piece of phlebotinum in a SciFi/Fantasy story?",Simpson17866,2019-11-21T20:45:17Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

In the end though my biggest problem with the series was that I was ready for it to end with the third book and it just didn't. Eragon did such a great job of being this naive young man's introduction to this world, Eldest was this great story of him coming into confidence and personal strength, so by the time Brisingr rolled around I was ready for it to be the climax of the story, and honestly it really read like a climax in that in a Return of the King sort of way...but then it just didn't end, the battle didn't really matter, the evil king was still waiting in the next castle. I tried reading Inheritance after that but I honestly never could finish it because I was just tired of the book treading the same climactic arc they had already covered in the last book.",turkeygiant,2019-11-21T18:10:33Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

He was just some 16 year old kid who's parents had a home-publishing business.  He was homeschooled in some remote place in montana and lived in his fantasy novels.  I can relate as a kid who grew up in a rural farming community.  In fairness, I bought a copy of his book from HIM at a renaissance faire in the late 90s,  one of the ones his family published and he was walking around selling out of his backpack,  so I've only ever read his home-published version that never saw a professional editor so maybe it was better afterwards.",Farlandan,2019-11-21T22:51:10Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

dzgebv,"Paolini is honestly the reason that I  started writing and sharing my writing with other people. Growing up, I was this nerdy little homeschooled kid who lived in imagination overload because my home life royally sucked. Paolini was my hero. A 15 year old boy, homeschooled, published this awesome book and got international's acclaim for it? Maybe I could be like that! A lot of his stylistic choices I want to say influenced my early years of writing (for better or for worse. I'd like to say for the better). Nowadays I prefer to teach rather than practice myself, but still turn to Eragon as a prime example of world-building versus more common ones like Tolkein.

In hindsight, was it the best book series? Not at all. It dragged in places. I disliked the ending. I feel like Brisingr as a novel was superfluous to the series. But it gave me light and life in a really difficult time and gave me a hobby that helped me cope.

I never got to interact with him like you did, but it really makes me (and my inner teenager) glad that the person I looked up to for so long is just as awesome in reality as I pictured him to be.",phoenixlance13,2019-11-22T00:49:13Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

dzgebv,"So I had to look up the timelines so I could be accurate. Eragon came out, self-published, way back in 2001. Then got republished back from in 2003. I remember reading it back when I was in middle school. Say 2007, 2008. I would have been 12 or 13. I remember one of my friends, reading the book, and he told me his older brother read it. And he told me the author wrote it when he was 15. That's what first got me seriously interested. I'd had caught up with Harry Potter by that time. That means I'd had read Goblet of Fire, Order of Phoenix, and Half-Blood Prince. Read more Nancy Drew than I care to admit, and a decent bit of the Hardy Boys, found a few Sherlock Holmes. Anything Rick Riodan were the hot potatoes in my social circles. The Edge Chronical were plentiful, and of a good length to knock out in a weekend. Any Artemis Fowl book was good for the light reading of the day time. Animorphs or Goosebumps also could the lunch break, or study period gap. You get the idea, I spent more time reading, than eating. The Bartimaeus sequence was a recently new find, that had a good chunk to bite into. Something that actually satiated my appetite. Made me slow down a bit when I chewed. A decent book with a texture to the characters. The plotline was driven by more than one desire. Inkheart scratched similar itches. I've read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tangerine for English class. I could put in the work to finish something. If I wasn't enjoying what I read. That didn't matter. What mattered was that I finished the story. So I'm I'm sitting there, listening to my friend, tell me about this book, a 15 year old wrote. How it's a fantasy, with dragons, and people who could ride them. There's supernatural enemies too, with magic, elves, and sword fighting. Naturally, I listened politely at his enthusiasm. Inwardly, I was skeptical, cause while I agree, all of those elements were cool; I didn't think I could write a story at 15, I'd want to read at 13. I needed to know more stuff, right? To even just make a story that's worth someone else's time. So I'm eye-ing his book, estimating it might take me a week. Maybe a weekend too, if I was lazy with it, or focusing on other books. When he was done with it, I'd give it a shot. He finishes it, and lets me borrow it. I'm pretty sure I got in on a Tuesday. I gave it back Thursday. Within the next month I had my own copy. Since then I've kept up with the releases of the Inheritance Cycle. I'm ever thankful for Christopher Paolini, for proving me wrong. For showing me with keen imagination that a piece of art, worth spending some time on, can be made by a 15 year old. That it doesn't take an adult, with decades of experience to rely on, to make a book worth reading. I'm super excited to read something of his again. Having grown more into a palate sci-fi with Herbert, Asimov, Stephenson, and ~~His-name-who-shall-ever-be-forgotten~~ ^^orson ^^scott ^^card too; I expect Paolini to bless us with a wonderful read to grace our shelves with. Or add to our e-book collections. Who cares how you do it, its just reading.

But no, they really weren't good books.

I read Eragon back when it first came out, but I didn't finish the series. I thought it was alright, but didn't really buy into the hype as much as my friends did.

The difference between the two is that one wrote a dumbed-down story for kids, and one was a kid trying to write an intelligent story.

The 4th book written a lot later had a very different tone and feel, but I still enjoyed it.

dzgebv,"There's lots of little scenes and conversations where Eragon is feeling down and saying that everything they went through in the last book wasn't really worth it, that the good experiences they had don't make up for all the suffering.

There's a subplot about him facing the fact that he will have to fight lots of soldiers to stop Galbatorix, soldiers who are mostly regular dudes that just there because they had no other option.

You know, just the general tone, it questions many things that were glossed over in Eragon.

And then it comes, my favourite conversation in the history of literature, and I mean it.

The Elves are having a festival they celebrate once every 100 years, every citizen and guest (like Eragon) is expected to bring something they have created, and to show it in front of the whole city. Some people bring artistic creations, other's make a performance, smiths make cool weapons or jewelry, you get it.

And Eragon doesn't have a single clue about what the heck to do, because he's just the kid who found the dragon egg, and all these elves are far better than him at everything. So he writes a poem that's not meant to compete in quality, but to explain what being ""The Chosen One"" has meant to him, and he writes it in the language of magic, which means he can only speak the words if he thinks they are true. He shows the poem to his master, and asks him to give his honest opinion.

He says it's kinda bad. Like, you know, readable, just meh. But he also says that Eragon is telling something that matters to him, a story that is very real and very true, something that's personal, something that other people can relate to, and there is another type of value in that.

And when I was a dumb teenager reading dumb fantasy stories, I read this chapter and thought, ""hey, this isn't just some story with made up characters, this is a story made by a human person who is trying to talk to me, another human person, and uses this story to connect on a personal level.""

The actual poem is in the book too, it's exactly as bad as you can imagine. But every time I'm writing something and I feel it's all for nothing, I think about that stupid and shitty poem, I imagine Paolini thinking: ""yep, this is happening, I'm actually writing the fucking poem to make the point clear"" and going through every version, trying to make it just a lil better until he does something that might not be ""good enough"", but is the best he can do, something that matters because the point he is making really really REALLY matters to him.

And it helps. It doesn't solve everything because writing is hard and I'm not any good at it, but it helps. And I enjoy doing it, and sometimes people enjoy the stories I share with them.

And that's pretty fucking cool.",mecharri,2019-11-21T17:54:45Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
dzgebv,"My point is more that Paolini and Eragon got a lot of hate simply for being successful. His work was considered ""easy"" to do, and therefore many considered him unworthy of success as an author. Yet he did what many and indeed most fail to do: he actually did achieve commercial success and built up a big readership, despite his work being ""bad"" and ""easy"".

This is a pretty big stretch, but there's an incredible article written a long time about about ""scrubs"" in competitive fighting games:

[http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub](http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub)

I think this should be required reading for basically anyone involving themselves in competition of any sort, be it Street Fighter or competing for market share and readership among fantasy authors. Paolini went with standard tropes, simplistic plots, predictable twists, fairly basic/straightforward usage of English, etc., etc. He didn't try to innovate in a big way. He didn't try to do something fundamentally new. He didn't write to impress or to sound erudite. What he did was ""cheap"", which earned him a lot of ire because it actually worked.

dzgebv,"This. Too many authors are cautious to fully define a magic system, because people will pick it apart and find any and every loophole. It has to make sense to its core if your going to break it way down. Harry Potter doesnt have to explain it further than magic words, make magic spell, and they even show that its not a scientific art for most wizards because they end up hurting/maiming/killing others/themselves while creating new magics.

But Eragon did such a good job of explaining the magic, that it really turned into a science of energy manipulation. Conversion of energy to make one thing into another, to focus light through water to make fire, it was just moving energy around and Paolini did a great job of keeping it mysterious and vague early on, and then expanding upon it across 3 more books til it was a full and robust system, with logic to how stuff was structured and how the magic even came to be. Even down to the telepathy/affecting others minds. Because of their ability to manipulate magic/energy, they just pushed their consciousness outside themselves to touch another mind/energy.

dzgebv,"Sure.

Eragon and the rebel army keep conquering city after city, they have to, if they want to reach Galbatorix's (the main bad guy) fortress, because they need to keep the supply lines safe. Most of the time they are at a disadvantage, and they need to keep their army mostly intact for the final fight, so they have to get original to storm the cities, for example, sending a small squad to infiltrate from a secret tunnel only Dwarves know to open the city gates. They also have to figure out how they are actually going to defeat Galbatorix himself, cause he has trapped the Eldunari's (basically souls) of most dragons that died during the last war, and drains lots of magic power from them.

While they are celebrating they conquered the last city before his fortress, Nasuada (rebel leader) gets kidnapped by Murtagh (Eragon's half brother, who is also a dragon rider and serves Galbatorix because he knows his ""true name"" in magic language, so he is forced to obey). Galbatorix begins to torture fer, to either force her to make her troops surrender, or to learn her ""true name"". I like the books but this subplot is pretty bad.

Eragon puts some prophecies and legends he knows together, and learns that the abandoned island with the fortress of the old Dragon Riders might have a secret weapon to use against Galbatorix. So he, Shapira, and Glaedr's eldunari (their dragon master) go there. They go to the island (which has super cool creatures that are inspired on obscure european mithology) and find out some Dragon Riders managed to hide lots of dragon eggs and eldunari, then deleted those memories from their own minds, so nobody would find out.

All the rebels group, and they put together three different plans to take down Galbatorix, using everything they have. Both armies begin to fight, and they try to sneak in and kill Galbatorix using invisibility spells, but their magic begins to fail for no apparent reason, yet nobody attacks them.

They reach the throne room where Galbatorix and Murthag await, and Galbatorix explains that he hasn't exactly been sitting in the throne, he has found the ""true name"" of Magic, which means he controls magic, he can literally rewrite all the rules, and do whatever he wants, but his control isn't perfect yet. He strips everyone of their powers, which makes all their plans useles, and forces Eragon and Murthag fight for his amusement.

Eragon tricks Murthag by letting him cut him, but then wins the fight by attacking while Murthag realizes he is exposed, Murthag admits that he was always the better of two because he was willing to make sacrifices, and that he has changed as a person by watching him.

That means his ""true name"", his ""true self"" has changed too, so Galbatorix no longer controls him. He uses the true name of magic to give everyone their power back, and tries to attack Galbatorix, but he the king reacts in time, and his defenses are just too much to handle. The rest of allies jump in, and they begin to attack Galbatorix with everything they have.

But... it's not enough, no matter what they use, no matter how hard they try, it's not fucking enough, he's way too strong, there's no way they can win. And as Eragon realizes they have lost, that every sacrifice was for nothing, he thinks on all the people that were counting on him, and he wishes that Galbatorix understood that too. So he tries one last magic spell, one that will make Galbatorix understand everything he did, and experience every emotion he has ever caused, good and bad.

It's not a real attack, it's just an attemp to communicate, but Galbatorix would never conceive being held accountable for his actions, or empatizing with anyone, and he didn't set up defenses for that kind of spell, so it goes through, and it's too much for him too handle, because he has done far more bad than good, and he blows himself up with magic to stop felling all of that pain.

Then everyone is happy, and all goes well, except the country has been devastated by war, and the high degree of militarization and rebellion has encouraged every small lord or count to pillage and install their own small dictatorships, and everyone is demading compesations, and... Nasuada tries to solve those problems, but it's.. hard, really fucking hard, and it would all be so much easier if Eragon just went there, overpowered every army with his magic and dragon, and stopped every rebel mage with the true name of magic.

But that's exactly what Galbatorix was doing, and they both know it. So Nasuada tries to keep solving the problems the hard way, and Eragon flies away from the country to avoid the temptation of thinking he has THE RIGHT SOLUTION and to not meddle with government, but promises to teach all the future dragon riders that want to, once the dragon eggs begin to hatch.

dzgebv,"It actually isn't.

It is much, much more closely pulled from David Eddings, who was very upfront that he (Eddings) was following the same Hero's Journey formula that was used for Star Wars (you realize that Lucas has stated many times that he was just doing that formula, right? A New Hope was far from the first to do it, and won't be the last).

One minor character's name is Garath. A major character in the Belgariad by Eddings is Belgarath, who was born Garath.

The ""will and the word"" is literally a straight dump from the Belgariad. The only difference was the ""true name"" thing which was done much better several decades earlier by Le Guin in the masterpiece that is the Earthsea novels.

Brom is literally Belgarath with a new name. Almost exactly the same character, with only minor differences in backstory that are made to specifically fit Paolini's cookie cutter world which is a pretty obvious blend of Brooks' Shannara and Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

The Elves retreating to hidden forests that no one can seem to find unless they want them to? Done first by Tolkien and (many say incredibly derivatively) then by Brooks in the original Shannara trilogy (which is an even more beat-for-beat copy by Paolini).

Dwarves? Again, Tolkien and Brooks. Almost beat-for-beat.

Coming age of mankind? Tolkien and Brooks.

God-like being to destroy with whom the old mentor has a very personal relationship with? Sure, Star Wars, but much more similarly from Eddings' Belgariad (note that Phantom Menace was only a couple years old and Clone Wars was released around the same time).

Eragon is a farm boy orphan who has a white mark on his hand that marks his magical powers? So is Garion, the protagonist in the Belgariad. >!Brom is Eragon's father? Surprise! Belgarath is Garion's great--------great grandfather and they all come from the same family of guardian sorcerers chosen by a god to protect and serve!!<

Not saying he's a bad guy or deserved anything more than honest criticism, but I understand the frustrated people who see a 15yo getting praise for being in the right place at the right time. It's impressive to write a book. And for most young authors, it takes years or even a lifetime to get published. It's like when a bad director gets a film deal because his parents are in the industry. If they obviously dont put out quality work, they probably didn't earn that opportunity. As a kid, I was confused and frustrated to see his book get published and receive praise until I realized how it happened. Then the world made sense again. I don't have a problem with anyone reading Eragon and enjoying it, but I have no qualms about criticizing it very heavily. There's plenty of well written YA literature out there.

Spoilers of course

The princess, being desperate as she is caught in a chase by the hand of the evil emperor, sends out her valuable package (R2 with the death star plans, the dragon egg) to a remote location, where it is found by a young farm boy. Upon receiving the package he joins up with a sagely old man, who was once a member of a mythical order from days gone by. Also his farmer parents get slaughtered, and he is forced to seek out the rebellion while under the tutelage of the sagely old man.

Along the way they rescue the captured princess, at the cost of his teacher. They join up with the rebellion, and using the valuable package from the princess to defeat the big bad, for now.

There are many more parallels as the series go on (Glaedr’s rider = yoda comes to mind) maybe I’ll add some more in an edit if anyone cares

Edit: Pre book 1, with our hero’s father as the right hand of the evil empire, the altruistic mythical order is brought down.

Along the way there are surprise familial connections,flame swords capable of cutting gates (as another commenter says) furry sidekicks, another isolated teacher from the long lost order, who dies, although he is given means to give guidance to the hero, and our princess is capable of becoming a member of the ancient order.

Galbatorix losing in a duel would be absolute bullshit. It doesnt matter how powerful Eragon was. Galbatorix at that point was more god than mortal.

dzgebv,"I'm not saying it's wrong to say Eragon was medieval fantasy Star Wars. What I am saying is that difficulty with discussing this is that you have to separate the Hero's Journey stuff from the details that make Eragon a copy of Star Wars.

The existence of a Mentor for example is not evidence that one copied the other, but evidence that they both have the hero's journey structure. It's the details of the mentor that will make things different. If Obi-wan and Brom have similar personalities and back stories, that's a better argument to make.

Likewise, the Death Star Plans and the Egg are typical forms of magical assistance that are pretty standard in the Hero's Journey, just like the Ring in LOTR. What would make the dragon a copy is if the Egg and the Death Star plans are used similarly in the details of their plot. Like if inside the egg instead of a dragon, its the plans to the antagonist's lair that happens to have a lot of explosives under it.

Leia, Chani from Dune, and Zoe Saldana in Avatar are all allies of the protagonistin a similar plot structure, but it's the details that would make them copies of each other. Leia for example doesn't really act as a translator or introducer to a new culture where the other two do.

11m06ix,"As a kid I absolutely adored the books, but even then I knew it could get really, really clumsy at points, especially when the characters had to make a decision of any kind. Everything needed to be explained and debated - all alternatives needed to be thoroughly debunked before we could proceed.

Let’s take Murtagh and Eragon’s fight at the end of the second book as an example. Before they fight, the two of them have a debate as to why Murtagh doesn’t just surrender or give up. Why are they fighting? Murtagh swore an oath. Why doesn’t he join the rebel cause? Magic oath. Why doesn’t he just let Eragon kill him? He doesn’t want to die. This back-and-forth goes on for upwards of *3 pages!*

It’s almost like Paolini doesn’t trust that, unless the answer was glaringly obvious from the get-go, a reader’s first instinct probably won’t be to pick apart a character’s decision-making process. Having it happen once or twice is one thing, but he does this constantly, as if he’s justifying to the reader why things need to happen the way they do. Why Eragon can’t be with his elven love-interest, why Eragon needs to leave at the end of the series, there’s even a debate as to why he doesn’t just try to use magic to *raise his mentor from the dead.*

Even so, I still hold a great deal of respect what Paolini’s accomplished. He’s a published fantasy author, with a full series of novels under his belt. That’s a hell of a lot farther than I’ve gotten with my own writing. What Eragon is, at the end of the day, is a huge passion project, and I think Paolini’s passion definitely shows.",Immersturm,2023-03-08T20:37:47Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

11m06ix,"I enjoyed the first book when I was a kid (I think it was given to me as a present), but luckily or unluckily I had already read the books that Eragon cribbed its world-building from.

There’s almost *nothing* original about the Eragon series. He lifted the dragon riding from Anne McCaffrey, the magic system from Ursula LeGuin (among others), not to mention the general Tolkien trappings and the rehash of Star Wars. Which wouldn’t even be so bad but they’re just… not well written.

And I know he was a teenager when he wrote them (he also had a *lot* of help from his parents in getting it published). They’re just *bad*.

I still enjoyed the first book - there’s something fun about it despite its flaws, and I did end up reading the whole series with varying levels of enjoyment. I haven’t read it again since I was a teenager myself and kind of don’t want to in case it loses whatever remaining charm it still holds for me.",JudgiestJudy,2023-03-08T22:11:25Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

11m06ix,"I have to disagree. Maybe I was a picky reader as a YA, but man did Eragon fall off the rails after Eldest. I expected so much more from the story, and instead in Brisingr we end up with what felt like close to half the book not even *being about Eragon*, but his god damn cousin with his stupid hammer. 

That doesn't even cover the McGuffin introduced near the end of Inheritance. *That also ends up not even mattering at all anyways for the final battle* >!They literally defeat the final boss by literally going NO U, and making him feel all the suffering he's caused which isn't....

Oh, then they go full HTTYD 3, >!""Everyone sucks, we're taking our bag of holding full of dragon soul orb things, and leaving. No one gets dragons now. Kthxbye"" !<

The ending felt rushed, poorly constructed, unsatisfying, and borderline enraging with the decisions made by Eragon and crew post fighting Shuriken and Galbatorix. There wasn't even a fight, to be completely frank. Shuriken was hyped up so much only to literally be a useless lump. The magic system with the wordsmithing was never really...expanded upon or used in any creative ways. Sure Eragon gets his fire sword...that is just...on magical fire. No fire beams, no learning more spell words to mix and match creative attacks. Nothing. It felt hollow, built up a little then just shelved quietly. 

The first two books were a ride, you were going places, had a mission, and we were growing with Eragon and Saphira. Growing stronger, learning more about each other, gathering strength among ourselves and new friends. The last two books just felt like a slog, with a very unsatisfying ending.

11m06ix,"I loved the concept of the arc, but you can tell that it was written by someone that started at 16, and that hurts a little. There aren't a lot of stories out there where the hero is a teenager, that is the fastest, strongest, smartest, best looking person on the planet, and with good reason.

There was a part of the first book, where  Brom is discussing how to strategically enter this place with a merchant or something. Both had been there before. Brom had a century of experience being a bad ass. And in comes like 15 year old Eragon, who's never left his village of like 12 people and a scared sheep, telling them how it's going to go down.

It was a really cringey part of the story, and I think it just made me even more conscious of how that kept happening throughout the stories. His protagonists are these unstoppable gods, fighting enemies that literally have heart attacks when they get looked at too hard.

Great premise. I would just love to see it reinterpreted by someone that is ok with their protagonists not starting with maxed stats in every attribute, and cheat codes running.

I mean, quick summary.

Within a year, Eragon goes from being an average teen farmer to:

The world's most powerful wizard
The world's best sword fighter 
The world's smartest tactician
Magically good looking
One of the best blacksmith's alive
Mature enough to seduce an elf princess a hundred years older than he is.
And he's able to literally rewrite reality by making up words that he just randomly guesses.

He was literally impossible to beat, except for his Deus Ex Machina. He only lost because Murtagh fell in love. All of the forces of men, elves, dwarves, dragons, urgals and whatever else could have come against Galbatoorix and they would still have lost.

This is an issue because Paolini kept ramping up Galbatoorix' power to make him a bigger and bigger threar, and ended up writing himself into a corner. He had to introduce a Deus Ex Machina because it's impossible for him to have lost any other way.

However, the swords of *Eragon* have a more Arthurian mythology bent to them - as in they have names - whereas the *Star Wars* lightsabers are more akin to ""tools"".

""I'm 16 and I'd love to romance an elf lady!"" When I was a teenager I thought it was awesome too.

But obviously he got older and became an adult and by the last one he realized ""I wrote a 15 year old who falls in love with a hundred year old mature elf, he's only 17 at the end of the series, there's no way I can actually write that.""

And like, yeah. Eragon having a crush on Arya is fine, but a romance was just off the table.

And I don't know if he'd ever plan to revisit the possibility of that romance later on, but Eragon leaving the country at the end of the series is probably the only way it could happen.

It is genuinely impressive to complete a book, period. It’s a *lot* of work. And he did that when he was a teenager. The effort is there.

I still stand by my opinion on the quality of the result. I think it’s fun… I just don’t think it’s very good.

Please understand, I don’t think any less of anyone for enjoying this series. I’m a fan of frankly *far worse* media than this.

11m06ix,"Yeah, out of all the things to complain about in these books, I hate that everybody focuses on Eragon and Arya. One of my pet peeves is every single female character always needing a love interest and this series was really good with not going down that road, and when it did (like with Eragon's cousin and his eventual wife) it felt more natural as a result. 

Arya and Eragon following that route would just have given me incel-ly ""nice guy gets the girl"" vibes; Arya certainly cares about Eragon but I never once felt that she loved him and she made that very clear on multiple occasions. I honestly think Eragon even knows this at the end himself; his departure isn't so melancholy just because he has to give up on his first love, but because after losing so much throughout the course of the series he has to give up almost everything he's gained (Saphira excepted) to do what he thinks is right. If you want to complain about the ending, picking on that makes more sense than saying he didn't get the girl.

Even if you approach it from the perspective of Arya being willing to start a relationship with Eragon by the end, it's still a good ending that makes more sense for them to not be together. Relationships being made impossible just as a result of circumstance is also a real occurrence, and it's not uncommon. Arya would absolutely choose to stay and fulfill her responsibility as queen of the elves and the newest dragon rider, and even if Eragon stayed it doesn't seem possible for him to be in a relationship with her as queen given how much importance is place on young elves and the need to replenish their already small population after the war.",PrisonerLeet,2023-03-08T23:31:31Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
17getme,"My youngest daughter had a significant reading issue when she was young. She was (is?) mildly dyslexic and struggled with reading, even See Spot Run type of books. She was held back in 2nd grade - she couldn't connect enough of the text to make a 'story' and just hateded reading. She and I started reading in bed before going to bed. Her sisters were all about Harry Potter, so we started with that. As the stories unfolded, she learned the wonder of books, and began to read more on her own.

A few years later, her cousin gave her Eragon for Xmas; she inhaled it. We bought the other books in the series for her. She adored them. 

When she was in JH, I was flipping through the channels and saw Eragon, I vaguely remembered the name and jumped in a half an hour into the story. It was execrable and I turned it off after a bit.  But the story premise was interesting and I knew we had the series so I started the read. 

Like a number here have said, the first book was obviously written by a young author looking for a voice. The later books were much improved, I don't remember that the third installment was as interminable as some here indicate. The fourth book came out and I reread the first three to refresh, and I was very disappointed in the ending, it seemed a setup for this next tome.

17getme,"These were my favorites as a kid. I read Eragon maybe 30+ times, and my copy is all taped together. I read Eldest maybe 12 times. By the time Brisingr dropped, I had kind of aged out of it, and I only read it twice: once initially, and once again when Inheritance dropped. That book I only read once, and I only remember one major plot point from it >! about the vault of souls and what’s inside. I don’t even remember if Eragon faces Galbatorix and who wins? !<

I’ve spent months reading a chapter aloud to my wife before bed and it’s been fun to see her experience this for the first time. She has theories and predictions, and now that we’re midway through the books I don’t remember as well, it’s been an exciting experience. I can’t wait to see how it ends! 

>! For example, in Eldest, she insisted that Murtagh was still alive and predicted that he would bond to the red dragon on the cover. However, when his familial ties to Eragon were revealed, she SHOT out of bed, slackjawed and sputtering !<

I will say that Book 3 is DRAGGING a lot. A lot of these chapters feel unnecessary, like they could’ve been avoided with better narrative choices. The books seem to get slower-paced as they go on.

As far as the fantasy world being derivative, I think that’s almost unavoidable. If you read a fantasy book, it’s either “this rips off Lord of the Rings” or “oh cool this deviates from Lord of the Rings.” LOTR is still the axis. For me, this series is just like I get a helping of extra LOTR, and I’m grateful.

But Darth Vader basically doesn't exist in Eragon, Eragon has to learn to read in order to track down the people who killed Uncle and over time discovers who they are. Eragon meets with the rebels and they throw his companion in prison for being the son of a bad guy. In the final fight of the first book, Eragon is crippled by the enemy and becomes unable to function alone, and so travels to the Elves (who also have no star wars corollary) to learn more and try to still be useful in some way despite his being unable to fight or cast difficult magic.

17getme,"It is pretty transparent from interviews that he wants to use the belt for a later story, but it wouldn't work to have Eragon have it in his possession. Eragon HAS to lose the belt, and it has to be on-screen. 

I actually really, really liked the climax of the book. We have known from the beginning that Eragon could NEVER hope to match his power. Most fantasy series end the story with the heroes finding out they can easily defeat the BBEG with friendship or by trying really hard. 

That's not what happens in this story. Galbatorix has been around for over a hundred years. He crushed all of the riders a century ago. His victory already came and went, this is just maintenance. Eragon, a boy who had less than two years of training, isn't going to defeat him at his own game. 

I love the climax because the way he is defeated follows a running theme throughout the books of introducing riddles and puzzles. The solution to a problem is NEVER the most obvious one. Through all four books the greatest victories the main characters achieve come not through force of arms or sheer power, but by problem solving and ingenious thinking.",Full_Plate_9391,2023-10-27T01:47:47Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

So my question I suppose is; how do you feel about the Eragon movie and how it represents the story and universe that you created?

g4vfqt,"OOH, OOH, I’ve actually been wanting to ask this for years!!!

WHAT IN THE *HECK* KIND OF ELDUNARÍ WAS IN LORD BARST’S BELLY????

((It’s been about a year since I’ve read the series last so please forgive any lapses in memory/details))

Now, maybe I’m misunderstanding a lot, but: 

1. The bigger the dragon, the bigger the Eldunarí, and the more powerful it’ll be. 

2. Magical wards expire with the strength of the caster. Deflecting/protecting with wards wears down the caster significantly.

3. Wards don’t last suuuuper long, especially when taking heavy fire. From the examples of wards deteriorating in battles, Eragon and others have had to refresh them quite often, and use large amounts of energy stored before the battle. (Granted, they’re not as powerful as dragons in the first place, so an Eldunarí *would* be naturally better at warding)

4. I’m under the impression that the storage space in Lord Barst’s armor was on the small side, giving his stomach a bulge not much bigger than an average beer belly. Enough to fit like...a four or five inch diameter Eldunarí? Maybe a couple?

It seems to me that in order to have the level of protection Lord Barst has, he’d have to have access to an *insanely* powerful Eldunarí.

He face tanks HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of blows with all sorts of weapons and catapults and teeth, claws, and horns, and it takes (hours?) to take him down.

Wouldn’t he have needed an Eldunarí so powerful that it would be too large to carry? Especially within his stomach-armor-thing? Or maybe he just had multiple Brom-Ring-levels of energy stored in various jewels throughout his armor? 

Whatever the outcome, it still completely blows my mind, and the battle of Urû’baen is my favorite of the series. (While I’m here, I gotta say—I am ***SO*** pleased with how you wrapped up that final fight!!!! Absolutely flawless!!!!) 😊

1. Who would have a final say in potential conflict of interests between Arya and Eragon? Theoreticaly Eragon have higher political position but I can't quite imagine him bossing her around. Is it going to work like 2 kings in Sparta or something?
2. Does Arya have higher possition than other kings because of her being a dragon rider? Will elvish houses try to influence riders through Arya? And in overall, how is this girl going to manage all the responsibilities you're placing on her shoulders?
3. Who will be training young riders before a trip to Mount Arngor and who is going to be the next egg courier (is it still Arya?)
4. How will new order ruling structure look like? Is it still going to be one lider and a council? Who will be directly managing riders once they go back to Alagaesia?
5. How will Eragon keep track of all the events taking place in Alagaesia? Just by Eldunarya and scrying mirrors or will he have his own metode

On dragons:

1. Is the newly hatched dragon bonded or wild?
2. How far will two-legs be involved in raising wild dragons? Will they just raise a few and then let the rest take remaining eggs and Eldunarya of wild dragons to let them be ""as wild as possible""?

On human tribes:

1. Where do they came from? Are they the same people who came to Alagaesia with king Palancar?
2. Can humans from wild tribes living next to Mount Arngor become dragon riders? Will we see such riders in upcoming books?

On war and politics:

1. Why didn't dwarves and elves want more for participating in war? (Come on! Their casualties were severe and they got almost nothing for it!)
2. Will relations between the races (for example dwarves and humans) still be so peacefull and friendly in the future?
3. How Imperium's political system used to work like? It seems a bit like european feudal system but why then there is no landlord in Carvahall or other villages?
4. Did the war made an impact on Imperium's society (like improving villagers laws or reducing a number of nobility)? And how about other races?

Games:

1. What are the rules of Maghra, runes and other games being played in Alagaesia?
2. Will fans ever get a merchandize connected to this games or official set of rules to play on our own?

Arya's current true name is it wavering as in it could change at a moments notice thus leading her to accept that she is in love with eragon. 

Man this true name thing is well.. if it encompasses the smallest of the small and the biggest of the big then Arya's current true name should have changed by now cause she has started to like Eragon doesn't that mean it should have reflected in her true name by now thus causing the change from her current to a new name??",Flatweb23,2020-04-24T13:46:02Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I have a couple questions for you:

1. What are your own favourite books? I always love hearing about what my favourite authors like to read.

2. On your website, you wrote a post titled “Writing Tips for Aspiring Writers”. On the first tip, you recommend us to take a well-written book and study it. When you say this, do you mean literally breaking down the grammar of the sentences and figuring out the nuts and bolts of how that sentence works?

I have a few questions. I check up every couple of months to see when TSIAOSOS was coming out, and this made my day hearing it’s ready! What was it that drew out the process? Is it a long complex story? or was it more difficult to write?

Tangentially, I’m writing a series of my own. I have several chapters over the course of the series written, but I get stuck fleshing out characters and the different languages, the world building of it it. How do you advance in your writing when you get stuck on something, whether it be narrative or otherwise?

1. Tornac: Did Murtagh actually get his hors (which he named after his teacher) before or after leaving Uru'baen? If he gets him before, why did he name him after his teacher? wasn't that very confusing? 
I remember him saying that he got his horse when he was still a foal so it should have passed quite some time between him geting the horse and the first meeting with Eragon. 
--> fun fact: The guys who translated your book to german got quiete confuse whith you naming Murtaghs horse and his teacher the same. So in the first book when Murtagh and Tornac left Uru'baen in the german version the horse got killed nod the human Tornac... it's something that confused me since my teenager years, luckyli 25 year old me reread the book in english and know everything makes more sense xD 

2. Did Brom know of Murtags existence? 

3. Did Brom ever consider to save Murtagh from his father and the king? For exempal after Selena died? 

4. Will we ever learn more about Tornac and Murtaghs childhood in the books to come? I really think Tornac is an underrated character so far and I would love too learn more about him.

Anyway first I would like to say thank you for making this awesome book series. It was my introduction as a kid to the fantasy genre and it has even inspired me on creating my own piece of fantasy! 

Now if you are still reading these, I have a question. 

Why Eragon had to leave Alagesia? 

Dragon Riders are supposed to be the defenders of Alagesia so why Eragon has to leave? Also isn't it easier to simply rebuild the old Dragon Rider stronghold using magic with the help of the Edlunari than journey to the empty sea not knowing if anything is there after all, or if their supplies will last?

And he dismisses Alagesia which is an entire continent by not having a place which is remote enough. 

Apologies if my question seen rude, English is my first language. I just fail to see Eragon's reasoning. 


And one more question. 

Do you read fanfics about your franchise?

The only bookseries I've ever finished (yep, never finished the first harry potter book). Wanted to let you know that these books helped me a lot in my teenage years. 

I hoped for a kiss between Eragon and Arya in the last book. With the years I thought a lot about a kiss between them but end with a weird feeling about it.

I remember reading Eragon when it first came out in grade school. I’m 26 now and graduating grad school in May. Time sure does fly! 

Fun Facts: I actually read Eldest (and I think Brisingr, memory is a little fuzzy) before the real release date. The librarian at our local library got an advanced copy and she saw how much I loved it and let me read them early. She was RAD. If I recall, I’m pretty sure they sent advanced copies out for editing purposes. I helped point out some misspelled words to her. You’re welcome!

Seriously though, those books were my absolute favorite as a kid growing up. They really introduced me to fantasy and I’ve been an avid reader ever since. I just wanted to say thank you! I still have my original copies sitting on my bookshelf.

g4vfqt,"I remember saving up coins and dollar bills for months in a small black purse in order to buy Eragon. I had first seen it in a scholastic catalog in elementary school and I was inexplicably drawn to this book although I had no clue what it was about. When I finally had enough money to purchase the book, I was OVER. THE. MOON. But when I began to read it, it was slightly too advanced for me in the beginning. I did not understand what was going on with the unfamiliar names etc. I gave myself some patience, read it more slowly and I was soon absorbed by the story and became a forever fan. I bought every new book as soon as it came out. I will never forget my love for the series since I saw he first book in the catalog. It is still my favorite fantasy book I have ever read. The characters are just so real and their struggles are so relatable. So thank you so much for writing them.

In case you check back and see this... I have questions...

I've seen that you recommend plotting as instrumental in having a solid first draft; what is your plotting process like and how is that balanced with world building? 

Who are the authors you look to as role models in writing?

Do you develop characters on their own or as they fit into the story? I have a few character ideas but even though I want to have them be the hero I feel like they would end up being a villain and I'm not sure if I should let them or if I'm just trying to shoehorn to much into a character. 

Once you have a character how do you decide what their starting point is? I feel like so many authors rush their characters into being a bad ass that they don't take time to show why they became that way or the other character development that occurred along the way.",Foobidee,2020-04-21T07:00:06Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

How do you handle 1.8k questions (Probably more when this is over)

You said in a previous qna that no one you saw has guessed what was taken from eragon. Has anyone guessed correctly yet?
Can you go into more detail into how the riders political system worked? (Both the dead one and the current one)
What are your thoughts on the r/eragon subreddits thoughts on the movie? (Also what are your thoughts on the movie)
How the heck was barst able to tank so many attacks from the elves? He only had 1 eldunari, and that would probably make him weaker than some of the forsworn who would have had multiple but if (forgive me for forgetting the name I haven’t read the series in a few months) the elves that were guarding eragon could have taken out any of the forsworn then how were they unable to deal with lord barst? 
Will the covid pandemic affect TSIASOS’s release date? Really hyped for it.

Few weird ones (Just stuff I’m curious about ignore if you wish)

g4vfqt,Question I've always had. The arrangement with the dragon eggs is that lines of kids would pass in front of it and the egg would possibly hatch for one of them. Problem is that you'd have no way of knowing who the egg hatched for. By Eragon it took a while - presumably at least a week or 2 - before Saphira hatched for him. By that point hundreds of kids could of passed before the egg. How would they figure out who the true Rider is? Also what would happen if the egg hatches and someone else sticks out their hand and touches the dragon first?

I know you've answered tons of questions about the relationship that Eragon and Arya have built through the series, but I wanted to know how you put yourself in such a mindset to flesh out their story. Specifically the heartwrenching scene between them in the Agaetí Blödhren. I love how absolutely real that conversation/situation felt between them, as well as how pivotal is was for both of them to allow the relationship to grow to what it is now.

1) Where did you get the inspiration for their relationship, or was it something you just let grow on it's own over time? As a younger teenager reading as the series unfolded it really felt as if us readers were growing in our understanding of relationships alongside Eragon for a while, at least for me.

2) I know it can be weary and monotonous focusing on a single project, do you see yourself at a stopping point for this world you've created or do you plan on continuing for the foreseeable future? I ask because there are just so, so many different views I would love to see. Anything from the viewpoints of the Dwarven gods, the other landmasses and their happenings, to the rambling and possibly incoherent thoughts of Tenga and his possible connection to the Grey Folk or even Galbatorix himself. Of course that's not even considering the standard requests of Angela, Brom, and Murtagh.

3) I've seen before that there is so much going on that you write down many details of the project you're working on, would you ever consider releasing an unpolished/uncensored/behind-the-scenes version of your notes for us to see the world of Alagaesia from your view?

Will Arya visit the new dragons that hatched in your last book?

Will the distance affect Arya's and Eragon relationship? Will they become strangers to each other? Eragon seemed very doomed at the end of Inheritance while Arya, probably because of her age and experience, seemed way more optimistic than him that they would see each other again.

But after a second Angela broke the spell and said something like ""if you knew who I was, you wouldn't dare to face me"".

So can you tell us anything more about her, how can she be so wise and powerful?",eXtant_csgo,2020-04-20T17:12:04Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"Hi Christopher, I don't have a question for you but I just wanted to share a memory I have and how much I appreciate it. 

Eragon was one of my favorite books growing up. When Eldest came out you did a book signing at a store in Michigan. A few of my friends came and I brought my hardcover copy of Eragon, that had been read by myself a few times and passed through my family in turn, so the outer sleeve was tattered. I was pretty young at the time and was worried you'd be upset that your book wasn't taken care of. 

I still remember what you had said to me about being excited that the book had been read do many times and just wanted to let you know that all these years later that still is one of the best memories I have about reading. Thank you for the memories and amazing books!",Euro_Lag,2020-04-20T21:24:37Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

So, thanks for writing a book that a young kid and his mom could both find interesting and serve as good bedtime reading material.

I read somewhere once that you wrote the Inheritance Cycle to reflect your own life events. And it's been about a decade since I read them but I remember one of the later books had a fight between Eragon and some mystery assailant in Eragons tent in a military camp and the assassin keeps stopping Eragon from killing him by claiming to be his friend and then continuing the assault once he lowers his guard. Was that inspired by a real experience in your life or was that just something you added to the book?",ColeWeaver,2020-04-21T04:29:21Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"I am very very late to the party, but I have to ask just in case Chris sees it-

In the last book, when Eragon visits Vroengard, there was a rider who turned himself into magical energy and caused a massive explosion, which then rendered most of the island uninhabitable. 

Was this explosion similar to a nuclear blast? I always imagined it to be, because of the similarities the fallout had to radiation (mutant creatures, uninhabitable areas, etc.), but I have always been deeply curious if that is what you intended. I thought it was epic when Galbatorix  went out in a similar way.

Thanks for answering if you see this, I have been a fan of your books since I was 8, and I am excited to have a chance to ask!",braden41500,2020-04-21T05:11:04Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

My question is: how do you come up with the names of your characters?? 

I know that sounds like a stupid question, but for my story, my characters are named by spelling some of my co-workers names backwards. Some of them sound really.... Fantasy-like when pronounced.

And I wanted to say thank you.
 Thank you for sharing your talent with the world, and for persevering in spite of challenges you may have faced. 
The Inheritance Cycle was one of my favorite book series when I was younger, and it continues to remain so even now.
The characters and the worlds they lived within were so colorful and descriptive I had no trouble being easily absorbed by them. 
Your success gives me hope that I can do the same someday with my own writing.

1. Do you think attending a college/university is essential when trying to become a successful author?

2. Probably can’t answer this but will Eragon be the center of the next book or will it embark on a new protagonist with new side characters?

3. Will the new story resemble the height of the riders or is it closer to a handful of riders being chosen? 

4. Will the new book be a new series or only a single addition to the series?

5. Will the world be expanded past the continent and locations we’ve learned or is the main setting remaining like the previous cycle?",Qowling,2020-04-30T15:20:30Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"Hello! I know I'm kinda late, but I just couldn't resist the temptation to jump at the opportunity to say something to you. Thank you so much for making the Inheritance Cycle. Ever since I first started reading Eragon in my school's library, I instantly fell in love witht he series. Not many fantasy novels catch my eye anymore, but your series was revolutionary for me. From the beautifully described landscape to the epic battles waged to the hardships I was taken through with Eragon and the gang, I became truly immersed in the adventures in Alagaësia. New concepts were introduced to me that I hadn't even dreamed of being in fantasy and I loved every one of them. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating the best fantasy series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. You are truly a master of fantasy literature. Anyways, on to some questions.

1. What inspired the idea of the gedwëy ignasia and the mental connection it allows between Rider and dragon?

2. (Spoiler alert for those who haven't read Inheritance) When Galbatorix shouted ""Be not"" in the ancient language, did he literally make himself cease to exist? If so, did he do it just because he knew he was going to lose?

3. How did you come up with the ancient and Urgralgra languages?

4. What's your honest opinion/evaluation about the Eragon movie?

5. What would you say is your favorite part in the series?

6. Since the elves do not have any gods that they believe in, what is their theory about creation?

7. I've heard all the buzz about you working on a 5th book. Is it the start to a new arc or will it just be a big epilogue?

8. Would you be able to see the possibility of the Inheritance Cycle getting a movie reboot or possibly a game? The game would probably be similar to Skyrim, but it'll be its own game with elements from the series and sorry if that sounds like a bad idea. I just would love to see the series done great justice and brought to true life in one of those ways.

Again, thank you for such a wonderful series.",Bite_Sized_Asian,2020-05-01T06:14:57Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

>! Eragon at one point learns about a magic that enables him to drain the life from other living things, and in exchange it gives him a great power.

I always thought that due to the length of the books, they lent themselves to the tv show format.
On another personal note, one of my main aspirations in life, and one of the driving forces in attending film school and becoming a filmmaker for me was to give the books of my childhood who’s adaptations were so butchered, like Eragon and the Percy Jackson series, a chance at redemption as movies/tv shows.",ShootingIn8k,2020-04-20T17:11:38Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

That being said, I felt the movie did not do Eragon justice, it was a disappointment how such a rich story got scraped down to fit Hollywood standards. The ending was lackluster at best.

Guess mine is less of a question and just more of a thank you.

g4vfqt,"Everytime I see you answering about a Murtagh, Brom or Angela book I get a little worried and sad. 

Because I'm still waiting for a chapter with Arya's PoV, I feel robbed of it on Inheritance. We should have got to see Firmen hatching. At least in the deluxe edition. Instead we received a letter from another character. I just feel robbed as a fan of Arya. 

Also, I'm still waiting for the 5 book that will continue the history of ExA. The ending from Inheritance turned me off of reading series for SO long. Because it was so open, so I never felt as it was finished. 

My questions are: 
1. Will we ever have an Arya PoV? 
2. Will book 5 happen before those of Murtagh, Brom and Angela? 
3. Are Eragon and Arya able to communicate through floating boat as they did in Inheritance? 
4. Can we have more chapters or books that showcase the elven helm, their culture and politics? 
5. Can you make another Alagasia Guide as the one I have is with wrong informations (with Islanzadi as the Queen, not Arya). It's a gorgeous book, it just need an update ^^.

g4vfqt,"Mr. Paolini,

Thank you for introducing me to lengthy fantasy novels! Something I'll always remember is begging my dad to buy 'Inheritance' for me the day it came out. Oh, I don't think I've been that excited for a book since!

You have such an ability to illustrate. I could always vividly imagine what you were describing to me. One passage I'll always remember --from 'Inheritance' I think -- it's when Saphira, Eragon, and Glaedr are flying high, maybe away from the Vault of Souls, I don't recall.

[I found it! It's here on /r/Eragon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/9xjx62/the_sky_is_hollow_and_the_world_is_round_how/e9sxwyk/)

It reads:

>At long last, Saphira detected a slackening of the wind—slight but noticeable—and she began to prepare to fly out of the stream of air.

>Before she could, the clouds above them thinned, and Eragon glimpsed a few glittering specks: stars, white and silvery and brighter than any he had seen before.

>Look, he said. Then the clouds opened up around them, and Saphira rose out of the storm and hung above it, balancing precariously atop the column of rushing wind.

>Laid out below them, Eragon saw the whole of the storm, extending for what must have been a hundred miles in every direction. The center appeared as an arching, mushroom-like dome, smoothed off by the vicious crosswinds that swept west to east and threatened to topple Saphira from her uncertain perch. The clouds both near and far were milky and seemed almost luminous, as if lit from within. They looked beautiful and benign—placid, unchanging formations that betrayed nothing of the violence inside.

>Then Eragon noticed the sky, and he gasped, for it contained more stars than he had thought existed. Red, blue, white, gold, they lay strewn upon the firmament like handfuls of sparkling dust. The constellations he was familiar with were still present but now set among thousands of fainter stars, which he beheld for the very first time. And not only did the stars appear brighter, the void between them appeared darker. It was as if, whenever he had looked at the sky before, there had been a haze over his eyes that had kept him from seeing the true glory of the stars.

>He stared at the spectacular display for several moments, awestruck by the glorious, random, unknowable nature of the twinkling lights. Only when he finally lowered his gaze did it occur to him that there was something unusual about the purple-hued horizon. Instead of the sky and the sea meeting in a straight line—as they ought to and always had before—the juncture between them curved, like the edge of an unimaginably big circle.

>It was such a strange sight, it took Eragon a half-dozen seconds to understand what he was seeing, and when he did, his scalp tingled and he felt as if the breath had been knocked out of him.

>“The world is round,” he whispered. “The sky is hollow and the world is round.”

*“The world is round,” he whispered. “The sky is hollow and the world is round.”* I remember reading that for the first time... it was so, so awesome!


A question for you, if you've got the time: I'm a horrid storyteller. It's exceedingly difficult for me to get what's in my head out my mouth, verbally or on paper. **As an author, how do you evoke certain feelings and images from your readers in a concise manner? How do you say (or write) exactly what you wish?**


You've gotten me all excited to read (again), maybe I'll give your new book a shot!

Big thank you!",-Bodhisattva-,2020-04-20T22:26:24Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"I'm a bit starstruck! My new years resolution was to get back into reading. The first thing I picked up was Eragon. I read the cycle and enjoyed it more as an adult (I didn't realize how poor my concentration was in the past). No other books have ever had me day dreaming as I drive, staying up late for ""just one more chapter"", wishing for more. There are no boring parts to me, every scene adds a stitch to the tapestry that makes Alagaesia more real. I also love that it didn't all the up neatly in a bow at the end. When I finished this time around, that bittersweet feeling stayed with me all day. 
I also love reading that you were inspired by Brian Jacques. Redwall got me into reading. I read The Pearls of Lutra and The Long Patrol so many times the spines dissolved. I definitely see elements of Jaques in Eragon.
 
I don't have any questions, just extending gratitude for sharing a part of yourself that touched my life so significantly.",teatimefortim,2020-04-20T22:50:45Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"When I first read your books I found out how young you were when you wrote Eragon. I thought to myself I wanted to be able to do the same kind of thing. Well, I procrastinated and my interests changed over time so I never even finished a rough draft of anything. But honestly, I think it’s been a good thing, because I feel like I’m a much better writer then I was when I was in high school. But I’d like to know, how close was your first draft of Eragon to its published version? Besides the editing and revisions, was it of a fairly professional quality, or was most of the quality gained after revising?",Hawkman98,2020-04-20T22:58:16Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

g4vfqt,"My husband and I have struggled to find a good couple hobby, but we decided to start reading together and started Eragon last summer (he’s in medical school and doesn’t have much free time).  I had already read the Cycle like 10 times before but now it’s so fun to hear his theories and predictions. He accurately predicted that Murtagh would be the rider for the red dragon on the cover of Eldest. We’re about 100 pages in on inheritance and he has no clue who the rider for the green dragon will be!!!!

Your books have brought us closer and I’m so excited to read something new to both of us next! We plan to read your new book when it’s out, so my question for you is: what else should we read next?!?!",chocolateeyes,2020-04-21T00:01:56Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"Hi Chris,

Big fan since I was young and the Inheritance Cycle is still on my Audible rotation. Not gonna lie though, the ending hit me like a brick when I was a teenager and I was a bit disappointed Eragon decided to fly away into seclusion. Anyways my question is about the Belt of Beloth the Wise. It seemed like a bit of a Chekhov's gun but I can't remember there being a situation in which Eragon wouldn't have got by without it and then BAM it's gone before the final battle. The wiki article says Eragon couldn't even scry it after defeating Galbatorix using the Name of Names. So my question is what was its purpose in your opinion?

Thanks again!",monsterosity,2020-04-21T00:47:45Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
g4vfqt,"Hey Chris. I'm not gonna pretend I have a question to ask, I just want to express my sincere gratitude for your work and, especially, how young you were when you did it. I was very young when *Eragon* released, and I vividly remember being sucked into it immediately. It engaged me in a way no book had before, and few have since. It instilled within me a desire to hold that spark, to be able to create a world that others would enjoy and get invested in just as much as I had.

My mom is a bookworm hardcore, and a massive fan of Lord of the Rings, so I always had this view of authors as crotchedy old men and women who were profoundly experienced in life and had all these experiences to draw on - so when I read you had written Eragon at 15/16, it unlocked that mental door for me. It opened up a whole new passion and gave me the closest thing to a 'life goal' I could say that I have, in that I want to be able to stick to an idea long enough to write my own novel about it.

So, thank you, Chris, for giving me a dream. You're an absolute inspiration, and I really have to get back to reading actively so I can check out your latest work. Thank you for everything you've done - you're an idol to me. I'll do my best to stay focused and put something out there someday.",RTSUbiytsa,2020-04-21T01:45:03Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I was a lonely kid, and it meant a lot to have far away worlds with friends like Eragon. I hope book 5 is in the works soon! Any hope for Arya and Eragon working things out? I’m a sucker for romance stories and can’t help but root for them. 

This AMA makes me want to reread these books. I’m late so you probably won’t see this, but really, thank you so much for writing these books. Your stories comforted me when I was a kid, reading about Eragon, feeling his triumphs and failures (God I cried so much when Brom died), and they stuck with me all these years.

g4vfqt,"Just wanted to stop and say thanks for writing my favorite series of all time. It has such a fantastic story, world and characters, the best system of magic i’ve ever read and is the only one that truly quantifies and grounds it in rules, and such a satisfying overall arc in which all the characters grow and the world changes dramatically. The ending is among the best you could ask for in any medium. 

Only question off the top of my head that I haven’t already seen is whether with Disney’s acquisition of 21st is there a chance for a reboot of Eragon either as a movie or as a series akin to Netflix’s the Witcher? Although I think the cycle would adapt to a series much better.

Also how hard was it for you to avoid a more cliché ending where the Hero overpowers the villain, and instead making such a miraculous and unexpected path to victory? And did you know all along that was how you wanted it to end or did you come up with it somewhere aong in the writing of the cycle!

Thanks again, and congrats on the near completion of what will surely be a big hit.

I do have one question that always bugged me though: after Galbatorix is defeated Eragon and Saphria share their true names but I always wondered how their true names stayed the same and did not change after such a huge life event just happened. A part of their life, a huge chunk of who they were is now over. And with Murtagh it seems all it took was a smaller event to alter his true name. So just curious about this is all.

g4vfqt,"Wow this is such a cool and unexpected AMA! I'm a college student now, but I remember reading the Inheritance Cycle way back in middle school, and it's still one of my favorite fantasy series to this date. I know you've collaborated to create in the past to develop an Eragon movie and video game, but I always felt that the movie and game were too short to do justice to the original novel. On top of that, there have been huge leaps in production technology that could display Alagaësia in a new, magical way. I was wondering, have you every considered conveying the Inheritance cycle in a television series or perhaps even rebooting with another video game studio? If you have, how difficult is that process and are you more concerned with a studio staying true to your original work or creating a quality product overall? I ask this specifically after seeing how reknowned the Witcher books have become after the author collaborated with CD Projekt Red to create that amazing trilogy of games and moved onto to make the Netflix Original. Or even after seeing how the Game of Thrones show brought GRRM's works to light. Anyways, thanks for taking the time to do this!",rodayalpha,2020-04-21T12:40:37Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

g4vfqt,"Thank you so much for writing the Inheritance Cycle! I remember first reading Eragon when I was in 3rd grade. It was basically my introduction into why I would love fantasy, writing and reading. 

My question to you is what advice could you give to someone on world building? What I still remember about the series was the attention to detail, the language you made and the world itself.

How did you find your characters and plot changed throughout your writing? Did you have a pre-plotted outline or let them involve as you worked through it?

Thank you!! x",ValerianKeyblade,2020-04-20T17:08:29Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Also, I remember emailing you some years ago with questions that I had about the Inheritance books. I don't remember when it was, or what those questions were, but I was relatively young at the time it meant the world to me that you took time out of your busy schedule to satisfy my curiosity.

Publishing: first step, write a book. Hopefully one people want to read. Then figure out if you want to self-publish or if you want to go through the traditional submission process with an agent/publisher.

g4vfqt,"Hi! Thanks for reading the books! Glad to hear they've been of some help to you.

To quote from an answer elsewhere in the thread:

""We lived/live in the middle of nowhere in Montana. My parents had self-published (via print-on-demand) an educational book while I was writing Eragon. As a family, we decided to do the same with Eragon. We paid to print all the books -- couldn't afford more than fifty at a time -- and did all the promotion ourselves, which involved me cold-calling schools, stores, and libraries in order to set up author events. It was a TON of work, and we didn't have any help from anyone in the traditional publishing industry.

We quite literally bet all our savings on Eragon. If it had taken another month or two to turn a profit ... we would have had to sell our house, move to a city, and get whatever jobs we could. Makes for a great story after the fact, but it was rough as hell living through it.""

Knopf approached us after we'd been promoting the book for about a year. We sold around 10,000ish copies of Eragon ourselves, mostly in schools.

Do your research. It's easier to get published now than at any other time. And don't give up!

g4vfqt,"Lotta great questions here. Let's see:

1. No one. They're of equal standing. The rest of Alagaësia might give Eragon a bit more standing, but the elves will side with Arya, and the elves are not to be trifled with. Plus, they're both Riders now.

2. Arya's position among the other leaders is high because of the amount of military and economic (and magical) power she wields. Not just because she's a Rider.

3. Yes, Arya and the elves will oversee the first stages of training for Riders whose eggs hatch in Alagaësia prior to traveling to Mount Arngor.

4. You'll have to wait to read Book 5 to find this one out. 

Dragons:

1. No comment.

2. Humans/elves/dwarves and even some Urgals will be *very* involved in raising the young wild dragons, since Saphira is the only semi-grown dragon around who isn't an Eldunarí.

Human tribes:

1. They came to Alagaësia later.

2. Any human could become a Rider (in theory).

War & politics:

1. The dwarves are going to get a huge amount from reopening trade with the humans. The elves don't care to expand their territory much beyond Du Weldenvarden. These things will be explored in greater detail later.

2. No comment.

3. Morzan actually held title over the lands of Palancar Valley at one point. When he died, Galbatorix assumed control over his properties. Thus, Palancar Valley was essentially owned by the state, not any one noble/earl.

4. Huge impact. Again, something that will be explored in later works.

Games:

1. Hmm. I'll see about getting some rules posted on my website in the future.

2. The merchandise situation is tricky, as Fox owns a lot of the rights (they bought them along with the movie).

The Grey Ones messed up a whole bunch of spells, which poisoned the land and nearly destroyed their society. The Ancient Language was essentially weapons control for magic.",ChristopherPaolini,2020-04-20T20:43:13Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I wrote a lot as a teenager, but Eragon was the first thing I wrote that was longer than, say, ten pages. I first had the idea for the story back in 1997, and it didn't get published by Random House until 2003. So it was an overnight success that took ... six years. Lol.

No doubt there will be conflict between Eragon and Arya at some point. Things aren't so simple as you say.

As explained in the book, Eragon felt as if he and the Eldunarí would be a destabilizing influence on Alagaësia. Plus, he wanted to protect the new generation of dragons.

The new Riders will be returning to defend Alagaësia once they're trained up. And Arya and Fírnen are still there to help.

Fixing Vroengard would have been incredibly hard, given the magical/radiation poisoning it had.

While there, they visited the cairn where the elves had burned Glaedr’s body and then buried Oromis underneath a great oak tree that they had sung from the depths of the earth.

g4vfqt," ""When  I was writing the first draft for Eragon, I needed to invent a  word  that meant fire; it was supposed to come from an “ancient language”   that is almost always used with magic."" (Some very skilled masters of   magic can use it without using the language, although risking a stray   thought or feeling distorts the results of the spell, which could be   deadly.) ""Since my parents owned a dictionary of word origins, I pulled   it off the shelf and flipped through it. Eventually I found an obscure   Old Norse word, brisingr, that meant fire, and because I loved it so   much, I decided to base the rest of my language on Old Norse. To find   more words, I went online and dug up various Old Norse dictionaries,   although I have been known to invent a word now and then when the story   requires it! As far as the grammar and pronunciation of my “ancient   language” go, they bear absolutely no resemblance to Old Norse as I   wanted to give it my own twist.""

Also  check out Uralsa Le Guin's Earthsea series. Pretty much codified and  popularized the entire concept of True Magic.

It's story structure and the different scenes that are required as part of the Hero's Journey that most good stories have.   A specific Han Solo scoundrel character, or the wise wizard, aka Obi-Wan similarities and other pieces are NOT directly part of the Hero's Journey.   The ""mentor"" and ""Helper"" are but these are vague terms, not specific characters.

Lucas himself was heavily ""inspired"" by Hidden Fortress by Akira Kurosawa (I would say it's more than inspired but that's another discussion).  But it's clear that Eragon was similarly ""inspired"" by Star Wars.

But I just wanted to say that the series with these two actually ended up being a huge formative part of my reading habits.

I LOVED reading the series, and I reread each previous book before reading each release. I *lived* for it.

After the end of your series, because of how it ended, I now go out of my way to get spoiled about whether the main love interests get/stay together at the end of a series BEFORE reading the series because of how devastated I was that they didn't in Eragon.

I went from it being my favorite series at the time to I would have rage quitted it if wasn't basically over anyway. Since then I've never reread the series even once, that's how much it was ruined for me (and I reread other series that I love DOZENS of times).

I also typically do not read ongoing series until they come to a conclusion because of this.

So yeah, I'm still salty about it almost a decade later, so I suppose that speaks to your writing skills and how good your story could have been, but at least you taught me to do my homework before reading a series so that I don't get my heart broken again.

&#x200B;

If you're a big fan of this, I would highly recommend Brandon Sanderson's adult novels. They're epic fantasy with very intricate and interconnected worldbuilding, magic systems, and plot. His writing in certain aspects can be a touch on the YA side which is probably the main criticism against him, but it doesn't sound like that would bother you at all. His main series are also all part of the Cosmere and take place in the same universe, and if you really pay attention there's an absurd amount of subtle hints, details, background references, and hidden plotlines that you'll only catch with multiple read-throughs and careful cross-referencing. Mistborn and Warbreaker are common recommendations for good starting points, though The Way of Kings is also fine if you don't mind diving headfirst into a big complex epic fantasy where it will take a little while to figure out what's going on (though if you read Dune and enjoy it, WoK is similar so you should be fine in that regard as well, and Dune is pretty awesome).

Then the second book came and although it was a little slower paced than the 1st, I enjoyed it too. The Roran story was fascinating.

After that it went downhill pretty quick. The 3rd book wasn't that bad yet, it had good moments. I just feel like Paolini got a bit inconsistent with his story as the time went on. I began to question the logic of the plot.

But the 4th book... man. It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life. It felt like Paolini lost his ideas at this point and tried just to close the story. The ending was just so antyclimatic. You build a narrative of a terrible king that rules the entire known world, he is described as the most powerful entity in the universe - and he is dealt with within as many pages as George Martin describes a fancy garden.

I finally found the hardback at a garage sale and it's been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years because I moved away from home and left the first three books at my old house.

Anyway, I remember I really liked the first two books, even though the first book had some random shit like a chapter being 3 pages long. But Eldest...that was fire. A great book. I did have some minor issues like dragons instantly becoming geniuses and the elves just being so much better at everything and everyone, but that's standard fantasy stuff.

I don't remember liking Brisingr quite as much. I think it's because it had a lot of stuff that I felt just wasn't needed, though the beginning few chapters were pretty awesome. Because it was originally one book before it got split into two, right? But it had some neat stuff in there.

I'll read Inheritance...one day.",iamthatguy54,2021-05-14T02:50:57Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

nbpfgt,"The biggest memory of the Inheritance trilogy/cycle that I have is being extremely disappointed with the last book. 
I remember discovering the Eragon book on my own as a teenager, standing in line preordering the sequels at the local bookstore ( which has since closed doors) going through forums , spending hours on Alagaesia.com , reading and being so so impressed with the author who wrote the book at such a young age . After Brisingr I actually gave up reading for a while because I was so so frustrated. 

It has been a ridiculous numbers of years since then but I don't know if I want to go back to it. In hindsight, a lot of YA series are derivative and once you're older you don't enjoy them as much, but the Inheritance trilogy will always be special to me (for many different reasons)",,2021-05-14T07:57:34Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

If there are three books I can credit with my love for reading, it's Halo: The Fall of Reach by Eric Nylund, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief, and of course, Eragon. 

It is always a delight to see you pop up in r/Eragon occasionally and hopefully one of these days I can catch an AMA while it's happening.

Brisingr and Inheritance are my personal favorite, but I do love Eldest and of course, Eragon holds a special place in my heart. The ending and death of Galbatorix was perfect. Death by empathy. It's something I can really relate to as someone who is overly empathetic, so I understand how for a monster like Galbatorix it was too much. And then the way you described Roran's cry of anguish as Eragon left, I almost cried during my re-read last year.

nbpfgt,"# Spoiler Alert

To me at least, she feels too convenient, too idealized. I haven't read it in quite a while, but I think she was lacking internal conflict. Her mother, the queen, died, and she had to step up. I'd like for her internal conflict to be more clear, how does it affect her relationships, etc. If I try to materialize her in mind and talk to her, her dialogue would feel generic and she'd seem empty because she is more of a cookie-cutter character. The princess of the elves who happens upon our hero, Eragon. Perhaps, this is a good argument for Christopher Paolini using a lot of cliches/inspiration from novels of the same genre.

I don't entirely agree that Christopher Paolini is bad at writing female characters as I found that Nasuada was developed well, especially in the prison. We got to see some of her inner conflict and her thought process with how she deceived the guard. 

That said, I think the ending was really powerful and I can still savor the bitterness of parting to this day. Towards the end, Arya was getting developed well, but I think that Christopher Paolini was weak with character development (at least women because Brom's death still haunts me) in the beginning. I can tell that he matured as a writer towards his third book.

I didn't think there was a way to defeat him through conventional mean and I found the spell to be kind of ingenious. I was a bit disappointed that the spell was just cooked up on the fly though. I thought the despair scenes Eragon goes through throughout the book would have given him some idea of how to hurt Galby without actually physically hurting him given his wards would protect from physical injuries.,Altair05,2021-05-14T03:47:08Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

The second turmoil is caused by Eragon and his affection. She knew he fancied her a lot, but she didn't see him that way. This became a very heavy strain on their relationship, but she didn't dare to cut him off because he was the chosen one.

While the latter relationship is seen mainly through Eragon's eyes, we can still see how uncomfortable and conflicted Arya is. I think in this regard Arya isn't a badly written character, but I think it's true that it's a shame that we only get to see her turmoil through Eragon's eyes.",trollokvoltak,2021-05-14T07:59:39Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
nbpfgt,"My thoughts exactly. The whole time I was reading Eragon, I kept thinking this was some idealized elf woman Paolini had just thought up for himself and for Eragon, and I just wasn't feeling it. I understand the elves are supposed to be naturally distant and foreign to humans, but Arya just felt flat. On the other hand, I absolutely love the way Nasuada was developed, from an unassuming minor character to a political mastermind. The fact that she was given her own POV was a good choice I think. I agree, I can definitely see where Paolini matured as a writer and in character development with Book 3 and 4, and the introduction of new characters and new races. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he set up Arya to be a certain way with Book 1 (which he wrote as a teenager) and kinda had to stick with it until the end, haha. 

A side story or something with Murtagh, I'd actually enjoy. IMO I found his character to be confusing and frankly kinda annoying. His whole relationship with Eragon felt surface-level and I also just felt no closure whatsover when he broke free of Galbatorix's control. That being said, I think if I read more from his POV and got a better sense of his ""complexity,"" I feel I could thoroughly enjoy his character better.",ghost_sharked,2021-05-14T16:38:33Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
nbpfgt,"It’s been a hot minute since I read the series as well, but when I think back to Arya’s character I don’t remember her really having a conflict at all. External ones, sure; she was in lots of fights. But internal ones, Eh.

They brought up how one of the elves that died protecting her and Saphira’s egg was kind of like her partner I think, and she mentioned how she was upset that she was gone. But she never really showed signs of grief for him.

If I remember correctly, her relationship with her mother was supposed to be a little bit strained, but I don’t recall that having much bearing on the story or her.

Her “relationship” with Eragon felt very one sided, she never really showed much interest in him other than platonically. There wasn’t really anything shown about her wanting to be with him but having to choose her duty instead, or not being over her old partner, or not being able to get over their age gap or race differences. It was just Eragon texting “you up?” And Arya leaving him on read lol.

And throughout the story she never struggled with much, she never grew, she never had to overcome anything. From what I can remember at least. So it’s like she’s just a fantasy version of a manic pixie dream girl.

I’ll have to read the series again to see if this is how it really is, if my perception of her holds up. But yeah I recall her being less of a character and more of a prop.",Rybur525,2021-05-14T08:03:53Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Just needed the right push, and Eragon did it. Like the first Eragon that ended a war because of empathy, he ended a war because of empathy. I could write a whole text o why I love this ending, on the psicological side of seeing your own shadow exposed to yourself in such dramatic way, to the importance that Eragon could do magic the way dragons do, how was simbolic that it was a wordless spell, etc, etc.

17dzikn,"I am 34 now, but read Eragon as a tween/teen. I just re-read them last year and... wow. They aren't bad books, and they are WAY better than anything I could write right now or ever.

But... the books come with so, so much cringe. The Eragon and elf-girl non-romance. It began to feel like Eragon is an incel. Even though he could fuck literally any non-elf consensually. 

The elves were made so powerful that the author had to magically make Eragon basically-an-elf for his existence to make sense.

The most glaring issue of the series is that Galbatorix, the most insanely powerful being in the conceivable world, with more magic than anyone could possibly know what to do with, just let everything happen. He did nothing to try to stop Eragon, other than send another corrupt rider after him, which almost worked. He should have been like, ""Oh shit! That other rider almost killed Eragon with 1/10000000000000 of my power? I should go kill him real quick on my own and stay in power.

It isnt like some sort of Sauron deal where the bad guy is tied to Mount Doom/Mordor. Galbatorix can and did fly around briefly. But it just ends up being like, ""What if Superman had power over every facet of life, but kept sending Green Arrow to fight his enemies""

Again, the books were a part of me growing up and loving fantasy. They will always have a place in my heart, and Chris did a great job writing a series for his age.

Eldest was a bit better in that regard but it certainly was still Empire Strikes Back. I also distinctly remember Eragon being pretty insufferable in the book. One page he would be wise beyond his years than the next he would be a whiney little brat. 

When the third book started with the main characters planning a rescue mission I just couldn't do it anymore. I returned the book to the library less than an hour after I checked it out. 

Anyway, those are just my two cents. More power to the people that enjoy it. And despite my feeling I still find it impressive that the first book was written when the writer was as young as he was.",IgnoreMe733,2023-10-22T22:03:42Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Even as a kid I had some complaints like the MC conveniently passing out at the most opportune times, or him having to become half elf, or that one book where a good chunk is one chapter with MC, then one chapter with his brother or whatever with the hammer, then back to one chapter with the MC, and so on.

17dzikn,"The plot twist with eragon's dad was really poorly done, imo. It was almost interesting, then twisted itself back into the most obvious path. 

Also, having read A Wizard of Earthsea, and seeing how hard the magic in Eragon copies earthsea, is kinda annoying. Especially since a wizard of earthsea has deeper things to say about how you the reader should live your life, while eragon is kinda Lotr: Return of the jedi.

Eragon flying away to the distant lands at the end was a perfect example of how the story is just kinda copying things. In LotR, frodo is so destroyed by his experience in the war, and so closed off from other people, that the only way he can find peace is by riding off into the sunset, into the nameless lands where he's never seen again. He dies. 

Eragon does the same thing, except I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be taken as eragon finding peace in death. He's spreading dragon riding culture to other places, he's still around. It feels like he copied the ending of lotr without thinking about WHY frodo disappeared.",Xeynid,2023-10-23T13:30:13Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

This shortcut, coupled with his youth and inexperience resulted in a poorly written and unoriginal story. 

Not only that, but the plot of the early story is basically a fantasy version of ‘A new hope’. Now I know that most stories follow the same plots and this is just another example of ‘the hero’s journey’. There is nothing wrong with reusing this plot line again. 

However, Eragon did not need to be raised by his Uncle in a rural farming community. His uncle didn’t need to die. He didn’t need to be found by the local hermit who happened to be one of the only remaining practices or a fabled magic. He didn’t need to be one of the next generation of these fabled magicians. His biological father didn’t need to be one of the main antagonists and magic users. The old guy didn’t need to die. He didn’t need to go and find an even older magician to continue his training. I am sure I am missing more examples, but you get my point.

The most annoying part of the whole series is how he gets those prophecies in book 1, and nothing substantial comes of it really. Literally the only reason he leaves and never comes back is because the prophecy said thats what happens. Same with him not getting with Arya. 

I do think the series overall does a decent job of setting up Galbatorix. Although his defeat was dumb. They set him up to be too powerful. So the only way the heroes could actually win is if he defeated himself. After 4 books of set up our final confrontation is like half a page. And Galbatorix wins.

First Harry Potter was barely 200 pages, but every book after 4 exceeded 600. You see it a lot with other series like Percy Jackson, where the fast pace and tight plot is what made it special, then move on to Magnus Chase and they just never stop dithering.

Eragon started out with that lack of a reasonable editor, and the series got absurd from there. There was no reason for Inheritance to be half as long as it was, considering there’s like a handful of battles and Eragon disappearing to find himself. I can forgive the series for being really basic hero’s journey material, because that’s part of the charm, but after a certain point it just feels like an author is wasting your time or stroking their ego with a 200,000 word slog.",cats4life,2021-03-09T03:52:26Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Ive spent much of the intervening time since first reading that book and now, studying aircraft, and air warfare. Suffice it to say that the average action movie has a more realistic depiction of air combat than Reilly's imagination generated. Id been putting up with the generic action prose and nonsensical description of special forces land warfare - it wasnt great, but it also wasnt my area of expertise.

It obviously was a Mary Sue story for Paolini in which he had Eragon do everything he fantasized about doing himself- falling in love with and having his feelings reciprocated by a much older, wiser, (hot) woman, saving the day on his very own dragon, becoming the sought-after advisor on all things war at the ripe old age of 15...  UGH.  And the page after page after PAGE of made-up language with no translation.

I got really angry with the main character at several points through the story when he did things that were sometimes needlessly cruel.

While the theory works as written by Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces, there are nothing in any Story theory that says:

Princess about to be captured  has to send only hope to young boy on a farm who happens to be the son of a traitor and who is constantly being watched over by the Old Hermit who is secretly a member of an order the Emperor destroyed and who fought with Farmer-Boy dad and keeps a colored sword.

Nothing says:
Old Hermit and Farmer Boys go on an adventure meet a dashing Jack of all trade and together they save the princess. Or that the Old Hermit has to die.

Or:
The heroes are followed to the Rebel base and have to defend it. 

Those are plot points taken from and developed in the exact same order as Star Wars and while it's a good story structure and it's simple, it's fucking Star Wars.

Hell, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, Wheel of Time, Dune, Princess Bride and even fucking Game of Thrones have ""The Hero's Journey"" in them as it was theorized by Campbell and yet, Eragon is just Star Wars.


And I'm just talking about the first Novel here. Let's not talk about how Farmer Boy over here  has to fight a relative before the end of the thing or the 1 000 other stuff that are taken straight from Star Wars.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, as I've said Star Wars has a fucking solid structure. But Paolini stayed very close to it. 

Eragon doesn't have his own ""Hero's Journey"" he has ""Luke's"" most of the time. 

And that's not even talking about how some of the name are straight up coming from Lord Of The Rings.

By the end of book 2, I couldn’t care less about Eragon, his cousin, Murtagh, Arya, any of them. The best written character in the books was Saphira, but even she was beholden to Eragon.

w8gp7m,"It’s not just the pacing. It’s basically everything, but I’ll hit the bulletpoints. It’s a long running joke, that’s not quite a joke, that Paolini has a thesaurus taped to his hand. He loads up his books with 10 dollar words like truncated and splendiferous with only vague notions as to what they actually mean, which in turn makes his stuff  onerous to read, especially when he’s not really saying anything at all. Books like Where The Red Fern Grows manages to deliver maximum emotion without needing the triple word score. And what he was too inexperienced to write, or neglected to load it up with pretentious word-of-the-days, he left to generic phrasing, and continued on. I’ve already mentioned that his stuff is unoriginal, citing Star Wars and LotR, but it’s more derivative than that, since knowing the thing’s true name in order to control the magic is straight out of EarthSea. The journey is D&D game 1 cliche. The plotline doesn’t make sense sometimes, like the Varden. Why are they fighting Galbatorix? He’s not really interfering with them at all. He starts wars and raises taxes, and as far as I can tell, that’s all he does. And if Durza is as powerful as he shows he is at the beginning of the book, why does he need the Urgal things? The characters are cardboard cutouts, and you never really feel an emotional connection to any of them. The female characters are cliches, ie, Arya is the stronger warrior, who will eventually be weaker than Eragon. Nasuada is the strong female leader who eventually gets demoted for Eragon. Female characters are only as good as a stepping stone for Eragon to surpass. And what’s worse is, Eragon is more than a little stupid. He believes everything everyone tells him immediately. Then there’s the plotholes. I don’t even feel like listing them, but I’m sure GoodReads has a forum or two on the subject. It’s just a teenage boy’s hormone-laced fantasy, aimed specifically at other hormonal teenage boys. And the fame from the first book did nothing but turn Paolini from what could’ve been a great talent, into an precocious, arrogant little bastard who treats his fans and everyone around him like stewed crap.

However, good alternatives are A Song Of Ice and Fire by Martin, anything by Tolkien, the Shannara series by Brooks, the Pern series by Anne and Todd McCaffrey, the Wild Magic books by Pierce, the Covenant series by Donaldson, pretty much anything by Feist, the Kingkiller series by Rothfuss, maybe the Dresden Files by Butcher if you like a little noir and comedy with your fantasy.",Shadpool,2022-07-27T10:09:58Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

And iirc Galbatorix was about to attack them anyway, so them preparing is a good move, whether they are neutral or want to get rid of this dark lord.

Why do people need an army to hold a conquered country? Hmmmm

Hey, I know the famle characters could be better, but Eragon has more competent and complex women than most other series.

Arya doesn't fall in love with Eragon which I see as a huge plus and she even manages to do something great at the finale by killing a dragon herself.

And it takes Eragon a lot longer and some training arcs to become stronger than her. Something that some shitty novels do mid book1.

The Traitor I'm talking about is Morzan, who is Eragon's mother husband? (Stepdad is weird in this context.) and was killed by Brom.
I don't know why you wouldn't consider Murtagh a relative of Eragon tho.. 

Like idk... Anakin being Luke's father and who ""died"" fighting Ben Kenobi. There's a twist to that formula in Eragon but the formula is pretty heavily inspired by Star Wars 

A princess sending a mcguffing away isn't original. You are right.
A Farmer Boy being the MC of a Fantasy Setting isn't original either.

A Princess being captured and sending the McGuffin to the Farmer Boy who's being watched by the wish version of Obi Wan Kenobi is some Kurosawa inspired shit. And guess what, that's George Lucas main inspiration. Star Wars is based on something and Eragon is based on star wars. 

You are talking about how each point individually are pretty usual for those kind of story and you would be right. The thing is IT'S ALL the same in the same order (for the first novel at least, then it stays pretty close to it but no more than any other Fantasy YA would.)

Nothing is original and would ever be in this kind of fantasy setting. But this is ticking every star wars plot point one after another in the exact same order, with the exact same specificities. Hell, Princess Bride is the exact same story, because Campbell was right when he theorized the Thousand Faces. But the Specificities of Princess Bride, Star Wars or like Dune are different enough because they weren't based on one another. And you can convince yourself that Eragon happens to take a lot of element from the genre where other novels succeed in twisting those elements enough, it won't change the fact that it's likely not what happened and that Paolini just based his story on Star Wars. 

Take Weel Of Time. It's pretty close too if you think about it that way, yet it's not the exact same story beat for beat. Eragon IS. Why does one feel so derivative and the other one feel like it's own thing? Because one respect the Hero's Journey and the other one is taking point from Star Wars. 

Eragon and Luke are comparable in the sense they are both having the exact same story. Beat by beat.

If, in your eyes, you think I'm lesser of an adult for it then that's on you. It doesn't affect me in the slightest. I don't bash you for reading The Great Gatsby or whatever.

nc8wfc,My biggest takeaway from rereading the Eragon series in my thirties was just how much I had grown. As being around Eragons age when it was written I remember relating quite bit to his journey.

nc8wfc,"The other thing to remember is that many of these series are introductory series for those authors, and the writing will grow and change as the author does. I think the Inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini (Eragon, Eldest, Brisngr, and Inheritance) are a prime example of this. He started writing Eragon at 15, and it clearly shows in his writing. But if you stick with the series, you see his writing style not only improve, but mature. The series grew along with its audience, and you can't witness that until you get to the end of the fourth book.   


It is important to understand the audience the book is trying to impact, and thinking from that age groups perspectives. One example in that series I can point to is romance. In almost every single YA book, there is the standard teenage romance and attractions. In Eragon and Eldest, this is seen in Eragon's Interactions with Arya. But as the 3rd and 4th books continue, we begin to see that not only does Eragon's own perception of the attraction begin to change, but Paolini's writing style, and mature understanding of adult relationships, begins to twist the way the relationship is not only approached from, but how it is interpreted afterwards.",psweeney1990,2021-05-14T18:48:19Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

nc8wfc,"This week I've rewatched How to Train Your Dragon 1. I am 27 and ejoyed every single frame of that movie as much as when I watched it for the first time as a high schooler. That movie's target audience're kids. I watched Coco in cinema twice and cried like a little bitch both times. That movie's target audience're kids.  
While sometimes there's certain gap, I find it that usually the truly GREAT works of art resonate also with people who're outside of the ""target audience"". My younger me loved The Lord of the Rings or The Witcher as much as I now adore some Pixar movies or shounen manga. 

There's also a difference between something being just not your taste and something being bad. i don't enjoy Percy Jackson books, but I can appreciate them because they're well written and fun despite being trageted to younger audience. On the other hand, books like Eragon or Twilight're clearly badly written stories and products of talented, but inexperienced authors.  


And lastly, the art can be bad and you can still enjoy it. Watching The Room in cinema with friends and other students was one of the best cinematic experiences of my life. Hell, bad art can also resonate with you completely unironically.

nc8wfc,"Yes and no.

Targetting kids is not an excuse for being shit. Not an excuse for movies, shows, games, or books.

There are countless examples of creative books, shows and movies aimed at kids or teens that are well done, engaging, and consistent.

You don't get a free pass on plotholes, one dimensional characters, poor pacing, etc. because your target audience is ""whoever can't see this is bad""

Yes, there are topics that are meant for children, you shouldn't expect to fall in love with the premise ""10 year olds run the world for a day"" or something along those lines, or something edgy meant for teens like ""this one quirky, very special, one of a kind person doesn't fit into their oppressive society"" thats fine. If you aren't hooked by those that is ok, just doesn't appeal to you. But you can still spot good and bad writing. 

I hadn't heard people speak badly about Artemis Fowl, well about the movie perhaps, and I am not familiar with Eragon. But, divergent is a pretty silly and flawed story. It is not wrong to call it bad regardless of whether you fit the tatget demographic or not.

I think more important to remember is that you are allowed to like, even love, bad media.

For example twilight and 50 shades are pretty much universally hated and memed on by the internet. And yet, a lot of people still like them, love them even.

I didn't put myself through the books but my girlfriend likes 50 shaded and we watched the movie. Not a very good movie, but we still had fun.
I also have guilty pleasures. The DC shows forb example. The flash makes no sense, is extremely poorly paced with stupid one dimensional characters and nonsense pseudoscience that has no level of consistency. Still watched it all because the drama is serviceable and the high points are very fun to see.
I would not call it a good show, but I still love it.

We can agree that something is not that good and still love it above things that you know is better.

So you love a bad book, or loved it when you didn't know better... so what? 
We can still call out bad content that is clearly only aimed at children or teens becsuse it is bad, without ever judging the readers that liked it.",GsTSaien,2021-05-14T17:05:20Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

My problem with this sub is people like to put so much weight on if a book‘s “quality” is bad or good, when good and bad are completely undefined and subjective terms. A book can be bad or good in one way but not another. Twilight is a great example. Most people here probably turn their nose up at it, but the purpose of Twilight was to entertain. Not to be “good.” And it ultimately entertained millions of people to a pretty substantial degree. That’s pretty damn good by those standards. Somebody else might define “good” to mean something completely different and think Twilight is fucking garbage. And that’s completely fine. I do agree with a lot of the commenters here that “quality” can be separated from target audience, but I can’t remember the last time Harry Potter or Eragon were discussed here where somebody didn’t bring up how they really aren’t “that well written,” as if the point of either of those works were to be literary masterpieces.",Zzqnm,2021-05-14T19:00:44Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I do disagree that it's simply a matter of voting; I do happen to think you're mistaken about Avengers, but not because more people agree with me. Literary criticism is an actual thing. Yes, there will always be an element of subjectivity to art, but that doesn't mean there are no objective metrics. I think it's possible to break down pretty clearly what makes the MCU an objectively ""better"" narrative than the DCEU, and it isn't because of box offices or rotten tomato scores or number of downvotes.

Lots of people like Shakespeare (or will at least say they do) and plenty of people think it's deep and incredibly meaningful; however if you actually dissect what he's doing it's mostly just pop culture that's persisted a real long time. Clever word play, tons of dick jokes, some love stories that don't hold up to even a bit of scrutiny. Just because a lot of people believe his works are high art doesn't make it true. They're just very, very good pop culture.",Oudeis16,2021-05-14T16:09:54Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I reread Eragon a couple months ago and while the writing wasn’t spectacular, I still really enjoyed it because of the nostalgia. The general consensus in online discussions is that it’s a terrible series but those people were looking through the lens of a “matured reading palate”. It’s a book for kids. It doesn’t matter that the writing is subpar or the plot seems lazy because it’s not for people who are conscious of that. All they expect is to read a book about a 15 year old that can ride dragons.

nc8wfc,"Kind of sort of. 

I read the Eragon books when I was in high school and couldn’t finish the series. Why? It’s bad writing. It’s famous because a kid wrote it, no other reason. It’s a gimmick. 

In the case of Twilight I have found that the primary audience it resonates with are teenage girls who don’t have the experience to understand how damaging the book’s concepts are (oh my 120 year old boyfriend left me. Guess it’s normal to sink into major depression for months. Or, it’s so romantic that he breaks into my room to watch me sleep at night!) and people who have unsatisfactory marriages and they need some kind of escapist reading.  

I read a lot of YA outside of being a YA and some of it is fantastic and some of it is bad. Kind of like any type of genre. 

So while I understand the point you’re trying to make.... Does not magically make it a true blanket statement.

So people can have a problem with this books for very valid reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not they fully fall under the target audience umbrella.",Ok_Ad_6626,2021-05-14T17:32:23Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

As Twilight became the series to dunk on I was unabashed to say that the only reason I probably liked it was because I was the target audience. Same with Eragon by the end there.

But some series were blatantly bad. Hunger Games and House of Night are the series I can point to the most of being egregious. With Hunger Games it was a solid first book, then a rehash of most of the themes, followed by some supposed closure for a series that really didn't need the series treatment. Whereas House of Night had a fun yet cliche premise. Vampires, Mary Sue's, and implied adult content. Then it got to the point of no longer even being fun trash and more a blatant cash grab.

There is definitely a difference in target audiences in all fairness. If you stay in that target you may never know better.

A lot of the books you've named are just plain bad. Twilight, for one, is 0/10. Artemis Fowl, on the other hand, gets a 6/10 - and that's because it's too immature for me. If I were of the right age for it, I'd probably rate it better. That's a clear difference between the two.

nc8wfc,"An interesting thought, but I don't really agree. I'm 27 so a little beyond YA target audience at this point, but I've been a long-time enjoyer of YA novels. Some of those books really are much better quality than others. Most of the better written ones are enjoyed and appreciated by many adults because they have good characters, interesting story, relevant themes. Even the things that focus on themes more pertinent to teenagers than adults, like fitting in at school, puberty, youthful insecurity, etc. can still be appreciated by older people because many of us can remember what it was like to be that age and we can recognize a good portrayal when we see it.

Some YA books are entertaining, but ultimately not well-written. Some of the ones you mentioned (I haven't read all) like Eragon and Twilight, and I think Divergent are like that. They're fun to read because the characters are attractive, or have cool powers, but some of those other areas are really lacking. I can see how in that category, you would probably have more teenagers who like them and more adults who don't because adults hopefully don't enjoy lusting after attractive teenage characters and we might get more bored by the formulaic plots. But there are a lot of adult books that are poor quality like that too. People may enjoy them, but it's also totally fair for people to critique them as being bad. They're guilty pleasure books.

There are a lot of YA books I've read that I will happily re-read, recommend to people, and proudly share that I love. The guilty-pleasure ones usually make me cringe to think about now because I recognize that they were not good books and the only reason I liked them was because the main character was hot. Twilight is definitely in that latter category...

So in summary, some books are objectively better than others regardless of target audience. Most YA books that are well-written are actually very enjoyable by adults too. There are poor-quality YA books and poor-quality adult books that people might enjoy reading, but that doesn't mean they're not poor-quality.",fuzzlandia,2021-05-14T23:31:05Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Not because it was a by the numbers fantasy, because I love those, and Norrath remains one of my favorite fantasy worlds, but because how blatantly the plot ripped off Star Wars, how terrible its prose was, and how much of a whiney cringelord shit Eragon himself was. The movie only reconfirmed my Hatred, and Jeremy Irons was far better in Dungeons and Dragons. It was written exactly as you'd expect a 15 year old with parents who own a publishing company would write a book, with 0 editorialization and probably the same number of rewrites. No author should go with the first draft, but I'll be damned if that's not what Paolini did. Say what you might about Drizzt being a Mary Sue edgelord, but R.A.

nc8wfc,"Are you really trying to say that ""there is no bad book""?

No, there are plenty of books that are bad or even straight up terrible, regardless of the audience.

Eragon, Divergence and Twilight series are pretty good examples of such books. By objective measures they are really bad. There are objective criteria that distinguish good pieces of literature from bad pieces of literature. Quality of literature is not a matter of taste or personal preference.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't like those books. You totally can and it's completely fine. But that doesn't make those books any better.",_Peavey,2021-05-15T08:23:36Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I haven't read Eragon, but I think Divergent had the same problem that How I Met Your Mother did.  That is, the author had decided on an ending but flubbed the wind-up.  By the time we got there, the ending that was planned wasn't a natural end to the story.  It felt forced and fake.

&#x200B;

There's a Philip Pullman book called Clockwork, that belabours the point about how you need to wind up the story and then let it happen.  You can't try to force it in another direction.  JK Rowling\* said something similar about the Deathly Hallows as well, that if she got to the point where Harry, Ron and Hermione all stated which one you'd ""obviously"" pick and the choices they made *weren't* obvious in how they'd been characterised to that point, she would have failed.

nc8wfc,"Honestly, as an adult I unironically enjoy plenty of middle grade and YA speculative fiction. A lot of the adult spec fic is just...not good. It's often over-the-top edgy for no good reason, and contains a lot of gratuitous scenes that seem to be put in just to make it seem more ""mature"". Think unlikable characters with sexist views, backstabbing that doesn't seem to fit with character motivations, and sex scenes that just don't seem to fit with the rest of the narrative. Moreover, I've read plenty of adult novels that ramble on about things that could have easily been pared down to make the story less tedious. I want my spec fic to be fun escapism, not an overwrought, grimdark portrayal of human weaknesses.

As an aside, I thought Eragon was universally hated, but every now and again I'll come upon adult fans who not only like the book, but seemingly have no idea about the hate base surrounding it. For the longest time I thought older audiences universally hated it, but apparently not.

Personally, I've read better, but I think Eragon is fine. I like it a lot better than Artemis Fowl. I didn't like Artemis Fowl when I was twelve and I don't like it now. It always felt just a bit too artificial and pandering to me.",TheAtroxious,2021-05-15T10:48:22Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

And I think the relationship with Arya was handled a lot better than a lot of romances in series. He tries to go after the girl he likes, she doesn't overreact and instead handles it fairly maturely, and then they talk it out as the series progresses, and it doesn't take over the plot. And not having them get together at the end was a bold move for that kind of series.

nc8wfc,"Hate is probably a strong word, honestly. It's a... disappointing book. I got hooked on it at first, but after reading Eldest and having it be not great, I reread Eragon and realized how it's very much a book *written* by a teenager. It has all these ingredients I should like, but the whole product is just kinda bland. That opinion only deepened as I got older and read much better books. I hold a little bit of a grudge for that disappointment, I guess, even if it doesn't really make sense. A lot of people have similar experiences of realizing that it just wasn't as good as they thought.

It's also a popular choice for people either getting back into reading by reading the one book they remember from high school, people who are new to fantasy, or people who haven't reread it and just have nostalgia for it, which means it gets posted here a lot. I think that fosters a little resentment with a lot of the userbase.

nc8wfc,"It's not just a similar ""hero's journey"" trope, most of the major plot points and character roles are almost exactly the same.


Young man who never knew his parents raised on a remote farm by his uncle finds a blue and white object sought after by the evil empire. Young man goes to senior-aged acquaintance for information and is told about the ancient order of peacekeeping warriors with mystical powers. The acquaintance was himself one of these warriors, and gives the young man one of their weapons. Agents of the empire kill young man's uncle, young man and old mentor leave on their journey together. Mentor is killed by a powerful agent of the empire, a rebel princess is rescued from prison, when the young man joins the rebels his traveling companion doesn't but still helps in the big battle. Young hero wins the big battle with a well-placed attack. After the battle, hero goes to train with a surviving member of the warrior order hiding from the empire. Leaves before his training is complete to help his friends, is defeated by emperor's right hand man, given a crippling injury, and it's revealed that they're family.

Some of the events happen a bit out of order and some of the roles played by Star Wars characters are split between multiple Eragon characters but it's all there. Luke is told right away that that his father and Obi-wan were Jedi, Eragon doesn't learn this until later. Durza and the Ra'zac play the role of the emperor's right hand in the first book, Murtagh takes over the role later and adds the family relation twist, and even betrays the emperor at the end of the series just like Vader.

If you like a book, read it. If you don't like it, put it aside and start a new one!

If you're looking for fantasy in general and something that's easily digestible, one of my first reading reccs in general is Discworld by Terry Pratchett. It's a huge series, but pretty easy to dip in to. There are several ""sub-series"" following recurring groups of characters, but you don't necessarily need to start from the beginning of any of them. I'd recommend *Small Gods* (a standalone), *Guards! Guards!* (the first in the ""City Watch"" sub-series), or *Mort* (sort of halfway between a standalone and the start of the Dᴇᴀᴛʜ sub-series). The books are mostly light-hearted, but Terry Pratchett was a master of making a book be a satire or allegory for something else, while also making it fun to read by itself, so some of the books explore some pretty deep themes. I grew up reading these and never tire of rereading. Pratchett made his characters lovable enough that it's like seeing an old friend every time. [Here's a reading order if you stick with the series.](https://i.imgur.com/VNnXF7Z.jpeg)


Another author who does easily accessible fantasy is Brandon Sanderson. If you like well built magic systems and world-building, Brando Sando is your boy. His two main series are *Mistborn* and *The Stormlight Archive*, though he has a bunch of other smaller series or standalone stuff. The majority of his books are all part of a large interconnected universe, but this is usually only shown in subtle ""Aha!"" ways. *Mistborn* is the lighter fare of the two, with borderline anime-esque action and power scaling, and is the quicker read. It has two separate narrative sections; it starts with a trilogy of books, and then there is a separate trilogy (with another book on the way!) set in a later era on the same world. The first half is mostly Victorian era and has a heavy ""we're saving the world"" feel, while era two basically goes full steampunk and has lower stakes. Book one of Era 1 is *Mistborn: The Final Empire* while book one of Era 2 is *Mistborn: The Alloy of Law*.  
*Stormlight Archive* has four books so far, and while the narrative isn't impenetrable or anything, the tone is a bit darker and more serious than Mistborn. Each book is around a thousand pages, but if you enjoy the first one (*The Way of Kings*) you'll blow right through them. They're very fun and detailed books, and have lots of depth but don't try to be any more complicated than they need to be. Brando Sando is a competent author, and I rarely find myself bored by anything he writes. I'd also recommend two short stories of his as jumping on points; *Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell* and *Sixth of the Dusk*. Both nice and bite sized while squeezing in very interesting worlds.

If you want to jump right in to some deep fantasy, I really really loved the *Liveship Traders* series by Robin Hobb. It's actually a bit like Eragon, I guess, except with sentient boats instead of dragons. They have some wonderfully developed characters, and some of the coolest worldbuilding I've ever read, at least in my opinion. There's a decent amount of life on boats, politics, and commerce stuff going on, but I never found myself bored. The first book is *Ship of Magic*.

Kind of an off the wall pick is *Spiderlight* by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It's essentially a deconstruction of the quest/prophecy narrative. The main protagonist is a giant spider and minion of the Dark, who is forcibly transmuted into a human and compelled by a Light adventuring party to guide them on their quest. It's a unique book, if a bit tongue in cheek, but I enjoyed it a lot. If you like sci-fi, he also wrote another book I love called *Children of Time*!

I'm kind of terrible at book reccs because I have a tendency to forget books unless I've seen them recently, so I can't drum up lists easy. But if there's any particular genres or needs you're looking for, I'm sure I and others in this thread will do our best to help.",SwayzeCrayze,2021-05-15T06:30:08Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Secondly, I first fell in love with the fantasy genre when a high school teacher told me I should check out this book I hadn't heard of: The Hobbit. That was over 30 years ago, I never looked back. That said, I actually still enjoyed Eragon and read the entire series. Does it have the robust world-building of books like The Lord of the Rings or pretty much anything by Brian Sanderson? No, but it's still a fun read. Sort of like in movies The Avengers is no Schindler's List, but we don't always WANT to read/watch something like that!

ebueqv,"Eragon definitely has some classic fantasy tropes that are common in several fantasy books. I'd imagine that most people who set out to write ""epic fantasies"" end up having several elements in common with each other, unintentional or not.

However, the inheritance cycle was one of my favorite fantasy series . I've read lotr+Hobbit, game of thrones, and name of the wind series to name a few, and the inheritance cycle certainly stands out. 

If I remember correctly eragon was alright because it is just setting things up, but once you get into brisingr and the next few books, the story ramps up quite a bit and becomes VERY interesting.

ebueqv,"I've heard that the teenager in the writer is really prevalent in the first book. I have not read it but something about what you said makes sense to me if you'll allow some speculation.

LotR is saturated in lore and back history which, while well conceived and documented, is ultimately a slog. At the time certain Tropes didn't exist in the mainstream as things like LotR weren't already popular enough that 1 in 5 households might have someone with approximate Middle Earth knowledge (just for context, my mom filled in a lot of gaps from the Silmarillion). Eragon, however, did not have the issue of being a trend setter.

I imagine a lot of the writing errors in Eragon come from a culture that's already pretty able to visualize a medieval fantastical world. It's like the effect the LotR movies had on the fantasy genre in film. Without those movies I doubt anyone would have done anything but turn their nose at the Game of Thrones series on HBO (even without the Sean Bean hook). I think that fantasy writing is so mainstream that authors either put in too much filler-lore (my own issue), or they themselves have such an easy time envisioning a fantasy setting that they leave out a lot of details that help build worlds because they write as though their audience can view their world through their eyes.",captain_rumdrunk,2019-12-17T16:23:34Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
ebueqv,"My only problem with the Eragon series is the same problem I have with most of Faerun books (TSR D&D world) written by Ed Greenwood (read: All the Elminster books).  They lack a well-designed tension and plot.  Both have too many  strange deus ex machina saving dead characters which hurts the overall story telling.  Something written by a younger writer having dreams of always winning, and losing isn't a loss, but just some strange semi-winning state.

Ed Greenwood has improved over the years.  I wouldn't considered him on par with Dragon Lance writers Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis.  But he has grown.  Maybe Christopher Paolini has grown in his writing, but after two books I pretty much had enough YA written by YA.

As for LotR... I have different issues with J.R.R. Tolkien. It is the same issues I have with modern Steven King novels.  They both need an editor.  I'm all for ""it is about the journey and not the ending.""  Which is why I honestly don't care if a book/movie is partly spoiled by knowing the ending, but when the middle seems to only semi-relate to the over all plot and it kills pacing it makes me not want to read or even listen to it on audio books.

If you like the medievalish stuff you may like The Deamon Wars Saga  by R.A. Salvatore (another good writer that came out of the TSR days).  There is a lot of good tension.  Deaths have meaning and impact, and characters you think should be dead that come back have it setup well in advance so when you get back to them you realized you missed the signs.  I'm on book 4 of this series, and so far it has been satisfying and the end of book 3 upended enough to justify a continuing series.",mouringcat,2019-12-17T16:39:17Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

That being said - yes, personally, I think there's a lot of stuff that was ripped off. BUT that doesn't mean it's actual plagiarism. The story is still beloved by many and the magic system, as far as I've heard from fans, is pretty darn cool. 

I have a LOT of friends who adore Eragon. And even though I'm a LotR-maniac, I blame noone who can't manage to read them. Tolkien was a linguist first, an author second, and at the end of the day it shows in his style. He tried to create a world because he realized that he can't create languages without culture and lore. 

You can enjoy whatever you like, if you ask me, as long as there's no obviously problematic messages (I'm talking romantisizing abuse, violence, racism and shit like that - none of which can be found in Eragon.)

ebueqv,Eragon was a great book for me as a kid because I didn't understand tropes and such. I tried to re read it as an adult and it just seems a little childish to me. That being said I'd compare it to the hobbit which I see similar issues with. The books after Eragon are where Paolini really hit his stride. The second book is still a little wonky and teenage angsty but it handles it really well and is the gritty book of the series. Books 3 and 4 are phenomenal writing imo. I've read the series multiple times and its a fantastic series I just as an adult can't read the first one without constantly reassuring myself that it was written by a 16 year old. Please keep reading and I'm glad you're enjoying it. I hope my comments haven't been offensive or anything.

ebueqv,"As a die-hard Tolkien fan, Eragon is also one of my favorite fantasy series. The plot and characters can definitely be a bit contrived at times, with Eldest being the worst in general opinion, but by the third and fourth books, I think Paolini really hits his stride with his world. There is a lot of in-depth exploration of the world and so many of the characters, in my view, feel like genuine people. When I finished Inheritance, I was left hungry for more, and desperately wanted to see the characters again. In my opinion, that's the mark of a good book. 

As for LotR, I've only read through the trilogy twice; once when I was 12, and the other time was last summer. I have started Fellowship so many times and gotten bogged down before I even got halfway through. The first part is a long transition, as we go from the comfortable familiarity of the hobbits and the Shire to the wider, scarier world. Once you get past Rivendell, things kick up quickly. I've found that to really enjoy it and get through it, you have to be in the right frame of mind.

You know what most 15 year old authors produce? Fan Fiction. I've never actually watched or cared about Star Wars, but I think one of the accusations is that Eragon has lots of plot similiarities. 

Might be an unpopular opinion, but taking someone else's ideas and changing them on the low to medium level to create your own thing is the *rule* not the exception with art, including writing novells. And this doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. 

Eragon has some great caveats, as well as obvious weaknesses. Nothing wrong in enjoying it. Something doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyable.

And even though JRR Tolkien might have been an all around intellectual and on a completely diffrent level than Paolini, I actually don't think that his writing style or the structure of his novels is that great either.

Reading Eragorn is unlikely to cause harm, so how could enjoying the process be considered ""bad""?  Most books aren't about Serious Business.  Most books do not aim to challenge your biases and assumptions.  Most books are not the sort of deep inspection of the human condition that might lead you incrementally closer to enlightenment.  Lord of the Rings certainly isn't.  Lord of the Rings is popcorn reading with uncertain pacing and a wooden, formal style that is often off putting to modern readers.  Reading Lord of the Rings isn't inherently ""good"" any more than reading Eragon might be inherently ""bad"".

The only bad reading is what happens when a book neither challenges you, nor entertains you.  A bad book is one that wastes your time.  Eragorn isn't wasting your time; therefore, Eragorn is a *good* book.",EclecticDreck,2019-12-18T15:02:24Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

The “hero’s journey” storyline can be used completely by accident. And Tolkien was not the first person to write a “hero’s journey” storyline. In fact, he used it at least twice.

ebueqv,"No not bad at all. It's my favorite series. Yeah sure it's a little derivative but it's not completely plagiarized. Just because he reused some story beats from other books and movies doesn't mean he didn't work hard on his creation. Dude researched a lot of old (Norse I think) to come up with a language system. Considering that he originally wrote it when he was 15 and published at 19 it's a pretty good book. And if you keep reading you can see he slowly comes into his own as a writer and gets less derivative as the series progresses. It's really only the first 2 books that borrow elements from other media.

Edit: to add to the comments about LotR I personally find that Eragon and the rest of the inheritance cycle is infinitely more accessible to readers than LotR. Yeah LotR is a classic and an progenitor of the genre but holy shit it is not a good read for someone that is just starting high fantasy. Eragon is an excellent entry into high fantasy.

ebueqv,"Since we're all nerds for narrative here, I'll drop my opinion here on the plagiarism thing, just to spark some more conversation maybe!

So it's been pointed out that Paolini first came up with the concept for Eragon as a teenager, and I think that makes him much less culpable for any kind of wrongdoing since we all know teenagers lack the ability to reason effectively. Still not cool, but kids will make mistakes, it's just a part of growing up.

Secondly, I haven't touched the series in about a decade so I'm really not recalling anything blatantly plagiaristic, but after I post I'll look into it and see (how wrong I probably am, lol). However, maybe some people here will be familiar with a non-fiction writer Joseph Campbell, who coined the idea of the 'monomyth'. This idea is that myths, legends and narratives about heroes all contain the same basic structure of 17 steps through three acts. It's a little on the nose that people keep mentioning that Eragon is very similar to Star Wars, since George Lucas has said on the record that Campbell's work strongly influenced his own.  


So, if the charge is being derivative of Star Wars and that's a bad thing or makes it a bad story, then I'd say that argument is flawed because Star Wars in and of itself is derivative of the bible, and other preceding works.",Ethical_Existential,2019-12-17T15:48:52Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

In the matter of *Lord of the Rings* i find it understandable maybe try the hobbit first it's a lighter read.

Also in the general matter of ""Is it bad to like something"" I would say no. You can like whatever you like but I find interesting searching why I like something.

If i wrote a novel that someone took inspiration from I'd probably be slightly okay with it. With so many books out there, its really hard to come up with a purely original book idea. Like I definitely think as far as author recognition goes, if its blatantly obvious that a story has some roots in someone elses work, a nod should be customary. But at the end of the day, it doeant matter how many experts get together to say who should get credit, its the audience that determines how successful a book is. If it sells, it sells. LOTR is a hard series to read, and i think Eragon, while maybe not original, is much easier to swallow.

Longer answer:
The real reason a lot of us adults praise it is because Eragon was our intro into fantasy.
When I first read it I had never read anything else (other than watching LoTRs growing up) so Eragon came across fresh, exciting and had characters my age doing magic with dragons. I loved that shit and still do.


The issue is it doesn't hold up to time, nor would it be anywhere near as interesting for someone who has read fantasy previously. It's tropey, very clearly inspired by other stories such as Star Wars, The Pern series, Lord of the Rings, and other massive classics you may have read.

I first read eragon in my mid 30s and loved all 4 of the books (no nostalgia or teen-taste in my case). Tastes are different and if its not for you, fine. Doesn't make it a bad story. Just not your kind of story. 

There are plenty of books that have been hyped that I didn't like either. And I might vomit if I ever have to read another book by my best friends favourite author.

My point is, wouldn't it be boring if we all had the same taste? You don't have to like books because other people like it.

It does feel like it’s following a formula: everyday hero with special sauce, a mentor, a rebel leader love interest, and an overpowered evil dictator whose death will solve absolutely everything wrong with the world.   The dragon fills the spot of ‘companion who will never abandon/judge you’.  

But I don’t see that as an issue with the story itself, simply an old formula playing itself out time and time again.   They are tropes for a reason.  

I still see the ghost of that story structure appear time and time again across movies, books, and even writing reference books in regards to plot and structure.  

Eragon was a trailblazer in another sense: the author was a teen, who self published the first book.  I don’t know if he was the first to self publish, break into traditional, and become a bestseller—but he’s the oldest example I can think of.  

I was just graduating HS when the first Eragon came out, or thereabouts.   So for me, it was a YA novel, or at the least a New Adult one.   As such, it holds a place on my shelf—although if another book followed all of those tropes I’d likely not read past 100 pages, either.",Intrepid_Fortune_1,2021-03-11T11:56:50Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Do I think Eragon is great literature? Of course not, but, I enjoyed reading it. Similarly, I also enjoyed Twilight and The Hunger Games, even the newest one that everyone likes to hate. 

There are some authors I just despise reading- Nicholas Sparks, James Patterson, Stuart Woods.. I can't even really put my finger on why I hate reading them and then loved reading something like Eragon. 

Similarly, I HATE lima beans. I don't know why I hate lima beans, I simply think they are the most despicable food known to man. I love arugula and brussels sprouts which my husband feels are poisonous crap suited only for the trash can. 

I guess the point that I'm making is that there are great works, which you should suffer through occasionally because they tell you something important. But, you can pick more agreeable ones from among the classics, different vegetables that you find more to your taste, you don't have to eat the lima beans even among the great classics.

m2o6sm,"Funnily enough, I just finished rereading Eragon like a day ago. I had read  the series as a teenager and young adult and had fond-ish memories of it and wanted to reread it to see how my outlook on it had changed 15 years down the line. 

I know that it gets a lot of hate on this sub but I found it rather enjoyable. I think the thing I liked most about it was how easy it was. Coming off of Malazan, it was a breathe of fresh air. It was really nice not having to work my brain trying to figure out what was happening. I could just plug in my headphones and enjoy my daily walk, and focus on other things if I felt like it. The prose were evocative in their simplicity, and I think the themes and plot reflect that. 

Most interesting to me was how it made me reflect on what I thought when I was younger. It’s pretty clear that Eragon was written before the author had had a lot of life experience, and you can see that in the way Eragon reacts to things in the book, such as lamenting why a god would let his uncle die. I can see why that might turn others off, but it reminded me of similar thought that I had when I was that age as well. Now that I’m more than double the age that I was when I read it, I can see that the world is more complicated and nuanced.

I think that it jives with young adults. In terms of quality I would recommend the Inheritance trilogy to young adults or someone just dipping their toes into fantasy. It’s not as clever or well written as Harry Potter, and IMO that’s fine. It doesn’t need to be. If it’s not your cup of tea, that’s fine. Just find something that does reflect your taste. Life is too short to waste on something you won’t enjoy.

To answer your question: it does get better but not so much that if you didn’t enjoy the first one, I don’t know that you would enjoy the later entries.",zombiebrains88,2021-03-11T21:40:21Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Part of me feels bad for initially writing off the book simply because of the lazy name. dragon - > eragon, he just erased one line. I figured it was trash.    But from what everyone has said, that turned out to be indicative of the rest of the book. 

But ok, even if he cribbed a lot from other series, is the writing style at least good? Or is it the typical YA level of reading 2 steps above ""see Jane run""?",noonemustknowmysecre,2021-03-11T17:35:48Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
m2o6sm,"I'd also say that most of the adults who praise Eragon after having just read it are either not big readers, or not big fantasy readers. Eragon tends to be a gateway to fantasy litterature due to its mainstream status, its fame, and its ease of reading.

As you said, Eragon is pretty much a standard héros journey. But for people who don't know this trope and don't have much reading experience in it, hero's journeys are great and interesting. There's a reason it's been a staple of myths across history, it gets readers engaged.

The genre starts being boring once you've seen or read a few of those stories, but if you're not that experienced I can understand finding it fascinating. Obviously there are also some people who like generic hero's stories and that's perfectly fine

m2o6sm,"I think a lot of people have trouble understanding that their personal preferences don't actually mean a book is good or bad. 

I don't think there are very many bad books, really, at least not that have made it through a publisher. If you want to find a truly bad book, you really have to look at self-published stuff that hasn't had the benefit of an editor. 

There are a great many immemorable books. Books that are maybe popular for a season, but, then you never see them mentioned again. Any book that is still being brought up regularly 15 years after it's publish date is at least a memorable book. So many books are published every year, for a book to still come up regularly more than a decade after publishing likely means there was something about it that stuck with people. 

Twilight and Hunger Games were sensations before the movies, Eragon was a smaller sensation in spite of its' terrible movie. These books didn't get the staying power they have by being truly terrible. None of them are perfect, they are all flawed in some way, but there's something about them that speak to a lot of people.",Jenniferinfl,2021-03-11T15:04:26Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I agree. 

I couldn't finish Jane Austen's *Emma*, although I know people who love it. It's not that I don't think it has any merit whatsoever, it just didn't engage *me*. 

It doesn't matter how ""good"" a book is, not everyone's going to like it. Yet for something like Eragon, some people just blankly state, ""objectively bad book"", when it's a book that speaks to other people. 

Unlike OP, I've not seen the threads full of praise for Eragon here - only the criticism. It feels like a circlejerk to me at this point; a book/series that a lot of people like to crap on, or state that they read it in their teens but hate it now. 

I'm not claiming that Eragon is some great work of literature. I'm just saying I enjoyed it. I absolutely accept the criticisms of the book - the Hero's Journey, copying Star Wars but with dragons, tropey, etc, and don't deny any of those criticisms. I'm certainly not blind to its faults.

I hadn’t re-read them since then, but about a month ago, I didn’t have a next audio book queued up after I finished one, and I saw Eragon on Audible, so I got it, then quickly went through the rest of the series. 

If you like audiobooks, I can mostly recommend them. My only problem with them was that I greatly disliked the voice the narrator did for all the dragons, but especially for Saphira. It was a horrendous, rumbly, gargling marbles type voice. Very jarring when I always mentally read Saphira’s thoughts as at least somewhat feminine.

4yg3vm,"Eragon was okay, at best, for me. It was one of my early fantasy books and I did end up finishing it. The problem as someone else mentioned was that he took so long. By the time the later books were coming out, I had already read more fantasy by better authors. Going back to finish the series was difficult for me, and I never felt a desire to re-read them. Anyways, here's a list of books that I have read multiple times, or I will read again if I ever stop looking for new fantasy:

- Malazan Book of the Fallen (re-read is almost required to appreciate the depth of the story)

- Wheel of Time 

- Chronicles of Amber

- The First Law trilogy and the other books in same world

- The Broken Empire

- Acts of Caine (similar sci-fi and fantasy blend like CoA)

- Farseer Trilogy

- The Long Price Quartet



Those are my definite re-reads, but here are a few other series I've read and enjoyed:

- The Black Company Trilogy (later books are okay, but first three are great)

- Mistborn

- The Seventh Sword

- The Dagger and The Coin

- The Sword of Truth (maybe) - It's been a long while since I read this one and I know there's a lot of politics and philosophy the author tries to force on you. But there's just something about Richard with the Temper that I find nostalgic. Plus Zedd's ""nothing is ever easy"" is one of the best sayings I've ever found in a fantasy book. 



Lastly, I hate myself when I start reading series that aren't finished, but these are series that I've started and am excited to see wrap up:

- Starlight Archive

- The Gentleman's Bastards

- The Fitz and The Fool

- ASOIAF (if I'm honest here, I thought the last two books were not that great and did not move the plot forward at all. That said, I enjoy the TV show so much that I'll have to finish the series) 

- Kingkiller Chronicle (minus the incredibly awkward sex scene in the second one)",,2016-08-19T12:43:07Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

My problem with the Eragon series is that it's very blatantly a mash up of LOTR, Star Wars, and Dune. I tried re-reading the first book a while back, and just couldn't get over it. ",tahmatwork,2016-08-19T11:55:06Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

4yg3vm,"Someone at my work who knew I was a fantasy fan recommended Eragon to me and pitched it as a light YA fantasy book. I figured why not and read it over the course of a few days. As I read it I enjoyed it enough, but wouldn't use anything stronger than ""okay"" to describe it. But when I finished the book it dawned on me that I just read, almost plot point to plot point, A New Hope just set in a middle-earth like setting. Now I understand the Hero's Journey isn't anything new and Star Wars wasn't the most original thing either, but the similarities were just insane. 

Fast forward a while later and I gave Eldest a shot. While it didn't follow Empire Strikes Back as closely it still covered all the main points, wrapped up in a really boring book with an insufferable protagonist. Eragon goes from sounding like a mature level headed individual to a bratty kid in a span of a couple pages a whole lot in that book. 

In the end I felt compelled to finish what I started so I checked the third book out from the library. But then it starts with the main characters planning a rescue mission and I just couldn't do it. I returned it an hour later.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the series. As for series I've been captivated enough to do rereads: Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire, Kingkiller Chronicle, The Dark Tower.

It could be the publishers are banking on those readers buying it based on the author.

ithob8,"It feels that Eragon doesn't grow as a character from the start of the second book all the way to just before the end of the fourth, where he suddenly becomes woke. He's a whiny baby in the first book, which is understandable, but he maintains that throughout the entire story. Book 2, waaahh my back hurts. Book 3, waaahh my sword is gone and my dad is a dick.

I also despised Rorans parts in Book 2. I think when I re read the books I just outright skipped those chapters. Learning cool new Elf lore, lets take a bit of a break to look at Roran, fuck no.

I really didn't like how he handled he problems he introduced. The biggest offender being the final battle with the big bad dude. Guy is built to be unbelievably strong. Utterly unkillable realistically. Oh but it's fine because the heroes find a weapon right at the start of the 4th book which bypasses all magic wards. Wow that was lucky. So he's solved his problem right here, pretty shit way to solve it but w/e. But THEN he makes the bad guy even stronger so that weapon is now useless against him and he has to generate another cop out, except the weapon would have at least given an epic battle at the end the second cop out kills the bad guy by making him feel bad. It's like he tried to do it like how the Palps dies in the ROTJ but it just falls flat on its face.

Similarly with his back problems. It just gets magiked away near the end of book 2 for reasons. It's not like he even grows as a character, right after he gets his back fixed he just goes and breaks the arm of one of his sparring partners. Our hero ladies and gentlemen.

The lore and world building is great though. A lot of cool interesting things that were never covered but could be done in other books. I always wondered, since you can't lie in the Ancient language, what happens if you say a paradox.",Nickizgr8,2020-09-16T08:50:43Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

I really wanted to read this book as soon as I heard about it specifically because of how much I didn't like Eragon. I knew he wrote it when he was much younger, and I was curious so see if he improved (he did!). 

I am a librarian, so I probably have different reasons for choosing a book than others might have. I read a variety of topics and genres to keep my breadth of literature nice and wide. I also know that many of my patrons are going to be interested in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars because of it's author, and I wanted to be able to have a better discussion about it with them. 

The story is really fun and engaging, and I think technology fans will have some really interesting opinions, because I couldn't tell if the science stuff was total crap or actually potentially possible. The last 5% or so of the book is Paolini going real deep into explaining his book's technology, so if you're having trouble understanding something, flip back there to read more about it.

ithob8,"Just gonna cross my fingers that I get names right since I never read the Eragon books in english \^\^ I'm not gonna claim that Eragon earned all the things he got, but I do think he earned some, especially the dragon hearts. Not through something as easy to point out as breaking into Gringotts or the ministry, but rather through all it took to have a shot at learning his true name. Him learning that in Vroengard might have not been very exciting, but I think that was a journey that had gone on for such a long time. So many times he struggled to look past his own feelings and recognise what it meant to be a leader figure in Varden, or to be good enough for Arya. To realize that he would never return to being just a farmer when it was all said and done. I kinda look at this all as his journey to enlightenment and understanding his overall quest, and himself. So, I found learning his true name like a long process that was rewarding to read in the way it paid off in finding the dragon hearts.  

&#x200B;

But either way, what I want to get at is that even with the things he got, they were not in themselves enough. He gained so much power and yet it was not close to enough to straight up overpower Galbatorix. In the end, he needed to find a way to use the power in a smart way to make up for the lack of power. And I could see why there would be differing opinions on whether the way Paolini did it was satisfying or not, but to me it mostly was - I think much because I would have not expected Eragon to figure this out earlier in his life, before all the personal growth that I do think he had.",Iceman6789,2020-09-16T21:35:48Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

And part of what makes the plot slow is Paolini tried doing world building. If you think Eragon is slow, reread Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time. Any time you try to build a new world, you have to take time to describe it and use lots of exposition to give the reader (a newcomer to the world) a feel for what it's like. That's why Eragon is so ""slow"" but Eldest was faster-paced. He didn't have to do as much exposition as the world was already established in the first book.

It's not great literature, but it is a remarkably impressive work by a 14-year-old nonetheless. As far as the fantasy I've read goes, it's about in the middle of the pack. It's not the head of the pack, but it's hardly the worst.",super_ag,2017-01-09T13:48:52Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
5mwuw2,"Funny that you recall people praising the books; I remember when they came out that everything I heard about them was overwhelmingly, ""They aren't very good. Just watch Star Wars and read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter instead."" There definitely was a lot of hype about how young Paolini was when he wrote the first book, and I have to admit that is impressive, but I feel like they've always been largely seen as pretty mediocre at best compared to almost any other fantasy series out there.

I think the source of their popularity has been primarily that: 

1) the author was very young, 

2) the books are very clearly geared toward young kids and, despite their wall-of-text exposition, are fairly accessible, easy reads compared to a lot of other fantasy (e.g. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Ursula LeGuin, George R.R. Martin, etc.), and 

3) they are entirely dragon-focused as a series in a way that wasn't really seen since Anne McCaffrey's *Dragonriders of Pern* books (and *Eragon* is more accessible that McCaffrey's books, as above). 

Yes, there are other books about dragons. Tons of them. But I think *Eragon* struck a nerve in a way that pretty much none of those other books did. When I was a little kid, I tried reading through the *Pern* books and was just totally baffled by... most everything. I still am (I'm really, really not a fan of them), but I was even more so then as a 6th grader. I imagine that if *Eragon* had come out then, I'd probably be obsessed with it too. I read lots of stuff that isn't particularly original or well-written (some of the *Star Wars* EU books, some of the BattleTech/Mechwarrior books, etc.), and it never occurred to me that some of it wasn't very good until years and years of reading it when I started to notice that people were relying more on repeating the same cliched, comfortable phrasing (if I see *one more* laser described as an ""emerald beam"" or ""ruby spear"" ""piercing"" anything, I'm gonna scream) than trying to create something really engaging.

I think *Eragon* hasn't aged well, but it wasn't really all that good to begin with. It's not an issue of it ""not holding up""; the problem here is not time passing, though time certainly hasn't *helped* it either. I think if you're a little kid obsessed with dragons and need some heavily-detailed-yet-accessible action fantasy, *Eragon* and the other books in the series fit the bill, and that's about it.",nova_cat,2017-01-09T19:04:42Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

5mwuw2,"They were never that good to begin with, and I say that as someone who loved them when I was younger.  They're not a bad jumping-off place for kids to get into the fantasy genre, but even then, there are much better YA fantasy series out there- Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, Percy Jackson, anything by Garth Nix, etc.  If it had come out 10-15 years sooner when the market was less saturated, it might have been more relevant, but the time it came out (and more importantly, by the time it wrapped up), there was enough good YA fantasy that it didn't really have much reason to exist.

I will say this: if you look at the books from a meta perspective, you can practically see Paolini growing up, especially because Eragon is such an obvious self-insert protagonist.  The first book reads like it was written by a kid- it has a basic plot, a derivative setting, absolute black-and-white morality, a main character who acts almost exclusively in service of the plot, generally with little thought or reason.  The second book feels like it was written by a college student.  Eragon starts being introspective and much more angst-ridden, and becomes a fairly militant vegetarian and atheist (traits commonly associated with obnoxious college students) seemingly out of nowhere.  By the time the later books rolled around, everything had leveled out somewhat- the story became less morally absolute, the main character started acting like an adult and reigned in his overbearing stereotypical-college-student values, and the story became less predictable/generic.",Volcanicrage,2017-01-09T18:27:34Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

Three and four are more adult, with vivid depictions about PTSD, moral, political, and ethical events along with multiple converging storylines. The second book is the best in my opinion, and if you stopped there you wouldn't miss much. You could probably imagine an ending that is just as pleasing. Not the best books, but for how easy and quick the read is I really appreciated the series.

Harry potter suffers from the same issues too, so they both basically middling ground fantasy books.

The author either hasn't written much since the Eragon series and/or has released books under a different name.

If you read the book as an adult you're more able to keep tabs of storylines, skills, traits, etc.  So you can see why things aren't adding up and what not.

1. The companion should be dragon. Dragons are very different from fictional mosters like pokemon or real life animals. They are very well known to everybody as they are very common in fantasy worlds. They are very powerful and can be somewhat compared to real beings unlike pokemon who I always found so far from real as possible. Thus dragons are especially appealing as a companion, at least to me when I was younger. Also you can fly a dragon, that's just badass.

2. Dragons is Eragon were intelligent beings. Unlike pokemon or animals who can only make some noise and rely not on intelligence, rather on instincts.

People shouldn't complain about bad writing in a book and then give a free pass to another just because the lack of quality is well hidden beneath a shiny layer of bombast. The genre will never reach its true potential like that.

P.S. I still like to remember the Eragon series to this day because it acknowledged a simple point that nevertheless most fantasy books, isolated in a ""continent"" which is really just a ~500x500km square, fail to make: that there is a wider world and large unknown swaths of planet which are completely and rightly unconcerned and unaffected by whatever the big baddie wants to do to our heroes and whatever small province they find themselves in.",JackJacko87,2017-01-09T19:09:15Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

As far as the magic goes, language-based with logical real-world limitations (physics, whaaat) is a great setup, and in this case predates other great systems like Sympathy and Misting; to that end, in Inheritance Eragon basically discovers “planethood” and space, and then immediately forgets about it — but it plants a seed of an idea for a expanded later story.",UUDDLRLRBAstard,2020-10-26T22:59:15Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

The second and third could've been shortened and combined. They got a bit bloated and purple-prose-y. I don't enjoy them because not much happens. They were way gorier than the first as well, which was always seemed an odd choice to me.

Four was solid. I don't think it was amazing, but I did like how they defeated Galbatorix in an unexpected and creative way. Heck, nothing about the way it ended was the way I expected, so kudos to Paolini for defying expectations in a way that was still logical.

What, besides LotR, qualifies as ""real fantasy"" according to them? If it's stuff like LotR, *all* of that stuff has tons of rip-offs of the LotR trilogy. Authors don't even realize that they're doing it half the time, I think.

I don't like Eragon mostly for stylistic reasons. I remember writing criticisms of the writing style in the margins of my sister's copy shortly after it came out when we were in middle school (we collaborated on the criticisms, and I'm sure they're about as cringeworthy as you'd expect from two middle school girls). They weren't unfair criticisms. Paolini himself acknowledged some of the weaknesses in interviews, even at the time. The plot was also really predictable. But people who like it aren't somehow reading ""fake fantasy."" 

It's not masterfully written, but it's not like enjoying something that's not written for a college lit class somehow makes you not a reader.

7twt8q,"I recently reread the Inheritance Cycle several months ago, having read each book only once since they were released. I knew going in that these books wouldn't hold up all that well from what I remember. Even then I wasn't the biggest fan of Brisingr and Inheritance when they were released.

With this reread, I do think a lot of the criticism thrown at this series does have a lot of merit behind it. There is merit in discussing why these just don't work.

I also don't think Paolini deserves any hate or bashing for simply publishing his fiction. It wasn't his fault that it got as popular as it did. There's really nothing offensive in or about the series. 

To be honest, I don't think you argue your opinion well enough in this write-up. I'll take your Deus Ex Machina section as one example. No where do you argue why it shouldn't be considered one beyond it plays into a certain theme, which I think it doesn't. 

Eragon getting his back healed by the dragons is most definitely is a  Deus Ex Machina. It does come out nowhere with no foreshadowing. That's not something up for debate.

It destroys all potential moving forward as Eragon doesn't have to deal with it. Proactively make Eragon's journey dealing with this injury pointless. It also doesn't strengthen your whole idea that the series about dealing with scars. It does the opposite, it removes a scar in a very contrived way. 

I've never thought of nor heard of the empathy spell being called a Deus Ex Machina, but it does kind of come out of nowhere. I found that whole section disappointing for entirely different reasons. 

I'm glad you enjoy this series and it holds a special place in your heart. Nobody who criticizes these books is trying to take that away from you. Those people just want to discuss why the book didn't work for them.

7twt8q,"I only read the first book, and I read it when I was fifteen (six years ago) so I can't comment on specifics, but I do remember that I didn't like it. It reminded me too much of my own writing at the time. Part of this was something you mentioned, advertisers making Paolini out to be some prodigy, when his writing was like anything my friends were writing at the time, only in novel form.

Based on what I remember, I don't think you could argue that Eragon is a ""good"" book, ie. That it has any literary merit. You're right that many authors borrow tropes, and that no art is created in a vacuum, but, from what I remember, Paolini doesn't bring anything remarkable to his take on the things he borrows. His work reads like a teenager who really liked fantasy decided to dedicate some time to writing a book, because that's what it is.

Ultimately though, I don't think any of this matters. What matters is that these books meant something to you. They don't need to be ""good"" to be enjoyed. There are plenty of things that I love that aren't considered ""good"", like the 2000’s remake of The Prisoner. I think it's awesome, but lots of people think it suck, and lots more have never even heard of it.

TLDR: Eragon is a story written by a teenage boy, and that's what it reads like, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that it means as much to you as it does. Keep on loving things, regardless of what other people think of those things. :)",,2018-01-30T02:06:44Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

7twt8q,"The online Eragon hate circlejerk is actually a big part of what got me involved in literary discussion. Almost all the small book-related sites I used to read were full of people complaining about the series and the author, often in comical, over-the-top ways, some of which were quite unfair.

Recently I've gone back and read some of this type of content again (""sporkings,"" reviews, enormous screeds, etc). Much of it doesn't hold up very well. It's the 2000's equivalent of smug YouTube video essays about why some movie is dumb because of ""plot holes"" or whatever. A lot of the things that get insulted are either not *that* bad, or else not bad at all. Stuff that gets called ""bad"" is often only ""bad"" by the standards of commonly-repeated rules of thumb that are *regularly* broken by great classic literature. This type of content tends to fixate on tropes, cliches, plot holes, or extremely shallow criticism that can be reduced to a flowchart (""How much agency does the main character have? Are they a Mary Sue? What about the Bechdel Test? Does the author use adverbs too much? What about too many dialogue tags? Do they use the word 'is' more than 4x per page?""). In turn, this sort of fixation can prevent young writers from understanding what is or isn't working in their own prose. You start to think of ""good writing"" as a set of rules rather than the subtler aspects of a text.

In general, this content seems to cater to young, insecure aspiring writer types who resent the success of works that seem mediocre to them and are also afraid of producing ""bad"" content themselves. They gravitate towards snark and mockery, in particular towards anything even slightly ""purple"" (such as Eragon) and/or emotionally charged, whether or not it's particularly bad. That can come out of discomfort with anything that appears to be ""trying too hard."" And the focus on rules or tropes can be a comforting tool to make a person feel like there's a formula to literature.

With all that said, I have to give this type of content credit for getting me interested in actually writing, first with short stories and novellas, and most recently (and many years later) a draft of a manuscript (which is probably significantly worse than Eragon, but that's what rewrites are for). I also took a lot of English classes in college, and really loved that experience.

It's probable that spending time with more ""serious"" or productive book-related stuff is also what started moving me away from the sporkers, TV Tropes, etc. and into other types of discussions, especially in real life. But I still have to fondly remember that ""community"" for doing so much to advance my interests in books and writing in the first place. However, people should be careful not to *stay* in this stage or this mode of thinking for too long. It's fine to start there, it's fine to come back and visit sometimes, but ultimately it's not a healthy way of thinking.

I know you're mostly talking about the Eragon books themselves, but you're also thinking about the criticism, and this topic has been on my mind lately. I'd say that Eragon has some questionable prose and issues with generic/stupid characters, but there's nothing so bad about it as to justify the hate.",,2018-01-30T02:00:10Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

7twt8q,"Good write up and overall it's a series that I think gets more bashing than it probably deserves. 

On your point about Brom I think if anything he's more inspired by Thom than anything else. 

I think the series was sort of polarizing because it seemed like it took forever for Paolini to finish writing the series when I was a kid. I think I read Eragon in late elementary school a year or so after it came out, then Eldest as soon as it was released then it seemed like I was waiting forever. By the time Inheritance came out I was really too old (I think 17-18) to be reading the series for the first time and had read much more mature fantasy so the ending wasn't as impactful to me. I think a lot of people around my age share the sentiment. 

I haven't gone back and read it because I haven't been especially inspired to. But there are other stories that are suitable for a similar age group (Redwall and The Edge Chronicles namely) that I go back and reread parts of every so often that have just aged so much better for me and I think were so much more creative. So it's not even really something that would be high on the list of things I would recommend to kids.

I didn't go in depth because the text was becoming too long for its own good. I appreciate that you tried your best to explain some of the problems you have with the saga, which was the purpose of the post.

Regarding the examples you mention, I can see the back injury being problematic if you understand it as a disability.

For the empathy spell, I think it was properly foreshadowed in Shapira's memory of Brom, when he tells Eragon that defeating the king won't be a matter of raw power, but of seeing a weakness that Galbatorix could never think of.

I don't recall anything that you've mentioned here when I reread Eldest. Eragon didn't develop PTSD from his fight with Durza. I remember Eragon creating the poem just to be a gift and not some elaborate capstone to an emotional arc.

I don't have a problem with the idea of an empathy spell, just everything leading up to it leaves the moment makes it anti-climatic and boring. Eragon never engages with the real series antagonist in any kind of meaningful way or struggle.  

I don't think Paolini used this piece of set-up when he wrote Eragon defeating Galbatorix in this manner. Also, it's not foreshadowing in a sense. A key component to Brom's advice is that in order for Eragon to find a weakness, he had to understand how his opponent thought, view the world, etc. 

When Eragon fires off the spell, he doesn't come from a place of understanding anything about Galbatorix. It wasn't written like ""Ah hah, I figured out something about you in this moment so if I worded my spell this way it will bypass this ward."" 

The way that Eragon begins the idea for the spell isnt' because he suddenly understands that Galbatorix lacks empathy.

154y32e,"My youngest was gifted this trilogy as as pre-teen. I *tried* to watch the Eragon movie, realized we had the book and decided to read it 10+ years ago.  Ended up reading the series because I enjoyed the story.

Big picture, the writing showed his age, but the story line was well done. I'll buy Murtagh just to see how the next chapters play out.",francois_du_nord,2023-07-21T02:42:13Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
154y32e,"No, he's alternating between the two so he can work on the *Eragon* series more.",Obversa,2023-07-20T21:46:30Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
154y32e,"I agree, he’s a low-tier writer. He got a modicum of success as a kid, because his parents published Eragon for him, then took him on a US tour to sell it. The book was picked up by Carl Hiaasen’s stepson, who showed it to him, and Hiaasen took it to Knopf to see if it could be published. So, the man who wrote ‘Strip Tease’, the novel that the Demi Moore movie was based on, was solely responsible for Eragon being published. 

Then it blew up because he was 16 with a published book. That’s it. They’re not original, they’re not well-written, and Paolini, in his head, has equated this fad-success for true talent. In the world of the written word, Paolini is a fidget spinner, a Giga-Pet, or some Pogs. Temporarily mildly entertaining, and soon, easily forgotten and discarded.

Also, Paolini fans can feel free to downvote me into oblivion, because a million downvotes won’t magically make him into a good writer.",Shadpool,2023-07-21T11:53:43Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
154y32e,"Yeah and as I recall it really showed in Eragon. I guess I kind of also grew out of the series myself midway as I loved Eragon and Eldest, and was super excited for the sequels. But then I fell off partway through Brisingr and never picked it back up again.",AvalenK,2023-07-21T08:30:38Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
154y32e,"This isn’t bitterness. This is disappointment. I could write a response four times that length on why I like Jim Butcher. I think a lot of people don’t realize that the author of Striptease (whose movie got a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, a whole 3% lower than Eragon) is the sole reason we can even discuss Paolini. I don’t understand the fascination, and I definitely can’t comprehend how one was elected to become a film in the first place. If a writer is subpar, that’s worth noting as much as a great writer. Bad reviews are nothing more than constructive criticism if one reads between the lines.

For example, Butcher. I love the Dresden Files. I devoured Changes when it came out, easily my favorite book of the series. His prequel, A Restoration Of Faith, wasn’t compelling at all, and the character of the little girl wasn’t believable. Storm Front was much better, but he was still getting in his stride. Fool Moon was even better than Storm Front, and I liked how it really put some definition into Karrin Murphy. And he consistently got better with every book. 

My point is, as bad as Restoration was, it wasn’t terrible, and it wasn’t Butcher at the top of his game. Paolini is confined to ripping off tropes and flaunting his weak vocabulary, insistent that somewhere in his drivel, there’s a bestseller. And nothing points this particular fact out more than that although both Butcher and Paolini are both NYT Bestseller authors, Jim Butcher has three Hugos and a Locus, as well as three Dragons against Paolini’s single nomination for a German award, which he lost, as well as that the NYT Bestseller List is hardly objective and easily manipulated. Just look at how ‘Triggered’ and ‘Real Marriage’ made it onto the list.

Is Paolini the worst writer I’ve ever read? Not hardly. Does he seem willing to accept any criticism, constructive or otherwise? Nope. Every subsequent book from Eragon follows the same tropes and same gaping plot holes, showing that despite the consistent outcries against his usage of stale plot, he considered himself above devising any shred of originality. This is nothing but hubris, no doubt caused by having his ego padded beyond his means and ability from a young age.

Had he took the unpublished Eragon manuscript for peer review from more accomplished authors, they would have pointed this out to him. He could have honed himself, become a better writer, and published later when he was more mature. Instead, he rushed it, and his parents are more at fault than he is, as they should have been the voices of reason and experience in this situation.

You might be thinking, “Who is he to talk about the accomplishments of a published author?” I’m an author too. Unpublished, of course. My book that I’m working on is well over 500 pages, likely to be 600-700 when complete, mostly block text. I haven’t bothered to break it into chapters because it’s still in the works, and I’ve been refining it, off and on, for 20 years. I’ve brought in editors, and people of every race, sex, religion, and nationality mentioned in the book to ensure that the dialogue is necessary and believable. I’ve had three friends who are authors (Two of which are published) to read, review, and give notes on the manuscript, all of which I took to heart and made any suggested changes within reason. In fact, I wasn’t going to publish at all until one of them suggested that I try. Originally, I was going to self-publish an extremely limited run for friends and family.

But after all of that work, I’m still not comfortable publishing, and likely won’t be for years. This amount of dedication to the craft for my single book is more than Paolini has dedicated to any one of his books, by far. And it’s obvious to us as readers. If he cannot muster the commitment needed to write a book worth reading, why should we commit to reading said book? Paolini could be better. He should be better. But he won’t. His ‘star-power’ alone is enough to guarantee sales, and that’s fine with him. Like I said, disappointment.",Shadpool,2023-07-23T06:59:46Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

wd2a7f,"Researchers of literature have determined that there are only six basic story types:

1. Rags to riches – a steady rise from bad to good fortune  
2. Riches to rags – a fall from good to bad, a tragedy  
3. Icarus – a rise then a fall in fortune  
4. Oedipus – a fall, a rise, then a fall again  
5. Cinderella – rise, fall, rise  
6. Man in a hole – fall, rise

So it's not that any book is a ""clone"" of any other book (well, some are poor imitations), but that the basic story TYPE is the same.  Star Wars (the first movie), Harry Potter, Eragon, all fit type number 1 - a steady rise from bad to good fortune. Humble beginnings to success. But so does Jane Eyre, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, and Slumdog Millionaire and a whole lot of others.

Starwars, particularly luke, and Harry Potter do share a lot of plot beats, I agree. From an orphan to being picked up and taught magic to defeat the big bad in the universe. They meet the 5 class types along the way, and establish an army. Lackey has several series that hits all these plot points too, including one that takes place at a magic school and one that takes place with a wise elder in the woods. Feist as well. Prachett makes fun of these exact plot points.

Trudi Canavan's Black Magician series is basically Pierces Wild Magic series.",pineapplesf,2022-08-01T02:30:51Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy
wd2a7f,"ooh, I liked the shorts about  Tarma and Kethry  by Lackey in the Sword and Sorceress series (I used to have a good collection of those anthology books).  Lackey has produced so much over the years that that is no small library to explore.

Prachett is always good for lampshading a thing. It's skill I would put on par with Weird Al, sometimes the parody is a work of art that transcends the act of parody it was conceived as.

Fiest I don't know much of, though I might have once had a TTRPG book based on his universe. Never played it but probably mixed and matched with some GURPS content to build adventure ideas for other games.

The magic school can find it's parallel in earthsea, though I think they are handled differently enough to not really share much beyond the idea of the school for wizards. Just like telepathically linked dragons and riders are shared 'costuming' between Pern and Eragon but don't quite qualify them as 'clones'. like using different hair, beards, color accents and code names to make different characters using the same base :D .

I'd be hard pressed to  come up with real Narnia, LotR, or Thomas Covanent clones. Though I suppose it's in part that I may just not have encountered them personally. 

LotR might be seen by some to be heavily cloned, in that it established most of modern fantasy. But that feels more like the set and the pieces to me, and not the story that are reused. For me to see it as a LotR clone, it would need an unassuming group who are ideal because of their unassuming nature, to take up the burden of going into a world of more powerful beings in a larger realm, to destroy a macguffn that is nigh indestructable and offers power to it's holder that can and has corrupted others. and along the way have the mischievious and bumbling duo, the simple loyal best friend, a grumpy veteran, and the reluctant heir to a throne and his love for somebody set up to be impossible for their love to be. etc. we could miss a few of the story beats and combine or split certain characters, but in the end I should be able to describe both stories with the same description.",doinwhatIken,2022-08-01T03:40:00Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

The whole marketing angle was that he was just a teenager when he wrote the story made it stick out even more, which isn't entirely accurate.

I do think this criticism is overused, but I don't think it makes it any less true. Eragon is most definitively derivative (to the point where it does actively hurt his story) in every sense of the word, especially for the fantasy genre. Whether or not he plagiarized is an entirely different issue that's up to the individual person. More accomplished authors can weave their influences into something unique and wholly original. It's entirely understandable why Paolini wouldn't be creative as other authors. He didn't have the experience as he was so young.

>Hero With a thousand faces was ripped off of just as much by Star Wars  as Eragon supposedly ripped off Star Wars. LoTR ripped off just as much  from fantasy works from 1890 - 1940 as it did (christ LoTR was a world  made for a language he wasn't even trying to be uniquely original with  it). Lovecraft uses direct names from earlier authors like with Carcosa.

I don't think you know what the Hero's Journey is. Even if what you claim is true (I don't think it is as this is a pretty common defense from what I've seen) that doesn't excuse Paolini either.

>Hating on Eragon for its inspirations is beyond disingenuous

I don't hate Paolini nor his books. I use to love these books back when I was younger. Then I got older and I feel out of love with them. I get that the ""hate"" might be overblown. I think people should focus their time on stuff they actually do enjoy rather than tearing down something they don't like.

""Oh, well he's young"" is not a good defense in my opinion for what I may view, personally, as lackluster or subpar writing. In response to your second reply to my comment suggesting that Eragon only got good reviews, the wikipedia article cites numerous critical reviews, and states that reactions were mixed critically - as they should be. Ultimately there should be mixed feelings, because writing is subjective, and what some view as good writing may very well be seen as horrible writing by others. I like this, all art is subjective and our view of art is influenced by our own experiences, influences and other interests in related and unrelated areas. I don't want to go on and on about this, I just hope you can understand that it is unfair to call someone unintelligent simply because they genuinely think that the writing is subpar: a feeling I hold myself.

685t9x,"Oh boy, honestly i think you missed the very biggest cop out. Lets take a look at the ending shall we. Spoilers for those who didnt read the Fourth book (count yourrselves lucky, free to imagine a better ending, a more satisfying ending.)

  
  
And so we find ourselves at the end of this grand cycle (formally trilogy) of books. And what resolution has this author provided? A cop out magic fix all. A word soooooooooooo powerful that it can just fix everything, animals not having true names, destruction, memories no doubt, crushing a mad king. Its great and somehow its still overshadowed in the end. As we watch the main character, our dear friend Eragon, gather up the reamaing plot (a horde of dragon eggs conveniently stashed behind a suit of armor,) and actually fly off into the sunset.   
  
  
To make something seem so imporbable in a world with dragons and magic creatures truly is an impressive achievement, but not for a good reason. It was closer to watching a train wreck and wondering how it could possibly be worse, then realizing half the cars were carrying explosives. 
  
But sure enough, ol' Paolini pulled it off, desperatly cramming together people and plots lines, leaving a trail of broken plot, unanswered questions, and confusion all around.He took a universe that had almost endless potential filled with half mentioned plot lines, hidden backgrounds, missing stories, and characters, and wasted it abandoning both the story and the readers.   
  
It goes down as the least satisfying series of books i've ever read, more so than other books where all the best characters die, and the loathesome antagonist wins. the best way to experience the books is to read the first one, marvel at the world, put it down then imagine what could come next.",,2017-04-30T13:01:13Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

It was an okay book. It was fun enough that I finished it, and good enough that it sparked my interest to read the second book (I never read the third one though, mainly because I wasn't interested enough to). But now that it's been a couple of years since I've read it, I can tell you that it wasn't memorable. If you asked me about Eragon, all I could tell you is that it's about a boy, a dragon (they can speak to one another telepathically), and it takes place in a fantasy medieval age-esque setting. 

It's like a block buster summer movie. It's enjoying enough to watch that you wouldn't switch the channel, but it's not good enough that you would go rent it and watch it again. In fact, in a few years, you'll probably forget about it, remembering it only in passing. 

If fantasy is your thing, and you're looking for a few hours of fun, by all means pick it up. But I wouldn't expect much more from it.

Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown, and decide to search for the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix.
Critiques of Eragon often pointed out the similarities to other works such as Earthsea and Dragonlance. Reviews also called the book a notable achievement for such a young author as Paolini.

1rxnzt,"I enjoyed them.  I really loved Eragon when I first read it in Jr. High; and while I've come to see some of the flaws in the books*, I don't think they're bad books.  I read the entire series start-to-finish this summer (reading the 4th book for the first time, rereading the rest), and still enjoyed reading them.

Some of the flaws of the books are that the writing is unpolished, that it does tend to get caught up in not terribly engaging political bits, there's bits where it seems like the author is trying too hard to put his own opinions into the book, and that some of the characters tend to be relatively one-dimensional.

But in it's favor: it has an excellent setting and an interesting magic system; the plot is engaging if not earth-shatteringly original; it has some really good moments. 

If you don't mind that the books aren't perfect, I think you can have a good time with these books. If you get easily distracted by flaws in books, I might recommend you give these a pass.  

*Side-note on the flaws; you'll notice I don't list ""It's a rip off of Star Wars"" on that list.  It's because I don't really find it to be a legitimate complaint.  Yes; there are a ton of similarities between the plot of Star Wars and the series (particularly book 1), but 

1) it doesn't help that Star Wars is a fairly generic plot itself; it's basically just textbook ""hero's journey"".  Notice how Star Wars being somewhat generic doesn't stop it from being a really awesome film series.  

2)  Even given that the book is at least ""inspired"" by Star Wars, that doesn't immediately make it a bad book.  Isn't ""Star Wars, told as a fantasy book with dragons"" something of an interesting premise?",Retsam19,2013-12-03T03:55:51Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

However, not as much for the story of Eragon as for the story of Paolini and how Eragon came into a breathing, living book. 

Really - its one of the more rewarding stories of family support and a kid just putting himself out there. 

The Book itself is pretty formulaic and predictable - and is a grafting of numerous well played tropes. 

The best explanation - its Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. 

However - really - knowing the history of how the book came into being, and then reading the story from the view of this was a 17 YO bringing this into creation - I enjoyed it. It allowed for an easy forgiveness of some predictability and some less than stellar writing.

Eragon as a book was extremely predictable, not terribly well written, and basically, as others have said, a mix of Star wars and Lord of the Rings. The movie was the most god awful piece of s*** that ever jumped from book to screen... don't get me started. 

Anyways. The book wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good. Good for all of us though, as Paolini matured, the writing did as well. The last three books in the series (though my close friends disagree with me) got progressively better.

78eizk,"I'd also like to point out how so many of the characters in the Eragon series make excellent role models for the young adult target audience. For me as a elementary/middle school girl reading the books, I can't even say how much I idolized Arya. She was a truly strong and independent female character, who took her own life into her hands and made her own fortune. She was born into wealth and royalty, but denounced it and pursued her interests rather than succumb to the pressures of familial expectations, only accepting them again when she felt she was ready to assume the elven throne. 
I also loved that Eragon's love for Arya remained unrequited, and that this didn't destroy their relationship. Too many young adult novels have the resistant women worn down by their male pursuers affections, which is an incredibly unhealthy worldview to teach to young people. It was refreshing to see a female character who simply said ""no"" to unwanted attention, and to see Eragon's character come to accept that and value their friendship for just what it was. This is one of the main reasons I love the series: the characters are so real, and aren't perfect. Eragon is immature, irrational, and doesn't think before he acts. Arya is too proud and won't accept help when she needs it. These are real personal problems that people can relate to when they read the books, and so having characters like this deal with their problems in healthy ways can help readers to do that to!",spagsnell,2017-10-24T20:24:12Z,Eragon,COMMENT,Fantasy

then he insists on putting things in there that are flat out impossible, like how Eragon becomes a sword master in 3 weeks while he's using his non-dominant hand the entire time, etc

it just reads like exactly what it is, a book written by a 15 year old. Good for him for making some money off of it but its not ever going to be good no matter how many fans it has.

49j3a4,"Yes.

If we take the book at face value, Eragon has basically no motive for killing Galbatorix. His goal at the start was to kill the Ra'zac. That's it. Unless he is an extremely weak-willed individual (which he isn't, judging by him not submitting to Galbatorix at multiple occasions), he has no true reason to wage war on Galbatorix. That was an elf's war against Galbatorix; Eragon has no reason to be there.

I'm not sure why Galbatorix sent the Ra'zac to destroy Carvahall, but I remember Eragon only hearing of it after he officially joined the Varden. There are really only 2 plausible reasons he joined the Varden in the first place:

1). Longstanding relationship to Brom. I don't remember Brom telling him to join the Varden, though. I only remembered him telling Eragon to go learn from some Dragon Riders there.

2). Him hating taxes. It's really the only thing we know of Eragon's motives, after all. The book doesn't really explain his other motives, other than him wanting to kill the Ra'zac to get revenge on them killing Brom.

This is where I drop the ""but"": I wish I read these books when I was in my early teens. When I read through the Tales of Prydain. After Prydain I discovered Stephen King and (shudder) Clive Cussler. I didn't wind-up reading LoTR until I was in college and, even then, wish I had read THOSE books sooner, too.

Personally, I prefer Tolkein to Lewis but, like I said, I read them first in college and - as an English Lit major - there is SO much depth that LoTR keeps me coming back over and over again. Maybe I was looking too hard for the same thing in the Chronicles of Narnia.

Maybe 40-something is a bit too old but, for all of that, the books did engross me. The story and settings kept me immersed.

It has a similar ""otherworldly"" aspect to it, while also plunging further into that, as well as much deeper themes and darker moments, all without the ""childishness"" that seems to peep through Chronicles of Narnia's writing.

There are also religious themes, but rather than being about the substance of the religion itself, it's more about the practice and commentary on organized religion. However, I think it's better incorporated into the story, and is less prominent than in Narnia.

According to some of his associates, the event was so humiliating that Lewis chose to shift his focus towards evangelizing through children's literature instead, which is how the Chronicles of Narnia was born.

It's still a fun ride, though.  If you're in it for the fun adventure, go ahead.  Don't let anyone tell you it's too immature for you, just don't take the messaging too seriously.

The most famous allegory at the time was Pilgrim’s Progress, and it was disgustingly simple, preachy, and patronizing. I know this because it used to be one of my favorite books as a young Christian, and most early 20th century Christians were raised on it as a collection of moral fables. Yet another forceful extension of Christian inculcation. I love the Chronicles of Narnia, but there’s no denying C.S. Lewis was very preachy in it. His concern about its reception makes sense as he achieved a higher level of fame when he started debating atheists and pandering to the Christian community, which risked him losing status among his peers during the scientific revolution. He was doubtlessly influenced by Pilgrim’s Progress himself. His literary idol was George MacDonald whose family performed plays inspired by it, and Lewis himself went on to write Pilgrim’s Regress, a very direct and intentional allegory explicitly alluding to Pilgrim’s Progress. Lewis was trying to save Chronicles from the same death that was already arriving for Pilgrim’s Progress, and he partially succeeded I think. Mere Christianity is a ever-weakening attempt to bolster 1st Century stories and is already mostly forgotten, but some of his fiction will probably stand the test of time because he was more faithful in it to his expertise in literary mythos which typically departs more or less from prosaic moralizing.",Hailifiknow,2022-10-02T14:28:59Z,Narnia,COMMENT,Fantasy

Certainly you are right that the death and resurrection scenes are parallel to Christ's own: But no one in Narnia is saved because of that, except for Edmund, and it is not mentioned again nor is it a requirement for following Aslan. It's simply in the nature of Christ to die for one in need, in their place, even when they are guilty, and that is simply in the one book.

P.S. I recommend to others the original reading/written order: Leaving the Magician's Nephew as the 2nd to last book, and not reading it ""chronologically correct"" as the 1st book.  The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is very much meant to be the first book.  Edit in: The stories mostly stand on their own, and so it's not a necessity to read them in *any* specific order.

I can still remember many of the quotes word for word in the various actor's voices. It really fed my desire to learn how to read and understand the world around me, seen or unseen.

When I got older I read the books, and it sparked my appetite for books and reading for the rest of my life. Once in a while, I'll reread them and notice things that resonate within me in a way they hadn't before or just appreciate how lyrical and smooth Lewis's storytelling is even years later. CS Lewis has a way of putting complex concepts and thoughts into words in a way that easy to understand, yet completely summarizes everything that it is in within the boundary of a few words.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite book of the series as it has the atmosphere of adventure and mystery while simultaneously giving the melancholy feeling of reading both an ending and a beginning. Reepicheep's final goodbye and journey into Aslan's Country gets me right in the feels every time I read it.

As some have said, Lewis was a better academic than he was a writer, but in his writing I find incredible ideas and images, and it's in these settings and possibilities that I love to go back to again and again.  The Magician's Nephew is a lovely creation-story, but it's not my favorite overall, which is probably the Horse and His Boy.

And who can forget Reepicheep, one of my favorite characters in all the series?

Just remember, these were written a long time ago.  They were ground-breaking then, and the fact that so many still cherish these stories goes to show that there are many universal ideas presented in a boiled-down way that resonates with a lot of people.

f27002,"In no particular order:

* The Chronicles of Prydain - The series that introduced me to High Fantasy. And until this day, I maintain, has one of the best coming of age stories written. Fantasy is still by far my favorite genre.

* Harry Potter - I grew up on Harry Potter like most 90s kids. At the time like a lot of them, I was obsessed about it. This got me into collecting memorabilia and buying multiple editions of the same book because of the cover. 

* The Chronicles of Narnia - The Horse and His Boy was my favorite title from the series. It didn't really age well. And I felt that the allusions to religion and Christianity got really in your face as the story was ending. I didn't really know it then, but maybe those were already signs pointing towards me being Agnostic.

* Shadow Children - As a kid, I thought this was a pretty dark story. Whereas I was used to knights, monsters and triumphing over evil, this was the most grounded book series I read at the time. Even in the first book, the event near the end was pretty shocking to me. I may not be a ride or die activist but I'm pretty outspoken about topics to push for equality and acceptance. 

* The Count of Monte Cristo - The very first book I ever read by myself. This was the book that started my love affair with reading. I was 9 and confined to bed rest after a head injury with nothing much to do. This book kept me company. 

+Bonus: As an adult -

* Mistborn Trilogy - my first foray into adult fantasy and introduced me to hard magic systems which I adore. Rediscovered my love of reading after several years of being in a rut.",kaysn,2020-02-11T12:32:23Z,Narnia,COMMENT,Fantasy
am6g7v,"I don't know about the antithesis of The Chronicles of Narnia, but that is an interesting way of looking at it. But I do know that the author, Phillip Pullman, is a huge fan of Milton's Paradise Lost, and that was part of the inspiration of his writing the His Dark Materials trilogy.  I enjoyed the books. It's basically a coming of age story, with some religious references, but nothing that strong, more of a certain type of cultural point.

Just so you know, there is a new trilogy that he is working on set in this world that touches on this one. There are also some other shorter works in the world.

Prince Caspian is (arguably) a lot more interesting because of the realpolitik aspects and that the Telmarines were basically just like the Pevensies in that they came to Narnia and stayed. However... The Telmarines decided that it'd be better to try and dominate pre-existing being in Narnia as opposed to working with them.

I don't really like The Last Battle because of the ending. Long story.",HappyMike91,2018-05-23T20:18:23Z,Narnia,COMMENT,Fantasy
8ll95e,"The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and His Boy each have unique flavors from the rest of the series. There's something so infinite about The Magician's Nephew, I always tried to imagine the various worlds beyond the doors. I have memories of reading The Horse and His Boy in a stable while waiting for my sister to be done with her horseback riding lessons.

I see TLTW&TW, Prince Caspian, and Dawn Treader as the meat of the series; they're very actiony with the strongest sense of continuity among them. Dawn Treader, being the 3rd written, makes the transition to exploring the edges of Lewis's world literally and figuratively. I was fascinated by this aspect and especially invested in Reepicheep. I'm glad that Silver Chair is getting a lot of love in this thread, it's one of my favorites. Puddleglum is a great character, and I liked seeing Eustace's character development.

The Last Battle is for me, like many others, the least favorite. Lewis gave in to his worst instincts with the apocalyptic themes here.

I think, looking back, that the Chronicles of Narnia cultivates a sense of transience and nostalgia. Lewis shows us moments of great beauty and great horror, then snatches them away. He taps into the fear of growing up, and he hints at mysteries never solved and tales never told. It makes Narnia feel so much bigger and more alive than what is actually revealed to us.",,2018-05-24T13:59:10Z,Narnia,COMMENT,Fantasy

Will and Maddie are sent to the neighbouring kingdom of Celtica to investigate reports of terrifying direwolves, an ancient species thought to be extinct. What they discover is even more of a threat - a sorceress who has brought direwolves and Wargals under her control and is building an army of creatures both living and supernatural. Arazan must be stopped before she becomes too powerful - but first Will and Maddie need to find her.

The plot and setting are ok but the main reason people read are because the characters are so well written and likable. However, in the royal ranger this changes. Our characters take a backseat to new ones that we don’t know. I don’t think this is inherently a bad thing, I mean brotherband did very well and that was about new characters. I think it’s because when royal ranger first came out it wasn’t it’s own series, it was book 12 in rangers apprentice. So readers go in expecting to see the characters we know and love just to find out they are now background characters. If you read them now and go into it knowing it’s a sequel series I think they will be fine, but going in with the expectation of your old favorites going on another adventure will make the book disappointing, regardless of how good it might be.",Ravenofthenorth,2020-08-30T15:52:33Z,The Royal Ranger,COMMENT,Fantasy

I have some obscenely bad news for you.

For some unknown and insane reason, nothing Flanagan has published since 2017 has been published in the UK. You can buy them on amazon, but they're American imprints and American spelling, etc.

Flanagan rejigged The Royal Ranger to a new series instead of book 12, and it already has two books (aside from TRR) published. edit: i see that your version of TRR is labeled as book 1, so I'm confused now, but there are still two more books.

I've contacted Penguin Random House in the UK, the US, and Australia, and I've contacted Flanagan himself, and none of them have an answer for me. As far as Flanagan is concerned, it's not a decision he's actively made, and the publishers are just being really cagey about it.

tell8n,"My only issue with the series and its not so much any singular book is the introduction of the Wargal and 
Kalkara. It leaves the reader to believe at the beginning that this ""universe"" has fantastical creatures that where going to play a larger role or just exist. The fact that Morgarath essentially held power over these creatures through mental strength leads to the impression of possibility of sorcerers or magic  in general but No. It set a tone for the story In a world that lead the reader to think one thing and then after morgarath you never see or hear of any other fantastical creatures until The Brotherband series when they get blown off course into the never ending sea and Thorn is telling them stories of a kraken and a whale breaches the surface near The ship and they freak out because they never seen one before.

afgxm2,"I agree that killing her off was stupid. I would have had no problem with it if he did it the right way. However, he just killed her out of nowhere. I mean if you are going to kill a character and deliver a more emotional punch. At least, build up the character and the scenes with that character before killing her/him off.

In the Royal Ranger series, he didn't even do a good job showing the effects her death had on Will. Aside for the fact, that he was just angry and nothing else.  Him having an apprentice was IMO for John to kill off Alyss without expanding the impact her death had on Will.

That being said, if Ranger Apprentice does have a Movie/tv series then they must eventually kill her off ,or else it won't be the same.  


Edit: I don't know if you watch RWBY, but a certain character died.  The writers for their many faults in that series, did it in a brilliant way, where the fans really learn how impactful her death was on another character.",,2019-01-13T08:48:01Z,The Royal Ranger,COMMENT,Fantasy

As to a reading order: Ranger's Apprentice (RA) 1-4, 7, 5-6, 8-11, Early Years, Brotherband, Royal Ranger. (I'd say early years before just because it ties in with the main series), and Royal Ranger will make more sense if you've read Brotherband.

I read them as an old teen and it took me ages to get past the Hobbit. The ideal audiance for these books was obsviously meant to be children. Tolkien describes the surrounding area and the nature soo damn much it makes you feel like you are reading the script to a nature documentary. 

After I read it I tried to read the first book from the box set and gave up. I was disappointed because I bought the box set and the hobbit and expected to read them all. I ended up giving them to a couple of friends who also came to the same conclusion. The last two books of the trilogy are still prestine because nobody opened them.

ghbu2d,"Absolutely.  At least the first one; I stopped there.  I felt like the attempts to raise the stakes up to LotR’s level (something about Smaug maybe joining the forces of darkness in the war he sees coming?  I don’t quite remember now) actually had the opposite effect.  The reason that The Hobbit always works for me is because it is *not* an overtly heroic story.  These are people off on an adventure that is not lofty or tied to the fate of the world.  There’s a sense that Bilbo could go off and get himself killed in a place that his neighbors have never heard of, and that it would matter very little to the world, and that sense of *being* small, not only physically but influentially, is such a big part of why that story reaches me in a way that LotR never did.

Lovely to read and act out. LotR was a major challenge given the dialects and world building intricacies. You can read these even when your kids are young. You'll be amazed at how much comprehension 6-8 year olds can handle.


I wouldn't trade doing that for anything. What a great experience for them, as well as my wife and I. If you read to children they will learn to not see it as a chore. When they are old enough, it is almost just as essential that you listen raptly as they start reading back to you. We started reading the Potter series to them, and by Order of the Phoenix they began reading them back to us. I've actually never read HBP and TDH...but I have had them read to me.

The pace wasn't breakneck speed which is good because it allowed me to figure out what the hell was going on.  I have the type of ADHD where I focus on everything at the same time.

ais5iq,"I was 12 and stuck at my grandparents back in '85. Tere were no kids close to mine or my brother's age nor was there even a park close. They didn't have cable and I was bored to death in their guest room. I came across a shelf with several green hard covered books. Each had gold writing and were very nondescript. I know now that it was some kind of classics series that my grandmother picked up somewhere as it had books from people like Mark Twain in it.

But one book had a name that made me want to see what it was about. In little gold letters were the words ""The Hobbit"". Out of boredom I began to read. I started mid morning and only stopped due to having to re-read some portions or words because I had a limited vocabulary or because I had to come eat dinner. I finished the book that night somewhere well after midnight and before dawn. 

It started a life long love affair with fantasy novels as well as spawned an immense love of reading. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many books I've read since then or even half the authors but I can tell you I read. A lot. Some of it over and over and some once and done.

ais5iq,"This has been the first r/books thread I could actually give my two cents in as I’m currently reading Return of the King, and am loving every second of it. 

A huge thing I noticed is that it’s about 90% easier to read The Hobbit than it is to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and for good reason. The Hobbit is the *perfect* introduction to Middle-Earth: you get to see all the races of the world and learn their special talents, you get the classic quest of venturing to slay a dragon (not to imagine the excitement of learning the thing talks), and its language is generally simple enough for even a child to be able to immerse themselves in it. 

Then comes the Lord of the Rings. As you read it you can tell this has been Tolkien’s magnum opus. An artfully worded and masterfully detailed telling of the most crucial times to happen in Middle-Earth. It’s honestly incredible how seriously you take the events that are happening and how easily you can imagine them. This series is one of my biggest recommendations.  

Like a few said this series is a great way to learn and really feel like you know English. It’s written in a way that feels like centuries ago. I actually have a a page in the notes app of my phone for every new word Tolkien teaches me. 

Tolkien’s method of story telling is literally genre-founding material. Of course the fantasy genre has been around for centuries but Tolkien’s world of Middle-Earth set the bar. Hell, it created the bar. 

I’m sorry, I just got excited when I saw I book that I love finally get a thread. My favorite part of The Hobbit has to be “Riddles in the Dark” when we first meet Gollum, and first encounter the One True Ring, with absolutely no idea what is to come.",MrCool87867,2019-01-23T05:52:34Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

The Hobbit or LOTR movies spent a lot of time building up and having massive battles, when the battles in the book were merely mentioned in a single paragraph.

Some could argue for each, but both are good in their own way, the movies made the storyline more consistent throughout with less downtime between drama or important events, and cutting out and changing useless plot lines added (specifically in the end of the LOTR books).

I wouldent suggest being a movie hater or a book hater like most on these subjects, each are good in their own way, the movies are more action packed, drama filled, and straightforward, the books spent a lot more time on smaller plot lines and events and explained them much more deeply.

However, after a number of complete readings it became apparent that she had followed - and grown to love - the story. Since she enjoyed The Hobbit perhaps she would also enjoy LotR, but this was not the case.

I speculate this is because The Hobbit is more linear and, comparitively, faster paced than The Lord of the Rings - as the vocabulary is not that much different between the two.
 
I've struggled to find other novels that appeal to her, e.g. Harry Potter, but to no avail. I wonder if that's because it breaks the formula of The Hobbit: Linear, A to B, and no flashbacks, forwards or parallel narratives.",zpc,2019-01-23T04:36:25Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I'm fairly certain it was his first foray into middle-earth, so hand holding is also expected to a degree, but Tolkien was a stickler for details.

It's also easy to go go in deep when explaining things, he did go on to create a fictional universe, complete with languages and a litany of backstories explaining the origin of that world with stories that predate the events of the hobbit by several thousand years.

One of my goals for the year is to read The History of Middle Earth, which is a twelve volume series following the evolution of Tolkien’s mythology, so I’ve just learned a lot about this specific topic.

What we see when we read The Silmarillion has its beginnings in writings Tolkien began writing almost 20 years before The Hobbit. He was a solider during WWI and still in his 20s when he started working on what we know as Middle Earth. The first two volumes of the series are known as The Book of Lost Tales (Tolkien’s original name for what he would eventually title The Silmarillion). Interestingly enough, Christopher Tolkien claims in the commentary that he began work on the HoME series to combat the widespread belief that The Silmarillion was a late work or the product of Christopher taking too many liberties with leftover material.

In reality, Tolkien had a well-developed world before he ever began writing the LOTR! It’s vey interesting, but definitely not going to be everyone’s cup of tea.",retrogamer_wv,2019-01-23T03:50:25Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

* The dwarves are a pretty greedy, selfish bunch that are primarily concerned about recapturing former glory, 
* the elves (Thranduil's bunch) are collossaly arrogant and spiteful, and only show up to fight to take a piece of the pie,
* Men (of the lake) are primarily concerned with politics and how to stay rich and in power
* Hobbits are a bunch of bumbling and narrow-minded country bumpkins

The whole story is essentially about how a couple of exceptional (and very untypical) individuals (Brand, Bilbo, Barin, Elrond, Gandalf) are stepping past their shadow to make things happen, once they are forced to do so. And even then, they have plenty of warts and issues.

It's quite at odds with them all having to make due during hard times for so many years leading up to their quest.

The only thing I could think of was this tone was struck in contrast to Bilbo's ability to adapt, so it is a plot device needed for the protagonist. The hobbit has a home he thinks he is tied to, but really he's bored and finds out more about himself on an adventure. The dwarves are on an adventure and desperate for a home to plunk down in, hating every minute of the journey. You might expect them to be more adaptable and prepared, but that would not have forced Bilbo's development nearly as well as having to save them multiple times.

ho1gj8,"huh. on the one hand you're right, on the other: it's a children's book that has been written to entertain Tolkien's children. If the dwarves would have been able to slay the dragon themselves there would have been not storyline in the beginning. and yes, Thorin and all the other dwarves had to make their living not as warriors but rather as some kind of salesmen. and everyone had to be a bit clumsy and incompetent to make the story line work. In my opinion you can feel that when the adult parts get into the story - the one ring and Gollum's fate, Beorn and his powers and of course, Bilbo's act of betraying Thorin for his own good, Gandalf who had to disappear sometime soon so that noone could think of him slaying the dragon and solving the problem. also: I guess Lake-town had to burn down because Bard should not be the glorious hero, but also a broken man who lost all. it was never the intention of Tolkien to contribute to the big heroic stuff but to the ""even the smallest people can make the difference"" storyline.

the fun thing is that it turns around in the Lord of the Rings: everyone does his best and the hobbits are now the clumsy people. the rest: warriors, sometimes professional trained killing machines (you remember one of the first scenes of the movie? those long lines of Elvish soldiers with precise movements, killing a second before they themselves are getting killed)",ssaminds,2020-07-09T14:58:41Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

ho1gj8,"Well, Tolkien understood that not everyone in your story can be wise and good, because among other reasons, it makes the people who you really want to highlight as being wise and good appear ordinary by comparison. In The Hobbit, Gandalf and Elrond are the unambiguously virtuous heroes (and you can add in Aragorn and Faramir in LoTR), to which the rather selfish and dimwitted dwarves serve as a contrast.

Finally, and most importantly, Bilbo can't be portrayed as a reluctant Hero if the dwarves are competent, bold, and decisive. Then he really would have been just a tag-along burglar, with no real importance to the story, and no means by which to rise in the dwarves' esteem. It's the same reason that the government is either incompetent or corrupt in action movies. If the FBI in Die Hard had been competent, there's no need for John McClane to go on a rampage to save everyone. If Lestrade is a good detective, Sherlock Holmes is just a snarky drug addict.

Also, I'm not sure if I'd describe the dwarves as bellends, they're just... normal. People acting in self-interest, and avoiding risks is completely rational, and mostly how people behave in the real world. Thorin's particular case of gold-madness is arguably the worst of their deeds, and that's a device used to dramatize the approach of the final battle, as well as to hammer home one of the Hobbit's moral themes.",DeadFyre,2020-07-09T16:17:15Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

As soon as the dwarves, by exploiting Bilbo who is a comfortable middle-class, get all the gold for themselves they just turn into the same monster the dragon was.

I'm coming the conclusion that Gandalf was the prime mover of the whole story, that it was his intention all along to have someone, dwarf or hobbit, determine the location of the one ring (he lucked out that someone actually found and possessed it, and that it was a hobbit). Gandalf has, all along, had a soft spot for hobbits. As a valar, he had more knowledge about the capabilities of hobbits and knew they were the few folk who could handle the power of the one ring. Other than wanting to gain status in their own community (for example, the Sackville-Bagginses who saw possession of Bilbo's home as a way to rise in status among the hobbit community), hobbits had absolutely no desire to gain power in the world.

ho1gj8,"I think the underlying messages of these books and others in this ilk tends to be that the non-human creatures are ultimately portrayed as morally inferior to humans, even though humans are often physically and technically inferior. Creatures like Dwarves and Hobbits are long-lived and intensely creative and crafty, but ultimately greedy, self-interested and unwilling to sacrifice anything for the benefit of anyone in the world outside their immediate environment. Elves are essentially immortal, physically powerful and agile, and control sophisticated magical and psychic powers, and much more in tune with nature, but they ultimately have the same failing, they are self-interested and unwilling to fight for an ultimate morality  on behalf of what they see as inferior beings. The message I got from the Hobbit/LOTR is that these peoples can't succeed against an evil force like Sauron without the leadership, self-sacrifice, and moral compass of humans, flawed though they may be.

In many respects, the Christian bias of the authors of works like these shows through, given the historical contexts of European colonization of the world, where the ""noble savage"" is respected for his strength, craft, and bond with nature, while being in need of the ""civilized"" man's moral code, or in the context of these stories, the underdog humans, who are inherently noble and imbued with a manifest destiny they have yet to achieve.

Tolkien consciously modeled dwarves after Jews, especially in the Hobbit. He wasn't the first to do this (e.g. Wagner in Ring of the Nibelung) and his use of negative stereotypes in doing so was far from the most problematic (again, see Wagner).

Some of the positive or neutral aspects of Tolkien using Jews as a model for dwarves:

- The dwarves' displacement from Misty Mountain was modeled after the Jewish displacement into diaspora.

- The Dwarven language was modeled after Hebrew, especially its blocky alphabet, ever-present use of three-consonant roots, and use of guttural sounds. The dwarven word ""Khazad"" is an excellent example of this.

Some of the negative aspects:

- A stereotype for avarice and obsession with wealth.

- Stereotypes for cowardice and whining.

As /u/mahoganyecho points out, the Dwarves in Tolkien's writing evolved as he learned more about Jews and the way that Nazi and racist ideologies of his time misrepresented them. That's part of why Gimli in LOTR is depicted as a noble, brave character who explicitly turns away from the material greed of the dwarves Tolkien had created earlier in his career.",hurhurdedur,2020-07-09T17:29:16Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I took a class on Tolkien and this was one of our points of discussion. Our professor made it clear that the characterization of the dwarves in *The Hobbit* is anti-semitic, but he also pointed out that Tolkien realized the issue and attempted to address it via Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings*.

Gimli’s characterized as a much different sort than Thorin and the other dwarves. His moment with Galadriel (where he asks for a lock of her hair) shows that he’s not at all greedy and instead appreciative of beauty. His relationship with Legolas also showcases him as unbiased or at least shows willingness on his part to check his prejudices.

It was just nice to learn that though Tolkien’s prejudices were clear in *The Hobbit* he at least attempted to work against them through Gimli in the main series.",cae37,2020-07-09T17:53:20Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

There is page after page after page of descriptions of the shire and it kind of dragged for me but once they get to Rivendell the pace picks up dramatically and it almost feels like Tolkien wrote the shire parts long before the rest of the book. 

From what I’ve read in these comments, Tolkien was told to write a book after The Hobbit success, about more hobbits, and that’s what the beginnings of fellowship of the ring are, until he combined it into a grand epic all together, it definitely feels that way.

Often, however, these greedy, avaricious characters are characterized with negative Jewish stereotypes out the wazoo, and denying the author's intention can be harmful.

That's an interesting question, to which the answer is *sort of*. Tolkien definitely had in is mind that The Necromancer was Sauron; in fact an earlier draft of *The Hobbit* [explicitly referenced](https://preview.redd.it/j2iaae8pq6qz.jpg?width=576&auto=webp&s=d36dcc6978756ed1990ca7528ab0dfa9c6a360f9) his role in the Beren and Luthien story.

It was when Tolkien went to write *The Lord of the Rings* that Sauron took form as the principal antagonist of that work and more firmly as a secondary to Melkor in the entire legendarium. So the gist is that Tolkien *did* mean that the Necromancer was Sauron; but Sauron wasn't quite yet the Sauron everybody knows him as",TheGuineaPig21,2020-07-09T13:42:16Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

In the case of dwarves many of their characteristics displayed in The Hobbit (short, long beards, excellent smiths, living in vast underground halls full of treasure) come from norse/germanic legends which Tolkien was very familiar with.

Too, Thorin, grandson of the Dwarf murdered to spark the war, and Dain, grandnephew of the same, might have been allowed to go to war earlier than most out of a sense of revenge: Gimli, older during the events of *The Hobbit* than either of those Dwarves during the Battle of Azanulbizar, was not allowed to be part of the events of that book, being considered too young at the age of 62.",,2020-07-09T18:08:53Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I’d also argue that it’s possible to make use of existing ethnic stereotypes to create a fictional race of people without actually holding to the prejudice associated with those stereotypes in reality. It’s clear that the dwarvish race is inspired by the Jewish people, but that doesn’t necessarily make his fictional stories commentaries about them or their actual culture.

ho1gj8,">	Im not so convinced that later portrayls make the Dwarves to look so great. We get one token Dwarf in Gimli who has to work out his prejudice for elves and arguably is the butt of some jokes

The jokes about Gimli, as far as I can remember, are largely light-hearted and have nothing to do with anything that could be construed as a Jewish stereotype, though. And it isn’t Gimli working out his prejudice for elves, it’s Gimli and Legolas working out their respective prejudices against each other’s people - a long-standing prejudice based on ancient grievances. Moreover, we find out that the Dwarves are difficult to corrupt and proved resistant to the effects of the seven rings, very much unlike humans. Tolkien depicts dwarves as noble, kind, and creative as often as greedy and prideful (traits which are neither restricted only to the dwarves).

>	Its not outright negative, but there is a kind of paternalism to the idea that, if they just stayed in diaspora and learned to get along with elves and humans, they'd be better off.

This bit reminds me of high school English classes where I learned that you can make almost any text “mean” almost anything by creatively interpreting carefully selected minor details. And that message is completely at odds with the reclamation of the Lonely Mountain, and the fact that the Dwarves ultimately did reclaim Moria after Sauron’s defeat.

I would argue that you’re nibbling at, and misrepresenting, a small portion of a much larger theme of LoTR: that overcoming the differences between people is key to peace and prosperity. There are elements of this all throughout the Hobbit, LoTR, and Tolkien’s other works, both between different races and between different factions within a given race. 

Tolkien didn’t write races without flaws. Even the elves and the gods of his world were flawed, and Iluvatar prompted Melkor to sing discordantly in the song of creation. If we take every flaw and fault of his dwarves as signs of authorial prejudice, then Tolkien was prejudiced against everyone.",sticklebat,2020-07-09T16:13:04Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

The LOTR is a mess by comparison, and not nearly as well written either.

vhkqw7,"I'm not surprised Tolkien wasn't the first, I didn't think it would go back as far as the Romans though.

After looking up Miles Gloriosus, I think I'd categorize that a little differently. If I'm reading this correctly, a character appears on stage and becomes the narrator of the story. The audience knows it's a character telling them a story.

In most stories, it's not a character telling you the story and you have every reason to assume everything you're reading is exactly what happened to the characters. In LOTR it's a surprise to find out  that the story you're reading is an in-universe book written by Bilbo and Frodo. It's a pretty different effect when you have no clue it was possible that you were being misled by someone.

BTW I'm also curious if Tolkien planned for that to be the case the entire time, or if it was a late addition. Knowing this and re-reading it, it seems to be planned the whole time. Most of the story is told from the POV of the hobbits, which is naturally who Bilbo and Frodo would be able to get the most information from.

The parts where hobbits aren't present (like Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's journey together) seem to include fewer details about what the characters are feeling. Aragorn and Legolas are portrayed as nearly perfect people while Gimli seems more relatable... it feels like Frodo and the hobbits must have spent a lot more time getting to hear the parts of the story they missed from Gimli, than from Aragorn or Legolas.",chocoboat,2022-06-22T10:00:17Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Yes and no. In this case Wikipedia is correct in their claim, but using a rather weak quote to prove it. In other places, Tolkien is far less ambiguous; Hobbits are a branch of Men.

> *The Hobbits are, of course, really meant to be a branch of the specifically human race (not Elves or Dwarves) – hence the two kinds can dwell together (as at Bree), and are called just the Big Folk and Little Folk. They are entirely without non-human powers, but are represented as being more in touch with 'nature' (the soil and other living things, plants and animals), and abnormally, for humans, free from ambition or greed of wealth. They are made small (little more than half human stature, but dwindling as the years pass) partly to exhibit the pettiness of man, plain unimaginative parochial man – though not with either the smallness or the savageness of Swift, and mostly to show up, in creatures of very small physical power, the amazing and unexpected heroism of ordinary men 'at a pinch'.*

That was the only translation before the publication of *The Lord of the Rings* in 1955-56.  *The Hobbit* was then translated into German in 1957, Dutch and Polish in 1960,  Portuguese and Swedish (again) in 1962, Spanish in 1964, and Japanese in 1965.  

In 1965 Ace published an unauthorized paperback edition of *The Lord of the Rings* and Tolkien countered by revising the work and authorizing the first paperback edition the same year.  This is when *The Lord of the Rings* became a phenomenon, and suddenly *The Hobbit* was a phenomenon, as well, read by adults as much or more than by children.  *The Hobbit* was turned into a radio play in 1968 and a film in 1977, and it has now been translated into over 40 languages.

The primary effect of WWI on Tolkien's stories were certain memories and images, and the loss of most of his closest friends.

""The pines were roaring on the height,
The wind was moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.""

Or maybe it's more correct to say that there it morphs into more into a sense of awe, which seems very similar when I try to attach words to it, but the feel is very distinct.

The effort to make them so they fit with the LOTR movies was a decent enough one, at least as far as the concept is concerned. Even Tolkien himself started rewriting The Hobbit in the '60s with the goal of doing exactly that. He even had Bilbo and the dwarves pass through Bree in his new version. He got sidetracked with The Silmarillion, though, and never finished the project.

But stuff was just way too padded in order to fill out a trilogy. The endless chase through the goblin tunnels, the pointless chase in the fields prior to Rivendell, the silly sequence with the giants ... all indicative of a filmmaker just filling out the running time.

71jf0s,"Respectfully disagree. I think that's a pretty common opinion though that comes from a familiarity of primarily mainstream fantasy and sci-fi, but it's not entirely true. LOTR made modern fantasy mainstream and influenced one popular subgenre, but it by no means defines the entire genre. 

The thing is that there are a LOT of different subgenres of both sci-fi and fantasy. War of the Worlds is one type of sci-fi in the same way that LOTR is only one type of fantasy. You also have to think about the other stuff Wells wrote, like The Time Machine, which has also been massively influential. Plus he wasn't the only author that wrote highly influential sci-fi. Frankenstein has already been pointed out, but there was also Jules Verne, and other authors like Rudyard Kipling or Edgar Allen Poe wrote sci-fi as well. And if you look at other types of modern sci-fi, like say, cyberpunk, you don't find Wells in there at all. 

Looking at LOTR, Tolkien was influential on the high or epic fantasy genre, but fantasy was thriving as a genre via the pulps. If I had to recommend old fantasy to a reader who liked modern stuff, I would go with the pulps because the level of action, moral ambiguity and even writing style is closer to that than Tolkien these days. Plus, fantasy has always been more than just wizards and elves. Tolkien wrote alongside CS Lewis, and his fantasy is very different from Tolkien's, yet still massively influential. HP Lovecraft wrote horror stories, but they were also technically fantasy or sci-fi stories at times as well.

The largest take away should be that we can rarely ever attribute something to only one person. Typically it's because of multiple influences that came across similar ideas around the same time. Obviously there will only ever be one or a few that get remembered by the mainstream, but you gotta think about the stages of influence. The writers in the 70s and 80s that were inspired by Tolkien also read the other authors writing at that time too. What is obscure to a modern reader may not have been as obscure back then. I mentioned to another poster that Poul Anderson's The Broken Sword is similar to LOTR and was released the same year, and Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland's Daughter predates both LOTR AND The Hobbit.

There's like, all kinds of weird, unrelated shit that happens before they get to the big quest.

Besides, as I [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/71jf0s/the_hobbit_was_published_80_years_ago_today_in/dnbns4u/?context=3), Tolkien himself once undertook an unfinished effort to bring The Hobbit more tonally in line with Lord of the Rings, even inserting Bree into it to better match up, so what Jackson and co. wanted to do in that regard wasn't out of line, at least as far as their goals were concerned.

I'm with you on Radagast as well. I was always intrigued by that character. The one we got on film was just awful. I think Tolkien would have been appalled at the idea of having him walk around with bird poop in his hair.

The Hobbit is one book that could have never been confused for being more than one book.  I agree that there are theoretical ways you could remain true to the book and have more than one movie, but it would be extremely hard to do right because you risk doing things like interpreting scenes fully which were only lightly treated in the book, and thus readers might have had a completely different view of.

The usual baseline reason that movies are shorter to show than books are to read is because a picture is worth a thousand words.  You can just show an environment that might have taken pages to set up in a book and also do the dialogue while the viewer is basically taking in both environment and dialogue at the same time.

71jf0s,"I think the reason is best explained by the stylistic approach.

Because LOTR and The Hobbit are such classic, foundational books, fans expect a degree of reverence. 

It doesn't have to be exact. No one wants a narrator to spend 40 minutes describing the architecture of Helm's Deep. LOTR did an excellent job of creating the atmosphere of the book in movie form. Down to the musical work even.

The Hobbit was a hard project to take on, because it (the book) has a very different feel compared to LOTR.  It just isn't a cinematically friendly story.

I figured it wouldn't be too well received due to the extreme ""fairy tale"" vibe of the book. If Jackson was true to the book, the movie would seem goofy, and if it took more liberties it would make the purist camp angry. It was a lose lose situation

Unfortunately Jackson did both. On one hand it was a very *Hollywood* movie, what with a lot absurdities in the action scenes and rather than a dramatic score it featured pop artists.  This felt like a n Adam Sandler rom-com.  Which would have been ok if he had just decided to embrace the fairy tale and be true to the book despite the silliness. Instead he also took some difficult liberties. The ""extra stuff"" meant to tie into LOTR felt unnecessary to many.  And while I admire the female character addition (which Tolkien unfortunately overlooked), Jackson shot himself in the foot by making...nay...forcing her into a ham-fisted love interest side story.

TL;DR

A true-to-the-book approach would have felt silly in film but made purists and children happy. Artistic liberties would have made a better film but made purists check out. Jackson took the worst from both options.",Laser_Dogg,2017-09-21T20:37:07Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It's Bilbo's tale and should be told from his subjective POV. To him, this magical world outside the Shire seems crazy and surreal and even stranger than it already is. A series of adventures, one after another, with no clue what's coming next. He feels alienated from his companions, as they think he's something he's not, and he has to constantly disguise what he really is. And of course the silliness--because when the story begins, he is a fundamentally silly person.

It's no ""The Hobbit"" in that the good guys wear white hats, the bad guys wear black hats (a slight over-simplification, I know, don't downvote me!). It's humans (and some non-humans) being human to each other. Some are just and good, some are debased assholes, but most are a bit of both.


The first book in the series, ""The Gardens of the Moon"" is a bit of a trial for some to get through, especially considering Steve Erikson has build a playland that spans a solid history of some 100,000 years, and a not-so-solid history that reaches as far back as maybe another 500,000.

t5o4v2,"FWIW since you called out Jackson by name: even though he did his job and put on a brave face for the media, most evidence suggests that it was the studio who demanded three movies, after the original vision was two movies. Then Guillermo del Toro left the project and essentially left Peter Jackson with roughly  two years (if that) to put together an entirely new vision for a blockbuster film trilogy when his previous success had been built on a trilogy that took six to eight years of work. 

I don’t like the Hobbit movies either, but from a filmmaking perspective I don’t think PJ deserves the blame. It’s more similar to what happened to the Star Wars sequel trilogy.",undiscokidd42,2022-03-03T22:30:58Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

t5o4v2,"The Hobbit movies are trash. For what it's worth, Jackson never wanted to do the movies but I'm guessing the movie studios threw a fuck ton of money at him and it was too good to turn down. It was originally also only supposed to be two movies but the studio turned it into a trilogy so they had to really pad these movies out. It's my understanding that at least some of the extra padding came from supplementary materials. However, Legolas was shoehorned in by the studio simply because people liked him from the LotR and Tauriel was completely made up just so they could have some half-assed love story in there as well.

I'm honestly not even a huge fan of the Hobbit. It's a great introductory book to the world of Middle-Earth for younger readers but it pales in comparison to the LotR. That being said, the book is infinitely better than the movies.

t5o4v2,"Finished reading the Hobbit to my wife and kid, never saw the movies and we're watching them now. I read it when I was a kid but upon rereading I was truly amazed at how short of a book it is, there is basically no filler.

I was honestly surprised by the first movie, I enjoyed it. Yes there is a lot more filler and movie action but it was true enough to the book. Then I enjoyed the first half of the second movie before it jumped off the deep end and became completely fucking ridiculous. Haven't finished the third movie.

Some changes I like, like why they brought a burglar, why the Arkenstone is so important, and how they plan to kill the dragon. In the book it makes the dwarves seem like they have absolutely NO PLAN for when they get inside the mountain. They literally spend THREE DAYS cowering in pitch black darkness because it turns out there is indeed a dragon.

Changes I really don't like: Bard being a seer who can predict the exact future, Bard already knows about the dragon's weakness so now Bilbo's riddling & discovery is meaningless, multiple changes to the story that make Thorin even more of an insane evil bastard. The dragon chasing dwarves sequence in a movie that already had that overindulgent barrel scene. I was super excited to see the events at Dol Guldur until that GOOFY ass fight sequence with those GOOFY ass wraiths.

Peter Jackson has never seen a chase or fight sequence that dragged on too long, he probably wanted to add even more to each of them.

t5o4v2,"My favorite way of thinking about it is this:  

The Lord of the Rings movies were made by people who loved the books.  The Hobbit movies were made by people who loved the profit made by the Lord of the Rings movies.  

The Hobbit is a much simpler story.  A much narrower one than any one of the LOTR books.  The fact that it has about as much screen time as the entire LOTR trilogy just boggles my mind.  Adding literally everything you can justify from the appendices to the LOTR (and quite a few things you can't justify) does not enhance the story.  It takes away from it.  

I enjoy Tolkien's wider lore, without even approaching being an expert in it.  But I LOVE the Hobbit.  It was literally my first experience in the genre (as it was for *countless* others) and has a special place in my heart.  

I watched the Hobbit movies in theatres.  But I will NEVER buy them.  And I will likely never watch them again.  Unless they were to someday come to their senses and release a revised re-edited version that actually told the story of the Hobbit in preferably a single movie, or at most two.

LOTR were passion pieces done as true to the books as possible, given the restraints of the times. Jackson never would’ve gotten approval for an epic 9 film high fantasy film franchise when LOTR came out. Simply not the times we see today where just about everything is approved and made.

The Hobbit films strike me very much as a well done money grab. Many folks may disagree about them being “well done”, but it’s important to also include the “money grab”. For a money grab trilogy, these were pretty good. I guess what I’m saying is, I shudder to think what they would’ve been without Jackson.",ELI5_Omnia,2022-03-03T14:24:06Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

A small defense of the movies... some of the subplots take from Tolkein's other works, particularly the Silmarillion, as a way to work in some of the mythology he created. Mostly, I refer to the Necromancer = Sauron reveal. When Tolkein wrote the Hobbit, he had not made that connection. He did that retroactively when fleshing out the mythology of middle-earth. I don't mind them mixing in elements from Tolkein's creations. All the unnecessary, forced, CGI action scenes are what ruined it. So bad.

t5o4v2,"Late to the party but I wrote a semi-deep review post on the Hobbit trilogy in partial comparison to the book on /r/lotr a little while ago so, in answer to a question about whether the poor reception of newer hollywood flubs would leave the Hobbit films viewed differently:  
  
> I really loved some changes that were made (e.g. Bilbo actively deciding to go on the adventure rather than being pushed out the door by Gandalf) and some of the more fleshed out story lines (Rhadagast discovering the evil in Mirkwood and a look at Gandalf dealing with ""the Necromancer""). Then there were some added pieces that I didn't particularly love but realized they helped maintain or add tension that is more necessary for a movie format than a book (Saruman in Rivendell trying to shut down the dwarves, Thorin's ongoing disdain for Bilbo, extra focus on the Arkenstone). Martin Freeman was fantastic as Bilbo. The Unexpected Party, Riddles in the Dark and Bilbo's encounter with Smaug are exceptionally well done in ways that bring the scenes to life.  
  
> And that's about as far as I can go with love for the Hobbit movies. At the end of the day they were heavily over-produced, written with absurd internal inconsistencies, suffer from terrible pacing problems and feel almost slavish to a standard ""hollywood focus group"" checklist. The use of CGI is overbearing, and much of it looks far worse than actors in costume did 10-15 years prior when the LotR trilogy was filmed. That in itself probably wouldn't be such a major issue if it wasn't constantly used to create ridiculous scenes that break immersion. Barrel fighting, dwarf-head dancing, wooden goblin bridge falling-then-sticking, stone giant knee-not-crushing, Legolas falling-stone-running, Thorin *molten gold wheelbarrow riding* scenes just constantly remind me that I'm watching a movie that is actively defying basic physics to the point where it's hard to stay invested. The decision to make two movies into a trilogy (fueled primarily by studios) and the addition of too many non-book, non-canon scenes wrecks the pacing in a major way. This is why we need an extended Thorin-Azog showdown before the eagle rescue. This is why we need the dwarves to... somehow explode a molten gold statue(? ugh...) to fight Smaug. Those movies each need a major climax because they need to be their own movies because three movies make more money than two. Then, because hollywood needs a love interest, the character of Tauriel is invented and needs to fall in love with a dwarf. So she falls in love with one of the three most-human-looking dwarves instantly over a penis joke. The story has to revolve around the most-human-looking dwarves because some people might care less if it was about more goofy-looking dwarves. Stephen Fry has to create drama as the master of lake town and they have to invent a character named (big big sigh) *Alfrid Lickspittle* to take up a completely unwarranted amount of screen time just being antagonistic during the extra time with the company in Lake Town they already had to invent because they needed 3 movies instead of 2. There were just way too many hands in the pot here. Too many studios trying to squeeze a profit out of the Hobbit movies. Too many producers who got too much input into what the product had to look like to maximize profits. While there were some decisions clearly made out of love and understanding of the source material, the ultimate product was a confused hollywood mess.  
  
  
> With that all said, I don't think the poor quality of the Star Wars sequel trilogy etc. would *improve* the reception of the Hobbit movies. The Star Wars sequels had much more glaring issues of writing (haven't seen the most recent Matrix to judge) where the characters just do dumb things or rules change within the universe because if those things didn't happen the plot wouldn't exist. Ultimately, bad movies are bad and poorly written movies are poorly written regardless of whatever else is common in cinema at the time. Despite all my criticisms, the Hobbit movies aren't nearly as bad as The Last Jedi or The Rise of Skywalker on those fronts. They were disappointing compared to the love and care we got to see put into the LotR trilogy (and a reminder that we are all beyond blessed to have gotten the exceptional quality we did get out of that trilogy) and they were bloated with a lot of superfluous junk and they frequently asked viewers to suspend their understanding of the laws of physics for the sake of an action set piece, but they weren't complete travesties of writing or in-world consistency like the latter Star Wars movies, and the existence of those far-worse movies doesn't justify the problems of the Hobbit trilogy.",O_the_Scientist,2022-03-03T17:38:09Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

t5o4v2,"Behind the scenes of LOTR, there was a lot of love and passion and exhaustion. Behind the scenes of the Hobbit was a cluster kerfuffle of rewrites, works that was just discarded and studio interference and broken contracts. There's stories if not videos of Ian McKellen breaking down sobbing because he was forced to do much of his work in green screen without interaction with other actors. The Elf-Dwarf romance thing was added in post production reshoots, over the objections of the actress. 

The book is ultimately a children's book. Hobbits, despite their age, are rather more child sized and approachable, and Bilbo is a hero not because of his profiency as a warrior but with his guile and creative thinking. The elements I think worked best in the movies are the things from the books. Martin Freeman is a delight and was perfectly cast. I even enjoy the fun of the barrel riding scene as stupid as it is. There's is a childlike way of thinking that goes into it.  (Although since the river was a source of trade and travel, it doesn't make sense to be rapids). There's enough good stuff in the trilogy to be edited down to be a more book fidelity single movie that would be much better received by the fans of the book.

Despit not liking the trilogy, the fact is I don't have any grudges or anything bad to say for any of the performers or crew, who clearly went into the production with the hope of contributing to film legacy with fervent desire to bring a class book to life. Faults lie mostly with the director, Peter Jackson, but even he didn't want to make this trilogy but was forced to due to studio contracts after the Studio butted heads with the original director, so in this case I will say the issue ultimately lies with the studio. 

I would also give credit to Orlando Bloom: I feel like he actually performed better as an actor this time around, or was given more of a chance to. When he did LOTR, he was a new actor fresh out of acting school, and I presume was told to play Legolas as stoic. In this the direction was different so I feel like he got to express and act more. While I don't like the Legolas storyline, I don't have a problem with his performance in it.

With LOTR movies there's tons things that were removed or changed and added in order to make the story work as a movie Trilogy, and they did a decent job of making those changes work. And from a movie making perspective, it's understandable. For the Hobbit, the changes added unneeded complexity and seemed to make less sense from a movie making perspective. The Studio wanted the Hobbit to be a prequel for the LOTR movies instead of it standing as the book does, as a fully independent story.

It diverges significantly more from the books.

The Hobbit movies are overall slightly better adaptations, but worse movies.

The movies are stuffed full of obnoxious filler, side plots from other LOTR lore, and extra characters (like that random orc guy who hates Thorin) who were never in the book in the first place

The crowning achievement is the 3rd film which takes ONE chapter from the book that Bilbo sleeps through and turns it into a massive pointless CGI conflict.

t5o4v2,"I think the Hobbit movies really improved two items about the book:

1) The dwarves in the movies were highly capable. In the book, none of the dwarves did anything of note. They got lost, didn't ration their food, got captured, wasted arrows, and were generally incompetent. I think making them capable warriors and adventurers was a good chance (really highlighted by the Battle against Smaug at the end of the second movie, which I think was well done). 

2) And specifically, making Thorin Oakenshield a capable and charismatic leader until he got dragon sickness. Book Thorin is basically a peevish British aristocrat who only gets people to follow him by promising riches. Movie Thorin is a force, who is then struck low, and rises again. I think it makes for a much better arc.

I don't blame Peter Jackson for how the movies turned out as he was essentially forced to make them as the studio wanted once Guillermo del Toro quit because of studio interference.

The Hobbit: The Tolkien Edit is 3-4 hours long and is pretty decent, but the characterizations of the characters that weren't shoehorned into the movie is still difficult to stomach. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is easily the best part of the movie.

and yeah, LotR, especially the increasingly extended cuts are surprisingly true to the books with small changes that make sense for the transition from page to screen without being super obvious.  I think the difference in fidelity of LotR compared to The Hobbit was what surprised and shocked a lot of people about it.

The conspiracy theorist in my says that GdT left The Hobbit because the studio wanted him to make the changes we saw in the final product and he refused, then they forced PJ to finish the film with their changes with some sort of dire threats in hand.

Movies can pick up main characters and plot points from a book but a book relies on the readers imagination to interpret the words on a page to provide images for the story, where for a movie compelling images are the only way it can try to tell the story.

Secondly, in too many cases the only thing a movie and a book may have in common is the title and maybe the main characters names and backgrounds, but in the Hobbit even that doesn't hold true. If I could compel answers from Peter Jackson about why a lot of the story was done so very, very poorly and not at all the way the story went in the book I would, but I probably wouldn't like the answers I got.",Juviltoidfu,2022-03-03T22:43:33Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

t5o4v2,"I, for one, enjoyed the trilogy.  They say that world was going to end on December 21, 2012.  What happened instead was that I and my family got to see the first Hobbit movie.  I have read the original story in preparation for it, and the book had so many problems, problems that the movie fixed by expanding upon it.  Azog the Defiler was mentioned only fleetingly.  So what?  The threat of the Necromancer existed in only one sentence.  So what?  Radagast the Brown was mentioned only once.  ***So.  WHAT?!***  These, among other things, are what made the movie better because those irrelevancies have become relevant.  Also, it is nice to go back to Middle-earth and see what has been accomplished since not only *The Lord of the Rings*, but also *King Kong*.  In fact, it was this movie that I got to hear my favorite movie quote, one that resonates more strongly with each passing year since and one that I'd see again with the character of Ezran in Netflix's fantasy series *The Dragon Prince*:

&#x200B;

>Saruman believes that it is only great power that can keep evil in check.  But that is not what I have found.  I've found that it is the small things--everyday deeds of ordinary folk--that keeps the darkness at bay.  Simple acts of kindness and love.  Why Bilbo Baggins?  Perhaps it is because I am afraid...and he gives me courage.

&#x200B;

The reason I originally had The Desolation of Smaug at number two had nothing to do with the added character of Tauriel and mostly to do with the actress playing her, Evangeline Lilly.  (***Long story.***)  However, as with *An Unexpected Journey*, what were once mere skims in the book have expanded into vital moments.  The payoff, without doubt, was Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Smaug.  Since Andy Serkis as Gollum and Kong, this was a big deal that has, as of 2020, not cooled down yet.  There was an air of power and confidence in that character, one that has instantly drawn me to him.  Indeed, his conversation with Bilbo was the most powerful of any version of *The Hobbit*, and here's why:  In the book, Smaug derailed Bilbo's confidence on what he was planning to do with his share of the treasure (""Not much use on the mountainside, I imagine?  Not much use in the forest?  Have you never thought of that catch?  A fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it.  Those were the terms, weren't they?  But what about delivery?  What about cartage?  What about armed guards and tolls?"")  That is an issue, but one that can easily be mended.  In the Rankin/Bass film, Smaug never bothered to play with Bilbo--he didn't even suspect the dwarves waiting outside!  (""Then I have guessed your riddle.  You are one of those miserable, tub-thumping Lake-men!  You are your kind will pay dearly for this intrusion.  So the Lake-men will seize my treasure!"")  In this film, Smaug pushed the right buttons by bringing up the Arkenstone, a big deal for Bilbo's friends and one of the many problems in the book that the films fixed by expanding upon it.  He knew how important that gem was to the dwarves, and so he nailed the long-underused ""weaponizing language"" trope.  (""I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer.  Watch it destroy him.  Watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad."")",JohnWarrenDailey,2022-03-03T22:00:24Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

The Hobbit was written as a children's book.  It was actually written for his child.  The reason why much of the 'exciting' bits in the movie were added is simply because the book did not have them.  It didn't have them because the book is targeted at young people (as in under 10).  

IMHO, the movie would have been (one movie because the book doesn't support more than one) would have been incredibly boring without the add libbing that went on.

t5o4v2,"The Hobbit movies reveal the major problem with the idea of the ""prequel:"" If the movie is made after another movie in the series, even if it takes place earlier in the chronology, it must follow the rules of the previous movie, even if following said rules doesn't make sense to the chronology. This becomes a bigger problem when you have something like The Hobbit which was actually written prior to The Lord of the Rings and has a slightly different set of rules, because the other rules hadn't been written yet.

In The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson set the rules for what happens when Frodo puts on the ring, and how horrible and frightening it is to even use it. This is consistent with the way it's portrayed in the books. It's a malevolent force that must never be used, but destroyed. In The Hobbit book, however, it was just a magical ring that made Bilbo invisible. In the movie, however, since it was made after the Lord of the Rings movies, Jackson must portray the ring in the same way, because the expectation for what the ring is and what it does has already been set. Had The Hobbit movies been made first, I'm sure it would have been very different, but by making the movies in the order he did, Jackson kind of painted himself into a corner.

Further, The Lord of the Rings books, in several places, tie everything to the wider Middle Earth lore, which Jackson also did in his movies. There was clearly an expectation that The Hobbit movies would do the same, which they did; while they were unable to use any of the lore directly from The Silmarillion or Unfinished Tales, they took everything they could from the appendices from the end of Return of the King. Again, it's likely that a straight adaptation of The Hobbit would have been done had it been made first, but since it wasn't, they had to basically adapt The Quest of Erebor.",Arkholt,2022-03-03T17:13:49Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Please do. Great books. The movies are great but it's so abbreviated.

More than enough material to justify the trilogy. Could have justified 5 or 6 movies. LoTR doesn't have to diverge much from the source material since they have simply neglected to include half the material. The movie hits the highlights of the book that advance the plot, but it's about an epic journey across middle earth and it's not as much about the destination, but the journey and all the minor happenings along the way.

While Jackson didn't do a great job with the movies, this statement is a massive disservice to the position Jackson was put into. LoTR was given 2 years for pre-production, 14 months for shooting, and a year for each film for post-production. Jackson has to more or less start filming immediately after del Toro's departure. Jackson has said in an interview that he had no time for pre-production and rewriting the script on the fly. He redid shots and worked only for the day because he was so behind. Iirc he even essentially didn't sleep throughout the whole process.

The trilogy wasn't planned by him from the start and he did what he could given the time and circumstances. If he had years to plan I assume he would have done a much better job with less LoTR tie-ins. Peter Jackson also initially planned for LoTR to be 2 movies, so I doubt he would have pushed for a trilogy for the Hobbit if he was in charge from the start.",sfasian_throwaway,2022-03-03T20:40:22Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Given the care that Jackson paid to the lore when doing LotR I'm pretty certain that had he written the screenplay it would be much closer to Tolkien's work.

t5o4v2,"I said this in another thread and used the 3.....THREE hobbit movies as an example, that writers, directors, and editors, all need reigning in from time to time. Otherwise they just circle jerk themselves with bloated directors cuts full of fluff that absolutely KILLS the momentum of the story. 

The Hobbit was a childrens book FFS, and they turned it into a 6 hour epic that makes Lawrence of Arabia look like a short story. 


One of the reasons why books will always be superior to films is that there are things you can read in books that are IMPOSSIBLE to show in film. It's not a matter of special effects either, it's just that some ideas don't map to an image, and can't be expressed accurately, or with the same directness, as a 'scene'. The best that a movie can do is to take an amazing, unfilmable, idea, and try to find an analog for it, like the infinite bookshelves in Interstellar being a place holder/analog to multi dimensionality. 

Other examples are comparing the monolith flight sequence between 2001 the book and 2001 the movie. The movie could pretty much only show psychadelic moving images and colors, to try to represent what the book describes. 

It gets even weirder when you get into completely psychological or impossible ideas. A writer could write about a universe that both fits in your hand, but is at the exact same time, the world around you, and that universe is also your cat, all at the same time. A movie would have to try to show a cat, or show a mini universe, or show a world around you, but in your mind, with good writing, they can become one thing with different aspects. 

Like describing a light too bright to ever see. The mind can imagine it, a camera could never film it. 

Trying to translate the written words amazing images, into actual images, would be like trying to take an MC Escher sketch of stairways that go every which way, and building it in the physical world. IE you can't, because that part of the original medium (images) can't translate to the real world in the same way an idea in a book doesn't directly translate to an image on a screen.",kodack10,2022-03-03T22:26:05Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

   I grew up reading the books and absolutely loved the LotR films.  The issue, I would say, is Peter Jackson got too wrapped up in his own success from LotR and his own desire to tell a story.  He felt the need to try and connect The Hobbit to Tolkien’s other works and there was no need for it.  The Hobbit should have just stuck to the book and be cut down to maybe two films.

t5o4v2,"> An example of this is the dwarves getting caught by spiders. Instead of Bilbo doing his dancing and singing, taunting the spiders while invisible, this scene instead serves to bring in Legolas and Tauriel.

What bothered me more about this scene was that in the book, this is where Bilbo revealed his ownership and use of the ring. Bilbo trusted the dwarves with a secret that he wouldn't share with anybody else for the next 60 years. When Gandalf finally figures it out, he *guesses* that Bilbo is using a magic ring rather than actually being told. This was a huge sign of the trust and friendship that had formed between Bilbo and the dwarves.

Edit; Also while I think Martin Freeman played a fantastic hobbit... technically Bilbo was 51 years old when the events of The Hobbit took place. While he moved very well and was quite spry for a 51 year old hobbit, Freeman came across as 20 years younger than what I expected Bilbo to be. When Gandalf says to Bilbo at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring movie that he, ""Hasn't aged a day"", he was quite frankly telling the truth. Ian Holm far more accurately represented Bilbo than Martin did, if you ask me.",cascade_olympus,2022-03-04T07:59:44Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

t5o4v2,"Resident Ringer, here!   
The true shame of the Hobbit-movies is that Guiermo Del Torro (of *Pan's Labyrinth*, and more) was supposed to direct them originally as 1 or 2 movies with a heavy storybook/farytale aesthetic! They spent a year or two on pre-production, but when they were about to start filming, the studio got cold feet and decided they instead wanted ""more LotR"" instead of Del Torro's vision. Pulled the rug and tossed him out the door!  
Peter Jackson was then tapped on the shoulder and told that if he wanted to keep the project in New Zealand (and thereby his friends and colleagues employed) HE needed to pick up the reins, make it like the studio wanted it to be(f.ex. 3 movies instead of 2) and start filming **NOW**. No prep. No pre-production.

He doesn't look it, but he is 87 years old in The Fellowship, at the start of the War of the Rings.

His tribe, the Dúnedain, are descendants of the line of kings of Gondor and Arnor (the sister kingdom in the north). They descend from Numeanor, which was sort of the Atlantis island kingdom of men that was lost when those men were corrupted by Sauron.

The men of Numeanor were taller, stronger, and lived for a long time, in part because they descend from Elros, who is Elrond's brother. Elros and Elrond are both ""half-elven"", meaning that they had one elven parent, Elwing, and one human parent, Eärendil. As a thank you from the gods/valar for badass deeds (long story) both Elros and Elrond got to choose whether they wanted to be human or elven. Elrond chose the elf life, became one of the elven lords in Middle Earth, eventually wielder of the elf ring Vilya, which came to him after Sauron killed Gil-galad. Elros founded the line of kings in Numeanor, some of whom eventually escaped to Middle Earth, founded Gondor and Arnor, and eventually descended to Aragorn, who inherited some of the last bit of the long life of the bloodline.

EDIT: Egg on my face here- I was incorrect. Aragon, son of Arathorn II, was born in 2931. Bilbo won the ring from Gollum in 2941. Aragorn would have been 10 at the time of Bilbo's quest to Erebor. Sorry!",MewsashiMeowimoto,2022-03-03T16:51:20Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

t5o4v2,"It's certainly darker and more tragic, but it's stylistically not that different. Tolkien focuses on the shining beauty of Gondolin and its seven gates, juxtaposing it with the dark and evil forces attacking it. What are these armies composed of? You don't really know. The rank and file aren't important. They are just faceless masses being led by charismatic and unique champions. Gothmog  (the balrog, not the lieutenant of the Witch King who besieges Minas Tirith) fights Ecthelion and both perish. The high king Turgon dies in battle to a nameless enemy, Glorfindel (who returns in the LoTR) dies and takes out a balrog attacking the refugees. Tuor (ancestor of Elrond) defeats Maeglin the ""dark"" elf betrayer. The swords Orcrist and Glamdring (which would go to Thorin and Gandalf in the Hobbit) gain their fame.

Compare this to contemporaries writing about the Great War, such as Wilfrid Owens or Siegfried Sassoon, or even the modern writers such as Sebastian Faulks with *Birdsong -* there is a much greater emphasis on the rank and file. Indeed the upper officer class is often ignored or vilified as uncaring and ignorant. There is often no visible enemy, but the rain of artillery, chemical weapons and snipers keeps everyone in a state of terror and shock. The soldiers simply march to their doom, and great detail is spent on describing the wounds and psychological impact of being surrounded by death. It is not an epic with heroes gloriously sacrificing themselves. There are no famous individual named weapons, only the names of mass produced and trademarked instruments of carnage.

There is only one battle that I remember being so horrific - the Dagor Bragollach where the first dragon and the first orcs appear, where Fingolfin challenges Morgoth to a duel and dies valiantly, and the tides of the war begin to shift.",PliffPlaff,2022-03-08T21:35:44Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
t5o4v2,"Yes, sorry if my comment wasn't clear enough. In the books Frodo leaves the Shire approximately 77 years after the events of The Hobbit which would've made Aragorn around 10 years old.

The LotR movies however skipped the 17 year gap between Bilbo leaving after his 111th birthday and Frodo leaving to destroy the ring so theres only 60 years between The Hobbit movies and LotR movies, approximately.

It was a different tone than the trilogy (well one book made into a trilogy) though. I felt The Hobbit was made more for a younger audience. Farmer Giles for a younger audience still. I guess the most amazing thing to me is the span of his books, from light stories like Farmer Giles of Ham, to deeper but still lighthearted writing in the Hobbit, to deeper and darker still writing in the Lord of the Rings, and finally the 'technical' language treatise and fairy tales of The Silmarillion.

ryy5fj,"I'm so glad you got to enjoy that lovely masterpiece, *The Hobbit* is a big comfort book for me. However, LOTR is a very different series in a lot of ways. 

Tolkien wrote *The Hobbit* for his children when they were young, it was intended as a bedtime story (hence the episodic chapters) inspired by old English fairy stories. 

The LOTR he wrote many years later based on the ancient hero ballads like *Beowulf*. It was also written without the clearest plan because he was sending the chapters as letters to his then adult son, Christopher, who was overseas fighting in World War II. And those current events influenced much of Tolkien's writing. (The relationship between Frodo and Sam was deeply influenced by Tolkien's experience fighting in World War I.)

ryy5fj,"I have two memories of this book to share.

In third grade, my teacher had a reading competition.  The goal was to read the most total pages of books.  My classmates really got into it, reading lots of books, competing to outdo one another.  The entire time, I was in dead last with zero books finished.

Why?  Because I was fixated on just one weird, cool book I found in the school library: The Hobbit.  I was totally out of my depth reading it at that age.  It was a struggle to finish every page, but I couldn’t stop.  So many fascinating characters and images and ideas.  I just had to find out how it ended, even if it meant losing that contest.

As if happened, I finished the book just in time for the competition deadline.  I remember telling my teacher, and letting her know I had just finished a 385-page book, which would take me from dead last in the competition to first place in one fell swoop.

She was skeptical, so she asked me questions about the book, and I just lit up.  I told her all about Hobbits and Dwarves and Dragons and Wargs and all the adventure.  I can still remember the rush of excitement trying to explain it all, and the big grin on her face as I did.  So that’s how I won the third-grade reading competition after being dead last the entire time.

But my best memory of The Hobbit came much later, when my son was the same age I was when I first read the book.  I picked it back up again, this time to read a chapter each night to him at bedtime.

He got into it, and I fed off of his fascination and wonder.   I made up voices for all the characters.  I improvised tunes for the songs.  Once again, I got absorbed in this wonderful, heartwarming adventure, but this time with by son’s big eyes widening at each peril or plot twist and rekindling my enthusiasm for this story.

The movies are fine and work best without the 3D or the HFR stuff.  They are certainly a class below the LotR films, but still fun enough to watch.

I think most of us guess that Jackson \*really\* wanted to get his hands on the Silmarillion content, and tried to use The Hobbit to backend into some of the material.

I did the same back in December with the LOTR films and yes, that trilogy deserves every kudo we give it, but many of those artisans went on to the Hobbit films and they still put forth their very best to make the best out of a situation they got thrust into. 

Also, watching the actors in both trilogies behind the scenes is wonderful to watch. How every man cast as a Dwarf in The Hobbit went through weeks of physical training, sword fighting and constant costume fittings often had me laughing out loud. And, it was often the same with LOTR.",pixie6870,2022-01-08T17:42:48Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

There's kinda more to it.

This never happens once in LOTR, nor does anything like it ever happen. You won't find a single place where LOTR describes scenery for more than a paragraph (at most). Tolkien's descriptions are always in the history and atmosphere of a place and NOT in its physicality. That's a huge misconception. Furthermore, Tolkien's incredible attention to history and depth, and how these things relate to some of the main themes of the work (i.e. how the world is slowly decaying and its magic disappearing forever) are what make it such a revered piece of literature and also what makes it far more substantive than *The Hobbit.*

*The Hobbit* also did not initially take place within the fictional universe described in *The Silmarillion. The Lord of the Rings* retconned *The Hobbit* into being a part of the same world, which is why it feels utterly disconnected from the rest of Tolkien's Middle-earth writings at several points.",,2022-01-09T10:01:13Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

ryy5fj,"LOL well yeah, it’s a tale of high adventure… where Bilbo’s character development hinges on being pried unwillingly from a comfortable life he’s very fond of & discovering a knack for adventuring.

Passages about Shire life aren’t the bulk of the writing, but they serve a purpose. In the Hobbit it highlights that Bilbo is a reluctant hero & in LOTR it draws parallels to how Tolkien endured WWI trench warfare/what he knows is helping soldiers survive the misery of WWII. It’s not the thrill of adventure that sustains a soldier when suffering, it’s thoughts of home; Tolkien specifically references this in War of the Ring. I conflate this with my view of The Hobbit.

Epic stories are literally bookended with cozy daily life: The Hobbit opens with it (Bilbo with his meals) & LOTR ends with it (Mild spoiler alert: Sam happily home with family). The narrative arc chosen by the writer begins and ends with the draw of a comforting home & its beloved routines; some readers pick up on this and find that it resonates. Tolkien writes about it in a really appealing way… *makes sense when you think about the context*.

TL;DR: the serenity of the Shire and coziness of hobbit life is a literary device and an important aspect of Tolkien’s writing… but please, by all means… go off on a 3 month old thread with your hot take on this.

In hindsight it would've been easier that way, but LOTR is one of those books I read every so often for fun now. Really a monster of not just fantasy, but literature in general. I still read it probably once a year.

That being said, those movies ruined my own imaginations of the characters. None of them really looked like my mental images of them, but now they're all I can see. These days I can't read them without thinking of them as those characters - some were well cast (Gandalf, Saruman), others I thought didn't capture it (Aragorn, Gollum) and otherwise I just didn't want Elijah Wood to be my vision of Frodo haha. In my mind he was a bit older, less childish etc.",,2020-05-24T06:19:38Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

gpbcbx,"The Hobbit us definitely written in a different way. It feels like you've got a grandfather telling the tale, whereas TLoTR is a bit more like the account of a scholar.

And The Silmarillion is even more challenging in its first parts. I found the latter parts (taking place on Middle-Earth, with elves and men) a lot more enjoyable and in tone with LoTR. 

I'm currently reading Farmer Giles of Ham, and it's not difficult to imagine it as a comedic film. Apart from the first couple pages it's very casual and amusing in it's language!

I read the Silmarillon once and really didn't get much from it. It is more like a lot of incomplete scenes and anecdotes with characters who are not developed or distinctive... it reminds me of when legendary bands from the 60s or 70s like the Hendrix or Zeppelin release mixes of their old practice sessions and call it a new album when really it is just a bunch of tidbits from old brainstorming and practicing.,StevenW_,2020-05-24T13:31:36Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

12x9l37,"The Hobbit is hands down my favorite book of all time. I used to pick it up and read it once or twice a year when I was younger. 

I'm sure others will echo this, but....LOTR is a WILDLY different experience. It's hard to read sometimes, oversaturated with descriptors and lore, and can feel like a chore sometimes. Having said that, from a literature standpoint, it's undeniably one of, if not THE best, single trilogy of fiction ever created. 

The Hobbit was meant to be a children's book. LOTR is anything but. Both have their place in the universe and both are amazing pieces of fiction. But do not, under any circumstances, think that the two are even remotely related, outside of subject matter.

I only call it filler because it's not directly related to the story, it's still really good writing. If it's not your thing though, you'll be more bored than lost. The first half of the fellowship of the Ring is particularly slow going, so if you're really struggling to get through that you can skip ahead to when they get to Bree, or even Rivendell.

12x9l37,"The Hobbit was originally written as a children's story for Tolkien's son.   As such, it's full of little songs and riddles and such that give it a sense of fairy tale whimsy.  The innocence of Bilbo makes for a stark contrast against the dark situations and creatures he encounters, giving them even more weight and letting you feel his terror.

LOTR has a more sombre tone and the storytelling is more drawn out - in fact it drags pretty badly in some places.  It features many of the same themes and characters, but there's a certain heaviness and darkness hanging over Frodo's journey that Bilbo's didn't seem to have.

The Hobbit is still my favorite book in the 'series' - and it was more fun and engaging to read than the trilogy to me.

12x9l37,"You should think of them as very different stories, both in tone and scope. The Hobbit is functionally a children’s book. It’s a fantastic story, and lays the groundwork for LOTR, but it’s still a book aimed at children. Think of it like a story that a parent would read to their child at night, a chapter at a time. LOTR is an adult fantasy book, patterned after the great western sagas (Beowulf and the like). If you’re not familiar with the story at all, I definitely won’t spoil it, but I will say that I’d be surprised if you didn’t have a feeling of recognition while reading it regarding its themes and tropes. It feels like a timeless story that gets passed down from generation to generation. Similar to how the original Star Wars is essentially the age old hero’s quest, adapted to a galaxy far, far away. That said, I don’t think it’s a difficult read.. It can be a little laborious at times, just given the style of prose that Tolkien used (he was a professor at Oxford, after all), but it’s not difficult in the way that like Eternal Jest or Ulysses would be.

But take that with a grain of salt, as I personally really, really dislike the movies. 

In my opinion the hobbit book is barely enough for two movies let alone three. Popular fan edits I've seen are between 3,5 to 4,5 hours instead of 8. That being said I think people who are able to watch the movies while completely ignoring the source material might find the movies decent on their own despite all the filler material. But I believe as soon as you start comparing the book to the movies there is not much room to justify their creative decisions. Characters, whether completely made up or just taken from the LOTR series for no reason, that definitely shouldn't be there, new stories that just don't fit, and lots and lots of filler material that wasn't necessary to tell the story of Bilbo Baggins. All just so the big companies behind it can try to get as much money out of three instead of the originally planned two movies.

So basically: If you value the source material and hope to see movies that try to bring that to the screen you're better off not watching them, but if you just want something to watch mindlessly without caring about the original story you can watch it I suppose.

I read The Hobbit to my oldest at bedtime when he was in Kindergarten/1st grade (we took lots of breaks). He finally got hooked when he saw the movies, and we recently finished the LOTR movies together as well.

So he's asked to read those books now too. But you're right - that part getting out of the Shire is bumming him out. He wants to start getting to the action scenes, but I've always been pretty strict with The Hobbit, and he has to listen to the boring parts because that's still an important part of storytelling.

Then there's a shift, and the hobbit story intersects with events that are much bigger than them.  It get less cute and fun, and gets really gritty and depressing.

When rereading lord of the rings, I think the movies have everyone thinking it's mostly the latter.  Then you're 150 pages into lord of the rings and the Hobbits are taking a group bath in a tub, making you wonder when the epic fantasy part is going to start.

But that doesn't change that the style and tone of the first chapters of LotR most closely match that of the Hobbit.

And even the circumstances are very similar. You get Bilbo and of course Gandalf, you get an expected party vs an unexpected party, Bilbo takes off out the door at Gandalf's urging (and with yet more Dwarves), and this time literally carrying his sword instead of his walking stick, etc.

We get Hobbits being very Hobbit-y, singing as they walk, getting swept up by silly but wonderful Elves who give them a feast in the woods and vanish by morning with little trace.

These are relics, some deliberate, of when Tolkien originally set out to write LotR as prompted by his publisher and as a sequel to The Hobbit. *The Next Adventure of Bilbo Baggins*, or *What Happened After*, as it were.

The man was a legend and he loved his fathers work more than anyone. The Hobbit was written by JRR for Christopher as a bedtime story. You can only imagine how much these stories meant to him. 

He was avidly against movies and adaptations. The only reason these LOTR and Hobbit movies were made was because JRR sold the rights for the cartoon version before he died. He even called out the movies on how poorly executed he thought they were.

Not even three months after Christopher stepped down as head of the Tolkien estate, the new head sold the rights of LOTR to Amazon to make a TV show, and made a lot of money doing it.

I agree books and movies should be two different things, but it doesn't feel like we're seeing the world through Bilbo's eyes for a lot of the Hobbit films. I guess that's also a symptom of it being made after the Lord of the Rings too, so it's not our entry point, it had to also function as a worthy follow-up to LOTR, which was going to be near-impossible anyways.

One piece of advice though... I'm a hardcore Tolkien fan and have read the trilogy and The Hobbit upwards of a dozen times. I have only read The Silmarillion twice... And only understood the book as a whole after I read a guide to the book. That's how crazy it is. But it's still totally worth reading. It answers so many questions and hints from the other books and just fleshes out the LotR universe so much more completely than if you just stick to the trilogy and The Hobbit. It's a rewarding and challenging read so prepare yourself. 

When I was a teenager I read a guide book after I read it the first time (this was pre-internet as we know it) and I can't remember what it was called, but a quick Google search makes me think it was probably ""A Reader's Guide to The Silmarillion.""

I am also seeing the best description I've ever read of it at in the Introduction on r/TheSilmarillion.

Good luck!!! You're making me want to dive back into 
The Silmarillion myself!

dio9z2,"I'm guessing they wanted to streamline the story a little bit and keep focus on the Black Riders as the primary threat at that stage of the story.

Having Tom Bombadil would have also required that whole thing with Old Man Willow, and afterwards the Barrow-wights. At that point a viewer who isn't familiar with the source material might experience a sort of ""inflation of threats"" and not be sure which ones are supposed to be the ""main enemies"".

And honestly, as intriguing a character as Tom Bombadil is in the books, I kind of doubt they could've done it justice - and, for the average viewer who hasn't read the books, it would be a baffling, pointless interlude.

In other words, I do understand why the film adaptation chose to skip that part and expedite the hobbits' arrival to Bree.

I think they had similar reasons for skipping the Scouring of the Shire. The argument, I believe, is that after the big bad has been vanquished, further conflict is difficult to take seriously. Building up tension becomes kind of hard with that kind of ""enemy downgrade"".

That said, even though it's a bit of a foregone conclusion what's going to happen, that was kind of the point in the book. Saruman and Wormtongue had the hobbits of Shire basically paralyzed under their foot, because the hobbits there didn't really have experience dealing with that type of unscrupulous, deceitful, cruel, and self-serving characters. Then these four Companions of the Ring turn back and immediately assume position of leadership, and put a stop to it all in a short order.

The Scouring of the Shire is there to underline how the hobbits have changed since they left the Shire - the hobbits there are basically how they used to be, but Sam and Frodo have been through a literal hell and Merry and Pippin are basically veteran warriors (and have grown to be abnormally large for hobbits, which wasn't really shown in the film either).

That said, the films do justice to the hobbits' character development in their own way, so I do kind of understand why the scriptwriters thought it better to adapt the story so that the tension and conflict is resolved when the Ring is destroyed and Sauron with it.",HerraTohtori,2019-10-16T16:56:49Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the book is flawed because there are no women in it, I just feel sad the dude didn't throw his daughter a bone.

I think Tolkien's specific time and place was almost exclusively masculine. He went to an all-boys school, graduating to an all-boys College, then fought in an all-boys war, and went home to teach in an all-boys University.

So I completely get how the dude basically saw the world as one filled with men. But he was married! He had a daughter! He invented languages when he was a boy with his two female cousins! Come on!",mattcolville,2013-12-01T01:31:00Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

The Hobbit at this moment, and I  agree with some of this. Though I don't think Bilbo is as uncomfortable with people as this person thinks. I think when we first meet Bilbo, he is very content being a mostly introverted homebody, but that quickly becomes his past persona. 

There is a great lack of female characters in The Hobbit, but I think it is a lot more to do with the nature of the story. It is a quest of men (or more accurate of dwarves) they travel mostly through the wilderness.

1rs51e,"It's a very smart comment and thought you had on it. I feel this is actually the logic behind the films containing Tauriel, in lieu of other female characters.

In what the Lord of the Rings universe has presented on the films, it has been a pretty diverse universe. The Hobbit, being made after the trilogy, is now automatically set in the same established universe. The Hobbit, being a war story disguised by an adventure told in a more young age manner, is then required to maintain the same universe, or it removes the films too much from what people really enjoyed.

This presents the issue, though. The Hobbit FILM, not the book where mintealixious very eloquently described the content, isn't told exclusively as Bilbo's story. Bilbo is presented as the main character, and while we're on the adventure of witnessing his story, the FILM contains a much larger story being told. It is also serving as an origin of sorts to the world we saw in LOTR (Now, whether that should have been done is another question). The issue that is now required to be handled is how do you maintain the very diverse universe that was presented in LOTR with a book that was very uniquely as I said above, a story presented from a singular character that is exactly as mintealixious described.",mrshock13,2013-12-01T16:45:50Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It was more than five years after he wrote it that a friend got ahold of it and he was induced to publish it.

* It definitely leads the reader to ask questions about their absence and their description.  Does it have to do with the author or the character or the situation? 

* It's not like Tolkien, writing a fantasy and a mythology, hasn't looked at his own history and seen great women like Elizabeth I or Mary Queen of Scots or Boudica and her daughters (heck there's even a statue dedicated to her in London) So why not create a female character?

* Well maybe we have that ""Boudica""-esque character in LoTR who takes down the Lich King, but then what are her defining traits? She basically wants to be ""one of the guys"" and she may have a thing for one of the main characters. It's hardly deep, it's more like she's a gear in the plot mechanism.

* I guess you can't really know authorial intent, and when analysing a book you have to ignore it, but what if there were no women because Tolkien preferred men and male relationships? It's just as easy to think that as it is to say that he didn't think much of women or their abilities.

I am NOT calling out Tolkein or saying that *The Hobbit* sucks or needs women or any of that. Tolkein's writing has almost no women. That's something that's *interesting* to discuss. The argument OP provided is fascinating and is asking us to compare Tolkein's treatment of women in *The Hobbit* and well, everything else and see if there is a difference. I'm not sure that there is, but I haven't reread *The Hobbit* or *The Lord of the Rings* in years and I'd love to see discussion on that. Analysing gender in Tolkein's work is especially interesting given how many races there are and that we have so much detailed information on them. For example, we know that Tolkein provided an in-universe justification for the Ents being only male. I am not trying to start some sort of gender war. I'd like to discuss Tolkein's treatment of women in his books...because it's *interesting*. It's okay to discuss gender. We dicuss lots of aspects of literature and there's no reason that we shouldn't discuss this one. 

I've seen tonnes and tonnes of arguing on this thread, but little actual discussion around the idea OP raised and I'd really like to. So please, please, calm the fuck down people.

I don't understand your point at all, by the way. Does a male character not count as male if he doesn't have any lines? Does a male character not count as male if there are ""only"" three dozen named characters in the book? Does a 100% male character list not count as 100% male if I have not read the book? (I have, but just pointing out - how does this matter?)

Your arguments would kinda sorta make sense if women were a small minority of the human population, like maybe Siamese twins -  then we could say odds are low that any characters would be Siamese twins.

So please, stop sticking straw arguments in the mouths of people who want to have an actual discussion about the book. Tolkein wrote about men, almost exclusively. To the extent that he provided multiple in-universe justifications for why there were no women. That's fascinating whether you're discussing this from an in-universe perspective or stepping back and looking at things like a Doylist. Having that conversation is not making gender a battlefield. It's a discussion of Tolkein and his work and how he treated gender. You're the one making this into a battle.

OP came here to discuss an interesting in-universe perspective on the lack of women in *The Hobbit*. It's an interesting perspective. And it should be analysed to see if it holds up. Is there a significant difference between *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* as this argument suggests? Or does Tolkein not really see women having a place in his world, at least, not in the big adventures? It's an interesting discussion to have. You're ignoring that possibility and instead making this into a gender battle, which is exactly what you accuse me of doing.  ",hermithome,2013-12-01T08:10:12Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
1rs51e,"Tolkein could have chosen to make a more egalitarian society in his fictional world than he saw around him. Instead he made a less egalitarian one. Instead of having women present and visible and having a modicum of power, he chose in _The Hobbit_ to have no women at all, and in _The Lord of the Rings_ to have extremely few women and those hardly active aside from solitary episodes.

It isn't surprising that his works reflect the ideals of his upbringing. It's just sad.",,2013-12-01T14:41:55Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

1rs51e,">? That's just a Wikipedia entry for the list of characters in The Hobbit.

Show me where in the Hobbit the Necromancer is. That is a list of names from the Hobbit. Not necessarily characters. If being referenced and identified is enough to make you a character then Bilbo's mother counts as a character and the entire argument is moot. And yes obviously the sacksville-bagginses is what I meant with that last sentence why make a note of it if you clearly understood the implication?

>Your arguments would kinda sorta make sense if women were a small minority of the human population,

For dwarves that is actually true. 

Let me ask you a question. What use would adding a female character be to the book if she serves no purpose other than being female? Say you take one of the dwarves and just make them a girl. No extra lines, no extra character traits, no purpose, just a name with nothing behind it. Does that change anything? Does that prove anything? Wouldn't that be worse than having no female characters. She would be there as an object. That defeats the entire purpose doesn't it? It would just be bad writing. It would be shoehorning something into a book for no purpose whatsoever.

1rs51e,"Sorry, but this convo is driving me nuts. Why on earth does a discussion about female characters have to involve romance? Come on! Females enjoy going on quests too you know!  

I realise this got started a bit upthread with /u/punkpixzsticks/ initial comment, so this is really to both of you.

Look, Tolkein wanted to write about men. It's what he knew, what he felt comfortable with, whatever. But he wanted to write about men. To the extent that he actually creates in-universe explanations for a lack of female dwarves, and female ENTs and so on. He literally writes the female species out of at least two races. (Can someone remember what explanation (or lack thereof) is given for the Orcs? I don't remember.) Is the book still good? Yes, it's a great book. There are plenty of great works of art that don't have female characters in them. And a lack of women in a work of art can be justified, in fact, Tolkein goes to fairly great lengths to justify the lack of women.

No one is here saying that *The Hobbit* sucks because there are no female characters. But the lack of female characters and the various in-universe justifications are an interesting thing to discuss. As are author experiences and motives. I'm not upset or pissed off by the lack of women in *The Hobbit*. But what drives me crazy is this assumption that women could only be romantic or sexual partners and that *The Hobbit* is a better piece of writing for not including them because you think romance would drag it down.

People can write what they please, but in turn others can comment in any way they please, and in this particular case I don't see it as asinine.  It's not a check on writing(or at least shouldn't be), it's a check on how others perceive that writing and whether they recognize what's going on.

Say I created the ACME test, which is a test to see whether media shows accurate consequences for violence.  If a coyote plummets 50 feet and still lives, or a duck gets a shotgun to a face and has not a scratch in the next scene, it fails the ACME test.  This test isn't a check to tell animators ""Hey, you can't create cartoons that don't show proper consequences for violence.""  It would be to highlight to kids and parents ""Hey, this stuff your kids are watching fails this test.  Some supplemental conversations regarding this material would not go amiss.""

Creators can and should create whatever they want, but a healthy society should be able to examine what's going on in those creations and talk about it.

I think you misunderstood my first question, so I asked it again. 

My point, I guess, is that I have never heard this argument from the other side. It bugs me that when I say ""hero"" or ""main character"" the default in everyone's mind (including my own, sometimes) is a man-character. And that the top comment in ""Female Characters Don't Exist in The Hobbit"" boils down to ""I didn't even notice!""

And Tolkein is his own special brand of exclusionary. He's a genius who thought up whole languages, and built a world of epic proportions, but couldn't fit more than a handful of women characters of any race in any book. 

Not that I don't like Tolkein: I like his works a lot. My dad read The Hobbit to me when I was a kid and it was awesome. I just think it would be cool if little-girl me had an easier time putting herself in someone's shoes from the story. And I'm not talking just about Tolkein-- there aren't that many books with women as main characters in the fantasy/scifi genre in general, and more broadly, in a lot of pop culture.

However the difficulty level is a little higher (with a lexile score of 1000 where Harry potter is at 880) and the interest level is rated older at 6-12th grade so you may not hold there interest just yet.. but I say give it a go. 
However if it doesn't hold their attention I have a few recommendations that are still out of their reading range but comparable to harry potter in difficulty and keeping the fantasy adventure theme and would be good alternatives for you to read to them. The Wings of Fire series by Tui T. Sutherland is a series about dragons, The Warriors series by Erin Hunter (more appealing to girls) is an adventure series where all the characters are cats or the Rangers Apprentice series by John Flanagan (more appealing to boys) a swords and sorcery battle oriented, Also you may find interest in the fantasy series that starts with Fablehaven by Brandon Mull it's probably the easiest on the list with a lexile score in the 700's and The Lightening Thief by Rick Riordain which is fantasy/aventure + Greek Mythology. A good standalone would be The Graveyard book by Neil Gaiman about a boy who grows up in the graveyard and is raised by ghosts. Those are all really popular right now.. A series that I personally like but is a little less popular would be a peter pan origin story series by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson called Peter and the Starcatchers. These are all roughly comparable to the reading level of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and meant to be self read at the 7-12 age range.

3bbqpn,"My dad actually read these exact books to me at that exact age. I was six, the first Hairy Potter had just come out, so that was what he used to tell if I could keep up. I could (I was reading somewhat early and much faster than all my peers, though, so maybe not identical situations since I don't know your kid) so we moved onto The Hobbit. I loved it, we did this for twenty or thirty minutes a night before I went to sleep and these are some of the best memories of my childhood.

Also, whatever you do, don't stop this until he gets old enough to start rebelling and just won't cooperate. He will never forget the influence this has on him and will cherish these memories forever. You're a seriously cool dad.",welcome2screwston,2015-06-27T22:09:29Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3bbqpn,"Hell yes!  I don't believe a child is ever too young for The Hobbit.  Anything that ignites their imagination is awesome.

My grandmother, convinced I was a child genius, always bought me books that I was way too young to read.  We're talking National Geographic, Nat Geo World (great for first graders!), and all sorts of literature that were either just a bit ahead of me or way ahead of me.

The National Geographics were the ones that made me want to read -- I saw these things that NGWorld hinted at, and I could understand that, but I couldn't understand the words in National Geographic.  

I could however see the pictures, so I learned about context.  I knew from a very young age that the article was about the Amazon Rainforest.  It didn't turn me off reading.  On the almost extreme contrary, it lit an insatiable fire in me to read.  

I had a pretty bad childhood and a vivid imagination, and so books were my way of escaping.  It would have been early to mid 1970s, before Star Wars is all I remember, when I first read The Hobbit and then LOTR.  It was a HUGE deal for me, it was a huge project that I took upon myself.  I felt both an enormous sense of accomplishment at taking on such a big book by myself, and also an indescribable thrill from discovering this enormous, vivid world.

I don't remember it but I know my grandparents read to me a lot as a young child.  

The only downside I could possibly think of is your boy not getting to read it himself in another year or two.  That's how old I was.  It had some big words, but I picked up enough to be completely swept away.  ",,2015-06-28T02:59:51Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I was so bored, but I probably sat for 30 or 45 minutes anyway trying to be involved. It was miserable. I still hate the hobbit. I've never made it past the first chapter every time I've tried to revisit it as an adult. I still hate it.

The hobbit is fairly ok, very little violence and not much scary magic.

You should be 100% fine if you just skim through the chapter, just a few lines 1-2 from every page and you should have a feeling for it.

This should be enough, but be close to them in case they get afraid of something unexpected. So dont sit in a chair while they are in their beds. ",baronmad,2015-06-27T20:34:19Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3bbqpn,"The Hobbit was the first chapter book I ever read to the boy I nanny - he was 4, and he loved it. Never got bored, even during the action-light descriptive passages. He's a VERY bright kid though. Since then we've done Charlotte's Web, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler, and a bunch of others that I loved when I was a kid. He's 6 now and we're finally starting Harry Potter. Reading to kids is one of my favorite things to do and I can't believe I get paid to do it! 

Anyway, my answer would be - go for it, even if you end up needing to skip parts. It's a fairly simple story that kids can follow. And have fun with the voices. ",cat_with_a_banjo,2015-06-27T21:09:55Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3bbqpn,"EDIT: I should have actually tried to be helpful alongside my snark. If you're not sure if a book is acceptable to read to your child, the only solution is to read it to yourself and decide if it is appropriate for your child. And while reading a book to your child, spend as much time talking about it as reading - you'll learn quickly how they are digesting it and can stop reading if you're not happy with the results.

My wife read all of the Harry Potter books to my daughter by the time she started kindergarten. She read all the Percy Jackson books to her over kindergarten. My daughter is going into 1st grade without having gotten knocked up, killing anyone or taking up smoking, so I think the Hobbit will be all good (assuming they don't find it too boring).",arstin,2015-06-27T23:09:19Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

For those books, you miss a lot of the important stuff if you do that. 

When I read them again when I was 10, it was like I was reading a whole new story. 

If them understanding what is going on is important to you, I would go with something a bit more linear, like Potter, or Narnia, or a Wrinkle in Time.

We've read books that push our boys' comprehension since they were little, and the boys love it.  Don't be afraid to start a book, get a few chapters in, and give it up if you can't catch at least one of your children's interest, but it's a balance.  If your kids are anything like mine, when you first start reading to them, they'd be much more content with a children's book with pictures, but as they get used to imagining the story as it is read to them, they grow to prefer ""older"" books.  I don't think I'd be able to get away with reading *The Hobbit* to them if I hadn't already gotten them into the habit of listening for context clues and consuming books that stretch them.

The two year old got sent to bed the other day while we were still reading the first chapter because he couldn't quit bugging his brothers while I tried to read.  He normally goes to bed easily, but that night he cried and cried until my wife went and lay down next to him with the door open so that he could hear the story.  He didn't mind going to bed, he just didn't want to miss the story.",tokekcowboy,2015-06-28T01:52:43Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3bbqpn,"As a parent, my advice is to read (or let your child read) *any* book to your child when you feel they are capable of understanding and/or enjoying said book.  Acceptable is different for every person and for every child.

My oldest daughter never had any interest in Fantasy/Sci Fi type books, but devoured books like Little Women, Pride and Prejudice and Emma. The exception, of course, being the Harry Potter series as you were a nobody in her age group if you weren't reading that in the early 2000s!  

My middle daughter was already attempting to read The Hobbit by herself at approximately age 6 and is mowing through the Diskworld series, along with loving the entire Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  She just loves to read, and many genres catch her interest.

So, to sum, it just depends on your child!  Give it a go, and see what happens.  If there's no interest, or you find they're really just struggling to understand, put it aside and try another time or just let them discover it for themselves when they're ready.

I don't have kids, but this was my first thought. I believe that the world of adventure and imagination contained in books such as The Hobbit are a fantastic way to get kids started with creative thinking. 

You could even substitute parts of the story out with questions.

It is also by Tolkein, may be good if they still can't pay attention to a longer plot (my dad tried to read my brother and I The Hobbit at bedtime, we had no idea what was going on). Roverandom is really magical and in 100 or so pages goes on quite the journey - the main character goes to the moon, under the sea, and meets dragons and kings along the way.

I remember reading The Little Vampire as a kid and absolutely loved those. I also loved anything with animal characters, though they can get deceptively brutal. I think I remember the Poppy series, by Avi, having quite a few bloody scenes and mice characters getting eaten.

This is the way The Hobbit was written - it shares a lot of elements with other verbal stories like The Illiad (fixed repeated phrases throughout the book to instantly callback previous parts, rhyming sequences such as the list of the Dwarves' names, parts meant to be read or sung in rhythm, etc).

Narnia's more of a book I'd encourage kids to read themselves, especially since it has that sense of accomplishment after each quite short book. The Hobbit is a book I'd read to them again and again for the performance aspect.",,2015-06-27T23:58:46Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

A modern series that is great to read to kids is [The Edge Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Deepwoods) - lots of great mouthful fictional words/names you can enunciate in a humourous fashion, and the frequent (and fantastic) illustrations help keep kids going with visual cues as to the creatures and action.",,2015-06-27T23:55:39Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It was written very quickly in the 1930s by a super young Gombrich, but is an absolute classic. A marvel to think about how he even accomplished the feat. A little Germanic world centric (which is a novelty in my largely Anglo world), and definitely Euro centric. He went on to write other classics such as The History of Art after fleeing the Nazi's. 

I read Magician by Feist and then the Hobbit when I was 12 to my little brother who was about 6-7 then. Still a fantastic memory.

It was a brilliant and inspirational move a but the thing is there were 30 of us in the class and only one copy of the book. I wasn't one of those lucky enough to get the book early on and with the many distractions of an eight years old's life I some how never got around to it.


Even though I didn't finish the Hobbit in school I never forgot the incident and I never forgot how much I enjoyed the story. I didn't finish the book for about thirty years more.

Later he read me the lord of the rings, I remember so vividly the images the story brought to me, after watching the films later in life. The images of the people I created in my younger years are still stronger. Finally, as I loved the books so much . He decided to read me more of Tolkien's work. Leaf by Niggle, ( his name is Nigel and my mum always called him Niggle), Farmer Giles of Ham and Smith of Wooton Major and the Adventures of Tom Bombadil. He didn't read me  The Silmarillion or the Unfinished Tales though, think that might have been too heavy for me even as a teenager.

You are doing parenthood right in my book sir!

Thinking about it now it's amazing to think how huge of an impact all of Tolkien's books had on my childhood, even though they were written so long before I was born - I remember when I found out the The Fellowship of the Ring movie coming out I was only about 8, but I was allowed to go see it with my dad on the condition that we read the book first (so I had some context for the violence and stuff I guess). He died shortly after The Fellowship came out, but the way we bonded over those stories each night for months will always be one of my favourite memories of him.

3o2a4p,"When my daughter was four and started to read her first book, I placed my hardcover copy of The Hobbit in her room and told her this was for when she was a little older.  Now of course, I piqued her interest.  Next to all these little Dr Seuss books was this large, green hardcover book in its own box with all this fancy lettering.  So she immediately began asking me to read it to her.  

When she turned 5 she asked me several times to read it to her.  

I've been reading The Hobbit to my 5 year old daughter and my 3 year old son now for a few months.  I read it to them before bed, and only a few nights a week so that they don't get overwhelmed with the story.  (In between sessions we read other things, or my daughter picks one of her reading books and reads to us - it's awesome).  

They absolutely love The Hobbit, and I never thought I'd enjoy the experience as much as I do.  In fact, my son remembers more of the story than my daughter does.  Every time I ask them if they remember where we last left off (as a training exercise for reading retention), and my son usually provides the best answers, which is surprising.  Last session his answer was, ""The wood elves just captured Thorin!"", in a most excited tone.  

I try to make the session a bit of a ritual, so I tell them that it's ""circle time"", which is teacher-talk for ""sit and be quiet"".  I start and finish every reading session by playing, ""Far Over the Misty Mountains"", from The Hobbit movie.  It's my version of invoking the muses.  :-)  This immediately grabs their attention, and they settle down.  

Then I try to read off a reasonable chunk of the story, finding appropriate places to stop the story, such as the completion of an adventure (entering Gollum's cave, defeating the trolls, etc.), or in suspense (suspended in the trees fighting off the goblins and wargs, wood-elf lights going out in the forest, etc).  They seem to find it very exciting.  

I'd like to give a bit of advice to parents who want to read this to their littler ones:  
 - 30 minutes of reading before bedtime seems to be ideal: right time of day, right length of time  
 - you need to use voices for all the characters.  It helps bring them to life and really pulls the children in.  I left my kids pick the voice to use for Bilbo.  So, when I read, Bilbo sounds like an effeminate homosexual on helium.  It makes them laugh.  
 - allow for questions during the reading.  I let them raise hands and ask as many questions as they want.  You'll be surprised at how good their imagination is.  It's forced me to put myself into world of Middle Earth more than I ever did when I first read it.  ",thedenofsin,2015-10-09T11:22:07Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

We started to 'study' the Hobbit on an iPad on an almost daily basis, 3-4-5 paragraphs per session, 7 full pages completed so far. The main reader is Alice and am helping her out sometimes. Obviously we are (over)using the dictionary looking for definitions for many words, some of them invented by Tolkien like ""bewuthered"" or a coinage like ""confusticate"". Our favourite section (besides the beginning): ""Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow! Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries.

He's gone now 13 years and it's taken me into my late-20s and early-30s to recognize how cool it is that we were able to share that connection and how heart-warming it must have been for him, though we didn't have the sit-down and read experience that you had with your son.

3o2a4p," This is awesome. I read small books to my 5 yo, he has a bunch of diferent books like Where the wild things are, a bunch of Dr Seuss books, and other small stories and I read about 3 or 4 of then each night. He gets to choose and sometimes hell go all the way back to The wheels on the bus books. 

Ever since he started enjoying story time, I've wanted to jump to a much longer story that he can look forward to reading every night. 

My questions is this, did you try reading it before he was 6 and did you find you'd lost his attention? 

Also, I always try to read books in their original language, if I can, a little difficult since I only know English and Spanish, but English is not my sons first language, and although he says he understands most of what I read to him or what he watches on Netflix, I'm worried that this and his age will make it boring or make it slow reading since he'll be inturrempting the story every 2 seconds to ask what something means.

I think I'll give it a shot anyway and see how that goes. Unfortunately I have a 10 day business trip coming up next week and I don't want to leave him hanging for 2 weeks, plus I need to find an English version of the Hobbit since mine is packed away god knows where, so I'll have to wait 2 weeks to start.",unfiltered_mexican,2015-10-09T13:28:38Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

One thing I would recommend, especially if your kid has ADHD or simply has difficult paying attention, is promoting reading comprehension early. When we do story time I read a few pages, then I ask him a question about what we just read. If he gets the question right (I usually give him two questions minimum) he gets a few more pages. It's usually something simple like ""What did Bilbo find in the cave?"" or the like, but it shows he was paying attention, and he gets rewarded (and feels good about himself). I also usually give him a quarter for his piggy bank if he gets ALL the questions right.

Every evening after dinner, my dad would bake chocolate chip cookies, bust out the milk, and read 1-2 chapters of a book. We read Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, the Space Trilogy, Animal Farm, A Spell for Chameleon, and I'm sure others.

I think this ritual is probably the only truly happy memory of my father that I have from childhood. If he hadn't done this, I'm not so sure I would be on speaking terms with him today. It also made me feel like I could read and understand any book even as a small child. It started a habit that continues to make me happy into my adult life.

1u3lq8,"""A better read""? Really? Sure it makes for a different read, but that's not what Tolkien wrote. Simply changing a character in your own head to female doesn't make it better. In fact, the only thing it changes is pronouns. If Tolkien wanted Bilbo to be female, it would be a big deal. As we've seen in the rest of his universe, having an adventuring female character is a big deal. Eowyn (who slew the witch king) did have to deal with disapproval, did have to disguise herself, and DID overcome everybody's prejudice. By changing Bilbo into a female character, and thus, making her gender a non-issue is not consistent with the values of both Middle-Earth, and 1930's England (when The Hobbit was published).

1u3lq8,"I hope this doesn't get buried because I don't see any comments on this topic: The Hobbit (and the Lord of the Rings world as a whole) provides a great story and role model for young boys to express themselves and their feelings.

Is the book good gender-switched? Probably. It's a good book! Tolkien wrote it really well. I have no comment on that.

However, I'd like to point out that so few books/stories/media of any sort encourage young boys to explore and express their feelings. Young boys don't have many great role models for expressing emotions. There are definitely books and stories out there, but they are in the minority. So often, men are portrayed as fearless, emotionless stumps. Never crying, never singing, never laughing, never afraid. The ""hero"" is so often the worst role model a young boy can have.

Having a character such as Bilbo, who expresses the full range of emotions, can be extremely beneficial for young boys. It teaches them that it's okay to be expressive and rounded. Is this same role model also beneficial to women? Absolutely! But women don't typically suffer *as often* from the emotional stunting that men do.

This is not a comment to post on women vs men or whatever. I do think however that while the link makes a good point that Bilbo is a good role model for girls when gender-switched, he's an ever better role model for boys.

1u3lq8,"I think the phrasing is weird, because I don't think the story is objectively better in the way most people would define ""better"". I think it would be more appropriate to say the story is surprisingly unaffected.

I think a lot of people do wish Tolkein's world (along with many other classic fantasy works) wasn't inherently sexist, and wish modern adventure stories featuring female protagonists didn't usually end up being sexist in a different, pandering, ""GIRL POWER"" way. So, if you were to take that value of ""better"", a hypothetical story written with a female Bilbo would be a pretty great thing, had someone actually ever written it.

I think a lot of people also get up in arms when the flaws of the work of a beloved author are pointed out. This was a guy who was a bit of a fuddy-duddy about women even for 1930s England. Social shortcomings in his stories are a product of the time and his upbringing, not something I would consider his ""fault"". 

But, it's ignorant to say you can't see the problems with the treatment of women in Tolkien's work if you are reading it in the modern day.

I'm not a fan of re-writing classic works to correct social flaws. But it's also problematic in that a lot of older stories meant for children (Which the Hobbit is) become something a lot of people find they have a problem giving to children in good conscience anymore. In post WWI England it would have been normal to read children stories with the undercurrent that a woman's obvious place was always as mother and homemaker, and the only good German was a dead German.

As an adult you can take that in it's historical context and still enjoy older stories. But in the modern day, the idea of... where *are* all the girls? And why are entire races of sentient beings getting dismissed as filthy, sub-human, and intrinsically evil monsters? That is something that might come up, and are something some people don't want to read to small kids until they are old enough to understand things were different when these were written.

1u3lq8,"Wow. So much rage in this thread. So many people missing the point. I'd find it interesting to know the gender ratios of the posters in here. Okay, better read, maybe not, but when you really consider the context of what the story would be like if the character was female and the real chances that NOTHING else would be different if it were the case, when you *really* try to consider that, this is a fairly interesting exercise. You would only be able to do it in a fantasy. Any book grounded in reality with a female lead character would have a different treatment if it were the only difference, unless they change reality. Consider the film Wild Wild West. Will Smith plays a black sheriff, and the movie goes straight into fantasy because he is a treated in an unrealistic way, people behave completely anachronistically. They don't react to his race. It would be completely impossible to make that character a female. It would change the entire script. There's no possible way the film would get made without changes specifically to make people treat the female sheriff differently because she exists.

The reason why it's particularly easy to do that with the Hobbit is because hobbits in general are fairly unsexualised. They're portrayed as wholesome creatures and they don't really have very overt sexuality. So, take one out of their little village and set him loose, and Bilbo proceeds through the story without doing anything that is distinctly masculine. He's not stereotypically strong or storybook heroic, he has universal characteristics of cleverness, courage, and endurance. Female characters are rarely given the treatment where their gender is not worth mentioning, and their qualities are given priority. That's the point. It works very rarely.

And then say that the hobbit is IMPROVED by changing the main character to be a female. Certainly I can agree that women/girls are not well represented in children's lit, but changing Bilbo's gender and calling it an improvement is almost as bad. You're just projecting the original problem into a work that wasn't written with it, since if no one is making an issue of gender in the book, and the story isn't changed in any significant way, then the ""improvement"" is coming from your own baggage (""isn’t it amazing that a girl did these things"").

1u3lq8,"The title doesn't do the idea justice, but the idea itself makes a lot of sense. 

What would happen if Bilbo were African or Asian? Would it change anything? Probably not. Race is never an issue (at least in the real-world sense. him being a hobbit is an issue, but not the one I'm getting at). It doesn't matter what race he is; it doesn't affect him as a character in the slightest. A white child can relate to him no more or less than any other. 

But what would happen if Bilbo were explicitly labeled as White? It would still be a great story, and Bilbo would still be a great character, but you would alienate everyone who wasn't white. Perhaps not in any great way; but it would still create a disconnect between the reader and the character. After all, if it weren't important to who Bilbo was as a character, why would the author have mentioned it?

Unlike race, however, gender differences are embedded in the english language. You can't help but know that bilbo is male, it's reinforced every few sentences. It creates a subtle, yet potentially powerful, disconnect between the reader and the character. 

When male characters are off doing cool things like adventuring and saving the world, while even the strongest of their female counterparts are forced to endure countless pages of gender-focused content, even children will see the pattern. It's hard not to notice that the primary female character in the latest hobbit movie was added as a love interest. Worse, her primary motivation for most of her actions were as someone in love with one of the male characters, not just someone interested in doing the right thing. 

By recasting Bilbo as a female, this mother takes a good story and removes the disconnect between the main character and her daughter. I believe that's as close to an improvement to The Hobbit as anyone could make.  ",lacronicus,2013-12-31T21:51:31Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

> Perhaps most importantly, she never makes an issue of her gender—and neither does anyone else

Perhaps, just maybe, that was the point. Even though the characters in The Hobbit are all male they could just as well be androgynous. Tolkien is the last author to meddle with a modern ethical concern, seeing as he  very much disliked allegory and wanted to write for the sake of story-telling.

The article is the very definition of clickbait.  The author used a controversial headline to garner attention, than wrote a bland and agreeable article.

Even if she were the perfect woman hero... there is still the awkward fact I could probably name a greater number of significant *horses* from LOTR than significant women characters.

And I think that folds into what the article was saying about how in fiction not enough heroic characters simply happen to be female. (And why they were so charmed with the result they got by making the Hobbit's Bilbo a she instead of a he). 

With a large variety of heroic male characters, they can all have different good traits countered with flaws. When there's only one or two significant women characters, and the author is emphasizing the ""wow, a *woman* is doing this?!"" factor, it kind of falls on that character to be the book's representation of all womankind. (And when you have the one woman warrior finding happiness by giving up shieldmaidenry to settle down and have kids, it has a different significance to people than if she was one of several women in battle following different paths).

That stupid love triangle in The Hunger Games really ruined what could have been a pretty solid YA scifi story. Then there's Twilight, which had some crazy-as-fuck weird stuff play out. 

Conversely, (it's a little sad that) that even to this day, one of the best teenaged girl/women characters out there is Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, because she's resourceful, clever, not throwing temper tantrums, or not having to find her prince charming to win the day. She can work and succeed as a girl, but not have to deal with being ""The Chosen One"" or ""I thought you were a boy!"" super specialness as to why she above all other girls is able to do what she can do.



It's not that gender flipping The Hobbit is wrong or great, it's that it can work either way without it having to be ""gender explained"" in the story why a girl could even go on such a quest. 

It's not a great fix (writing a character as a male then finding/replace gender is still an issue), but that doesn't discount that there does need to be better stories for girls that doesn't revolve around being princesses/finding prince charming/only special girls get to have adventures/desexing gender as a cheat code to write stories.

Even if Bilbo were a girl I think it would take away from their adventure, distracting them from their true goal.

I am not telling women/girls what to read and what not to read. If you want to read a romance novel please do so, we need more love in the world, and there are plenty of books to choose from.

There's a good reason that the ancient world was a man's world.  And that reason is that if a group of marauders with axes and swords comes to kill you and take your shit, the best plan of action is ""women get the fuck out of dodge, and men prepare to kill and die to protect them.""

And all the ""gender roles"" spring forth from this cold hard truth.  And by glossing over it I think you receive a diminished understanding of the world we came from, and in turn maybe less appreciation for the world we have.

People in this thread keep waxing on about ""gender roles"" but could those roles not have been the motivation for Bilbo to rise above his culture and become a hero?

Isn't it likely that he saw this male dominated world of heroism and battle and danger, and felt a compulsion due to being a man that he would dishonor himself by not rising to the challenge?

It ain't easy to go out and risk your life and limb for something.  If you don't have a culture telling you you're not a man if you don't, that everyone's equal, then a lot of dudes wouldn't do it.  Gender roles and sexism are a necessity to convince human beings to go do violent, dangerous shit.

A lot of women don't understand or appreciate the drive to be respected by men, for doing that which men are thought to have to do.

The characters in the hobbit would *understand* if a female Bilbo chickened out.  They wouldn't think less of her, because that's not a woman's role to stab orcs and confront dragons.  But if a man chickens out, he's a pussy.  Fair or not, that social pressure has its advantages when you live in a world of physical power and physical danger.

Bilbo isn't Bilbo outside of the context of this warrior society.

(Frankly though, all gender aside I can't imagine someone reading the Hobbit to a five year old without gutting the story of a lot of plot points like giant spiders and threat of being eaten by trolls as well. I think it would probably have been better just to leave it til they were older).

From your post, I do think you also missed the fact that in the article, it was the kid that actually made the change to the story, the mother was only going along with her. The fact the story still worked well was what brought up the bigger discussion.

Of course, had the original terms of copyright had not been changed, the Hobbit would have already been in the public domain. Imagine if Wishbone had been the one telling it.

I'm not upset at the idea of one mother reading the Hobbit to her daughter with Bilbo as a woman. I'm upset with the idea of retroactively changing characters to insert modern values. You're projecting your own issues with gender dynamics and general influence of patriarchal power dynamics onto the issue to the point where anyone that disagrees with you is upset that a female character can be a woman without conforming to every stereotype in the book, instead of the larger issue of retconning when other (and in my opinion more valid) options are available. You're like a bull rampaging through a china store that only sees red.

The daughter enjoyed having a female protagonist - evidenced by her insistence that Bilbo *is* a girl - and the mom changing the pronouns to female ones didn't hurt the story in any way, and her daughter seemed to enjoy it.

The author of the article was making an observation that while many books have a female protagonist, many of them make serious efforts to change the story to fit a stereotypically female protagonist.

The author of the article wasn't speaking to how ""progressive and inspiring"" The Hobbit became when she changed Bilbo into a female.

It was a simple thought experiment and certainly not one to evoke such hostility as you are bringing forth.

I'm not arguing for ""my story"".  I haven't written a story.  I was offering an example of how a *typical* story about a female protagonist progresses, and simplifying the situation for /u/othniel01, as they asked for some clarification.

The problem with the Hobbit trilogy is it is based off a short book. When I read it was being made into a trilogy I knew it would never work. The LOTR was huge. And Peter Jackson had the Silmarillion and Lost Tales for further references on the world. As those who have read the books as well well know Jackson's movies are really only a snippet of everything in the books. As long as they are he cuts a lot out because it just doesn't all fit.

As a side note I love the pace of LOTR. I think it is more on par with reality. Although this is fantasy. Things don't necessarily happen to us all at once.  But in a movie you need action a lot faster. It is a different medium. ",kimchi01,2018-08-31T09:37:18Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

9bprt0,"The Hobbit is the best way to ease into the Tolkien universe.  I'd highly recommend it as a first serious novel to give young children, and agree that The Lord of The Rings demands a major jump in attention span and reading comprehension.  

I tried reading Fellowship immediately after The Hobbit as a little kid and it was an agonizing slog - couldn't get a genuine read-through until several years later.  There's also a plot doldrum in the middle of The Two Towers that can be tedious at any age, so newcomers to LOTR should plan for that and not be deterred when they run into it.

Definitely read The Silmarillion at some point after the novels.  It's epic mythology that is most rewarding after you've already built up a personalized familiarity with Middle Earth.  Written pretty smoothly and easy to read, for the most part, but it resonates most deeply when you already feel connected to the material.  Otherwise it can seem a bit thin and random because it's so far removed from the time period and societies of the novels, occurring in the ancient history before them.

A writers first book(s) is often not the masterpiece. The long descriptives in LOTR are beautiful, but I personally couldn’t appreciate them until I was an adult in my 30’s.

9bprt0,"Correct, LoTR was begun only after the publisher wanted another book after *The Hobbit* took off.

Tolkien also suggested that LoTR and *The Silmarillion* be published together as one massive book titled something like, The Book of the Ring and the Jewels. His publisher (needless to say) refused. Also, LoTR was written as one work made up of six individual ""books"" that was broken into a trilogy to make it cheaper for his publisher -- sales were not expected to be high.

The Silmarillion was never actually completed during Tolkien's lifetime. His son, Christopher, compiled what he thought was the best version of the major stories together into what became The Silmarillion. Eventually his son decided to just publish his father's unfinished manuscripts, a process that is still ongoing though the Middle-Earth centric publications were primarily done with the Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-Earth.",kazingaAML,2018-08-31T19:35:38Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

ucog44,"*The Hobbit* was written for two audiences, children and the adults who read to children. Tolkien's voice is heard throughout, unlike in *The Lord of the Rings* where it's really only heard in the Prologue. Other than Thorin, the dwarves do not have very distinct personalities because the story is very much about Bilbo, not about the dwarves. 

Gandalf is a master trickster as much as he is a wizard, and Bilbo is his protege. Bilbo's ring merely gives him invisibility, and that doesn't do him much good against a dragon who can smell his presence. Gollum is Bilbo as he could have been if he had not found the courage to escape the goblins. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is a crucial turning point in his adventure and his life for reasons having little to do with the ring.

Bilbo is 50, not 20, so in a sense he is undergoing a mid-life crisis. During much of the adventure he has to remember how to be a boy on a boy's adventure. But curiously he also ends up as a trusted advisor and even savior of the dwarves when Gandalf is unavailable. And he is the one member of the party who dares to defy Thorin when greed threatens to cause a needless a war over Smaug's spoils.

*The Hobbit* was very well received by critics in 1937. C.S. Lewis compared it to *Alice in Wonderland*, *Flatland*, *Phantastes*, and *The Wind in the Willows*, not because the plots had anything in common, but because they take place in their own delightful little worlds. And he compared them as well because although classified as children's books, they could be read and enjoyed again and again at any age.

ucog44,"The Hobbit was his first foray into that world. He gave a draft to his son Christopher to see what he though, he liked it and Tolkien said well that's good enough for me and got it published. People wanted to know more about that world, the people, the ring of power. So he set off to make the Trilogy. Which in his foreword that Serkis reads he says he wanted to make a very long book, and also indulge his love of languages. They read very differently than the hobbit. His friends were quoted saying they didn't like to go on walks with Tolkien because he would just stop to look at a tree for 20 minutes. It really shows in the Trilogy in the best way in my opinion.

The thing about the Trilogy is, it is a beautiful heart breaking story. It's an end to things mystical and mysterious as the world of ancient things slowly leave and die out. 

I love fantasy, its pretty much all I read. My DnD group is coming on 8 years. Magical escapism into heroic adventure just clicks with me. And I go through a TON of audio books as I work alone and drive a ton through my day.

ucog44,"The Hobbit is frequently under-rated IMO. It's always viewed as LOTR's kid brother, and there's some truth to that, but I think it does a lot of things very well. I think of it less as a kid's book and more of a book for adults to read to kids. That ""conversational"" prose in the Hobbit makes it really fun to read out loud. I really enjoy how it mixes episodic chapters that have their own contained adventures, with an overarching quest and character growth. Its moral about getting out of your comfort zone and trusting yourself is especially applicable for kids but is a good reminder for all of us.

You're probably remembering the 1970s animated Hobbit made by Rankin-Bass (the company that made Rudolph and all those other clay-mation Christmas films we grew up with). It had some *unique* takes on how fantasy creatures should look. Cat dragon, frog goblins, bearded spiders, testicle-headed dwarves, and some truly horrifying wood elves.

LOTR is a bit of a different animal. I had read The Hobbit at a really early age, but couldn't handle LOTR for several years after, even though I was very interested in the world. The Hobbit is basically Tolkien's take on ""fairy tales"", like those by the Grimm brothers. LOTR is more like his take on epic fantasy like Beowulf. Though if you've read any of those originals you can tell as much as we think of Tolkien as classic fantasy he was really modernizing those inspirations.

Usual advice for LOTR is to push to Rivendell, where the story really opens up. But I think for people familiar with the films, there is so much in that first part that was cut for the films, that it should be interesting.

LOTR has a lot of its issues, but it is for adults, with adult themes and it's a story with a very clear direction and so plays much better for me.

I left the theater in disgust when I realized that’s what was going to happen in the third film.

It’s possible the reasoning was so that it wouldn’t feel like the trilogy completely climaxed  in the middle (which, I admit The Hobbit story kinda does with Smaug) leaving audiences wondering why there’s a third film.  But that’s what happens when you break a single story up into three separate parts.  Really, there didn’t need to be three films.  Two would’ve done.

It’s not nitpicky.  It’s not “the popular thing to say on the internet”.  It’s just an awful story adaptation, period.  Oh, and yeah the constant CGI sucked.  Part of what made the LoTR films so amazing was the actual on-location filming.  You cannot recreate that atmosphere with a green screen.  It simply can’t be done.

Virtually everything Tolkien did was based in some form of epic literature. And surprise, writers from the Celtic and Germanic 9th century were all men who were not very interested in the tropes and themes or authentic representations of women. 

And I don't know what documented 'general misogyny' you are talking about. Frank Zappa (is just the 1st to come to mind) was a documented misogynist.

He was religious and traditional in many aspects of his life, and his work is largely a product of his time and his character.  On his omission of female characters in The Hobbit—it was 1937 and the active roles of women were not as prominent in the public sphere as men.  It’s almost as though a lack of sex, intrigue, or romance in a story results in a lack of female characters.  In LoTR, Arwen and Eowyn’s stories were largely that of a love triangle, tied to Aragorn.

It’s oversimplified, tunnel-vision, where the stories of men overshadow the stories of women because the actions and importance of women remain in the peripheral in male authors’ own real worlds, and therefore in their own made up worlds.  It is a reflection of one’s narrow perspective and ones narrow perception.  

Awareness, perspective, and perceptions are expanding (I found myself intentionally avoiding the term *diversifying*, because it’s apparently a dirty word these days), and with it world building is more complex. 

In 1954, when LoTR was first published, women were entering the public sphere more.  It was nearly two decades from The Hobbit’s original publish date, and so perhaps Tolkien’s life experience could explain his slightly more inclusive handling of female characters, and more complex world building in general.

As a girl, I made it my business to empathize with Frodo & Sam & Aragorn (and Holden Caulfield, The Old Man in the Sea, The Gunslinger...)

Because he felt that male was the most appropriate gender to convey the ideas he had for those characters within the context of the world he built.

Why?

Because most of them were fighters, or monarchs, or leaders, or otherwise roles that would be filled by men in the world he built.

Why?

Because it's his fictional world and that's what he decided was true for the fictional peoples in his fictional universe.  Which is honestly all it boils down to.  It's his world and he can write it however he damn well pleases, can't he?  **Within the context of the Middle Earth he created**, none of the rulers, fighters, and people of other import to the story of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield, and the dragon of the Misty Mountains would have been women.  Women absolutely filled prominent roles in Middle Earth as we see in all of his other works about it, it just so happened that none of those women had any reason to cross paths with Bilbo and Thorin during the adventure they had together detailed in The Hobbit.

A better question would be ""why does it matter what gender the characters in The Hobbit were?  Would the story have been fundamentally different in any way if Smaug was a female dragon?  Or Elrond was a woman?""

8ub2nq,"These ideas are much more coherent and well thought out than your other comments. As for normal and trite opinions on the subject - I misjudged your commitment to the books. But it's worth saying - just because an idea is novel or unique doesn't mean it's valid or holds up to scrutiny. Just the same, because an opinion is commonly held doesn't mean it's worthless. Sure I'm just repeating ideas and theses of professors and scholars I've read, but it's not like I got a grad focus in Epic literature. Irish Lit was my focus. So I'm just a tourist in Tolkien and Epic literature. That being said, I can talk somewhat intelligently on the subject - but this is gonna be a long response, so bear with me.

So anyway, lets start with Homer, cause that's probably what I know best - There's some timeline issues with your statement that Homer was obsessed with the Persian empire. The 1st Persian Empire came to power around 550BC and ended in 350BC. Now we have no idea when The Odyssey was written down, but we generally assume that it was written by Homer around 750BC - and Homer was using an oral tradition as the basis for his writing. So if the oral Bards who recited The Odyssey before Homer's time had any anxieties about foreign, Middle Eastern powers, it wasn't about the Persians. Before The Achaemenid Empire, the Persian people were nomadic, not united, and certainly no threat to the power of Greece. 

The Assyrians and Anatolians are mentioned in Homer's writing, and the Phoneticians and Egyptians are written of extensively in The Odyssey and Iliad. Maybe there was some anxiety about foreign Middle Eastern powers (and you could probably make a fantastic argument of that), but it certainly wasn't of the Egyptians and Phoneticians. Homer writes of their trading habits, their exports and imports, their gods and religious pantheon. Zeus tells Odysseus to see the King of the Phoneticians - that they will treat him well in his travels home. Now the Greeks held many prejudices but I think we can assume they held favorable views of at least the Phoneticians and Egyptians. Their wares and religious culture and military strategy and their vessels are spoken of very highly. I feel like, for an oral poem, praising the skills of a shared enemy wouldn't impress the audience too much.

""The East"" certainly has a foreign, other-ness quality that's been used throughout Western Civilization, but in this example, I think Tolkien is utilizing the specific language of Homer and other Epic writers in the interest of tradition. I think for Tolkien, it was a way of describing a group of people - any people, by their location. The Huns are 'of The East' in the Nibelungenlied, the Hyperboreans dwelt ""on the Northern Wind"" in The Odyssey, Egil's Saga and Volsung's Saga both refer to groups of people by their directionality. It was a theme, and Tolkien was just utilizing that in his narrative - in my opinion. You could possibly convince me otherwise of that.

Onto Tolkien's inclusion of women in LotR and his lack of women in The Hobbit - He certainly did chose his source material - but women are not a major aspect of traditional epic literature. Sure, in the Odyssey, women are clever and intelligent, and often the equal of their husbands (Penelope or Calypso or Charbydis are reckoning forces, some literally) but even then, in The Odyssey there's 1 female for every 10 males (for Penelope and her Suitors, that's an understatement) and there are hardly any women in The Iliad at all. Helen is described as a bewitched whore - and that's about it. And she's nice to look at. She's given significantly more depth during her appearance in The Odyssey, but otherwise, she and other women in traditional Greek literature are just plot mechanisms and foils. So some of Tolkien's source material had a diverse coalition of female characters, but some works had almost none. Beowulf, Nibelungenlied, Hildebranslied, and other Germanic/Icelandic epics are sorely lacking in female characters. But the Shanemah has a diverse coalition of warrior women - an that is a text which I think inspired a number of female characters in LotR.

Excluding The Hobbit, which as OP pointed out, has no women, LotR and the Silmarilian do in fact have a diverse cast of strong female characters. There's Sam's wife, the Valar are almost equally divided between men and women, Lady Haleth, Galadrial, Shelob is a female, Arwen is no slouch and there are others. There may not be very many women in Tolkien's stories, but all the women he includes are strong, formidable, wise, and often times dangerous. I can't think of a single feeble, weak willed woman in the entire trilogy and I can name probably half a dozen sniveling, unmanly, subjugated men. 

I do agree with you about your final point - artists are separate from their art. John Lennon was a terrible father, Albert Einstein was a womanizing shithead, Cobain was a debilitated dope addict. I just don't think it's fair to label Tolkien's writing as 'racist' or 'misogynistic'. There's not enough evidence in his writing to suggest that to be true, and there's no evidence to support that from his personal life. I can't tell you too much about his personal life, but even if he himself had racial prejudices, I don't think LotR can be interpreted in the way you've described. The women he does include are inspiring, the racial themes are more aligned with traditional epic narrative and language than they are 20th century prejudice and racism. But, ya know. It's worth considering. I enjoyed your argument very much.",silverbean,2018-06-28T01:33:21Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Also, I don't usually recommend this but... watch the LotR movies first (NOT THE HOBBIT MOVIES!!! AVOID THOSE UNTIL YOU""VE FINISHED THE BOOK) They are not 100% accurate to the books but they do a good job of catching the feel of the books. Also, they leave a lot out, so the books still feel fresh in some ways. It can help to know there's exciting stuff coming when you get bogged down by the rather slow beginning of the Fellowship of the Rings. 

 I personally think it's totally fine to skip over some of the prose and descriptions (and poetry) on your first read through. I love Tolkien's world building, I have read the books more times than I can count and appreciate the beautiful writing, but I know the drive to just get to the action.

It's all about letting the reader know what's at stake, the effect the events of the story are having on the world and how the past has shaped the future. Sometimes this means the story slows to a crawl but think of it like a stroll through a forest and enjoy the scenery as Tolkien describes it. If you try to fight his pacing you'll probably end up hating the books. They are not action stories. Also, be aware LOTR is written quite differently from The Hobbit. It's a much more dense book, more complex in language and themes and not the fun adventure The Hobbit is. That's not to say it's not good, it's excellent but it's a very different book from The Hobbit.",VincentVegaFFF,2022-04-14T18:30:30Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

The Lord of the Rings is definitely the closest in style fo writing to the Hobbit, even if it is more serious. 

There’s the Silmarillion which is best described as a fantasy Bible for Middle Earth, is a lot more like a history book or a compendium of mythologies. It’s one of my favourite books, but it’s completely different from the Hobbit.

There are some stories from the Silmarillion that have their own books. “The Children of Hurin” and “Beren and Lúthien” in particular are good reads.

The idea of homosexuality wasn't nearly as accepted (as in...it wasn't at all). Second, the way of writing was completely different back then compared to today. Different terminology, definitions, syntax, etc. was used compared to today. Third he was English and they have different sensibilities than Americans, Even back then. Finally, the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings can be seen as having strong Catholic themes and personalities. Tolkien was Roman Catholic.

I would read that and then decide based on that whether to move on to The Silmarillion or not.

Bilbo doesn't become a Dragon Slayer, he isn't a great War Hero, he just happens to be the guy who was along for the ride and wrote a book about his travels.

As for the dwarves NOT slaying the dragon, I think it is kind of funny.

oz8v95,"I would recommend reading Tolkien's Essay Titled - On Fairy Stories. He refers to all Dues Ex Machina-like things as a eucatastrophe and that it is a core part of any fantasy story. Tolkien uses the eucatastrophe in all his stories like the eagles in the return of the king, the killing of Smaug, and Gandalf arriving at the battle of helms deep to name a few. If we look at other stories we see eucatastrophe happen all the time the Woodsman saves little red and grandma, jack cutting down the beanstalk just in time to kill the giant, or the big bad wolf falling down the fireplace and burning to death. So this was an intentional choice        

Lore wise it is said that Eru or God has a chosen path for everyone throughout Arda. Luck, Fate, and chance is a huge theme in the hobbit. The Dwarves and Gandalf ""randomly"" choose bilbo Bilbo found the ring by ""accident"". Bilbo also found the Arkenstone in a mountain of gold by ""chance"". Now things didn't happen by accident they were laid out by Eru so the ring would be found and later destroyed by Frodo. If we look at the early pages of the Silmarillion when Morgoth when against Eru's song by creating his own melody ( were getting into some deep lore here folks). Eru told Morgoth that no matter what he did will always contribute to Eru's ultimate plan. So everything happened just the way it was supposed to happen according to Eru.",Spendrs,2021-08-07T01:39:48Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
oz8v95,"Ok people, first of all,  has anyone besides the one who claimed to have read The Hobbit, actually read the book?  Because it sounds like you have either only watched the movie (cartoon or live action) or read the comic book.  The Hobbit is NOT a children’s book nor is it a simple fairy tale. You’re missing the point here.
Bilbo was a vital part of the story because of his size.  Hobbits in general are known to have large gardens, find peace in the small and simple things, also they speak to small animals and birds. The thrush did NOT tell Bard about the missing scale. No one knew Smaug even had a missing scale until Bilbo snuck into the cavern. The thrush was the one who shared that tidbit with Bilbo, who in turn shared it with Bard.  The humans of Laketown had a long history with Smaug.  There was no magic arrow.  Bard’s father, Girion was the Lord of Dale and initially fought Smaug and broke the scale off.  
Bilbo was the whole reason Smaug was killed!  
Also if you remember correctly, Gandalf was always a part of the story. HE is the one who called The Eagles to help.  The dwarves were never motivated by greed. Thorin was blinded for a time, but the initial motivation was to get the dwarven king back. The elves simply didn’t trust the dwarves with all that wealth because it had driven Thorin’s father mad. The Orcs and Goblins were just plain evil.  The humans had just seen their friends and family die, their town leveled and had nothing to rebuild with.  The only ones truly entitled to the treasure were the dwarves, who it belonged to initially.  
Bilbo the Hobbit was no easy out in this story.  In everything he did throughout his adventure, his actions were pivotal all the way up to and including the desolation of Smaug.",,2021-08-07T01:27:56Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

oz8v95,"I'm mixed on it. On one hand, I like that it doesn't fit what has become the standardized formula. The idea that a character or situation must be established in a certain way in the story before it does something important--sort of a reverse Chekov's gun--seems to me a part of a very modern concept of How Books Are Supposed To Be Written: everything must have a place and purpose, introduced a certain way and ultimately do a certain thing, everything must advance the plot, characters must always ""learn and grow"" (ugh), etc. etc. And ultimately that becomes very formulaic and telegraphed.

That said, in the case of The Hobbit I sympathize with your perspective, because I don't find the two incidents you mentioned to be all that dramatically satisfying. There is a futility and lack of agency to it, but it seems almost not to realize its futility and lack of agency, because it is written as ""eucatastrophe"" rather than satire. And no matter how they are explained in-universe (so to speak) in Tolkien's other writings, it's difficult not to see the eagles as a problem in terms of plot and stakes.",WyldeBoar,2021-08-07T17:51:39Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

You'd be mistaken in thinking that The Hobbit had little depth, but finding it dull is very much a matter of taste. It's a story of the development of one particular character, whereas LOTR has wildly more complex character development.

Indeed, the plot of LOTR depends heavily on character development. You see characters pushed to their very limits, you see them break, and the day is only saved because they had friends.

The Hobbit is much lighter in tone. LOTR is much darker, very melancholy, but stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with hope and faith in the possibility that just maybe good will win out in the end.

750i5b,"The LotR trilogy is easily my favorite series of all time, rivaled only by Harry Potter for me. I've made a point to reread at least the main trilogy every year since my sophomore year of high school, about 6 years ago. 


What I love so much about Tolkien's universe, is the attention to detail that he put into his work. I mean, the man actually created his own language, several in fact! The way he describes Hobbits and Hobbit culture at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring rarely comes into much importance later on in the saga, but it paints such a vivid picture of what life is like for the Hobbits that I can easily visualize it in my head. Tolkien had the family tree of every main character drawn out to, at least, a few generations. A lot of characters and names we'll never read or see mention of in the books, but just the fact that they exist adds so much to the world building.


Now I consider myself to be a diehard Tolkien fan, so I feel compelled to recommend you the other novels in that universe:


I'd start with the Appendices actually, at the end of Return of the King. This gives more of the lore that takes place after the trilogy, along with things like pronouciations and family trees. It is absolutely essential to read this along with the LotR trilogy, in my opinion.


The only other book that is a must read for me is the Silmarillion, Tolkien's bible. Though it reads like the actual Bible at times, it is a ""brief"" overview of everything that happens in the LotR world; from creation to the end of the Third age, and even hints at events beyond then. I find myself skipping certain chapters here and there, so don't feel bad if you find it to be a difficult read.


The Letters of JRR Tolkien are a nice read, and indeed a glimpse, into the mind of the author. Not an essential read, but it does add more lore and provides corrections or explanations on things that were not adequately done so in the books.


The Children of Húrin is a much smaller story in both length and scale compared to the LotR books, but it is measurably darker and much more sinister. I have only read it two times, as it is a bit of a downer for my tastes, but I would recommend it nonetheless.


There are other books that I am forgetting to mention, it's early I haven't had my coffee yet, but if you really want to learn more about this wonderful universe, there are endless resources online that will explain everything to you. r/lotr would be a fantastic place to start.

But, it's likely a deliberate shift in the story by Tolkien to alert you that this is the ""last of the Shire"".

750i5b,"I think Tom Bombadil serves several purposes. He is a helper on the quest (quest heroes in traditional epics and fairy tales generally run into helpers who have the exact qualities that they need), so he rescues the hobbits from their first serious challenge, Old Man Willow, which they cannot overcome by themselves. (Traditional quest heroes also usually fail their first challenge, as Bilbo does in burgling the trolls in *The Hobbit*.) 

Tom also demonstrates the nature of the Ring. It feeds the desire for power. Hobbits, who by their nature generally don't desire power, turn out to be better guardians of the Ring than other creatures. Thus Gandalf, by nature a powerful being, fears the corruption of the Ring because he knows how it would corrupt his desire to use his power for good. (Gandalf seldom exercises the power within him; he uses advice and persuasion, believing in free will, not domination.) Tom Bombadil is similar in this respect: he has a great deal of power, but chooses not to use it. He freely sets boundaries on his desires: he is the master of his land, but does not claim ownership of the beings within it, who all belong to themselves. Thus he does not desire the Ring--and the Ring has no hold on him. Frodo feels no threat from Tom to his possession of the Ring, so he freely hands the Ring to him when Tom asks. Tom remains visible while wearing it because the Ring has no hold on him. Frodo does feel threatened when Tom plays the trick, making the Ring disappear (in a neat inversion of its usual power over others), resulting in Frodo playing his own trick: putting on the Ring and becoming invisible to his fellow hobbits. But Tom (literally) sees through him, tells him to take off the Ring (""your hand is more fair without it""), which Frodo does and the moment passes. Tom is the only being in the narrative who lacks desire for greater power than he possesses; he is thus a foil for those who have great power but remain unsatisfied (principally Saruman and Sauron).

Of course, Tom is also an isolationist, withdrawing from engaging with the world. That is ultimately an indefensible position, figuratively as well as literally, as Gandalf makes clear in Elrond's council: if Sauron wins, ""Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First, and then Night will come."" In other words, isolating yourself does not solve the problems of the world; you simply avoid the responsibility of solving them but will likely get trampled by them in the end.

Tl;dr: Tom Bombadil's purpose in the novel is to show how desire for power needs to be limited, but also the pitfalls of isolationism.",Midwestern_Childhood,2017-10-08T17:12:34Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
750i5b,"A lot of these are explained in the book and appendices.

> Why is the world seemingly depopulated? Why is civilization dying out? 

The story in LoTR takes place at the end of the age of mythology and the beginning of the age of Man. For most of the history of the world, there was a titanic struggle between the first more magical races, like the elves and the first men the Numenoreans, and the forces of literal evil - first against the god Morgoth, then against his lieutenant Sauron. One of the things that is repeatedly mentioned in the books is that part of the power of the elves is to preserve things as they are - and since they are immortal this greatly slows progress. Over time though more and more elves have been leaving to go to the undying lands, but the magic they bring to the world still slows development.

The world of men seems to be dying out because the real magical evil that existed in the world was constantly sapping the energy of the human realms with wars and twisting men to fight other men in an attempt to gain the upper hand and finally get rid of the elves and claim the world for the side of darkness. There were absolutely titanic struggles in the past that wiped out whole kingdoms and sank continents...that has left the remaining humans as kind of survivors of a number of apocalypses who are limited in the niches that they can fill in the world because of the still present influence and power of the more magical / evil world.

> What the hell were those things in the mounds? What happened to those Kingdoms the Wraiths ruled? Why is he called the Witch-King - because he is immortal or because he was a mage? What happened to Angmar? 

They were old kings who were seduced to the evil side of things. That whole depopulated side of Middle Earth used to be full of human kingdoms, but the forces of evil captured many of them, like Angmar, using things like the rings of power. Sauron gave those rings of power to human kings in that region to control them and their people, and when those kings died the rings allowed their wraiths to continue existing in bondage to Sauron. Wars were fought to destroy these evil northern kingdoms, and the area was never repopulated because true evil still lurked in the land and was active in picking off and corrupting humans.

So the books are really about the changing of ages, the fading away of a more magical and heroic past into the inevitable, and necessary even if sadly not magical, human future. They are about the way that the balance of power works, and how if things are controlled by beings who aren't interested in change and are undying then things become static and withered as attrition takes over and fatigue sets in. 

The universe that Tolkein created is really intricate, and one of my favorite things that isn't in the Hobbit or LoTR is the explanation he gives for the beginning of the universe and why there is evil in it.",Anjin,2017-10-08T18:55:11Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It is unclear whether Tom was created by illuvatar, how he came to be or how powerful he exactly is, or when he came to middle earth (a physical area in arda, not even a continent). In fact, we know nearly nothing about Tom..

However, it is very likely that treebeard is the oldest creature STILL EXISTING in middle earth, since they were created almost at the very beginning but most likely had awoken after the elves.

Note that the LOTR trioligy and The hobbit is a secondary and less accurate source in Tolkien's world as they are merely diaries by hobbits. The Simarillion is considered as the final word on every piece of Tolkien lore it covers.

750i5b,"Thanks. I'm glad if it helped. I don't think there's a lot to say about what Tom is capable of besides what Tolkien shows us in the two chapters Tom appears and what Gandalf says in the Council of Elrond (which isn't much). His origins are equally murky, and Tolkien didn't seem interested in pinning them down. So anything I say/think is speculative, rather than interpretive. (The earlier explanation is interpretive: arguing what specific textual elements mean, whereas speculative means that the textual elements just don't exist and I'm having to guess based on general comments Tolkien makes elsewhere. Do be aware that what I was saying is my interpretation; others may argue differently.) 

I speculate that within Tolkien's cosmology, as set out in *The Silmarillion*, Tom Bombadil is probably a Maia, like Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and the balrogs. He came into the world with the Valar and other Maiar when Iluvatar offered them the chance to make the song of creation real, but for reasons unspecified didn't stick with them. By his own account to the hobbits, he has been in Middle-earth before the rivers and trees, before ""the first raindrop and the first acorn"": that sounds to me like before Yavanna created the plants in *The Silmarillion*. He has seen everything since: in fact, I think the tale he tells the hobbits, taking them through history back and back to the very beginning, when he falls asleep, mirrors his own personal history. He ""nods"" as if falling asleep because he gets to the point before his own awake and aware existence. The one contradictory element for all this is that he tells them he was there ""before the Dark Lord came from outside""; however, Melkor/Morgoth entered Arda with the other Valar, so it's unclear how Tom Bombadil could have come in before him. 

I doubt Tolkien wanted to pin it down so exactly anyway: as a Catholic, he was fine with a sense of mystery cloaking some things.",Midwestern_Childhood,2017-10-08T19:25:18Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
750i5b,"See I kind of get why they left him out.. He was a very mysterious character in that he had an early role, showed he was some kind of all powerful being (put the ring on and laughed at it basically) and then is never to be heard of again.. Doesn't fit too well with a movie when a character of his power is abandoned.. Think of all the memes about not sending the eagles in with the ring!

750i5b,"Essentially, since the amount of time that elapsed since the ring was lost, everyone was more or less starting to think of all the old stories as “legends”. He only had an inkling of what it COULD be (I stress that because he had many pressing matters that he constantly dealt with and following up on veeeeery rare research materials wasn’t exactly priority, especially all for an inkling) but enchanted items weren’t exactly that unheard of, at least on Gandalf’s part. Sauron was also obviously growing in power but no one had any fucking clue where the ring was (except Gollum, more or less). I only say more or less for Gollum because he didn’t really know what it was and he only really knew who had it. When Gandalf was more certain, enough to really look into the matter, the Shire was the perfect hiding place in the mean time. No one there had any clue what it was, Bilbo (and Frodo) was apparently very resilient and Gandalf and the Rangers worked very hard to ensure that the hobbits/the Shire remain fairly unheard of on top of it all. It wasn’t until Gandalf learned about the dealings of Bilbo’s adventure with Gollum and getting the ring, seeing the effects in Bilbo, finishing his research on it (and verifying with the inscriptions), finding out Gollum was looking for him and then that Gollum was captured and spilled all his knowledge, that he really freaked the fuck out and made that his priority above all else.

So it definitely wasn’t a loophole, more so that shit was getting serious real quick once Sauron started coming back into power and being. During this, Gandalf was constantly trying to fix/help out all of his allies, considering how powerful and knowledgeable he was. Once it seemed a decent chance of being The Ring, he acted accordingly.",AFG2417,2017-10-08T20:59:26Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

After reaching the Prancing Pony and finding out that Barliman Butterbur forgot to relay Gandalf's ""urgent"" message, the pursuit of the Nasgul becomes much more immediate and getting to Rivendell becomes urgent.

I read the books after I had seen the movies a couple times, and what struck me was how much totally unrelated shit the hobbits do before arriving at Rivendell. In the movies, they book it to Bree and then book it to Rivendell, while being chased by the Nazgul. In the books, there's the whole Tom Bombadil thing and the Barrow-downs sequence, and that's before they even get to Bree, IIRC. ",blisteringchristmas,2017-10-08T21:10:34Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

750i5b,"Here's the thing though: many things that work in books do not necessarily work in movies and vice versa. They're two entirely different mediums. So while the movies don't give you all the nuances of the books, it's pretty hard to deny that the movies succeed at showing the grand, epic scale of the war. It's like comparing apples to oranges. I understand why avid book readers get upset, but honestly the movies, if anything, have most likely expanded readership rather than caused people to substitute the movies for the books (i.e. people who want to read the books will most likely not be dissuaded by watching the movie). I think of them as compliments to one another, with each showing a different aspect of the same story. For instance, in the books Tolkien focuses mostly on the hobbits and their perspective while embarking on this huge journey. And that narrative strategy is successful, in my opinion, at taking the reader along the journey. But if the movies focused on the hobbits as much as the books do, it would have been seemed strange; the movies tell a visual story, and as such we expect to see more of the bigger picture (e.g. Saruman's ""a new power is rising"" speech in two towers; the movie does a better job at capturing that epic scale) ",Brucewayne39,2017-10-08T14:51:16Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I always think it’s enourmously naive to wonder why Tom was cut from the movie. The whole point of Tom is that he doesn’t really make sense, and doesn’t have an explanation, that just wouldn’t have worked at all. The only inclusion of Tom I could see working is a small dialogue nod at either the council of Elrond, or in the hobbit when they’re talking with Elrond, I can’t think of any other way to actually include him in the movie.

There are also very serious books like The Silmarillion, which is basically a gigantic, steaming lore dump that puts all of LOTR in perspective. It's, unfortunately, very hard to read with hundreds of unpronounceable Elvish names of characters, groups and places. 

And there's a 12 volume set of The History of Middle Earth which contains (to my understanding, I've barely read a few pages from it) many story fragments that Tolkien wrote.

I mention these because they ground LOTR, which never explains who or what Sauron is or why the ending was so significant. Instead of reading them there are also some really great lore videos on youtube that will help put LOTR in perspective.

nmdla,"I would start with The Hobbit first because,Ike others have said, Tolkien can go on and on about things like scenery, meal times, etc., ad nauseum. I think The Hobbit will give you a good intro to his style. Plus it's a great book. Then read LotR. And if you find yourself wanting more I'd suggest moving next to The Silmarillion. Contains the history of Arda going back to the First Age. It reads like a mythological account you might read about any other creation myth here on Earth, so it's not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. If The Silmarillion is not to your taste skip ahead to The Children of Hurin. It's an expansion of a story in The Silmarillion, but more complete and presented as a stand alone story. Great read, I thought. If you do enjoy The Silmarillion, the next step is Unfinished Tales, and then ultimately, Chris Tolkien's 12 volume series The History of Middle-Earth, which is more of a literary and historical read of the making of the Tolkien Works. 

Happy reading. There's really something here for everyone, from a kid reading the Hobbit, to an avid adult fan with The History of Middle Earth. ",STXGregor,2011-12-22T14:17:33Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Strictly speaking, if it's the whole Middle Earth mythology thing that you want to get into, and absorb all of the backstory (lets face it, ""The Hobbit"" is prelude, and LOTR is the main story) then you should go all the way to the foundation material, and read the Silmarillion. The danger of that is of course the intense boredom that the Silm causes in all but the most hardcore fans. Your mileage may vary.

We'd been reading books together as a family for years by that point, but I still remember the conversation around the dinner table when one of my parents suggested that our next book be Lord of the Rings. Immediately they both lit up with excitement, trading the names of their favourite bits and characters back and forth: ""Oooooh, remember Strider? Remember the Dark Riders??"" (I specifically remember that they said Dark Riders, not Black Riders, and later realizing that they'd misremembered the name. 😂) My sister and I didn't know what any of these names meant but we knew we were in for something special, based on how excited they were about it. And we were right: it's a book that has shaped a lot about my worldview, and I can't think of a better way to experience it for the first time. When I reread now, there are many places in the book where I can still hear my parents' inflection as they read the chapter aloud to us (I will always hear Riddles in the Dark in my dad's voice, especially the moment when Bilbo first puts his hand on the Ring).

3gs2ol,"I believe that the answer is both yes and no.

As I recall, the silmarils had their origins in Tolkien's Silmarillion myth cycle, that he had been working on in one form or another since 1914.

As I understand it, when Tolkien began working on The Hobbit in the 1930s, he did not originally intend for it to be part of the same world as the Silmarillion.  They were two completely separate literary universes.

He did, however, borrow many ideas from from his as yet unpublished Silmarillion cycle to help flesh out the story and world of The Hobbit.

There are numerous similar-but-not-exact parallels between the two works, and the arkenstone was probably a case of Tolkien recycling his idea for the Silmarils and reworking it slightly to fit into his new story.

So according to the in-universe history that was later established in both The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion, the arkenstone and silmarils are two distinct entities.  But from a meta perspective, the arkenstone can be thought of as being more-or-less the same thing as the silmaril in question. ",,2015-08-13T02:03:11Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3gs2ol,"I believe this to be the most correct take on the debate.  I wish there was a comprehensive copy of the Silmarillion stories, prior to the current published version.   

Symbolically, there are quite a few similarities from the Silmarillion in his other writings.  It was not accepted by publishers ""as is"" and he continued work on other stories.  Posthumous, his son ""cleaned up"" the Silmarillion to fill in gaps.  This material was mostly a mix of the hobbit stories and Silmarillion + Lost Tales. (No direct source, pure speculation because... Well.. Only Christopher knows for sure where each gap was and which writings he used to fill them).  

I do believe, however, that JRR was not exclusive in his writings.  Once he began the hobbit series, he began to weave The Silmarillion to blend the two.  In my opinion, this occurs mid/late in Quenta and follows into Akallabeth (where the cross-name sharing really begins).  The final story (Rings of Power & the 3rd age) felt a bit rushed and piecemeal recounts of historical references from LOTR.  Quenta was also the point at which he was working on LOTR and revised some of the original Silmarillion text..

So that's kinda my take on it.  I'd really like the capacity to take the three major works (Lost Tales, Silmarillion, and hobbits) and compare them in simultaneous times, as they begin cross references.  The closest thing is really The History of Middle-Earth.

3gs2ol,">By your own logic if it is impossible for one of the gems to have been recovered and unrecognized you have to then ask why the elves didn't RUSH into the sea and the fiery pit where Maedros and Maglor threw their Silmarils and quickly recover them

One, none of the elves knew where this occurred, as it happened after they escaped an encampment of elves and Eonwe prevented anyone from pursuing them. The elves who might've been able to recover them, somehow, were also united to return the Silmarils to Valinor, as that was what was intended until Maedhros and Maglor stole them. Thus making it unlikely for anyone to attempt to do it, even if they were one of the few who might have some vague idea of where it landed.

>No. If you've read the Silmarils you have to remember that the wars weren't fought because the Elves really needed those gems or anything. It was fought more as a pride in the Elven race. To take what had been taken by Melkor and to defeat him. You also know that the War of Wrath was largely a failure and it ended as was prophesied in utter sadness and tragedy for everyone involved.

I think it was more tragic that the pursuit of these gems ultimately render the only two remaining heirs so evil and impure that they could not bear to touch the Silmarils themselves. They had shed so much blood, uselessly, as they could not even claim what they had sworn to retrieve. Secondly, the Silmarils were NOT simply a point of pride. They held the remaining light of the Two Trees, which were destroyed. They are unable to be altered or unmade by the Valar themselves, which is another reason the Arkenstone cannot be a Silmaril as the dwarves cut the arkenstone. Melkor didn't steal the Silmaril because it was a particularly nice gem. While never explicitly outlined, it is entirely possible that the initial hope of the rebelling elves was that by retrieving the Silmarils, they might somehow be able to renew the Trees...ya know, the main fucking light source for where they lived. 

Finally, I just have to point out, as someone who has issues with the Valar, half the fucking tragedy of the war was directly caused by the Valar themselves refusing to act. Like, seriously. It's like saying ""Hey, don't wear that blue dress, bad stuff will happen to you"" and then the only bad stuff that happens is that you beat me when I wear the blue dress.

None of the elves knew where Melkor fled after stealing the Silmarils either. But you can't tell me if the Elves are hell bendt on destroying themselves for generations to pursue a gem with no logical way of getting it back from the grasp of a Valar they all wouldn't have sent out search parties to recover them once Maedros and Maglor tossed them away and keep the logic of your argumen.

>Thus making it unlikely for anyone to attempt to do it, even if they were one of the few who might have some vague idea of where it landed.

Then by your own logic this would apply to the Arkenstone were it the silmaril as well. You're contradicting yourself.

>I think it was more tragic that the pursuit of these gems ultimately render the only two remaining heirs so evil and impure that they could not bear to touch the Silmarils themselves.

It was tragic that generations of a noble race destroy themselves through greed and corruption and war and death in the pursuit of objects and pride. The story is about the gradual downfall of a great race through the corruption of material objects and desire and being unwilling to accept the things that happen.

>They are unable to be altered or unmade by the Valar themselves, which is another reason the Arkenstone cannot be a Silmaril as the dwarves cut the arkenstone

How does anyone know the dwarves cut the arkenstone? Isn't it just as likely that the Arkenstone had been around for so long that everyone assumed the dwarves had carved it since no one thought it could have been the Silmaril? Since Bilbo wrote the Hobbit couldn't he have just mistakenly assumed it dwarven?

And the fact that they cannot be destroyed in no way makes them necessary objects. And it also contradicts your next point. No one would have thought they could remake the trees with them if in the very definition of the Silmarils they cannot be altered or destroyed. Condradicting yourself again.

>Finally, I just have to point out, as someone who has issues with the Valar, half the fucking tragedy of the war was directly caused by the Valar themselves refusing to act. Like, seriously.

Umm what? No. Just because the Valar don't take part in helping the Elves with every problem doesn't mean it's their fault. Melkor is the one responsible for everything bad that happened to the Elves not the Valar. It is discussed in the Silmarillion that the Valar don't interefere in every problem of the lives of the Elves out of respect for the music of Eru and in letting it play itself out. It is in the playing of the music that it's true beauty can be revealed. If they interfered all the time it would disrupt the vision of Eru. Basically if everything was chocolate cake an booze and titties and happiness all the time those things wouldn't be valued or special anymore is I think the vision Tokien was putting forth.

EDIT:

>Besides the Silmarils being unable to be cut, they also burned the hands/skin of those unworthy to touch it, not ever noted in the Hobbit.

I took a long time to learn to read. In grade 3 I went from Mr. Muggs (picture books), to Jurassic Park, The Hobbit, The Belgariad, etc. My mom didn’t care what I read, so long as I was reading. My mom took reading very seriously, and was very happy to spend hours in the library with my brother and I. We went to the public library weekly, at times.

I basically skipped an entire genre of books for intermediate ages, going from young kids books to adult.

My teacher thought it was her right to monitor what we were reading. She would walk us weekly to the public library, and then try to corral us into the kids area. I would always sneak off to the adult section, when her back was turned. 

Every time my class went to the library, my mom was either taking us or we had already gone. So, I never took out books. This lead the teacher into trying to demand that she keep my library card. My mom gave her a firm no, and assured her that she was fully capable of keeping track of our reading and she was fully aware of what I was reading and my comprehension on it.

Back to Jurassic Park. My teacher took it away from me, saying it was too scary and too advanced. I went crying to my mom to get the book back. My mom happily complied and told this teacher to never take anything away from me again, especially a book.

You can find the audiobook on youtube and give it a try to see if it helps. 


If you don't want to try the audiobook, just read aloud. It's a bit of silly advice, but even I was surprised to see how well this book goes along with spoken word. Imagine that you have a kid and you read him a bedtime story. You'll be surprised.

I think it is really important to think about what Tolkien was doing/trying to do with these books. I know that sounds dumb, but hear me out. Tolkien was incredibly well educated and these books were meant to be a sort of folktale for the UK because the UK doesn't really have one. The Silmarillion is the actual folklore ethos he created for the UK, but the Hobbit + LOTR are sub-stories. Like Cain and Abel or the story of Noah in the Bible, or Amaterasu in Shintoism, or any of the stories of the Buddha leading up to his enlightenment. So outside of the truly theological this begat this and begat that, Tolkien presents and adventure that was important to the period. A true good versus evil to be passed down in Middle Earth. He was also a linguist,l so instead of just putting gobbledy gook down in his stories, he created Elvish, the first language, and then created the other languages to follow. 

Later he even wrote the Lhammas which explains Elvish, it's other sub-dialects, and everything spoken during the first age leading in to the mannish languages (english) by discussing a fictional piece in the penned by a fictional person named Pengolodh, so now he is creating things like The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Iliad to give a folk history for a place that doesn't have one. It's really an epic undertaking and it all came from him telling stories to a young boy and then writing with other greats like C.S. Lewis.

The description was in depth and beautiful, but if it doesn't pertain to the story (as in if there's something intense going on and the scenery of the wind blowing is being described) I just skip over them. I hate to do it, but that's just my opinion. Glad I read them. LOTR got interesting at the end of the Two Towers.

3phds2,"I had to read The Hobbit in High school, and the rest in college.   
Having an interesting teacher got me over the initial bumps, and I really enjoyed the books once I got going.   

My suggestions: 
Download one or more of the many 'cheat sheets' or 'cliff notes / spark notes' around.   These helped me keep track of the new words, place names, and people's names that can make it very hard to follow.   
If it isn't unpleasant to you, keep notes as you read... A notebook, note cards, post-it's or pencil notes in the margins.   I tend to retain things better when I write them down, so I do this often.  
I'm reminded by my librarian friends that many times the famous, valuable books were annotated by their famous owners.  Today's books may not survive centuries, but I'd like to think that my notes would jog my own memory on re-reading later, and perhaps give some character or inspiration to an otherwise boring collection of papers that someone else might acquire. 

Watch (or rewatch) one or more of the BBC or PBS documentaries that discuss the books.  Stick to the pre-2000 searches on You Tube.  [one example](https://youtu.be/HkmNHP58OhU).  
They can be a little slow, but listen in the background perhaps.   They discuss the major story lines, making you more familiar with the characters and places.   
   They also offer some insight to the myth origins and how the book reflected the world when it was written.  These themes aren't developed until much later, but I found it interesting to look for items that helped (or hurt) these ideas as I read. 

Finally,  see if you can raise a few other readers to go with you.  A local library, friends, or even here on Reddit.

  - now I looked for a sub, of course there is. /r/TheHobbit,  /r/tolkienfans  possibly more.    Likely to have helpful notes or annotations, and offer interesting discussion.   I wouldn't be surprised if they read the book(s) on a periodic cycle, or answer your question in their FAQ.  

In any case, some folks may find it helpful to discuss what they read with others.   (I was too introverted to enjoy class discussions.)

3phds2,"I'm a stickler for doing things in order, so I've been halfway through The Hobbit for at least a year and half now. Originally it was helping that the movies were being released at the points I was at in the book, so it helped keep my attention, but I just couldn't grasp it sometimes. I had the same problems for  A Song of Ice and Fire, but I ended up doing the audio books instead and that was probably the better route for that series. I really wanna read the fancy editions I have for LotR, but I might have to go the route of the audio book. Or just read it when I'm out in public and look all cool and sophisticated with a thick heavy book in my hands. ",SundanceKidZero,2015-10-20T14:33:22Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
3phds2,"For me it definitely took a while.  The books start slow, explain lots of background that a new reader wouldn't be interested in, and generally aren't jam packed with action or interesting material (SO MUCH WALKING).  That being said, once I got a few hundred pages into the LOTR trilogy, the lore became common knowledge and the quality of the story and characters began to shine.  I know its not ideal to hear ""just keep reading for a few hundred pages and eventually you'll like it,"" but I think that if you make it through the slow setup chapters you might end up enjoying it more than you expected.  

I like to think of the LOTR trilogy as a single 1000+ page story, with a VERY LONG beginning, middle and end, rather than 3 shorter stories, each with its own beginning, middle, and end.  That helps put the rather boring first 200+ pages into perspective for me.

I also think reading the Hobbit after LOTR makes the former more interesting - Bilbo isn't a huge character in LOTR, so knowing about his story is kinda irrelevant.  Sure the background on the ring is helpful, but it doesn't really impact the story very much.  Knowing what happens to the ring before reading the Hobbit, on the other hand, made me VERY interested in learning the backstory.",,2015-10-20T15:27:31Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3phds2,"I'm late to the party here but still want to provide my advice (because you know, internet). But in all honesty I think I can help. I've been a Tolkien fan since I was young. I had the Hobbit read to me from an early age, I've then read it myself multiple times (including reading it to my daughters). I've also read the LOTR books at least a couple times each. On top of this I listened to a very good version of the book on tape for the Hobbit back when I was a kid, many times, many many times. 

The Hobbit is by far the hardest to get into, but once it gets going it really doesn't stop. My recommendation to you is this, if you can't get into the actual book try listening to an audio version of it, look around and find a quality version though, I recommend either NPR's or BBC's version of the Hobbit from back in the 70's or 80's. 

When it comes to the movies, I can almost agree that the LoTR movies are worth watching, the same however cannot be said about the Hobbit movies. Peter Jackson and whoever threw that crap together should be ashamed of what they did to the Hobbit. Just because you did a great job with the LoTR movies doesn't make you innocent from raping a great book with those horrible movies you just put out.

3phds2,"When I was a kid, I remember how off-putting I found the cutesy beginning of the Hobbit. Ugh. 

Because of that, I never read the books. Once I realized the movies were coming out, I decided to wait til after I've seen them before attempting to read the books. 

I think one of the things that makes Tolkien problematic as an author is that he was a linguist and scholar first, storyteller second. This mostly means that the formal structure of the work he creates is as important to the story as the story itself. 

The cutesy tone of The Hobbit really turns me off, but if I can ever once get into it, I do enjoy the story, despite all those dwarf names repeated in sequence far too often. It's a series of fairy tales strung together, which makes the various bits of it a bit more approachable than LOTR, but again, the cutesy tone (and a writing style that seems out dated to me) really interfere with the work, if you ask me. 

LOTR? Stylistically, it's written in the form of an epic. Yeah, ancient Greek poetical styling and heroic/epic story styles applied to a modern English novel. I can appreciate what he's created even as I think the formal structural elements get in the way. I understand what he was trying to create, even as it annoys me. 

Neither one is anything I reach for casually, and no, I won't ever be reading the Simarillion or anything else Tolkien wrote without a really good reason. 

For what it's worth, I have all the movies on extended version dvd and really enjoy them (even if the same stylistic elements that annoyed me in The Hobbit still annoy me in the films.)

Find something else to enjoy and try to let go of the idea that you 'must' work your way through this stuff. 

As much as I might admire, say, Don Quixote, The Count of Monte Cristo, or Moby Dick, they aren't books I've reached for to re-read, and 
that's fine with me. Studying them taught me some useful stuff about literary whatevers, and I'm probably more articulate because of it, but that doesn't mean I need to struggle through hefty novels in my free time. 

So long as your reading comprehension levels are where you want them to be, don't sweat it. There are tons of good stories out there just waiting to be read.

I will suggest it doesn't make sense to start with *The Hobbit*, because it is really meant to be a children's book. And LOTR starts slowly: it wasn't a mistake to cut Tom Bombadil from the movies, as much as some people love him. 

Who knows? If OP does, say, skip a bunch of the beginning and get more into the action, he/she might end up loving it, and go back to read it all over.

6l42q0,"Short answer: No.

*The Lord of the Rings* was intended to be a sequel to *The Hobbit*, but as Tolkien was writing the story it sort of took on a life of it's own and became it's own thing. /u/CrispedMarshyMeldoze compared it to Star Wars, but I don't think that's right because Star Wars is a series and each of the films tie into the film preceding and suceeding it. *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* take place in the same universe and share many of the same characters, but they aren't a directly connected story. Furthermore, *The Hobbit* is a children's book and while it's very well written and fun to read, it's not on the same level as LOTR.


If you want any sort of literary companion to *The Lord of the Rings*, I recommend *The Silmarillion*. It was published 40 years after LOTR in 1977 by Christopher Tolkien (JRR Tolkien died in 1973) but it was written sporadically between 1916 and the 1950s and is an collection of short stories that describe the universe that JRR Tolkien created for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* in detail.

Before chapter 1 in LOTR the essential parts of the hobbit are covered -- if you don't read the Hobbit you HAVE to read that - but that alone is fine. Now, like I said reading the Hobbit may help your enjoyment of LOTR to a degree, especially where one particular 'baddie' character is concerned, BUT the books are on two completely different levels. LOTR is a godlike masterpiece, one of the greatest things ever written. The Hobbit is a pretty good kid's book -- I wouldn't be shocked it it could possibly even dampen your ardour for LOTR as you could start think 'huh what is all the fuss about?'

11rze37,"There's SO MUCH humor and sarcasm in LOTR - but nobody ever mentions it! Tolkien is a really funny guy!

I love the passive-aggressive Hobbits. Bilbo's gifts to his relatives are hilarious and cutting.

Gandalf is so snarky too, especially toward Pippin. He dunks on Pippin constantly and it's always funny.

Even the elves have a lot of humor. Elrond makes so many snide little comments at Bilbo during the Council scene. You can tell he's fed up with this Hobbit who has way overstayed his welcome, keeps eating all the food, and keeps making everyone come listen to his amateur slam poetry.

I also loved the opening chapters of Fellowship. It made me feel like I had lived in Hobbiton for years and I knew all the hot Hobbit gossip.

Early 20s, raised on street dialects with a combo of Chicano gangs and surfer slang in the 1960s. Dirt poor suburb with a combo of Polish, German, and Japanese families. My only input about how to be with adults was getting yelled at for doing something wrong, and just shutting down.

I read the Hobbit and was absolutely floored that the dwarves absolutely meant it when they said, ""At your service!"", and bowed. 

I bought and finished LOTR the same week. Then reread all four the next week. The third week, I gave notice Tuesday, bought an airline ticket to Seattle, and landed there at midnight on Friday night. A month later I was in Alaska and stayed there for more than a year.

11rze37,"A few things that blew my mind when I learned it recently and reread the books:

- Gandalf fights ALL NINE of the ringwraiths on Weathertop *at the same time* a few days before Frodo Aragorn and co get there. They see lightning/lights from afar and wonder what it is, and Tolkein doesn't explicitly tell us what it is, but then Gandalf says later on during the council of Elrond that he encountered them. Fucking badass!

- Glorfindel is a stupendous badass himself, and while I understand why he was swapped for Arwen to make the movie less of a sausagefest, they really did him dirty writing him out of the movies. This guy is such a badass mofo that he was camped out on the bridge to Rivendell a few days before meeting up with Frodo and carrying him to safety in the flight to the ford. While he was there, three ringwraiths came up to the bridge as advance scouts, saw him there, and they just noped the fuck out. Let that sink in.

- Frodo and the hobbits get magic knives made by Numenor I think? in the Barrow Downs in that weird chapter when Tom Bombadil saves them from the barrow wights. They were specifically made to fight the undead I think, and the armies of the Witch King of Angmar when he waged war on them a thousand years before the events of LOTR. In the battle of pellenor fields, Merry stabs the Witch King in the knee with that magic knife, which is what allows Eowyn to deal the killing blow. Full circle, knives introduced early in FOTR and then used at the end of ROTK. 

- Bonus fact about the Witch King: that prophecy about how no man can kill him was spoken (and slightly misquoted) by Glorfindel, badass as he is, after that war a thousand years ago. When his armies were defeated the Witch King fled and Glorfindel say nah, let him go, he's done here, and not by the hand of man will he be defeated. The witch king heard about this and interprets it to mean he's invincible. Eowyn hears this and thinks it means she can kill him because she's a woman. Turns out it was the tag teaming woman and hobbit with an ancient magic knife that takes him out.

The army logistics, sizes, equipment, and travel times are realistic. The tactics are realistic. Sauron isn't just an evil wizard unleashing countless hordes of orcs; he executes an actual coordinated military campaign, carefully probes his enemies' defenses, and reasonably adjusts his strategies in response to new information. 

Hell, even the soldiers' psychology is realistic and ahead of its time, with Tolkein using each of the Hobbits to explore a different way war can affect someone. Some people are broken by it through no fault of their own (Frodo). Some are scarred and forever changed by the experience, but manage to go on and live a happy, fulfilling life--though you're unlikely to hear them telling fun war stories (Sam). And some people manage to come out the other side better and stronger than ever, with no deep scars (physical or psychological) to speak of (Merry and Pippin).

Lots of people get bogged down in Bombadil: the hobbits fall asleep a lot and so do some of the readers. I love that section, but I understand why it's hard for first-time readers. It's very important thematically, but not for the plot, which means you can still understand what's going on in the story if you miss it. So rather than skip the whole book, skip Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, and start with when the hobbits arrive at Bree.

The Kindle eBook that has all three of the LotR books is okay, but has weird confusing formatting shit going on with the footnotes. I recommend skipping all footnotes if you're using that particular version for a first read - mostly they aren't vital enough to be worth the headache. If you want the footnotes to actually be usable (or if you want to constantly refer to the maps or the pronunciation guide at the end of the book), I suggest getting some cheap paperbacks and reading those instead. It's easier to flit back and forth between the story and the maps and whatnot.

You can skip all the prologues and appendices on your first read, unless you decide you want more at the end - they are mostly there for turbonerds who want bonus lore delivered directly into their bloodstream, or who want to take a calligraphy pen and put elf-runes all over everything they own (read: teenage me).",bigmcstrongmuscle,2023-03-16T19:12:13Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

epxaj,"All that you really need to know about the Hobbit can be summed up in a couple of brief sentences:   
Bilbo Baggins left his comfortable home in the company of 13 dwarfs to go off on an adventure. He was not exactly a willing participant, but along the way he decided to make the best of it. He picked up a magic sword that glows blue when Orcs are around, and a magic ring that made him invisible. Eventually they reached their target, a dragon's den, the dragon was killed, and a big battle was fought. Bilbo went home very, very rich.   
   
There, now you can start in on the really good stuff. Be aware that the tone of the Lord of the Rings trilogy changes a lot from one book to the next, because Tolkein wrote them over quite an extended period of time and his style often reflected what was happening in his life at the time. Fellowship is long, sprawling, almost lazy storytelling. There is a lot of content you can skim through if you start getting bored with the poetry and songs, although you may enjoy that aspect. The action starts picking up about halfway through, then there's a bit of a lull again before the end.   
   
The Two Towers is almost entirely action, all the way through. I find it some of the most compelling reading of the series, especially the introduction of the Riders of Rohan and the development of Gollum as a character.   
The Return of the King is, in my opinion, the masterpiece of the set. There are sequences that make the hairs on my arms stand up when I read them. The mustering of the Rohirrim, the battle of Gondor, Sam & Frodo's trudge through the wastelands of Mordor, the Scouring of the Shire... I fucking love these books.

I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.

5dpzfx,"Yeah, this is a key differentiator between his fiction and that of his close friend C. S. Lewis.  Both were religious individuals and their Christianity doubtlessly influenced their work, but you could go so far as to say that Middle Earth in its various incarnations was a reaction to the fact that Tolkien felt that there was no body of Anglo-Saxon lore which had persisted through to the modern day, as it had been overwhelmed by centuries of Christian European culture.

He was consciously trying to create an ethno-national story where yeoman farmers, the salt of the earth, were the heroes of a post-heroic age.  The era of direct intervention by the divine is already lost in the mists of time by the Third Age, so any direct parallel to the Old Testament misses the fact that the Third Age is analogous to a much more modern period in time, if there was a ""Hobbit Moses"" he lived in the First Age.

The Hobbits aren't Jewish, they're English common people and the lore of Middle Earth has a lot of parallels to other aspects of North and West Germanic poems and sagas (hint: There are a lot more elves and dwarves -- and all knowing father figures with beards, strange relationships with birds, and funny hats -- in Northwestern European mythology than there are in the Bible).  But even to draw a direct parallel to Germanic myth is to find patterns which Tolkien certainly didn't intend.

Bilbo (and Frodo) are supposed to represent the humbleness and basic goodness of a mythical English yeoman farmer not biblical prophets.  They're notable because they're so normal, not because they're in any way ""chosen"" people.  The Hobbits are distinctly simple people with simple desires and simple pleasures of family, friends, food, drink, and music.  All very wholesome and mundane things that the average reader can relate to.  Gandalf remarks on this on many occasions, especially in Fellowship, and he is constantly pleased and even surprised at their persistence and good nature in the face of peril.  What's notable about the Fellowship itself is that Frodo is in some ways the least remarkable member of the group and the Hobbits as a race are so diminutive and unimpressive that they can pass without notice into the heart of the enemy's camp.  Only the goodness of their hearts and love of each other protects them from the dangers that they face.

Bilbo is less fully developed in this regard, but it's clear that in Tolkien's final conception of the Hobbits bears little resemblance to the Hebrews and certainly not prophets endowed with a special relationship with the Almighty.",Garfield_M_Obama,2016-11-19T04:34:14Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

5dpzfx,"You're right that Tolkien wasn't trying to tell Bible stories allegorically in LOTR, and that he drew more upon Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture than Jewish culture. However, Tolkien certainly was influenced by his Christian faith, though more on the level of his thematic and moral vision than in specific references or allegories. I think if you asked Tolkien whether his valorization of the humble, simple hobbits was related to the Christian virtue of humility, he'd respond in the affirmative. The hobbits' simplicity, at least in Tolkien's mind, didn't necessarily contrast with Biblical ideas of prophets or chosen people; in fact, the Bible tied humility and God's special election together (cf. Deuteronomy 7:6-7 “For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples."").",hwqqlll,2016-11-21T14:48:22Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Certain characters were left out while others were given a more prominent role and some significant events were cut or re-ordered to fit the movie format batter but overall Jackson did a great job with them. The Hobbit movies, on the other hand, are a complete mess compared to the book. They stretched and played with the source material too much for them to be anything more than average.

6s5lmf,"> Many people call them the greatest fantasy epics of all time, while I've seen others call them convoluted and difficult to read. 

I don't think those are mutually exclusive :) 

Keep in mind that Tolkien wrote ""The Hobbit"" for children / young adults, and he wrote LotR for adults. The two have very different tones, the trilogy is much darker.

And somewhere about halfway through the second book (""The Two Towers"") you're probably going to want to chuck it in, 'cause  things slow to a crawl as the storm slowly gathers energy. But keep plowing ahead, the payoff is worth it.

It might be easier if you have a copy of something like ""Complete Guide to Middle-Earth"" handy, as JRR tends to throw out references to ancient kings/queens/elves/forests/rivers/aliens/whatevers, so it can be useful to have a reference for those ""WTF is he talking about?"" moments.",,2017-08-07T14:23:51Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Your understanding grows slowly, with theirs.

Other writers would insert tedious backstories explaining these details as the story unfolds.  Tolkien doesn't.

6s5lmf,"I disagree with the two movies part - there's no way The Hobbit could have been told adequately with just one movie. The Hobbit is a short book because it races from one adventure to the next, without developing any of the locations or characters (save Bilbo); half of the Dwarves don't even speak! Bard shows up like two pages before he kills Smaug and has little description other than ""grim."" Gandalf rides off in the middle of the book and returns  only at the end, his disappearance handwaved away; the final battle is told rather than shown because Bilbo gets knocked out at the beginning.

All of the above is acceptable for a children's book, but it doesn't work when you're asking a movie audience to care about thirteen Dwarves. Especially an audience coming straight from a hugely successful trilogy about the ""Necromancer"" Gandalf dealt with during his disappearance, in which there were numerous fan-favorite characters who are expected to be included in The Hobbit, and in which there's tons of information about Middle-earth/its inhabitants that didn't even exist when The Hobbit was written. There's no chance Peter Jackson could have done justice to the book/universe with a single movie rushing through the Shire, Rivendell, Beorn's cabin, Mirkwood, Laketown, and Erebor, all while trying to make the characters (i.e. thirteen Dwarves) stand out enough for audiences to care if they succeeded or failed in their mission.

7r783m,"I read The Hobbit when I was 7 and the Lord of the Rings when I was 9 or so: that was my starting point.

They were a fantastic gateway for reading and the fantasy genre, but I think that if Harry Potter had been around at the time, it would have been a better starting point: 

It's more accessible for kids, has a more modern voice/context, and they're more likely to encounter friends at their age who have also read the books, due to the popularization of the series. It's also probably more of a reading-in-general gateway instead of a fantasy-specific one.

The gradual increase in length and complexity of storylines is also fantastic for a child whose reading level will increase over time.

I'd also say that reading Lord of the Rings that early might be a bit of a mistake: I think I'd have enjoyed it more (and been more willing to revisit the series later) if I'd waited until a later age. My reaction to some of the more long-winded, verbose descriptions etc was that they were quite tiring to slog through for me at that point of my life.

So: go with Harry Potter. But if they're ravenous to expand their reading, the hobbit would be a great second step.

As for who is better:

Tolkien is far more original, but Rowling's basically top of the game for the specific thing she did: accessible fantasy that reaches the broadest audience possible while still retaining a level of flavour.

It's like comparing the invention of the lightbulb to a cheap energy efficient light bulb today: one is a more astounding accomplishment, but the other lets you appreciate how far we've come etc. I'd definitely use the latter, but comparing it to the originality of the literal orginal is a bit meaningless :)

The Lord of the Rings is a book of heroics.  There’s a threat to the world, and we need to stand up to it, and these little folks who seem so harmless are going to be the key to making it work.  There’s the sense is that, even if they don’t make it, even if they die in the attempt, it’s an attempt that *must* be made, and that even those deaths would be heroic.  

There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but compare that to the Hobbit.  There is this almost constant sense that our heroes could die forgotten and alone in a cave or a forest.  No one would praise their glory; very few would recognize the loss of the protagonist.  He isn’t given some intrinsic value because he’s a key player in saving the world; he’s not rising to an occasion that demands success or catastrophic failure for the whole of creation.  He is discovering his value, and discovering what he’s capable of purely out of a sense of adventure and comraderie.

j46e4t,"I don't think it's as unpopular as you might think. At the moment, I favour The Hobbit above TLOTR, but that's based on one read through each. I'm prepared for my opinions to change when I do a re-read because I've heard that TLOTR is the type of book that readers typically  appreciate and love much more upon the second read. 

My reasons for loving The Hobbit more than TLOTR are similar to yours. I found it to be more consistently adventure-packed and fun, in comparison to TLOTR which is very slow in places (particularly the beginning of TFOTR, it took me about 5-10 attempts to read that book before I finally finished it). The Hobbit also has more charm, whimsy and laughter in comparison to TLOTR which is much darker in tone. Like you, I also adore Bilbo as a protagonist. He's relatable, funny, brave, endearing and his character arc is brilliant. Ironically, despite being a children's book, I think The Hobbit appeals much more to adults because of Bilbo. He's the type of character that a lot of adults can relate to. His life is built on routine, stability and comfort but underneath it all some small part of him craves adventure, despite being afraid to actually pursue it. It's a feeling that a lot of adults who are trapped in mundane daily lives can relate to. I related to Bilbo a lot because of this and consequently, I was more invested in him. Although a lot of the heroic acts he accomplished, happened by chance, luck or with the help of others, he felt like a proactive rather than passive protagonist. In TLOTR, I felt like most of the main characters were passive. They just went along with what was happening because that's what ""good guys"" do. 

It'll be interesting to see if my perception changes when I read TLOTR again, but at the moment, I'm firmly with you in the ""I prefer The Hobbit to TLOTR"" crew.",its_the_stars,2020-10-03T09:35:15Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I'll object to this:

>  If you look at Lord of the Rings, there’s constant allegory (even if Tolkien denied it): Sauron is Hitler; Saruman is Mussolini; the Dead Marshes are symbolic of Tolkien’s time in the trenches of The Somme, etc. etc.

Just because readers imagine that something is supposed to be inspired by something else doesn't mean that the author was so inspired.  There are innumerable reviews of LoTR which say the Ring is an allegory for nuclear weapons, which is flatly impossible because Tolkien had the backstory and lore for that written before nukes were invented.

CS Lewis wrote an essay once about how so many reviews of his books weren't just critiques of the writing and dialogue and plot but instead included lots of guesses by the reviewer about what Lewis was really thinking when he was writing it.  He was inspired by this, or he was thinking of that, or this is an allegory for the other thing.  As of the time of writing of the essay, Lewis could not remember a single time any of those guesses had ever been correct.

That someone reads LoTR and says ""This evil character reminds me of that real-life evil guy"" is all well and good, but that doesn't mean it was intentional allegory, and people should really stop writing such stuff.",CaveatAuditor,2020-10-03T02:11:27Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

the author basically said: ""Tolkien said there wasn't any direct, intentional allegory, but for some reason I'll say he is a liar because i don't have enough imagination to think of something else than pure allegories. And thinking of allegories doesn't make me enjoy the story, therefore it doesn't give me any joy and it's bad.""

The key is here. If you stop trying, by any mean, to see allegories everywhere, you'll start enjoying things more. You'll find joy in LOTR as much as in the Hobbit, as intended. The author of that article is the one blocking himself from finding joy.",Wanderer_Falki,2020-10-03T15:40:36Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

7l1j1e,"I'd like to offer a bit of an alternate comparison.

The Hobbit is a book that Tolkien sincerely wanted to write. He was always one for fairy-tales and folk-stories, and The Hobbit is exactly that. In it, he managed to mix many ideas from many mythologies, taking stories from across Europe and putting them in one relaxing read.

The Lord of the Rings, in contrast, is a book he never wanted to write. 

It is not a folk-tale, and it is not a romance. It is grounded in European literary history, of course, but in a much smaller way than Tolkien wanted. Even in language, it seems to be half-way between the dialogue-esque tone of the Hobbit and the King James poetry of Silmarillion, the book Tolkien had wholeheartedly wanted.

The Lord of the Rings is an excellent book I recommend to anyone, and is one of my favourites. But, in all honesty, it is a compromise work, and Tolkien has always treated it as such.

I read LoTR for the 3rd time this past summer, the first being about 12 years ago and the 2nd probably 7 years ago or so.

With every re-read, I find myself enjoying it even more. Though I used to find The Fellowship a bit dull, and pained through the travel portions the first time I read it, I found myself enjoying these so much more now.

I don't know if it's because I am simply older, or if it's because I am a more experienced reader than I was then, or both, but I am actually looking forward to reading them again in a few years.

5s9wgk,"Eh.  I'm glad you liked it, but there are plenty of stories that have valuable lessons and themes that are also engaging.  I'm not against any teacher teaching this book, and I'm sure plenty have.  But I don't see any overwhelming reasons to make it a standard part of the curriculum.  

One thing The Hobbit lacks is a definite historical context.  Take To Kill A Mockingbird as an example.  It has many of the themes you mention in The Hobbit, and it also has valuable historical lessons.  The social and cultural context of To Kill a Mockingbird is just as important as its values of kindness and acceptance.  Not all books taught in schools have the historical context, and i won't pretend that even the ones that do pull it off well.  But I think it's an important factor when choosing books for a curriculum.  

And while the deeper themes of The Hobbit are universal, I question how relatable the characters and plot would be to a wider, mainstream audience.  It's a largely male-driven and fantasy-based story that many kids won't have an interest in.  Obviously you can say a lot of books currently taught aren't interesting to kids.  I still think it makes The Hobbit a not great pick for curriculum. 

I think your analysis of The Hobbit is good and accurate, and again, it's nice that it had a positive effect on you.

Many students do end up reading the hobbit.  Alas, I fear its widespread adoption is unlikely.  One reason is the wide-spread adoption of YA ""literature.""  Hobbit, and other ""old"" novels, do not fit well into the marketing and/or social goals of the companies that have created the ""YA"" genre.  Quality and educational value are irrelevant -marketability is key.

Another reason is that school teachers are shockingly resistant to science fiction and fantasy literature.  As a teacher myself, this was one of the most surprising aspects of the jobs.  Teachers consider themselves independent thinkers and like to talk about outside the box ideas.  In reality, they are very cliquish and like to be validated.

1vfs2y,"Made an account just to respond, so factor that in to my opinion. 

I would very much recommend the books if you at all like fantasy or Tolkien. Martin and Tolkien's styles are quite different. 

I've read The Hobbit and LOTR trilogy, as well as all the ASOIAF books. I consider Martin's writing to be far superior (though obviously owing Tolkien a great deal in heritage of ideas). 

Generally I find Martin to be faster-paced, more interesting. 

I strongly disagree with some comments saying that if you don't like Tolkien you won't like Martin. I got through LOTR trilogy out of a sense of obligation to read a seminal work of fantasy. I got through ASOIAF so far because I literally couldn't put it down. 

Would also like to chime in on the ""slowness"" comments. Don't want to spoil but quite often when I discuss with friends who've read all 5 of the available ASOIAF books, moments that I dismissed as ""slow"" or ""filler"" contain very subtle hints and background information that you NEED to fully appreciate the political machinations and history of the characters involved. 

tl;dr  Yes give them a shot if you at all enjoy fantasy. ""Slow"" parts are deceptively not salient until they really are. ",,2014-01-17T19:36:20Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

So when I started in Game of Thrones, I didn't expect to like it, but I do. He's just a damn good writer, with an enormous vocabulary, the ability to create a gigantic cast of believable characters, a great knack for storytelling (not even plot as much as narration). The book switches perspective in each chapter which really helps it from getting too dull. 

Yes, the language can get a bit overly epic, and if I never see the phrase ""boiled leather"" or ""a man grown"" again for as long as I live, I'll die a happy man.

I read The Hobbit through Return of the King, and about a 3/4 of the way through return of the king, i hit an elf song, or a three page musing on how a tree looked and hung it up for good.

For ASOIAF I watched all three seasons first, then read the books. They are amazing, however like the cliche, there are no happy endings.   Then you'll be mad at the show for what they skip or gloss over. GRRM focuses a lot on what kind of food they eat a lot, and I have no idea what boiled leather is, but everyone and everything is wearing it.

I highly recommend reading them, they aren't boring like Tolkien. Every now and then you'll hit a [Book 1 Spoiler](/s ""Bran chapter and wish he'd died falling out of that window."")

Structurally, they jump from one character to the next, generally with events happening in relation to each other. Except for book four and five.

It took me two goes to finish reading the Hobbit (although I was 12 the first time, then loved it at 14), and I've read almost all of the LOTR (got busy and stopped reading the 3rd quarter-way through, and then started reading another book, and another... one day though...). 

I devoured the ASOIAF series, and since finishing the fifth shortly after it came out I've been anxiously awaiting the sixth. I think it strikes a great balance between action, dialogue and description—except when it comes to feasts, GRRM seems to love describing food. To me, GRRM does a really good job of weaving a complex story line in an understandable way. One of my friends said she had trouble keeping track of the characters, there are a lot of people that come and go (often violently). I personally didn't have a problem with that. I did sometimes get depressed reading the books though, like, the Red Wedding made me stop reading the third book for a few weeks I was so upset. I see that a lot of people think they're drawn out.

e2owgp,"Sam's name literally means ""halfwit"" but he turns out to be one of the wisest and bravest characters in the LOTR universe.  He doesn't lack courage or intelligence or charisma, but he severely lacks self confidence.

When one of the hobbits had to invoke a half forgotten bit of lore, especially Elvenlore, it was Sam.  He had drunk deep from the fountain of Bilbo's wisdom and remembered more than he let on.  He also had a better memory than his master and quickly became the moral center of the group as Frodo's will begam to fade under the pressure of the Ring.

As for his feats, besides the obvious fight against Shelob, he has quite a few.

Two hobbits in history successfully used Elven magic.  Frodo is one, Sam is the other.  They did it together, invoking Elbereth to break the will of the Watchers and escape Cirith Ungol.  Sam also used Galadriel's gift to heal the Shire

3 characters are known to have successfully used the singing magic.  Tom Bombadil, his wife Goldberry -- and Sam, searching for Frodo in Cirith Ungol

Sam is the only creature in the entire history of the Ring to possess it, use it, then give it up willingly and without assistance.  Even Galdalf feared that trial.  That and his use of Galadriel's light proves that Sam's willpower is absolutely enormous.

Sam was also the leader of the team from the moment he rescued Frodo from the tower until the moment the Ring was destroyed.  He planned the moves, he prepared the strategies that would allow them to evade the Eye

Sam was also the physically strongest of the 4 Hobbits, had the greatest endurance, and had far more cunning and guile than he gave himself credit for.  Frodo gets nowhere near the Mountain unspotted without specifically Sam with him.  Neither Merry nor Pippin could have, at the end of their own strength, picked up Frodo and carried him the last few hundred yards to the goal.  

Merry was the bravest of the 4 and probably the smartest, Pippin was young but did great things through his compassion and charisma, but Sam was the superstar of the whole tale in my mind.

My favorite Sam scene happened (in the book) at the beginning of Two Towers, when he managed to correctly guess Frodo's intentions and throw himself into the river to force Frodo to rescue him and take him along.

Did I mention that Sam can't swim?",,2019-11-28T00:42:53Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
e2owgp,"Tolkien was commenting on the whole heroic, kingship aspect of the sagas as has been pointed out, but he was very much commenting on britain in the world war, and what was worth fighting for. I agree that the heroes are the hobbits, and the endgame is life in the shires. Yes, what he was also saying was that it is ordinary people who win the war, not heroes, at least not just heroes. 
To me the key mood of the saga is that the shire is his idea of heaven, and what ordinary men gave their lives for. 
Whenever he describes the shire i have a ear image of the pretty, idyllic, but dull villages in Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire. Also the cut and thrust of academic life in those universities. Also uber dull unless you are arguing over some recondite academic point, brewing your own beer and trudging the many public footpaths in the area. 
His is a quintessentially English view of nirvana. He is expressing his distrust of raw power as infinitely corruptible.

e2owgp,"The first time I tried to read Fellowship I also found it pretty dull. First time, I didn't even get through the Party. Now, having read the entire saga multiple times, I find it charming, but at the time I found it boring and pointless.

I'm going to give my second suggestion first, because that's the one I hope you'll follow.

Read only a small amount in one setting. Make sure you're somewhere free from distractions, in your 'ideal' reading space (whether that's a dark bedroom, a cozy living room with a roaring fire, or a park next to a lake), clear your mind, focus on what you know about the setting and the characters, and read just one chapter. Really try to imagine it. Even if it's a bit dull (as the Party absolutely is--it deals with *Hobbits*, the only creatures in Middle-Earth more boring that humans), you can get through one chapter. And maybe you'll gain a little appreciation for what their lives are like.

My Other Suggestion:

A lot of people would probably want me tarred and feathered for recommending this, but one thing that might be helpful *solely to get you engaged with the story and past the parts that currently bore you* would be to actually skip a bit. Look up some chapter synopses or something, and skip to the next good part.

**DON'T** make a habit of this, or do it through the entire series, because you'll miss tons of things by reading that way on a regular basis. Novels should, in general, be enjoyed beginning to end. But just to help you get through the first section (""Book I"") of *Fellowship*, it might not be a bad idea. Some of it is painfully slow for someone who isn't terribly invested in the world and Tolkien's writing style.

If you find yourself still skipping things in Book II (that's the second half of *Fellowship*; each volume is split into two 'books'), it's time to stop skipping. In fact, at that point, it might be time to take a break, then go back and read what you skipped. If you can't do this, well... not everyone enjoys the same things. You might simply be someone who doesn't enjoy Tolkien's writing style. I always find that sad, but it's true. Like I said, not everyone likes the same things. But I'd still recommend that you make an effort to read the entire thing. View the non-action-scenes as the tendons holding the body together.

The bones are the lore and world-building; things that aren't explicitly stated, but that exist in the background. (There's some detail about stuff like that in the Appendix, and far more in Tolkien's posthumously-published works.) The action scenes, and major dialogue, like the meeting with Strider and the Council? Those are the muscle; they move things; they cause things to happen. The rest of the book, the getting-from-here-to-there, is the connecting tissue. The muscles fall right off the bones without it. And considering that the subtitle to *The Hobbit* is ""There and Back Again"", Tolkien was quite aware of how important getting from here to there is to this type of epic tale.",morostheSophist,2019-11-28T07:19:51Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

e2owgp,"The overarching point that Tolkien was making in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* is that we lionize a lot of stuff that we shouldn't, and the world's a horrible place as a result. The thesis is stated pretty baldly by Thorim in *The Hobbit* -- ""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world"" -- and then Tolkien drives it home relentlessly in LOTR. 

LOTR sets up a whole bunch of characters who are recognizable archetypes in classic literature. You've got Aragorn (the mysterious figure of great destiny), Gandalf (basically a demigod), Theoden (a good and honorable king), Boromir/Faramir/Eomer (great warriors and trained from birth to be leaders), Eowyn (the unconventional fighter who will take great risks to prove herself), and the elves (figures of tremendous power and insight). In the end, Sauron doesn't go down because of any of these people: He dies because of two little hobbits he never thought had the capacity to be a threat. The greatest evil in Middle Earth was defeated because Frodo wanted to do the right thing and Sam wanted to be a good friend. In that vein, you can argue that LOTR is actually a *deconstruction* of the ancient epics that Tolkien spent so much of his academic life studying.

So his fiction is basically a WWI vet shaking the reader by the shoulders and screaming that there is nothing about war or wealth or power that is glorious.

And yet, in the real world, it takes power to defeat evil, and it takes good people to take up power, and use it, to defeat evil.  Unfortunately, the primary means of defeating evil in LOTR was to destroy the means of power, but this is not such a good message.  It is an avoidance of the real struggle between good and evil in all of us, and in our world, which is that doing great good requires the same power that is required to do great evil, and doing one and not the other is incredibly difficult.

Do you remember when Treebeard found Isengard, got sad about all the trees being cut, and called all the Ents out to wreck stuff?
From the film's internal logic and storytelling, this is fine.  It gets a dramatic moment in and is all very well done.

From my perspective as a book reader, I'm primarily seeing the entire Ent race being dumbed down to make it as obvious as possible that Merry and Pippin are the reason Saruman’s main base was taken out.
For anyone who didn’t read the book, the Ents were well aware of what Saruman was up to.  Not all the details, but they certainly knew about the tree cutting.  They were already considering that something needed to be done, but these are incredibly patient creatures which are used to seeing their precious trees assaulted by the uncaring lesser races.  Merry and Pippin were the pebbles that started the avalanche (Gandalf’s words, I think) by providing just enough new information at the right time for Treebeard to call an Entmoot and formally get a declaration of war from all the Ents against Saruman.

Did the filmmakers think this was too complicated for their audience to understand?  Did they think Pippin and Merry were being too passive?  Whatever their reasoning, they chose to have the Ents completely unaware of things going on in their own forest.  Treebeard had to be ‘tricked’ into going near enough to see what was happening there.  The filmmakers then discard the alien patience that practically defines the Ent outlook on the world in favor of an immediate attack because spending time on a second Entmoot to discuss this new turn of events just wouldn’t be good moviemaking.

Aaand just to get extremely petty about it, the filmmakers also completely failed to deliver on the absolute whirlwind of destruction that the angry Ents were when properly roused.  I was really looking forward to seeing that scene brought to life but got the standard, lumbering stereotype that is typically given to larger creatures.  I just dug up both versions to see if my memory was out of line.  Book rampage has the Ents making so much noise they are shattering stone, the hobbits had to cower on the ground stuffing their cloaks in their ears.  Movie rampage has fun scenes of the hobbits throwing rocks at orcs because of course the main characters must be in every scene.  Bah.

So that’s just one scene.  Now multiply that across all three films (third being the worst, first being mostly forgivable) and you should get an idea why I deeply dislike them.   I keep seeing changes that make the story and characters worse instead of better.  I understand that changes are necessary when adapting books to film, but there should be an effort to keep the spirit of a character or an event intact.

Well, this is a new one for the dumpster bin.

I understand the ideas behind this article well enough, but it seems to me like the writer just hates LotR to an unreasonable degree. There is a point to be made for the harmful trend of world building replacing plot, but using Lord of the Rings to explain why it's bad is just... not good. Lord of the Rings captivated people because it was well written, and made the reader want to know more about what else was in the book.

64khzr,"This article seems to me to be a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's true that there are serious flaws with the Hobbit movies and they stem from the need to divert the story just about every time the original plot starts moving (although I do think it's unfair to criticize the 'clomping foot of nerdism' with no mention of anything like a corporate desire to stretch one fairly short novel into three long movies to sell more tickets).  On the other hand I think it's pretty clear that the author doesn't understand what makes Tolkien different from a number of his imitators.  For example:

>The Silmarillion[] takes nerdism to its logical conclusion: a gigantic collection of myths and legends, with no central ‘plot’ as such, which comprehensively explains the history of Middle Earth.

While it's true that the Silmarillion is a collection of myths and legends without a strong central plot the point really isn't about explaining the history of Middle Earth.  The Silmarillion is really about explaining the logic of Middle Earth and the ways in which it functions, because it doesn't function like our universe does now.  That's part of why the Silmarillion is very different from something like the Star Wars expanded universe guides or the recent Game of Thrones Westeros encyclopedia.  

So it's not a very good article and doesn't really add anything to the discussion that anyone interested wasn't already aware of.  The short essay by M. John Harrison that is referenced in the article is much better and anyone interested should check it out.",,2017-04-10T17:06:07Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

64khzr,"I feel like the author leaves out a lot of facts for the sake of formfitting Tolkein's works to his premise. I do think the Hobbit movies suffered from overstuffing, but that related more to the studio wanting three movies to squeeze cash out of, as well as Jackson's weird impulse to try and link the Hobbit to LOTR, even though in my opinion the fact that Gollum's ring is regarded as a curious trinket in the Hobbit and goes on to be the fulcrum upon which LOTR pivots such a cool concept and was very mindblowing for ten year-old me when I found out there even was a sequel to the Hobbit.

I do think there's a tendency in modern pop culture to overexplain things and modern audiences are treated as though they won't accept a story that is thoroughly contextualized and made plausible (either by framing it in the real world or by laying out in-house rules), but I really wouldn't say it's the Lord of the Rings' fault just because it's a successful example of the thing the author doesn't like.",Jazz_Fart,2017-04-10T23:44:20Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

50bhq0,"The Silmarillion wasn't something Tolkien ever really ""finished"" as a coherent work. His son Christopher went through all the various things JRR had written about Middle-Earth (some as far back as 1917), tied it all together as best he could, and published it. So some of it reads like very dry history, some like mythical allegory, and some of it approaches the storytelling you're familiar with. So it isn't an easy read, at all. But if you want to understand how Middle-Earth got to where we find it in The Hobbit, then the information is there. 
 
Christopher Tolkien went on to publish ten volumes of his father's papers, showing the path that JRR took to reach the final version of his stories, and how Christopher pulled all of this together to construct The Silmarillion. The interesting thing is that he was under a considerable amount of pressure from the publisher and public to put the book out in the mid-70s, and believes he would have done it differently given more time.

50bhq0,"I had this problem with A Feast For Crows, in fact, I think everyone does.  The issue with AFFC is that when GRRM wrote it, it was technically just half of one big book, and his editors made him split it in two.  Rather than splitting it right down the middle, he decided it would be best to divide the two books by North and South.

AFFC focuses on the South, where very little is happening and we're seeing this boring time through the eyes of most of the people we hate.   Cersei and the like.  There are few interesting chapters, it is overall a slog.

This incredibly dullness is compounded by the fact that the previous book, A Storm of Swords, was one of the most exciting books I've ever read, where almost every chapter had me audibly saying ""oh, shit.  Oh, shit!""

But, I had to get through it, because it's a massive chunk of a story that isn't over yet.  In the end, as boring as it may be, I have to know what happens in it to avoid getting lost later on.


So...I overcame it by waiting for the show to catch up because fuck you I'm not reading that.  I dropped it about halfway through.

If the book feels like work to get through, don't read it.  The Silmarillion adds flavor to the setting, but it is not necessary to understand the Hobbit or LotR.  If you don't like it, don't force yourself.  It's just not your kind of book, and that's okay.

Feanor, the silmarils, Ungoliant, knowing that Elbereth Gilthoniel refers to Varda and who she is, plus Beren and Luthien's tale was particularly beautiful. Learning about the fall of Númenor and basically all of Aragorn's ancestors gives more weight to his journey in LotR.

But it is absolutely not for everyone. The writing is dense, and saying it can be difficult to get through is a massive understatement. I recommend having the indexes from LotR on hand, because having the family trees on hand made keeping track of the elves a whole lot easier.

Reading the whole book gives a lot of background info for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, so I consider it still worth the effort. I've read it twice since (couple of years in between ;-)) and discovered new details every time I read it anew.

Since it already has taken so long, I would recommend starting from the beginning again. There are so many names or places to remember that makes a slow reading pace that more difficult to keep up.

Dragons, elves, trolls, orcs and plenty of other less known side things were often amalgamations of various stories told about similar creatures. Dragons for example are known throughout the world, but different cultures have wildly different versions of how Dragons look or act.

The biggest influences you can see come from Nordic and Germanic cultures.

He was heavily influenced by the english country side (which he modelled the peaceful shire after) and he was very influenced by his experience in WWI fighting in trenches.

The hobbit started off as just a fun story for his kids that slowly developed into more. A lot of the silmarillion was just back-story for Tolkien's own notes when writing the original LOTR. He used a very Christian themed mythos with much of the concept about Good, Evil, Messiahs, the eternal struggle against Satan (Morgoth/Sauron) and much of the world building in regards to the planes, gods, higher beings, are all very easily attributed to Christian ideas.

The Silmarillion (or parts of it) was by no means just backstory for LotR, it was Tolkien's life's work.

He was a linguist first and foremost, and therein lies his whole motivation for creating Middle Earth; he wanted a setting and context in which his languages could develop. He started writing it in WWI and didn't stop until he died. His goal was to create folklore for England on the scale of Beowulf or the Finnish Kalevala (can't believe no one has mentioned that here so far). As far as I know, he didn't even intend to write LotR until publishers wanted a sequel to the hobbit.

I feel like I need to mention Kalevala again. Tolkien borrowed some of its plot lines almost directly. The story of Turin Turambar, for example, is very similar to that of Joukahainen in Kalevala, and the Silmarillion (3 gems beyond measurable value) are basically the Sampo (a device that creates wealth). Also, elvish languages were somewhat influenced by Finnish, which Tolkien also studied. I believe he liked the language for its complexity, and while there are only a handful of words that are similar, elvish grammar is derived from Finnish to some extent.

jfvgbi,"> Books were designed for illiterate people.

Let's just pause to reflect on that statement for a moment.

Ok, 

1) *The Hobbit* takes place in a trolls' hideout, a goblin cave, an evil haunted forest, and a mountain kingdom that was completely torched by a dragon; none of these are going to have a library handy.

2) If this is a larger Middle Earth question, then there are actually quite a lot of books: Gandalf rummages through the archives of Minas Tirith; Rivendell is called a center of lore, and it can't be just because Elrond has a good memory; and the hobbits have several of their own histories, like the yellow book of the Tooks (or some similar name which I can't be bothered to look up right now).  However, *again*, the majority of the story takes place in the wilderness, or in ruins that are thousands of years old, so I'm not sure when our friends would encounter a lot of written matter during the course of the plot.

3) Books are not designed for illiterate people; the examples you cited involved a literate person reading them out loud to a bunch of other, illiterate people.  If the entire society was illiterate (like Rohan in *The Lord of the Rings*), they wouldn't make a book, they would just have pictures by themselves (carvings and tapestries, like Rohan is stated as having in *The Lord of the Rings*) and oral histories (again, like Rohan is stated as having in *The Lord of the Rings*).

As you haven't seen the movies and have avoided spoilers you will most probably enjoy your time spent with the story, just remember that it was written for children and as such doesn't really focus on too many details that a child would miss. There is also a lack of female characters so there's that you keep an eye on too",NexusWit,2018-01-23T17:22:49Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I would suggest reading The Hobbit now. And maybe disciplining yourself and taking your time with it. Digest it and that might make LOTR more enjoyable in the summer. 

We are reading The Hobbit aloud to my 4.5 year old son...and he gets excited every night to read a chapter from his “adventure story”. We do skim over some overly descriptive and/potentially nightmare inducing sections. But by and large read most of it.

7sfttq,"If you enjoy epic fantasy, you will probably really have a great time reading The Hobbit. It's still a favorite of mine, and I've re-read it many, many, times. (It was the second book with actual chapters I ever read.) I still re-read it every now and then (LOTR also) and still enjoy it. It's a rich and wonderful story, with compelling characters, vivid descriptions, and set in a complex and enchanting world, all told  by a master story teller. (Although, Tolkien wasn't very good at writing female characters. He wrote *about* some amazing female characters, but just didn't do well about actually writing them, instead of writing about them.)

Don't feel bad or worry about not having read  the book yet, just enjoy reading it now. :)

And LOTR is connected to The Hobbit, set in the same world, has some of the same characters, and the events in The Hobbit set things up for some of the events in LOTR. But they are different stories, with different plots. The Hobbit is a personal journey, about, and from the point of view of a main character. LOTR has multiple main characters, changes viewpoints between them at times, and it's scope is an entire world. It also has a slower start, and takes much longer to  have any big action scenes. Still, an extremely well written book, a well told story. But they will feel very different at times when you read them.

And when you do watch the movies, a LOT was left out of the LOTR movies, though I think it was done quite well for the most part. I didn't bother to go see the third Hobbit movie, just too much was changed too drastically. It felt more like an alternate universe fanfiction of the Hobbit, than an actual movie version of the book.

Pink Floyd paid homage to it with their first album. The children's play Toad of Toad Hall is reprised every year. Tolkien would almost certainly have read it. I don't think that the Wind in the Willows actually inspired The Hobbit though.   
An interest in small vulnerable creatures is symptomatic of a certain mental state I think, especially in people recovering from a great emotional crisis, compare Richard Dadd, who murdered his father and spent the rest of his natural painting scenes of elves and gnomes.

dmtmyi,"There is a very noticable difference in tone between the Hobbit and the LoTR, although the first 150 pages of the LoTR which are set in the shire still carry some of the light-heartedness of the Hobbit. So read beyond those first 150 pages even if you don't enjoy them, you will be rewarded later. After the hobbits leave the shire and are drawn into the events of the larger world, the tone becomes more serious. 

Even though, I don't think Tolkien is an especially sophisticated writer. It is his storytelling that is so uniquely masterful and captivating, more so than the language and style. The writing differs between the chapters. There are ""empty"" chapters full of descriptions of nature or architecture. There are chapters of slowly unfolding dialogue, revealing some piece of history or illuminating a new character, like Aragorn, Faramir, Saruman, Treebeard - those are my favorite chapters. There are still those less satisfactory chapters that seem rushed to wrap up a storyline (esp in RotK). There are chapters with far too much poetry. But always, the stories are a window to a great and legendary past, the age of the Elves and the Men of Westernesse, further to be explored in the appendixes as well as the Silmarillion.

I read the whole trilogy aloud to my daughter, beginning when she was seven years old.  Started with *The Hobbit*, of course.

We had to take a break for about a year early on, when we got to the scene of the Black Rider sniffing for the hobbits huddled in the tree roots under the road - she yelled, ""Stop, stop, I can't hear this!"".  

Eventually she began asking to start up again.  Took about 3 years altogether, but it was so worth it for many reasons - the bonding, the building of the habit of reading, the free entertainment and exercise of imagination.

There's a bunch of hey-nonny-nonny Party stuff, a lengthy chapter of exposition, some Black Rider Chase stuff and then a metric ton of Tom Bombadil. It's all secondary to the main plot, the Hobbits are acting like fools and it's all seemingly going nowhere.

The strange thing about the book is that after you've read it a few times, those early chapters start becoming some of your favorite moments in the book. The chapter ""Shadows if the Past"" becomes utterly fascinating as it lays out who the White Council is, who Aragorn is and what Gollum has been up to before you really meet any of those people. Bombadil telling stories while it rains adds layers of meaning and history to the world. The Barrow Wight is terrifying. Etc.

They should have been able to encourage me to keep going. So I think there are far more people who claim to have read them than have in actually, if not understood the book anyway... I finished them last year as audiobooks and one day will read them.

The first part about Hobbits is a sleeper of fantastic scene-setting. So, my opinion is that it is supposed to bore the shit out of you.  Hobbits are boring! OMG are they just...ugh.  That's the whole point. You're supposed to feel that way, and it translates to you feeling like you're bored with the book. The problem is that as modern readers we are tuned to action ""movie"" levels of start the action at the beginning.

Tolkien knew what he was doing to the reader. The first chapters are meant to paint a drab and dull sense of repetition. The hobbits are boring so that you can understand just how amazing the fellowship hobbits are later and how much they have changed.

ibe0r8,">Edit: Should have said this, I have read The Hobbit probably 5 or 6 times since I was a kid and love it, I think it was a bit of a shock trying to read these expecting the same world from the same writer but having the writing style be so drastically different even though the world was familiar

To me it's easier to think of as Tolkien being a linguistics and English literature professor, focused in classical English lit myths like King Arthur and Erik the Red and Beowulf. He based a large portion of The Lord of the Rings from these tales, some character names being the same (Wormtongue is from Erik the Red iirc), the overall worldbuilding and dialogue, but most of all the writing itself is replicating this old style that Bards would sing and tell around a campfire. Lord of the Rings is written to be in the pantheon of stuff like The Illiad and Arthurian Legends, Tolkien intentionally wrote the books in that style to ensure it would be read that way.

I hope no one feels bad if they can't get into the Lord of the Rings books where they love the movies. The writing is emulating a style from about the 15th century. While he did write in a modern English vernacular, the thing is incredibly dense.",,2020-08-17T16:26:18Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

ibe0r8,"My story:  Due to dyslexia, I worked hard at reading until it became a passion.  I was always looking for books and my aunt, Rosie, gave me a crate of used ones from her attic.  Most of them were ""junk"" (if any book can be described as such) that I took to the book exchange for credit.  Among the books I kept were the 2nd and 3rd volumns of 'The Lord of the Rings'--volumn one was missing.  I only kept those two books because of the Barbara Remington covers.  

Also kept was a detective novel with a scantily clad woman on the cover.  My 13-year-old self kept it hidden and read it at night; it was surprisingly free of sex and violence.  Years later, I would find out that many of the Harlequin novels that I traded in had much more sex and violence--a pity.

I came upon the first volumn of the LOTR, at the used book store on a Saturday afternoon.  I was pleased to complete the set of books and the cover that formed a strange picture of Middle-Earth. Book in hand, I went to the early showing of a sword and sorcery film at the local theater, The Coronado.

The Coronado was built in the '20s and could hold large crowds.  There was the large main floor with long rows of seats, each with a thick velvet seat covering.  The upper balconies were  roped off, except for special performances.  The ceiling was a navy-blue velvet with tiny lights embedded so as to look like the night sky.  On each side of the screen were pillars with carving of angels and gargoyles and other mythical creatures.  Years later, Steven Wright would call it, ""The Devil's Attic.""  This is where I began reading 'The Lord of the Rings.'

 I was early for the first show.  With my drink and my popcorn in a huge, empty theater, I started reading.  Over the summer vacation, I would spend the hot afternoons reading while listening to LPs and drinking coke from heavy glass bottles of ice-cold Coke.  Even now, when I hear Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's, 'Wooden Ships,' I can feel that summer.  

When finished, I took a perverse pleasure in counting how many pages I had read that summer.  It all came in handy, my sophomore year of High School, when I needed book reports and theme papers; impressing teachers with what and how much you've read never hurts.  

Well, almost never hurts--while discussing LOTR with a teacher who loved the books, he informed me that there was a fourth novel, 'The Hobbit.'  

I finished, 'The Hobbit,' by the following Monday, because--embarrassing.

I read The Hobbit a few times as a child, but had difficulty with LOTR.  Gave up for 5-10 years, then tried again in my late teens.  Was capitvated.  Couldn't believe the additional depth.

I recall the following:

* Loved the development of friendship between Gimli and Legolas.  This was powerful to me.
* Thought that Tolkein's finish (The Scourge of the Shire) was masterful.   The folk of the Shire could have never appreciated the task the foursome completed abroad, but they became local heroes for these accomplishments.  This demonstrated something to me about locality, presence and meaning.
* Loved the timeline in the appendix that gave brief glimpses of the future for each of these characters.",veidtre,2020-08-18T04:00:50Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

My older brother sequestered the first volume to read, taking advantage of my good nature, and mumbling something about him being the faster reader. I was so anxious to read it, and it took him so long, fast reading notwithstanding, that I started reading the second volume completely cold, without even having read the Hobbit or anything.

I'll never forget the sensation of being thrown into a different world, similar to ours but different in magic way. The fact of now knowing who was who, but reading about them behaving in internally coherent ways, raised in me powerful emotions. I stopped very soon, after >!Boromir's death!<, fearing more spoiling knowledge.

From them on I have always thought that this is a good way of ""tasting"" a book. Open it up in the middle and see if you want to know how all that started. There is the risk of spoilers, of course, but what's life without risks :-)",TheUnvanquishable,2020-08-18T09:59:15Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

ibe0r8,"It took me so long to finish the series the first time I read them, I did it in a weird order though, I'd read the Hobbit years before and enjoyed it, then I watched the fellowship movie when it came out, that sparked me wanting to read the trilogy so I read Fellowship and Towers in just a few days, I loved them both and found them very easy reads. Some of that was possibly because I'd seen the first movie so the scene setting side of it didn't drag on as much and I could get on with enjoying the story. Return first time I read it I found mind numbing, I really struggled, I'd read a dozen pages and have to put it down, I'd go weeks or months without reading it. It took me so long that by the time I could finish reading it the I'd already watched both the Towers and Return movies. I think it was around five years before I finally got towards the end and got hooked enough to finish it.

I've read them since and don't find them as difficult to get into but that first time was a chore, a chore that was worth it in the end, but a chore nonetheless. I've never been one to watch a movie before reading a book, if I have any intention of reading the book at all I will do it before watching the movie (or series with the way things are being adapted now) but LotR is one that I'm glad I saw Fellowship and Return before finishing the books because I don't think I would have got through the books without them.

Others are citing the 150-page mark, which (depending on edition) would be about after the hobbits leave the Shire and encounter Tom Bombadil and the barrow wights. In other words, about when Aragorn, the more conventional action hero shows up. The way the narrative changes there may fit people's genre expectations better. I really love the way Frodo's arc is set up at the beginning (and Gandalf's backstory for the Ring, and how the relationships with Sam, Merry, and Pippin are established, and how the Bombadil and barrow wight chapters are tests for Frodo and reveal the nature of the Ring), but it makes a certain amount of sense that if your reading expectations are set up for more traditional action heroes you may find the opening section slow but enjoy the book as the plot moves on.",Midwestern_Childhood,2020-08-17T14:57:30Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It took a while but man Tolkien’s writing is very magical and does bring about such sense of wonder, scale, history, and there was a tranquility in that.

It's easy to skim through those (generally pretty short) descriptions if you don't want to imagine them. I suspect that the impatience with the visual descriptions is greater in people who have seen the films first: they already have a clear idea of what Middle-earth looks like that was formed by the movies, so they don't want/need the visuals Tolkien was creating in his imagination--details that were really important for readers who came to the books first (and/or see how the landscapes fit thematically into the story).",Midwestern_Childhood,2020-08-17T15:19:14Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.

>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dûr would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.

>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.

Because you wrote:

The idea that J. R. R. Tolkien is *trolling you*, that he sat around and thought, ""you know what would be great? I will deliberately bore and annoy my readers, that's a top idea"". I mean it's laughable. Maybe try to entertain the notion that the issue might be with your perception, not with the book. You are not ""supposed to feel that way"", you are supposed to enjoy it.

>The hobbits are described in **extreme detail** and all of it is a life of simple and unexciting days

It's not extreme detail though, is it? It's a few pages. Frodo has left the Shire by, what, chapter 3? Most of Ch. 2 is dedeicated to exposition from Gandalf, so really we're talking a few pages. I mean, in Proust there is *literally* a couple of hundred pages dedicated to a single dinner party. *That's* extreme detail - a chapter or two of scene-setting is not. And besides:

In the first few chapters:

* Bilbo has a birthday party and dramatically vanishes
* The Shire is described to us
* Frodo is entrusted with the Ring
* The Ring's true nature is (half) revealed through Gandalf
* Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin set out on a quest
* They meet elves in the forest
* They become aware of Black Riders and have a near-encounter with one
* They meet Tom Bombadil

How all of that translates to ""nothing happens"", I don't know. Loads happens! It's not at all a ""drab and dull sense of repetition"", and i would suggest that if you feel that way about *Lord of the Rings*, then the issue is with *you* and not with the book.

You could have said, ""I found the opening chapters a bit slow paced for my taste, I prefer a fast moving plot"" - but you didn't, you have to think that there is something wrong with the *book.*",blueslander,2020-08-18T14:37:36Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Hobbits are enchantingly dull in their affairs.

I encourage you to read some of hispanic literature to get more used to the way we talk or write in spanish. Reading translations is not that good, that's why I bought The Hobbit.

I would recommend, if you haven't read them yet, some books by Gabriel García Márquez. Maybe read the smaller and easier ones first. Like *No one writes to the colonel* or *Chronicle of a death foretold. Twelve pilgrim stories* is also a very good one. 

I recommend you Gabo because I'm from Colombia and he's my favorite writer, so I feel like I have to. Nevertheless, I would say that the best you can do is to pick a specific ""dialect"" of spanish to read from and to learn. Any country you pick would open a whole world of things to enjoy.

I just love the way both languages can be so different. For example, No one writes to the colonel is a good title but the original in spanish, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba, is waaay better and is different from the version in english.

32pxex,"> Lastly, why is the book and movie drastically different in some dialogue scenes?

Because they figured it would be more popular as an action movie, I guess.

I remember giving up on The Hobbit movies early in the second one. (I've told this story before and people ask, ""why did you take so long?"") In the book, the scene where they meet Beorn is a witty comedic scene showing off Gandalf's and the dwarves' characters, and that of Beorn himself. In the movie, that scene turns into the party on the run from a werebear before we see Beorn as a person, and they manage to get by him just by slamming the door, because... no apparent reason. More exciting that way, I guess. As if the previous three hours of them outrunning one CGI monster after another across one hi-def landscape after another, or the five and a half hours yet to come, wouldn't be exciting enough. No, apparently there was absolutely no time for witty comedy with character development. 

I don't mean to sound critical of you about it. Taste is subjective, and the works of Tolkien are definitely written in a more old-fashioned style than more modern fantasy, so that could be off-putting if you aren't expecting it. And I thought more highly of Jackon's version of LOTR than The Hobbit, so you may like the book more.

In fact A Clockwork Orange is the only one I like but there are oodles I haven't seen (like To Kill A Mockingbird). 

You are clearly not enjoying them as they are, so don't force it. If you are really committed to teaching these books, you might want to look at the Tolkien translation of  Beowulf, translations of French language Arthurian legends, The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer, and other older works. (You might want to check out some of Tolkien's essays and as many fairy tales as you can. There is a [new, exciting translation of the Grimm fairy tales](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/12/grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation) that I can't wait to get my hands on! )


Tolkien was a great scholar, and if you can get into and appreciated the literature that inspired him perhaps you can ""reset"" where you are coming from... Perhaps if you are acquainted with the ideas that Tolkien was trying to express it will help you to see his works in a new light. 

For what it's worth, I really love The Hobbit. I think it's an amazing tale that incorporates the philosophical ideas of the middle ages as understand by Tolkien. The LOTR was work for me.

In The Hobbit, the journey was miserable nine-tenths of the way. Then they get there and they're huddled on the mountain with no real plan. Then even after Smaug is killed through dumb luck (or fate, or other peoples' work and sacrifice, but not the dwarves'), they still have to fight other people for the prize. Bilbo gets knocked out early on and is completely unimportant to how the actual battle goes. Was it all worth it? Sure, maybe Bilbo got home safe and rich, but it wasn't worth it for Thorin. War is hell. In the movie, they're all clean and shiny, and even when they're soaking or covered in soot they're still incredibly good-looking. Swap the armor for modern clothing and they could be in a fireman's pinup calendar. (In fairness, I wouldn't be surprised if Jackson felt obligated to slip some ""war is hell"" parts into the third movie of The Hobbit, but I think the overall point still stands.) See also Lord of the Rings: it's also about war partially, and the journey sucks even more. And again, it's not glamorous. I remember one scene from the book where Sam sees Sauron's human armies passing by, or maybe the aftermath of a battle, and he thinks about the motivation of the foot soldiers of the enemy and wonders why they fight and if they knew what they were getting into. 

In the movie? I'm not sure if we even see any human servants of Sauron at all. Orcs and trolls all over the place. ",cybishop3,2015-04-16T16:02:45Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
32pxex,"The book is most definitely not about war. War is a subtext in the greater story line. The book is about Bilbo, not the dwarves. That is why it is called *The Hobbit*. War is a much more prevalent theme in the LOTR (one book). But to keep this in context of your statement - ""The Hobbit: watching....."" *The Hobbit* is nothing to do about war. I gave you several themes concerning *The Hobbit*. Tolkien wrote these books in the middle of a real, world war. The last thing he wanted was another story concerning itself with every day life. He wanted an escape for himself and his readers. An adventure that separates itself from what we are used to in our own lives. It was meant to emphasize the things worth cherishing, even through the trials and tribulations of every day life, i.e. camaraderie, food, adventures, etc. 

Jackson just wanted to focus on the war. That is why he brought in a character whose only mention in *The Hobbit* is in the appendix - Azog. The only reason he is mentioned in the book is to point out who was Bolg's father. Jackson didnt concern himself much with what Tolkien envisioned in his own words. I have no doubt Jackson loves Tolkien and his works, but he had dollar bill signs in his eyes when he wrote, directed, and produced this terrible trilogy. That helps explain why the fudge Legolas and Ariel are in the films. They added NOTHING to these films. If anything, they detracted from the little worth the films had to begin.

32pxex,"I think you're confused. I never wrote anything starting ""The Hobbit: watching..."" Also, the Lord of the Rings was published as three books rather than one, and if you want to go by the author's intent and ignore everything else then you might as well call it six books, because that was how he divided it up internally. 

I agree with you that the movies are worse than the books, that many of the differences were motivated by money, that none of the books are mainly about war, and to the extent they are about war they have a mature viewpoint on it informed by Tolkien's life experience. It looks to me like I said all of that in the comment you replied to. (I didn't mention awareness of Tolkien's military career, but I knew of it, I promise.) All that being said, if you really believe the books were not about war *at all*, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

14wymh,"Personally, didn't like it. Sorry about it to everyone here who loved it, but there was so much random stuff shoved in to the movie in an attempt to make it longer. Did we need a 30 minute sequence of Ratagast running around? And why was Ratagast this weird, insane old wizard? He shows up very briefly in Fellowship of the Ring and is a normal guy, albeit one who loves animals. 

Also, why did we need another 15 minutes of the ""council"" at Rivendell? Again, not necessary to the plot, but the makers wanted to tie this into LOTR more. 

Furthermore, the whole subplot of the white orc was completely unnecessary to the overall plot of the Hobbit. While I enjoyed the scenes with him, especially Thorin's final scene with him, he was still simply shoved in there so the producers could turn this into a three-part movie. 

I will say I liked Gollum's scene a lot, and that a large number of the dwarves' scenes were extremely awesome / fun. That being said, there didn't need to be some battle/running from enemies every two seconds. 

TL;DR: Movie did not need to be so long, and had so much shoved into it in a blatant attempt to lengthen the movie so it could be 3 parts and make money. ",YoungDumpy,2012-12-16T20:11:53Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

But my point is that the Defiler and the White Council are not necessary for the overall plot of The Hobbit. Sure, they can be put in there, but they are unneeded. The only reason they ARE in there, is so that the makers of this movie can stretch it into 3 parts. 

This book did not need to be in 3 parts. They easily could have finished it in two, which I would have accepted so they could put in all the important details.

40smfl,"I was very disappointed in the tone of the movies.  They seemed to lack the warmth that was present in the books.  For instance, to the Hobbits at least, Gandalf was supposed to a kind, funny old man who could break out some awesome fireworks and that the older people looked at as a bad influence on the young.  They had no idea how powerful he was because he never felt the need to flaunt his power.  It was supposed to be a shock to the hobbits when he threw down some serious magical fire and wrath.  I think the films missed this aspect of his character.  Same thing with the elves.  The books portrayed them as powerful people who were silly, warm, and kind because they preferred to be that way.  Elrond was supposed to be wise, thoughtful, and benevolent; not a scary reboot of Agent Smith who I would be afraid to be in the same room with.  Galadrial in the books was beautiful, warm, and loving, not an ice goddess.  Tolkein seemed to employ a theme of the forces of good hiding their power because they were more concerned with happiness on a day to day basis than they were with fighting and war.

Jackson had to take over as director and asked the studio for a year to go back and do his own version of the movie. Remember that he was the Executive Producer. The studio declined so he had to start shooting what was essentially del Toro's movie. I'm quite sure that if del Toro had made the movie, it would have been different. Had Jackson been given the time he requested, it would have been a different movie. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and what we got is the result.

From *Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth*, there is a draft of a conversation in which Frodo recounts to Pippin, Merry, and Gimli a prior conversation with Gandalf. In that prior conversation, Gandalf said

>'Somehow, I had been attracted by Bilbo long before, as a child, and a young hobbit: he had not quite come of age when I had last seen him. He had stayed in my mind ever since, with his eagerness and his bright eyes, and his love of tales, and his questions about the wide world outside the Shire. As soon as I entered the Shire I heard news of him. He was getting talked about, it seemed. Both his parents had died early for Shire-folk, at about eighty; and he had never married. He was already growing a bit queer, they said, and went off for days by himself. He could be seen talking to strangers, even Dwarves.

> ""'Even Dwarves!' Suddenly, in my mind these three things came together: the great Dragon with his lust, and his keen hearing and scent; the sturdy heavy-booted Dwarves with their old burning grudge; and the quick, soft-footed Hobbit, sick at heart (I guessed) for a sight of the wide world.

In a different draft, we get, from Gandalf,

>'And then there was the Shire-folk. I began to have a warm place in my heart for them in the Long Winter, which none of you can remember. ... I wanted them still to survive. But I saw that the Westlands were in for another very bad time again, sooner or later, though of quite a different sort: pitiless war. To come through that I thought they would need something more than they now had. It is not easy to say what. Well, they would want to know a bit more, understand a bit clearer, and where they stood.

> 'They had begun to forget: forget their own beginnings and legends, forget what little they had known about the greatness of the world. It was not yet gone, but it was getting buried: the memory of the high and the perilous. But you cannot teach that sort of thing to a whole people quickly. There was not time. And anyway you must begin at some point, with some one person. I dare say he was ""chosen"" and I was only chosen to choose him; but I picked out Bilbo.

> 'How would you select any one Hobbit for such a purpose?...I had not time to sort them all out; but I knew the Shire very well by that time, although when I met Thorin I had been away for more than twenty years on less pleasant business. So naturally thinking over Hobbits that I knew, I said to myself: ""I want a dash of the Took"" (but not too much, Master Peregrin) ""and I want a good foundation of the solider sort, a Baggins perhaps."" That pointed at once to Bilbo. And I had known him once very well, almost up to his coming of age, better than he knew me. I liked him then. And now I found that he was ""unattached"" - to jump on again, for of course I did not know all this until I went back to the Shire. I learned that he had never married. I thought that odd, though I guessed why it was; and the reason that I guessed was *not* the one that most the Hobbits gave me: that he had early been left very well off and his own master. No, I guessed that he wanted to remain ""unattached"" for some reason deep down which he did not understand himself - or would not acknowledge, for it alarmed him. He wanted, all the same, to be free to go when the chance came, or he had made up his courage.

3w56v4,"It is little known that the Hobbit was a lot more sadistic when first published than the post 1954 versions. In 1954 the Hobbit was revised to appeal to a younger audience and left put many parts of the original manuscript dealing with murder, rape, suicide, racism etc. 

Bilbo was originally abducted by the dwarves against his will and was sexually abused by the dwarves before managing to escape in the goblin cave. However upon meeting Gollum and being subjected to torture he developed essentially Stockholm syndrome and returned to the dwarves. Upon rendevous with the dwarves one of them admits his wrongdoings and pleads to be killed as recompence for his sins. Thorin prevented the killing and the dwarf was made to suffer physically. For whatever reason Gandalf pretty much has nothing to sat about it

In the elves dubgeons half the dwarves are killed by the elves and while some dwarves are pissed others are pretty much happy about it as it means more gold for them - the dragon sickness is already corrupting their hearts. Bilbo believes he can save them and so stays with them

The confrontation with smaug is much more extreme in the original version with several dwarves being roasted into burning piles of flesh. By the end there are only a couple of dwarves left and Bilbo who basically went around with his invisibility ring killing the laketowners encamped outside erebor. 

When Bilbo returned to bag end he pretty much kicked out the black servants who had taken over his home - but Tolkien later changed them to the Sackville bagginses and removed references to race.

Its just the original version was written in a war and racism period and things changes.. hence the heavy decisions.

The killer for the former was probably all of the expository dialogue and slow pace, and the relatively dry style of writing.

But recently, on a classic fantasy kick, I reread Hobbit and LotR, and had the complete opposite experience. The Hobbit seemed a little formulaic, with each ""adventure"" starting and stopping in an increasingly predictable sequence. While the book ended juuuust before completely overstaying its welcome, I was still pretty eager to get off the ride by the end of it.

LotR was a total revelation. Things which I'd previously remembered as boring were utterly engrossing, and there were many details revealed in adulthood which I'd never appreciated as a teenager. What especially stood out was the relationship between Frodo and Sam. The films of course try their best to do justice to this, but even in the 30 hours of extended material there's simply not enough space or time to capture all of the nuances of what they go through. By the time they reach Mordor, their experience becomes so exhausting that it's almost difficult to read—but in the best possible way.

I watched the Fellowship of the Ring movie first before going back again into the books and I think that helped me visualise how the story would go about. Afterwards, I had the opportunity to visit some of the film locations in New Zealand; that really made me appreciate the stories even more. I read the LOTR trilogy first before The Hobbit and after such heavy narrative on the trilogy, The Hobbit seems like a breeze.

When reading books aloud to him, I always use different voices for each character to make it more fun and bring the stories to life. 

As I’d previously watched the films (although he hadn’t at that point), the actors influenced my choice of voice/accent a great deal, which with so many characters was a challenge.

When we later watched the movies together, he remarked how all the characters had the same voices just as he’d imagined them. He wasn’t ever aware of me using different voices and accents when reading to him (and to think I almost lost my voice after several chapters of reading almost entirely in “dwarf”).",NoVinyl,2019-07-18T15:01:32Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

cedlbb,"I was in an advanced reading class in sixth grade, and one of the books we were assigned to read and discuss was *The Hobbit*. 

I was (and am) a procrastinator. So I fell behind in the nightly assigned chapter reading, and eventually gave up on reading the book. (Fudged and sloughed my way through the discussions.)

Eventually, years later, I read the book on my own and really loved it. (I think that it was during either high school or college, but I don’t remember which.)

Then in my twenties, I gave an attempt at reading *The Fellowship of the Ring*, but I soon lost interest and gave it up.

Here’s the problem, *for me*:
**I don’t know what to think of the book’s setting, and that bothers me too much to enjoy the book**.

Here’s what I mean by that:
They call it “Middle Earth.” I *used to* think that meant some early time period of the very planet that we inhabit. But then I thought of the fact that the map of the world of LOTR is utterly not the map of our world, unless we are to believe that in the time between then and now, there was such tremendous geographic/tectonic change that it somehow because the world of today. Even if I accept that, it’s not possible for me to accept the idea that *so long ago*, presumably *before* the age of dinosaurs (because it would have to be) civilization rose to the point described in the books, only to disappear utterly for many millions of years.

So that left me stuck having to think of “Middle Earth” as being “another planet,” or “earth in an utterly different timeline, and forget what you know about the world we live in.” And I couldn’t do that. I found it impossible to reconcile. 

This world Tolkien describes—it has horses, and eagles, and presumably rabbits and mice and such, but it also has giant spiders, and trolls, and orcs ... . I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t accept it. It didn’t have a place in my understanding where it fit and lay neatly. To this day—I’m forty-seven—I don’t know *where* or *when* “Middle Earth” exists, and it prevents me from being comfortable enough with the books to read them. 

By the way, this also goes for just about any other fantasy books. I did somehow make an exception for the “Earthsea” series by Ursula K. LeGuin, despite my problems with accepting that “humans” unexplainably inhabit some utterly alien “earth” in every normal way except for it *being* earth.

No one has ever explained to me the settings of these kinds of books, and where/when I’m supposed to categorize them as existing. If anyone would like to try, I’ll welcome it.",ClearBluePeace,2019-07-17T16:44:19Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I liked the LOTR movies, because they did a genuinely good job at working out the art style, makeup and music and made it all fit, but I'm very displeased with changes they made to the story and characters. Eowyn was a loveable, strong headed, feminine character in the book, but they made her into a brat in the films. Not sure why they did that, but it sucked. The chase to Rivendell and the rescue of Frodo also was quite boring in the film, compared to the book, they just simplified it too much. Never seen it in the cinema, but apparently the death of Saruman was only in the extended version, which is a very bad mistake in my opinion. 

I kind of understand why they left the bit with Tom Bombadil out, it's simple to skip and feel as if nothing has been lost, but it's a very memorable part of the first book and gives it more depth.

I tore through the books. Only put them down when I had to --- like in class. My oldest brother (6 years older than I was) got the box set. When he finished one book, then I read it. Except when I finished The Two Towers, he had taken The Return of the King on a weekend camping trip. So my middle brother took me to the store and I bought my own copy of RotK and had it read before my oldest brother returned from his camping trip. So, ironically, I started the books after he did and finished the set before he did.

I've read them many times since then. Both before and after the movies came out. My favorite way to read them is with The Atlas of Middle-earth beside me because it is the most incredible reading experience to have those maps open while reading what happens at those sites. It gives a whole new dimension to the books.

Not to me they weren't. There were parts that were good, but when I think of LotR, the movies don't even cross my mind. It's the books. When I read the books, I visualize nothing from the movies.

He's a fat, lazy, decadent aristocrat who gets sent on a mission he is in no way actually prepared for, yet he manages to hold on, and even thrive in this new environment. Exactly because he's such an unlikely hero, there is never any insincerity to him, when he describes his fear, his discomfort, his pain. This both makes the character more relatable, and the story more exciting, imo.

That being said, Tolkien clearly is not afraid of using his various Dei ex Machina, which some may perceive as a weakness, but which I personally feel fit in with both the style and the fact that it is a bit of a tale for children.

skrsem,"You've identified what a lot of people think is the pivotal point in Tolkien's writing of The Lord of the Rings. For the first 10 or so chapters, Tolkien is writing the story as a sequel to the Hobbit, and it's kind of skirting around the edges of the rest of the stories that he had been writing in his spare time since his early 20s. 

But there's a clearly defined point when he finally decides that yes, this new story he is writing is actually going to be a part of the the wider world that he's created in the background, and it's when Aragorn says the line ""I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel"". It's both a great in universe introduction to the small story that Aragorn is going to tell as well as serving as an out of universe message from Tolkien, that he's finally going to let us in on one of the stories from the First Age, that will now serve as the backdrop for the rest of the story.

Also as a sidenote, once you finish the Lord of the Rings, the best of these backstories that serves as its own contained book is *The Children of Hurin* which is another of the great tales of the First Age, but never gets a summary treatment in LotR like Beren and Luthien does.",rcuosukgi42,2022-02-05T06:31:28Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
skrsem,"It's one of those moments that remind you that Tolkien was always more interested in the world and lore than the main plotlines of the books. He spent years creating the lore of all the ages of Middle Earth, the mythologies and histories of the main races, even creating entire languages for them, drawing maps, and all that. He drew heavily on existing Anglo-Saxon materials and made them his own -- all without planning to write Lord of the Rings. Then he wrote The Hobbit set in the world, and people demanded more, so when he eventually created the story for Lord of the Rings, he already had an incredible world of wonder ready in which to set this epic.

Also, I'm sure the thread is full of people saying this already, but: if what you like best about Lord of the Rings is the world-building and epic lore, you really ought to read Silmarillion, which covers the entire epic history of the world, from its creation through successive ages, and moves from pseudo-religious battles of gods to mythic history and on toward the time of LotR, which more closely resembles actual history.",theAlpacaLives,2022-02-05T06:11:46Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
skrsem,"Tolkien's books are a worldbuilder's/lore lover's paradise. I've yet to encounter anything quite like them. 

Most author's subscribe to the notion of ""everything must serve the plot"". And maybe Tolkien had a vastly different, grander concept of what constituted the plot (the story of the whole world?). Or maybe he just didn't give a damn. But many of his tangents have virtually nothing to do with the plot.

Tom Bombadil is the biggest example of this. He is 100% unnecessary to the plot, and his chapters could be excised entirely, with nothing more than stating the hobbits found their swords in an old burial mound, or even got them in Rivendell. Nothing that happened in those chapters touches anything else for the entire rest of the book.

Yet he adds so much to *the world* that Tolkien is building. Those chapters show ancient, mysterious beings of unknown powers, and the remains of kingdoms the hobbits never knew existed. Hints of a world far bigger, far older, with so much to discover. And the book is filled with this stuff. Seeing the elves making their way to the Grey Havens, the book in Balin's tomb, all the little songs, the various bits of other languages scattered all over, the fact that Helm's Deep is named after a person and has a history to go with it, the entire chapter of lore dumping in Rivendell...all of it adds flavor to the world, and helps it exist beyond the characters' horizons.",TheObstruction,2022-02-05T15:54:37Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

There are words in Tolkien that you can't help but read out with a certain tone that says 'there is much more to this', it's a kind of verbal hyperlink that children can't help but click on, so they'll pull you up and ask. And when they do you're getting no further with your bedtime story tonight, because you are deep in Tolkien lore and there's a whole lot to talk about.

On the way through _The Hobbit_ you may find yourself discussing who these Sea-elves and Deep-elves and Fair-elves were, and how they went into the West and why some later came back. You may find yourself discussing Gondolin. You might talk about what a Necromancer is, and who was at this mysterious council that Gandalf went away to consult with about _this_ Necromancer. You may offer more details about this Moria place that is mentioned, and why the Dwarves don't live there any more. You might hint at the sad history of this strange monster under the Misty Mountains, and suggest that he may indeed come out some day to seek the recovery of the precious thing that was stolen.

The phrase 'that comes into the next book' might be a common one. If demand arises to read the next book?

All while reading these we also read his letters to Christopher, C.S Lewis, and other literary figures of the time (many of whom were in the Inklings group with him).

skrsem,">are really not breaking their backs trying to find the Ring thus far

&#x200B;

Wellll.. they are and they aren't.  One of the things that you have probably noticed is that the Nazgûl are a lot less hands-on in the books so far than they were in the movies.  It's not giving anything away to reveal that their power actually depends a great deal on how close they are to their Master, and if you look at the map, you'll realize that up in the Shire and near Bree and so on they are actually quite far from home.  At that distance, they really are wraiths, having to conserve their meager physical strength and obliged to depend on magic and terror to do their work.  (And gold...)

It's also not giving anything away to say that Sauron has been gone a *loooong* time now, and many things have changed in Middle Earth.  For example, the Shire and hobbits didn't used to be around.  Nor was Gandalf!  Sauron has no idea who or where they are, so getting up to speed quickly on that has been a pretty major effort on his part.

All in all they are actually working pretty hard against the hobbits and their friends, but at a big disadvantage (that they are rapidly closing, as you have seen).  Sauron and his minions are now growing pretty confident.  But... Sauron remembers that he did this once before and got killed by a mortal hero with a mighty sword, and he and the Nazgûl are still not sure which of their old enemies are still around, and what they are capable of these days.  A lot of the good guys have been keeping a low profile over the centuries, and stealth is going to be their friend more than in the movies.",amitym,2022-02-05T04:36:06Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

This is just something I read on the Wikipedia article about Hobbits:

Still, Tolkien clearly states in ""Concerning Hobbits"" that hobbits are not technically a distinct race from Men, the way that Elves or Dwarves are, but branched off from other humans in the distant past of the Elder Days.""

I'm guessing Tolkien intentionally left their origin story without much detail - which is strange, given his first book in this world was called ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" was written in response to people wanting more books about Hobbits. But that's the point - they're just people, don't even know much about where they came from, but they have the capacity to be brave and curious and humble and loving, and that's the important bit.",PaoDaSiLingBu,2022-02-05T07:12:55Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

3bqj80,"I was in 7th grade...about 12/13 years old or so...when I first read The Hobbit. I liked it, but found it a little difficult to get into. I read the first four chapters of FotR but stopped because it was just too confusing to me. This was in late 1999/early 2000. Fast forward to August 2002. I was 15 and it was just before my sophomore year of high school. I'd been wanting to watch the LotR films and was finally able to watch FotR. I fell in absolute, complete love with it. That same night, I started reading the series again. Blew through them in a little over a week. I was even more madly in love with Lord of the Rings. 


Like you, I really learned a lot with those books. About friendship, bravery, courage, leadership and the burdens of such. I can't get over just how much influence those books had on my life and who I am.

3bqj80,"My problem is that I like to read a bit slower than others and fully absorb and appreciate everything as I go. For me, LotR's themes and details were quick to pick up. The problem was that the Fellowship was written like a cartographer being forced to write down everything rather than draw out a map. You hear about every bush, every literal turn in the road, every step. It's a crazy amount of detail but it makes the story feel like it's conflicting between describing an entire day's uneventful stroll and telling a story. I loved the entire Shire part, the 20+ page info dump on Hobbit culture and lifestyle, and Bree is still one of my favorite chapters in the book. I especially love the way Tolkien writes in the Bree chapters. But before you know it, it's back to pages of telling me where bushes are and how a river they'll never cross bend and how one part of the road has a lot of trees  and that the southend part of a hill slopes a different way than the other hill next to it. I get what the writing is trying to do but it honestly feels overwhelming and dull many times. It works when you know the hobbits are about to encounter Wights but it doesn't work when it just leads to nothing.

I know I'm probably the minority on this but I feel like this is why LotR is considered a hard read for a lot of people, and why people don't try to emulate that style. A lot of writers are taught no one would read through such stuff and today I think Fellowship would have had 100 pages of writing edited out. I'm not saying LotR is bad but that's why I've never gotten past Fellowship and I think that's why people have such problems with it. I love The Hobbit and Silmarillion though.

It shows the far reaching effects of evil, in that even the Shire did not escape untainted.  It also does such an excellent job of showing the growth of the four Hobbits.  I've read the Trilogy about 10 times now, and I always tell myself that I'm going to be more cognizant of the change that overtakes the Hobbits throughout the series.  I think I'll be able to note where they suddenly become leaders and warriors, that I'll be able to point to this point at which the transformation begins.  

But I never can.  They leave the Shire fearful and unsure, yet they return bold and confident in themselves.  I love how well it contrasts their beginnings with who they are after going through the quest.  ",TalonKAringham,2015-07-01T15:34:39Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

For Pippin, the journey was very different, even though he was with Merry for most of it. Pippin was never strong, but his value lay in his mental abilities. It was especially apparent when they talked to the ents that Pippin was intelligent, but he could never be as strong as the other hobbits. This didn't stop him, though, as he accepted that he wasn't the greatest and took pride in his achievements, because that was the best that he could do. Seeing him as a leader in the Scouring of the Shire was very emotionally satisfying, and he and Merry shall forever be remembered as the hobbits who became men on their journey.

ac9okd,"Just got done reading parts of The Unfinished Tales. There is so much heartbreak and woe in Middle Earth that doesn't come through in the Hobbit or LOTR. The story of Turin shook me, hard. 

While hope is a main theme, I think coping with madness, strife, and hardship is really what makes the stories. Another quick synopsis from The Unfinished Tales. Little hope did Aldarion have that his marriage would last, but he continued to sail to Middle-Earth from Numenor to council with King Gil-Galad in the face of the renewed darkness from Angmar. In the end his daughter would resent him, his father never really understood him, and on his last voyage home as the Kings Heir he left without anyone sending him off, few people cared, and no one was there to welcome him when he came back. He was one of the greatest ship builders second to Cirdan, and still his life was viewed as wasted by his own peoples. Yet, he was paramount in supporting the Eldar as this new threat emerged. His people barely knew and sorely mistrusted him to the extent that little is said of his life as King of Numenor. His Middle Earth Cliff city of Vinyalonde fell into despair and ruin. Yet, still he returned to converse and coordinate with the Eldar against the Great Evil that was growing in the North.

Stories such as this have reminded me that there must be dark before light, despair before hope, emptiness before fulfillment. The depth of the Universe Tolkien created is incredible. ",jmgreen4,2019-01-04T17:56:11Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

wj8suk,"Well, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In Tolkiens book, the focus is on the Hobbits and their adventures. He makes this exceedingly clear in the ending with the Scouring of the Shire-- which involves no one but the Hobbits. He shows how the adventures of each Hobbit affected them and their ongoing lives once they had returned from 'the mythical journey'. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimili, Gandalf and Boromir are side characters who don't necessarily undergo relatable character development, they're mythical heros that we're not supposed to entirely relate to, though they embody qualities that we should aspire to have (great courage, nobility, etc). The movies shifted the focus onto the entire Fellowship and in doing so had to add definable arcs to particularly Aragorn-- but that missed the poignant mark Tolkien hit with the original timeless ending. It's not quite a 180 degree turn, but I always found it an subtle but very interesting (and criticizable) difference between the adaption and the original.",ruser8567,2022-08-08T23:45:23Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I don't agree that the point of The Hobbit was missed out either.

What seemed so far away from all these things at the beginning was proved to be no less a part of the entirety.

I get that films lend themselves much more to action & slapstick-comedy than to long dialogues and voice over internal thoughts that books can manage well, but it’s still a sad thing that Hollywood seems to feel that we want only action and special effects and shy away completely from personal growth and moral integrity. Some of my favourite books are really inspiring because the characters are brave enough to face up to their own flaws and do better.

2q528e,"*The Silmarillion* was published after Tolkien's death by his son, Christopher, and I believe it is shorter than Tolkien wanted; when he attempted to publish it shortly after WWII, he was refused on the grounds that it was far too long, requiring too many resources to print in consideration of post-war scarcity.

*The Silmarillion* may give you the wrong idea about Tolkien's writing style as in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. *The Silmarillion* is structured like a series poetic retelling of historical events, in the sense that there is no dialogue, and no overarching story. *The Silmarillion* covers thousands of years of history with few recurring characters. Perhaps the only character who appears from his subsequent fantasy works is Galadriel, and her name is only mentioned once, in passing.

I recommend against reading *The Silmarillion* first; it is a poetic history book, while *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are novels. Reading *The Silmarillion* last, I found more satisfaction than if I had read it first; it was a great way to experience more of the world after the stories were done.

If you are concerned about missing historical references, Tolkien wrote his two novels (if you include the Trilogy as one novel) so that you don't need to know any more history than is told to the characters. If you want to know more of the history, there are several volumes dedicated to the subject that are more complete than *The Silmarillion*: *The History of Middle-Earth*.",kaqmere,2014-12-23T04:10:44Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It was only expanded and given a greater meaning when he cooked up TLOTR. But this is an example of how he managed to tie the Hobbit to his other works in subtle ways one doesn't initially realize. Obviously though, *The Hobbit*, in terms of size, is a cookie cutter. Far too restrictive for the rest of the legendarium.

The ring takes the wearer into the sub-physical plane where Sauron has form. It's so that the two could come find eachother to bring Sauron back to the physical world. 

Sauron hasn't had ""form"" since the Valar zapped Númenor, and he with it. But before that, Sauron created the ring of power. Sauron instilled into that physical object all of his non-physical being, the very core of who he was. When his physical form was trashed, the ring still existed. It tied him to the physical realm.

Finish the books.  Savor every moment of the Trilogy and read them *slowly*.  Don't miss the passing references that seemingly have no context and most importantly don't skip the songs like so many do. Contemplate those poems as you read them... they're important.

Then read the *Silmarillion* and let your mind be blown as the nooks and crannies in the *Lord of the Rings* are filled in and made so much more... significant.

Once you've done that, watch the movies.  They're super fun, and visually a pretty good representation of Middle Earth.  I read the Hobbit and LoTR as a teen back in the 70s, and I am positive that I would've enjoyed them much less if my mind had been tainted by the fancy visuals of the movies beforehand.

Also, I recommend watching the Rankin Bass animated *Hobbit* which, while goofily representative of the time in which it was made, presents a much more accurate portrayal of the magic and childlike wonder of *The Hobbit* and Middle Earth in general than Jackson's quick-cut blockbuster Hollywood approach.

e2xwgk,"I think the order you mentioned would be just fine, The Hobbit followed by The Trilogy, but you could also do The Trilogy followed by The Hobbit and still be just fine. 

I believe The Hobbit is a bit more approachable and a good way to get your feet wet with Tolkien’s style. Be ready to encounter pages worth of “songs” or poems as well as various languages of elves and dwarves. It can sometimes throw people off, but if you embrace it you’ll find it just makes the world feel that much more immense. 

As far as watching the movies first, that’s totally your preference. It might help, but you don’t have to. I was in middle school when the films came out so I watched those first and absolutely loved them (still love them). They are for the most part faithful adaptations of the novels, with a bit of added Hollywood flair. The films inspired me to read the books and it was helpful to put a face with the names since at times you can be bombarded with scores of names and family lineages and places.  

I’ll end with this, I’m envious of you right now. Reading those books for the first time was probably the most memorable reading experience I had in my entire life and I owe a lot to them. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

After that read LoTR and have a great time.   
If you really enjoy the trilogy and want more then "" The *Silmarillion* "" is next. This again is different in tone and covers a large swath of the backstory and lore. Its almost a collection of short stories or novellas.

e2xwgk,"It really depends on you. 

If you want to go in totally blind then I would read The Hobbit and then start The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is a bit different in terms of tone and, while you don't have to read it to enjoy The Lord of the Rings, it does set up a number of plot points that are important later on. I think The Hobbit also serves as a nice intro to the world of Middle-Earth, which can be quite daunting in terms of its massive history.

That being said, The Lord of the Rings books are somewhat denser than The Hobbit and I wouldn't blame anyone for watching the films before starting the books. While The Lord of the Rings films are a superb adaptation of the books, they do differ at certain points but they will allow you to have a good understanding of the characters and plot before you dive into the books.  I would recommend you check out the Extended Editions, as they go deeper into the world of Middle-Earth and include a lot of great scenes that had to be cut from the theatrical versions due to time constraints. That said, I don't think you need to watch The Hobbit films before watching The Lord of the Rings. Those films stray very far from the book and feel more like fan-fiction than true adaptations like The Lord of the Rings films. As I've said, The Hobbit is less dense than The Lord of the Rings so I don't think you'll have any trouble diving into that. If I were you, I would:

&#x200B;

* Watch The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions
* Read The Hobbit
* Read The Lord of the Rings
* Watch The Hobbit films if you're interested
* If you still want more after that then there are a number of books Tolkien was working on prior to his death that were published. Plenty of important events happened thousands of years before The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and books such as The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales that detail such events.

 I don't think it will matter when you watch the films. I personally wouldn't watch the films first, but I don't think anything is lost by doing so.

5a53qj,"The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are novels, but Silmarillion is a collection of myths. Christopher Tolkien arranged the stories chronologically, so it may feel like a history book of sorts, but it's actually a pseudo-mythological cycle starting with creation and going all the way through Second Age.

So, in order to understand if it's somehting you want to read, keep in mind that it is neither a novel nor an adventure epic, but a collection of stories mimicking Tolkien's favourite mythological works (e.g. Kalevala). Also, consider reading stories seperately and not as a book, because Silmarillion the way we know it isn't a JRRT's creation but his son Chrostopher's. Some of it is pretty dull, while other parts are pretty nice, like the ones about Turin Turambar. As a 15 year old (Silmarillion was actually the book I learnt English with), I loved how grandiose yet authentic some of the stories felt, and it certainly amplified my appreciation of LotR for a while: I'd go round explaining, like, ooh, Gandalf's a nickname, real name's Olorin and he's a maia, which is a type of god, did you know? etc.",jeikaraerobot,2016-10-30T10:09:49Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

It's stories are great and several characters from the core books gain a level of importance, especially Elves like Galadriel. Reading it however without having recently  read tlotr and the Hobbit is ill advised.Read it to enrich the core books, alone its not that gread of a read.",Der_Kaiser_Von_EU,2016-10-30T09:26:11Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
5a53qj,"First, background. When I like a book, I keep a copy, and read it repeatedly.

As far as Tolkien goes, I've read both LotR and The Hobbit many times. Not so his other works. The Silmarillion? Once. Not only that, but I've tried to get back into it on several occasions, and utterly failed. That once was all there's going to be, in my case. Frankly, it's hard going.

If you happen to be enthralled by all that is Tolkien, you'll find it worthwhile. But, really, it's the ""historical"" back-story for the author's use. If you've ever, say, run an RPG campaign, it's quite possible that you've generated something similar - notes to yourself that you can call on when required, that make sense of what's going on, but are never intended to be seen by your players. Such story content as there is, is highly episodic; full of stories about characters mentioned in very brief passing in his other works, who meant something to Tolkien (and by implication his characters), but held very little interest for me.

5a53qj,"It's not for everyone.

The idea is that The Silmarillion is a religious text, a bit like the Old Testament or the elder eddas, etc - for the fictional world Arda, where Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are both set.

If I recall correctly, it begins with the creation myth, where Eru and his servants sing the world into existence, then it follows the creation of the major species - Elves, Dwarves, Humans and eventually Orcs - and then it talks about some of the heroes of what might be called the dawn age, and their exploits. There's the story of Beren and Luthien, there's the forging of the silmarils, and the children of Hurin, and several others, making up the mythos of the ancient world of Arda.

I think several of the individual stories in the Silmarillion are well worth reading, but that's me, and I can't speak for whether it's worth it for anyone else.

There was a time when I considered myself a huge Tolkien nerd. I even spoke a bit of Quenya, and even back then, I wouldn't have considered the Silmarillion to be one of the greatest books ever written - at least not for a broad audience, but it does what it sets out to do very well, and those who are interested in that sort of thing tend to treasure it highly.",Skrp,2016-10-30T15:13:34Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy
5a53qj,"I read this about 25 yrs ago. It's good. It's a creation myth and explains the reason-to-be for the Hobbit, and others including rings. It was written last and assembled into its final form by his son as it not was finished when Tolkien died. Regarding difficulty and dryness: Tolkien thought a really good fantasy book should read like history, and that means giving attention to lineages, who migrated where, names and so on. A good bit of detail then is given here as the elves, once they are created, migrated into various parts of the world. Dwarves come next, and humans last. This contrasts to books from CS Lewis, and others where there's no pretense to being real. So whether or not this appeals to you I think depends on your maturity, and how many fantasy books you've read. As you get older my guess you'll value it more. For example, my older kid likes Marvel movies less and less with each passing year for much the same reason: he realizes they are grounded in less and less reality inasmuch anybody can do anything to move along a plot, there's little correspondence between action and consequence, the plots are too similar, the dialog is poor, the characters are thin.",,2016-10-30T15:46:58Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

5a53qj,"Little Column A, Little Column B. 

The Silmarillion is the sort of thing Tolkien fans decide to read to get more into the universe, even though it's often dryer than the main series, and also less linear.

At the same time, The Silmarillion is a very experimental book. It's an attempt to mimic a Bible for a fictional universe, and the end result is excellent. It's just hard to appreciate the first time through, and most people do it because ""Well I like to think I'm a Tolkien fan, and this is *the* defining backbone for works regarding Middle-Earth"". 

It will be dry. You won't understand half of it the first time you read it. You'll probably need to re-read The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings, and then return to read it again, if you truly want to discover its magic.

It's a good book, just one that takes work to appreciate. And I don't think there's anything *wrong* with that; you're not entitled to an immediate understanding and enjoyment of a work. But you deserve a fair warning that, despite its short length, it's a mountain to climb.

The reason you only hear Tolkien fanboys discussing it is because they've gotten the most enjoyment out of it. It's sort of like Chaucer, or Homer: their works are great, but people specialized in English or Greek literature are going to understand the significance more than others. The Silmarillion is a dense book, and unless you're willing to pick away at it, you often won't come away with very much.

At the very least, I suggest reading some select chapters. Some of the early ones, regarding the creation of the world, are pleasant. My favorite, by far, is the tale of Turin Turumbar, which despite being only a single chapter, is one of the most well-told stories I've ever read. There's some really great stuff sprinkled throughout, but some chapters are entirely world-building for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

I'd consider re-reading Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, either before or after you read The Silmarillion. I'm not sure what would help you get through it: doing it first, to appreciate it better, or after, to avoid an overdose. Your choice. But noticing that ""oh, that guy is mentioned in Lord of the Rings!"", or ""This place's name has the same root word as that one guy"" will help you get the most out of The Silmarillion.",TheCodexx,2016-10-31T09:04:02Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

> Frodo: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
> 
> Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. 

I would start with *The Hobbit* first mostly because it's less daunting from a storytelling viewpoint. Tolkien tends to use very flowery descriptions and pages of songs referencing lore that's covered in more detail in the appendices, The Silmarillion, and other works outside the LOTR books. While beautifully done, given that *The Fellowship*, *Two Towers*, and *Return of the King* are technically two books each, it's a long haul. 

*The Hobbit*, in contrast, was designed to be a children's story, so it clips along at a quicker pace. You might find it easier to ease into Tolkien's writing style that way, or if you're feeling brave just dive headfirst into LOTR. 

It's worth pointing out though that not everything that happened in Peter Jackson's interpretation of *The Hobbit* actually happened in the book. He borrowed a lot material from the aforementioned appendices to flesh out the story. That isn't meant to deter you, just keep that in mind.

Those fucking hobbits are heroes who are criminally underrated in the films. Merry and Pippin especially. They throw themselves at orcs and men and ringwraiths. They show bravery in the face of near-certain death over and over. When they get back to the Shire and it's been overrun by villains, do they make some light jokes and sing? No. Merry rounds up a fucking hobbit army and they drive them out.

As a side note, the movies butchered Faramir too. He was perhaps the most noble character of all in the books, and they portrayed him as just another greedy dude on film.",CrubzCrubzCrubz,2018-08-15T12:21:23Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

There are some scenes they both nail, there are some parts where the book is much better, and there are a limited few parts (the bridge of khazad dum, the ride of the rohirrim) where I actually prefer the movie. Honestly Bernard Hill's portrayal of Theoden is so good I'm pretty sure Tolkien would have gone back and made some revisions if he ever saw it. 

Because they were so successful, and because they spawned a heap of imitators, people forget what an enormous risk Peter Jackson was taking when he made the LOTR films- he was trying to adapt hugely unwieldy source material to the big screen in a way that had never really been done before, with a stupendous budget to try and recover- although I hate what he did to the hobbit, with LOTR I think you have to accept he was never going to be able to slavishly adapt it and he had to make a lot of judgment calls.",juddshanks,2018-08-15T11:55:44Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

That turned into reading Two Towers and ROTK the following spring, months before the second movie was released.

My opinion on ""The Scouring of the Shire"" has changed a lot. When I first read it, I agreed with the filmmakers that it felt unnecessary, because the One Ring had already been destroyed. Shouldn't the story be winding down? Now I realize how important that part of the story is in order to show how the hobbits have changed. Their adventures have made them confident and capable enough to take their home back from Saruman.

97f7ad,"The LotR films were hardly rubbish.  The changes you mentioned as being the cause don't really line up.  Even in the book, Tom Bombadil was a character out of place.  He's a hard stop to the story, and feels way more like he belongs in The Hobbit.  It's as if Tolkien said, ""Hey, let's see Beorn again, but for no real reason.  Oh and he might just be the most powerful thing in existence...but then let's never mention him again for any substantial reason."" And yes I'm including the council when I say that, because it's clear that Tolkien had an ""oh shit"" moment at that point, realizing he'd forgotten about Tom and just wrote him out of the story there.  Tom is a fun character, but didn't fit in the book and certainly not in the movie adaptation.

As for Merry and Pippin, yes, in the book their role was help represent the rest of the world coming to the shire, and how the child-like people could deal with these problems.  They were part of the fellowship because of a sense of friendship, but also because once they learned of the danger, they wanted to help stop it.  In the movies, however, they were comic relief.  They had no reason to join (in the movies' rationale) other than the fact that they did so in the books.  The child-like innocence of the hobbits was dumped fully into them, and while they did have character arcs, their purpose was changed from in the book, so the Scouring wasn't needed as payoff.  They matured and came to the ""end"" of their journeys in Merry's companionship with Eowyn and Pippin's service to Gondor.  

Again, while both of these elements were fun in the books and many fans, including me, would have liked to see them in the movies, it certainly doesn't mean they are rubbish.",scribbane,2018-08-15T11:32:34Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

He serves as a pit stop, if you will, and while he is a neat character and is a hint at something larger in the world, there is no payoff to him.  Like I said, he feels like a misplaced chapter from The Hobbit, where these sorts of weird diversions did happen and then just went away.  

While reading the books, because there is so much world building sprinkled throughout, he seems to fit the tone initially.  Again, the movies are adaptations, and even altered the narrative slightly.  Because of Tom's ""flaws"" in the book, and the differing direction of the films, it makes perfect sense to me that old Tom got cut.

Because LotR has been out since the '50s while this book was published in 2007.

Reading it by itself misses a great deal of the focus, though. Besides the fact that it's not the first book (chronologically) dealing with the First Age (which means a great deal of context is missing in terms of why the fuck everyone is doing what they're doing), the major theme is to contrast what Túrin is doing in comparison with what Beren did in *Beren and Lúthien*. Túrin wants to be the next Beren, but everything is being twisted by Morgoth's curse and Túrin's own failings, and virtually everything he touches gets destroyed.

It's clearly more Christopher than J.R.R. in the prose (it's stilted as can be), though all the plot comes from J.R.R. It would never have become anything as big as LotR or Hobbit as written.",crazyike,2022-09-05T20:54:54Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

If you've never read Tolkien, The Hobbit's a great place to start (one of my all time faves). That being said, The Lord of the Rings is significantly more dense, a more ""adult"" take on Tolkien's world if you will.  

Btw, I've heard for newcomers, in LotR, Tom Bombadill is ""the wall"". He's a character left out of the movies, that can be fairly taxing to new readers to get through his part, but if you can, you'll do fine with the rest. Not sure I agree with that theory, but it may hold true for you. 

After LotR, try The Silmarillion (Tolkien Society suggests Tom Bombadill's poems, give em a go if you're so inclined).

Very often in the Hobbit I would be knocked out of the book by the narrative. Like you said the voice is too omniscient.

""In the first edition of The Hobbit, Gollum was characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. But to fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien revised later editions of The Hobbit: the version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf.""

And it helped me thoroughly enjoy the movies, and identify the liberties taken by the movies (I think the romance between the elven woman and the dwarf was unnecessary for those who see what I mean).",Fantasy_Witch333,2022-01-10T17:56:57Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

letnig,"High fantasy isn't really my thing.  But I was kind of pushed to it.  I was introduced to Dungeons and Dragons when I was 15, and like many became a bit obsessed.  The next year I had an English teacher put *The Hobbit* on her reading list -- it wasn't exactly required, there were 12 novels on the list and you had to read and write a report on 6 -- *The Hobbit* sounded more interesting than most so I read it.  It was clear from reading *The Hobbit* that much of D&D was based on Tolkien lore, so I went on to LOTR.

I really enjoyed *The Hobbit*, but to me LOTR rather drags and gets confusing by introducing too many characters with odd names that get hard to keep track of.

I have a pedantic streak that gets annoyed at LOTR being called a trilogy.  Tolkien wrote it as 6 books, but publishers chose to package them in three volumes.",DanTheTerrible,2021-02-08T11:17:41Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

I absolutely detest songs in novels. I always skip the songs in LOTR when I reread it (I've read it a dozen times at least so far, and I think I own four editions), as well as when I reread The Hobbit and Wind in the Willows. I love to write poetry, used to be a singer-songwriter, and I even put a Broadway song in the novel I'm writing. But because I hate reading or hearing poetry, I always skip that stuff when reading a novel. I really can't stand it.

Your post made me think about this more. I don't think it's just because I dislike poetry. I think it's because a lyric interlude feels very out of place in a novel (for me) because in the United States, culture as I know it in this country (where I grew up and live), people *don't* break into song in everyday life. For better or worse. It's just not a part of the culture; consequently, it feels and seems VERY ""off.""",suchathrill,2021-02-08T15:04:22Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Abject misery. 

I've never read LotR, but I loved reading The Hobbit, and had a varied, but mostly pleasant time, reading a variety of his other stories and tales. Silmarillion can go fuck rocks.

Like, the story of it is fantastic - it's that world's entire myth of creation, their bible if you will. The pacing, actual writing, organization, structure... absolutely abysmal. 

You have entire fucking \*pages\* of lineages, sometimes repeated shortly after, whereas some entire wars go by in a paragraph. Some really exciting plot points and events go by in a sentence, whereas several paragraphs are dedicated to fucking nothing... There is more nothing packed together than at times than I've ever remember reading in anything not named Moby Dick. It's not even a big book, but it feels fucking long.

YMMV, some people love it, but then again some people love the aforementioned Moby Dick, a book that, had I not known the author was literally paid by the word I'd have to assume was actually written by a complete sociopath who hates people.",ProxyDamage,2021-02-07T22:16:51Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

daz9k3,"This is the best time to read it, as it puts you in the same life stage as Frodo was, when he set on the journey.

The biggest issue I have with the films is that they made the Lord of the Rings into Yet Another Coming-of-Age Story. There is a very limited time jump between Bilbo's disappearance and the main story. At the Birthday Party, Frodo comes of age (he's 33) and, in the movies, he sets of for his journey shortly after. He is approximately the same age as Merry, Pippin and Sam.

In the books, by contrast, 17 years passed between those events. Frodo is 50, wealthy and accustomed to comfortable, if not luxurious life - very much like Bilbo in The Hobbit. Sam is 12 years younger, Merry 14 year younger, so they are young adults during main events of the book. Pippin is 28 when he sets off for Rivendell, so he is not even adult yet. This puts his behaviour in perspective.

This changes the perspective from ""we're young, let's have a crazy adventure"" to ""would you sacrifice your comfort and established position in the society to go on a suicidal mission?"". It's much easier to empathise with Frodo's dilemmas when you are around 40 than when you are 18.",skinnyraf,2019-09-30T09:00:00Z,The Hobbit,COMMENT,Fantasy

Luthien defeats Sauron & Morgoth. Instead of developing the characters that already existed, he had to put his hand in it as if Tolkein needed his help. I lost all faith in his 3 part opus.

 I guess to each their own.  

I know there’s a subreddit for the books and even the tv show, in which almost everyone who have read the books are completely disgusted in the show.

I really hated Tom Bombadil, but once I got past that and the Council of Elrond (an interesting chapter - just really long!), the books started to take shape for me. The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I read it in a week. I ended up having to read it again, more slowly and really enjoyed it. I recommend pushing through, it's really worth it, all of the characters are so much richer in depth in the books. 

I watched the films first, but I think doing it that way really helped me have an increased appreciation for the books and the way Tolkien wrote them.

The descriptions of hobbit life, and the minor characters you read about make for much better character arcs and a fuller story, especially at the end of the third book. There's a whole bit they didn't include in the movies there. And Tom Bombadil is the shit, don't get it corrected. 

Weathertop, Rivendell, and Caradhras sequences are great. But my God, the Moria scene? Unreal. The writing is so vivid that the images from the movie don't even dominate while reading it.

Largely the women are all carbon copies of one another with very little personality beyond coming off as extremely immature, constantly having temper tantrums and turning their noses up in the air (like Sapkowski's version of braid tugging imo). Only one that seemed to somewhat break that mould was Milva (you won't see her until Blood of Elves).

It works both ways. For example, Polish translations of Terry Pratchett's books are never as good as the English original.

Honestly I think the books benefit a lot from the games success. They’re good but not essential reading. 

The lore is decent. I like the world. The story/pacing loses momentum quite often. Frustratingly so. The last two books of the main saga took me a year to get through off and on.

16bmd8r,The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny are collections of short stories. They're not meant to have continuity; treat them as character introductions and worldbuilding. The saga starts with Blood of Elves.,seaworthy-sieve,2023-09-07T00:45:44Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy
q1c6mq,Which one did you start with? There's commonly a bit of confusion about the proper order to read them in (The Last Wish first ->). I've seen many people start with the first book that is not a collection of short stories (Blood of Elves) and that is definitely a mistake because it is the worst stand-alone book in the series especially if you haven't read the previous books.,Juuberi,2021-10-04T20:37:24Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy
q1c6mq,"I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the books. 

My big gripe about the show is not keeping in some scenes that really give people a clue about Geralt in general. The scenes they left out when hunting the Dragon, for instance, would have provided some comedy (the dwarves), the lethality of monster hunting (Sir Ike fighting the dragon), and Geralt's code of ethics (refusing to kill it because its sentient) without bogging things down in the stupid love triangle of dumbassery that the writers want to push. 

The most interesting thing about Geralt of Rivia isn't that he's banging Yennifer. 

They did treat the Last Wish correctly, though. It's only hinted at as to what the wish was.",Jezerey,2021-10-04T23:53:33Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy

75x6j1,"The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny are two collections of short stories. They are easily the best since both Sapkowski and the concept of the Witcher universe works best in that setting and short form. Witcher was conceived as a episodic format of stories published in fantasy magazines and then it was pulled together in Sword of Destiny with an overarching narrative in the form of an intertwined story.

Then it became huge in Poland which at the time was breaking out of communist bloc and had barely any western fantasy (except Tolkien, LeGuin and a few others) and the published wanted more so Sapkowski decided to write a saga.

The saga has 5 volumes plus the 6th rip-off after the games revived the character but it not nearly as good. Kind of  a slog and by the last two books you can get bored. Unless you like it.

But all the things which make is really smart and interesting in the stories are mostly gone.",kmar81,2017-10-12T17:53:13Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy

Finished the saga and sword of destiny and it remains one of my favourite series (as are the games).

From what I've heard, Polish speakers say the original versions are much better than the English due to how the author's style and mannerisms do not translate all that well into English. I suppose if you don't already speak Polish, you're not going to notice it. 

Out of the saga, I think Time of contempt is my favourite but overall I enjoyed the Last Wish the most (best chapter maybe being the lesser evil... It's been a long time since I read it). ",Brain_My_Damage,2017-10-12T20:46:08Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy

Then I got to Blood of Elves.  I hated BoE.  It just felt like a whole book of setup for very little payoff.  There wasn't even that much worldbuilding, but I did play the games first so maybe there I didn't recognize the worldbuilding for what it was since I knew that information.

After that it got a lot better, I really liked The Lady of the Lake and Tower of Swallows.  The characters grew on me, even if they were infuriating most of the time.

I ended up switching to the audiobooks because of all the dialogue and world-building. Reading the books was bad per se but they can really can drag on. Seasons of Storms has been a low point in the series for me. The Last Wish was awesome.

I will say that playing the video games and watching the Netflix series prior to reading the books has probably lowered my expectations of the books. I’m quite invested in the Witcher world at this point and the books are supplementing my previous exposure to all the characters, places, and events. If I had been been introduced to the series via the books, I’m not entire sure that I’d be reading them as eagerly as I am now.

As for your question regarding the books the show's based on, it's the first two (The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny), although far from everything in them has been used so far. Left as material for subsequent seasons perhaps.",vindicivuoto,2019-12-22T20:43:44Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy

3ki7p1,"As a native speaker of the original language I had the chance to read the books as they were being published in the early 90s.  While the saga is a standalone story the writer assumed that most of the people who bought it were already familiar with the stories as they were the second biggest thing in Poland after Tolkien where fantasy was concerned.   So the truth is many details, flavours and other small things might escape you if you didn't read the stories because Sapkowski was writing it largely on his own without much help from the publisher as the modern popular markets in Poland were only starting at the time. So there was no ""last time on the Witcher"" put into the saga - very few explanations and many characters or events are given on the go. They don't prevent you from enjoying the series even if you might feel a bit confused but if you read the books chronologically then you get a much better picture. There are two books ""The Sword of Destiny"" and ""The Last Wish"" (published 1992 and 1993 but the The Last Wish tells earlier stories narration-wise ) and I do recommend that you read them before starting the series.   Many things might get lost in the translation if its not up to par but you'll still be better prepared.

But then again some people like to explore the world, some don't.. take your pick.

EDIT: Oh and the series has many hidden political and social undertones. Most of them should be clear for a westerner but the saga is set in a world that makes some nods towards Polish history in XX century. I recommend you read a quick overview of what happened and then you might pick up interesting or funny details. 
The games were a bit too overt with some things but they are a different medium. And for fans of the books it was actually pretty funny to see those things realized.",pharmaceus,2015-09-11T08:28:17Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy

There are two books before Blood of Elves: The Last Wish, and the Sword of Destiny. Both are semi-connected short story collections which set up the events for books 3-7, which are one long story. You should read both of them, since they are the best books in the series. You don't need to read them chronologically, but you really should, since you will miss out on a lot of funny moments, character introductions, and the main ""a-ha"" twist at the end of the entire series if you skip the short stories.

After Sword of Destiny even the Witcher series changes a fair bit (morphs into epic fantasy). One thought is that you might want to try some old school sword & sorcery like Elric of Melbinone, Conan etc. Part of me also wonders if you'd be into something like The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold. It's not a very long book, is single pov involving curses/demons in a medieval setting, although not s&s or about a monster hunter. 

As far as the Witcher series itself, for me it was a mixed bag. I loved The Last Wish and Baptism of Fire because they were the most Geralt heavy. I loved Geralt as a character and wished more of the series had actually focused on him.

So there’s 1 book (The Voice of Reason chapters) and several short stories bracketing them. You can almost think of them as flashbacks bc they’re all different events which lead Geralt to where he is. Now, I think it’s a fascinating way to give you just enough of the world and the characters to want to know more, but not so much you’re thinking yea yea yea ... skiiiip.

The game series has 'flavoured' the marketing of the earlier books (and the US releases), but it hasn't had much of an effect except arguably be the catalyst for the UK releases (The Last Wish released roughly alongside The Witcher 1).

The translations aren't perfect, they're certainly not on the level of, say, a Murakami novel, but they're pretty readable. I haven't yet read the most recent translation (Baptism of Fire) through to completion, but it's pretty typical of the series. 

It's worth noting that the actual second book, Sword of Destiny, is due for release (at least in the UK) in May, with the rest of the series (except the latest book, the translation of which is yet to be confirmed IIRC) to follow in time. It was skipped for some reason but one or two of the stories are important as they lead into the novel series.

Oh, I didn't explain. The Witcher series is two anthologies and then a series of books. The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny come first, and they're collections of shorter works, and then the series starts properly with Blood of Elves.",,2015-02-03T08:56:40Z,The Last Wish,COMMENT,Fantasy
