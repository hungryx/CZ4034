1arcnnv,"Ah what a book!

The whole thing is like... I feel uneasy and nervous but not sure why... Just like this portion. Why is she so ashamed... What's that about?

I'd say it's her aversion to the idea of taking advantage or being manipulative. 

Shopkeeper: ""If you can manipulate your mistress to keep her coming back it'll be worth your while."" 

While not necessarily illegal or particularly immoral… the protagonists shame/embarrassment just speaks to how she is innocent, not conniving or selfish. 

This sneaky streak wouldn't have bothered Rebecca or Mrs Danvers and, almost her whole arc is about her fear of being manipulated or subtly controlled.",johnzer88,2024-02-15T13:42:08Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
1arcnnv,"I think this is the best explanation. Although class may come into it I think the point of the interaction is to show us the protagonist's character. Not only does she not accept the offer but she feels gross about the idea of it and picturing herself as the type of person who would accept. It also is an interesting contrast with other parts where she pictures herself as confident and knowing as Rebecca, not understanding what that actually entails until the reveal.",,2024-02-15T16:54:05Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

1arcnnv,"You also have to add religion into this. Historically, royalty was seen as having a divine right to rule, and therefore if something went wrong (losing a war, not having a male heir) it was quite literally your fault and a message from God that you had lost His favour through some sinful transgression. Conversely, becoming king was a sign from God that you were the best person for the job and morally pure.

Extrapolate that downwards, and you get a class mentality that people who are born into wealthy families are naturally morally superior, and people who are poor are innately morally inferior. The upper class are the moral gatekeepers of society (hence rich people not only patronising churches and individual clergymen, but having  an unquestionable right to decide who is worthy of patronage). If someone is in a ""better"" trade they are literally a better person. 

Similarly, if someone rises through the ranks via trade (think Captain Wentworth in Persuasion) they become more socially acceptable not just from having more money but because their success itself indicates moral superiority. God has indicated their worthiness by allowing their choices to result in good things.

Conversely, women were not seen as decision makers in marriage - men choose a wife - so a woman who rises above her station through marriage is morally questionable. It's what happens *after* such a marriage takes place that determines her worth; if she is a success (children, social success), then again God is ratifying her rise in station. If she is a failure, it's proof that she was not meant to have the role to start with and is morally not good enough. Rebecca's social success helps to hide her moral failings, whereas the protagonist's social stumbles aren't just gauche, they are in some sense indicative of being fundamentally bad/wrong for the role.",Comfortable_Fig_9584,2024-02-16T09:08:01Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

ytbt3j,"I don't know if it's in every copy, but the commentary in mine by Sally Beauman about Daphne Du Maurier's personal life playing into her treatment of both Rebecca and the narrator had me thinking about this book for WEEKS after reading it. 

She talks about Du Maurier's life, being bisexual and having past relationships with women before marrying someone quite conservative and moving to Egypt and having to be 'a proper wife'. Beauman talked about Du Maurier possibly basing both the narrator and Rebecca on the different sides of her personality, as she's not exactly censuring or endorsing either of them by the end. She's both sympathetic AND critical of both women, showing a conflict between the two sides of her own self.

She makes another great point, that despite this being the narrator's story, we leave with Rebecca's name on our lips and our memory. 'Well behaved women rarely make history' and all that.

ytbt3j,"Rebecca was published in 1938….I always pictured Maxim as an older man, old enough to have served in wwi. 

‘What about the poor wife?’  Yes, what about the poor fucking wife.",AJFurnival,2022-11-12T17:25:07Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"Yes! I love Rebecca, and I’m always happy when other readers discuss the really fascinating gender dynamics that Du Maurier was exploring. I 100% agree with basically everything Beauman explores in her excellent afterword - including her theory that Rebecca as a character represents a threat/alternative to Maxim’s patriarchal and class power. The last straw that causes him to murder her is when Rebecca threatens to bring up an illegitimate son as Maxim’s heir and inheritor of Manderley, breaking his line by doing so. Maxim’s entire identity lies in his gender and class power (and passing down this power to his sons), and what he truly hates so much about Rebecca is not that she’s cruel, but that she doesn’t play by his rules, or societal rules. 

Rebecca, although not entirely an innocent victim by all accounts, nonetheless represents a powerful foil to Maxim’s patriarchal world. Our unnamed narrator, on the other hand, is desperate to submit to Maxim in order to gain his approval, despite how unhappy this makes her. The scene where she realizes that Maxim pets her the same way he pets the family dog is so incredible and darkly funny! 

My favorite scene is the the last few pages of the novel, where the narrator dreams that she and Rebecca are merging into one person, and that they use their long hair to hang Maxim. She then wakes up to discover that Manderley, that long-standing symbol of Maxim’s power, is in flames. So powerful!!",_gothicghost_,2022-11-13T06:49:10Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"Reading the comments also made me realise something else too. Maxim inadvertantly drew attention to his guilt via the complete 180 in how he treated his 2nd wife after Rebecca's boat was found. Everyone at the fancy dress ball would have noticed the distance between the newlyweds. The servants would have heard and gossiped about how Maxim yelled at her evening of the ball. How he didn't even ask to speak to his wife when he was away. Bea is shocked Maxim didn't buy her a bridal wardrobe or any wedding gifts outside of the hairbrushes, she implies he was very conscientious with Rebecca. This is echoed by the many peers/tennats who use the lack of newlywed treatment to petition another ball. 

For Colonel Julyan, likely to have heard these rumours/whisperings and seen for himself the distance between the newlyweds at the ball 3 days before he's called to assist in confronting Favells blackmail, arriving and seeing Maxim thick as thieves with the wife he previously disdained must have been the 1st 🚩",excel_pager_420,2022-11-13T00:52:04Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"I disagree that their sexual relationship started with the confession. She says that their honeymoon was carefree, and that he was attentive and ardent, her friend and lover. It wasn’t until they returned to Manderley that he resumed being distant and cold, now realizing that the specter of Rebecca and his personal demons haven’t dissipated. 

I always found it weird that they had separate bedrooms, but apparently that wasn’t at all unusual for the wealthy. Plus it does lend to her loneliness and isolation. 

I agree that he set her up to fail by sending her into this incredibly new situation and social status absolutely blind. I don’t think he purposefully set her up to fail. He wasn’t considerate. But I’m not sure, really. I also don’t believe he was grooming her with malicious intent. More so, he was attracted to her because she was so guileless and opposite Rebecca in every aspect. But it comes down to whether you believe his account of her murder or not, and I do. 

I think Manderley had to burn to set them free. As much as they loved Manderley, Rebecca’s presence there was too overbearing. The ending is so open ended. Who is to say that they remain unhappy and homeless forever? I think they will eventually settle down somewhere. And probably be happy enough - surely not more unhappy than any other mediocre marriage out there.

I do think that he wanted her companionship, at the very least. One thing that struck me was the way he listened to her prattle on when they would meet up in Monte Carlo. Of course, he was reserved and keeping his big secret. But still. In my experience, at least, abusive oppressive men don NOT want to listen to you talk about yourself. That’s one thing I’ll give to Maxim - he seemed genuinely interested in her life, at least at that point.",doingtheunstuckk,2022-11-22T16:49:59Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"This is what I think:

1. Rebecca is the main character of the book.  Even though she is dead as the book takes place, she is still the center of what takes place.
2. Maxim loved Rebecca until she confronted him with who she really was. Up until that point she had played a role. He cared enough about his family name to put-up with her actions and I think he may have still cared enough about her to try to make it work until her actions became too flagrant. This is England in the 1930's.
3. The attraction of the 2nd Mrs DeWinter had for Maxim is her innocence. She is very different from Rebecca. I believe that he fell in love with her but held back because he was afraid that Rebecca's body would be found.
4. You comment that Maxim enjoyed treating his second wife  badly but I think a lot of that was to keep the reader in the dark as to what is really going on. Mrs. Danvers manipulates situations to cause trouble. Such as advising the 2nd wife on her outfit for the masquerade party, knowing full well Max will be shocked. 
5. Rebecca's greatest fear was dying a painful death in bed. We know this because Mrs. Danvers tells the second Mrs. DeWinters this. When Rebecca got her diagnosis from a doctor in London she called her cousin Mr. Favell and left a message for him to meet her in the cottage on the beach. I don't know exactly what she planned to tell him if she got through to him, but he was her back-up.  If she couldn't lie to Max and have him kill her, she wanted Favell to do so.
6. Max shoots Rebecca.  It is planned by her.  She planned to ruin his life to secure a release for her. She damaged his life but not completely because of the woman he married the second time.",,2022-11-13T05:17:08Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,I know this is an older thread but I would like to suggest reading Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman. The book is a sequel to the Daphne du Maurier novel Rebecca and is officially approved by the Du Maurier estate,Existing_Ad866,2024-02-23T20:58:02Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"Rebecca is a story that depicts the 'imprisonment' of its characters in terms of their gender roles, class levels, and social expectations during the 1930's. Most of the story takes place at a fictionalized estate in Cornwall named Manderlay; largely based on a property that Du Maurier herself had refurbished.  The fictionalized story unfolds between the period of the great wars and does not include other world events such as the Depression etc.. These events are not shown in the story to have a bearing on the characters overall.  The narrator of the story is the protagonist, the newly married 2nd wife of Maxim DeWinter. Du Maurier once suggested that her name was Daphne also. Regardless, the unnamed narrator in the story of Rebecca does not allude to her name because the narrator's reflections structure the tale. Maxim De Winter was taunted into murdering his 1st wife Rebecca when Rebecca lied to Maxim that she was pregnant by one of her lovers. Rebecca is initially depicted in the story as a successful and accomplished wife but is later shown to be a sociopath and a serial cheater. In the story, the underlying inference is that rather than being pregnant, Rebecca would instead soon die of a debilitating disease and that is not something she could tolerate. Hence the taunting of Max De Winter, her then husband, to shoot her, place her body in her sailboat and then to scuttle the boat.",retread2017,2022-11-12T20:33:25Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,"y'all are reading way too much in imo.   i mean, fill your boots if it's fun, but it's funny to me to read this and see what a difference generational awareness can make.  

i wasn't born until 1965, but even in those days and among my (atypically older) parents' generation, i have seen TONS of long-standing marriages that were 'comfortably' on a very formal standing.  yes, even after 50 years together.   in the 70's i had a piano teacher who was probably born around the turn of the century, who never called her late husband anything but 'mr x'.   yet she was entirely content with her marriage and how her life had worked out; and she was not an oppressed nitwit either.    

many of my parents' age-peers were the same.  it wouldn't have worked for me, doesn't probably work for anyone alive now.  but that's no reason to presume it did not work for folks from the time when it was a norm.

rebecca is a really well-written book.  i like the sinister atmosphere and the suspense part that relates to the murder, but to me it's also an emotional thriller.   the payoff feels too imbalanced to ever work for me, but i'm happy to take it at the face value of what du maurier wrote.",Dazzling-Ad4701,2022-11-13T04:49:37Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
ytbt3j,I have that in my novel too!! I haven't read all of it but the parts I read blew my mind.

ytbt3j,"You know, I thought about this. But the marriage to Rebecca seemed to have lasted over a decade. It's implied they were married in their 20's. So I thought maybe Maxim was young enough/rich enough to avoid being drafted, as the novel avoided any particular dates. Especially as they never make any reference to Maxim being in the military. Compared with all the military related jabs Favell manages to get in about Colonel Julyan, whose in the book for like 10 mins. And the war was presumably before the narrator was born.

Although maybe everyone was doing that thing we're doing with COVID, where we don't explicitly mention it because the trauma is ongoing and we all want to move on? And we understand when we read something where the person references 2020 or 2021 and says, *due to circumstances* they mean the pandemic. But in a 100 years time people might be like wait, why is everyone in this novel excusing that snappy short-tempered character just because they work in medicine/as a delivery driver/postal worker/insert other essential job? 

A contemporary reading sees it as Maxim referencing his time in war. A modern reading reads it as an reference to Maxim not being new to murder 🧐",excel_pager_420,2022-11-12T18:26:14Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

ytbt3j,"Oooh interesting!! So how I came to my conclusion and why it's so different to this is that I don't believe Maxim told the truth. Sometimes reading the book I was wondering if the narrator was telling us everything, you can tell she's unhappy but she keeps lying to herself until after the ball. So because of this,

1) Agreed, the book is named after Rebecca
2.)I don't believe this happened exactly the way Maxim says it did. As much as he says he hated Rebecca even before they moved into Manderly together & claims he was lying throughout, it's odd that so many characters that knew Maxim+ Rebecca very well only noticed their unhappiness in the years before Rebecca's death. Or in the case of Danvers knew the marriage was a sham but believed Maxim had genuine love those 1st few years.

3.)I don't believe Maxim ever loved the narrator. I think he wanted someone compliant, no family or friends, the opposite of Rebecca. He claims he loved her innocence but before the confession he gets irritated every time she displays it.

4.)Mrs Danvers manipulates 2 situations max. And even with the ornament situation, Mrs Danvers doesn't force Maxim to engage in a conversation with her about how stupid it was that his wife hid the pieces like a child in front of his wife. Very unusual behaviour for the master of the house to publicly scald the mistress of the house with a servant. Throughout the novel they wait to have important conversations when the servants aren't present. That's the world they live in. And Danvers isn't there when Maxim is awful to his wife after their first day at Happy Valley and then the beach. Or when he gets annoyed in Monte Carlo and stops the car and opens the door and tells her to hop out in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country if she doesn't like what she hears and then drives her back to the hotel knowing she's in tears. Or when his marriage proposal involves calling her a fool and admitting he's being a brute to her. It's one thing for the author to give us misdirection. It's another to make one character treat the other so badly, that Mrs Van Hooper warning this marriage isn't a great idea sounds like the most sensible thing she says as you're reading it.

5.) We can't know this exactly. Don't forget Rebecca often spent nights on the cottage alone. So there was nothing about that particular night which meant she could have predicted Max would follow her down to the cottage with a gun. She'd been there having midnight picnics & allegedly banging her cousin for years with his knowledge and he'd never done such a thing. Maxim doesn't mention anything in particular Rebecca left out to taunt him.

6.) We simply can't know this. This is what Maxim tells us. Could that be his way of easing his conscience? Killing a women who's told you she's pregnant would feel less evil if you believed you were used as a tool in her final master plan. It comes down to whether you trust and believe Maxim is an honest, reliable character. If you do, than this is what happens. If you don't, it's all part of the novel, wondering what Rebecca would have told Favell had he seen the note and followed her down, and who Rebecca really was.",excel_pager_420,2022-11-13T11:59:24Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

ytbt3j,"I don't really understand the point of your comment tbh. It's ok if you perceive it as portraying a normal romance, similar to the many relationships you witnessed growing up, so you read it as a tame emotion thriller and leave it at that.

But to say I'm reading into it with modern sensibilities because the discovery that the husband murdered his 1st wife believing she was pregnant was less shocking in the 1930s than it is today is untrue. The 1940 Hitchcock film of Rebecca, released 2 years after the book was 1st published, turned Rebecca's death into an accident because people felt so strongly that Maxim shouldn't get away with murdering a women he believed to be pregnant.

I'm sorry that you witnessed and normalised so many cold marriages, but in the world of *Rebecca* it's established from the moment Mrs Van Hooper spots Maxim that everyone believed Maxim to be devoted to Rebecca, everyone believed they had this unbelievably loving marriage and that was part of what made Manderly so popular. Spending time with this glamorous larger than life couple. Most people the narrator meets are shocked at how different Maxim is with her and it's one of the things that convinces her Maxim is still in love with Rebecca.

>I always loved the 14 yo girl who studied the book with me and exclaimed in outrage: he’s got away with murder because he’s posh!

She really got to heart of the issue!! That's the same thing Favell says in *Rebecca*. And the narrator acknowledges it too, she comments thank god Favell was drunk and yelled and didn't communicate the way people of Maxim & Colonel Julyan class communicated. You can even tell that Colonel Julyan realised Maxim was guilty & Frank & the narrator accomplishes. He couldn't look any of them in the eye. But because of Maxim's position in society he advises them to move abroad and promises to get the word out that Rebecca was ill to clear their name.

 It seems relevant because a) Rebecca was of that same time and involved people of similar class, and b) the longevity and apparent contentment of those real-world couples offers an alternative interpretation to the ones offered here.  

You questioned the ”point” of my contribution.  Open discourse? Variety in points of view?  Freedom of opinion?  I felt I had something to say?   Something like some of those things.",Dazzling-Ad4701,2022-11-13T18:12:45Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

It's 3/4 days later that Manderly is burned down and she enters the life she has at the beginning of the novel where she obsesses over her 3 months at Manderly while babysitting a Maxim is affectionless, deflated, aimless without Manderly.

The narrator isn't even in her mid-20s living like an elderly retired couple. It's the perfect situation for resentment to grow, for the narrator to realise more and more each year she was taken advantage of. No Manderly so no servants to put on a show for. In such controlled conditions, Maxim can interpret the littlest things the way he interpreted Rebecca's behaviour and dispose of her for someone even younger and more malleable.",excel_pager_420,2022-11-13T00:23:54Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

What always strikes me as so odd, is that she thinks about how Beatrice would feel when she visits Manderley - the house she grew up in. It is not about lost family members or the relationship with her brother - no narrator wonders what Beatrice might feel about the goddam house.

Narrators obsession with Manderley is of cause a mirror of Miss Denvers love for Rebecca. And it mirrors the rising difficulties of English country estate owners to keep their properties which grew harder and harder after WW1.

In my opinion, the burning Manderley is a symbol of a whole burning social class.",PureChaos4704,2022-11-13T12:27:31Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

pzmiwt,"Many Gothic romances really build upon the helplessness of the woman involved, the rather pitiful array of virtues of the ""hero,"" and the subtle horror of the situation (and by extension, women's lives in general.) Rebecca just took those elements and turned them into an unreliable narrative in a way. If you re-read it, it is more obvious that good old Mr. DeWinter was a douche and Rebecca herself had severe problems that were definitely not just being a bitch (her relationship with her nanny? Seriously screwed up.) The unnamed heroine is supposedly liberated at the end, but is she really? No, because she's still married to a murderer and now bonus ptsd. It's a freaking tragedy-- oddly enough my daughter and I were just discussing it in regards to an unreliable narrator. The unnamed heroine is misinformed, not lying, but it's an interesting read the second time when you know the ""secret.""",Swerve_Up,2021-10-02T03:39:16Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
pzmiwt,"I think the true horror of the novel is the corruption of the main character. At the start she is presented as something of a blank slate. DuMaurier makes a big point of her youth & naivete & it kind of feels like her character arc will be something of a hero's journey. She will emerge from the book's events stronger, more sympathetic, less gullible, etc. Instead, we see her:

*Rejoice in the murder of her 'rival'.
*Take no thought or care for whether Rebecca really was pregnant at the time or the fate of the baby.
*Find her big moment of 'strength' in being a little ruder to the staff.
* Help cover up a murder.

Because it's written in such a tight 1st person POV, the horror of what she's doing & the woman she is becoming is written as being good & empowering. The ending is written as something of a happily ever after. But, that is simply more unreliable narration. Of course the narrator will portray her actions as justified, even if, reading between the lines, we know they were deeply wrong. Of course she will claim it was all worth while even if we get a glimpse of the misery it's caused. We are only getting her side of the story.",,2021-10-02T14:14:36Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
pzmiwt,"I'm not sure there's supposed to be a lot of character growth. It's the inherently unhealthy story of two emotionally downtrodden people who fall into a codependent relationship.

---

Maxim comes off as a man with a weak-willed streak who was trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage, with a manipulative wife who didn't love him and had open affairs in front of him -- including sleeping with her brother-in-law. When Maxim threatened to divorce her, she told him it'd never happen. Then Maxim lashed out with the ultimate violence because Rebecca claimed she was going to give birth to her lover's child -- a child that would have legally been considered his and legally entitled to all that was his.

Then even after she's dead, he can't be rid of her. His house becomes a shrine to the angel that never was and all the while he's pretending that he mourns the hateful woman he killed.

Rebecca, by all descriptions, seemed a savvy enough woman to know exactly what she was doing by telling him she was pregnant. It was suicide by another hand ... and if she thought she could take him down with her, that was probably a bonus. She seemed to have had zero remorse for any of her actions, a red flag if there ever was one. Little fear either, except for the fear of a lingering death.

The only sympathetic descriptions of Rebecca come from her lover and Mrs. Danvers, neither of whom are impartial. And Mrs. Danvers kept bullying and humiliating the narrator, not to mention trying to drive her to suicide, so her version of Rebecca is incredibly suspect in a book full of unreliable impressions.

So I can feel *some* sympathy for Maxim when it comes to such a marriage. And his lack of remorse about her murder makes sense in the context of an abuse victim killing an abuser -- I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep if my own abuser shuffled off the mortal coil.

---

As for the second Mrs. de Winter, she comes off as an incredibly lonely person who is happy even with the smallest scraps of affection , even when they're delivered with put-downs/verbal abuse from her husband (who may have very well learned to have mistake cruel terms for affectionate ones). She has an inferiority complex and constantly compares herself with and is compared to the false front of Rebecca. She thinks she is plain, foolish, and emotionally weak, even when other characters contradict those thoughts.

The narrator ends up having no choice really about being tough on the staff. Mrs. Danvers was insubordinate about the narrator from the start, going against Maxim's orders to have the staff come out to greet the narrator for the first time. When she finally started giving reasonable orders to the staff, Mrs. Danvers complained that it wasn't what Rebecca would've done. Staff intimidating the mistress of the household wasn't really something that would've been all that sympathetic in the time period.

When it turns out that her fears were based on lies and that her husband actually loves her, she protects him. His innocence is false, but it's fitting given the falseness Rebecca showed the world.

---

By the end, the narrator and Maxim have each other without any lies in the way, but his beloved house is burned down, the specter of Rebecca's murder will always hover over them, and Mrs. Danvers helped Rebecca triumph one last time over those tormented by her in life and death.",i_bite_right,2021-10-02T18:25:54Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
pzmiwt,"What stood out for me is how insecure BOTH of the main characters are. Maxim is so insecure that he feels compelled to murder his wife rather than let his reputation be damaged and then spends the rest of his life wallowing in fear. Mrs. De Winter is so self conscious and timid that she literally cannot explain to her husband that her own servants are bullying her.

That’s why, after the murder is revealed, they can resume loving each other — they’re a perfect match! They complement each other’s insecurities and can be paranoid together. The fantasy that kicked off the book — Maxim pretending to be a worldly, confident man who swoops young women off their feet, and Mrs. DeWinter as the careless young thing that can devote her feelings to him — is shattered. Now they are exposed to each other, which leads to a codependent kind of equal and honest relationship.

pzmiwt,"I just finished reading the book not too long back and the ending felt rather abrupt to me :( _x000D_  
_x000D_  
While reading, I got carried away with the twists, rooting for Maxim to escape the accusations (only for the sake of the narrator). I felt terribly sorry for her. But the sympathy quickly led me to realise what a horrible man Maxim was.  _x000D_  
_x000D_  
I was angry with not just the murder, but also the fact that he might have been manipulative with her - confessing his love only after admitting to the murder. From the details the narrator expressed earlier, there was no inkling of intimacy nor was there a spark of love after she moved. Furthermore, Maxim was very much older than her and knew very well how he could toy with a young, naive girl’s emotions who was inarguably so besotted with him. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
This then brings me to question if Rebecca was truly as horrible as he described her to be. She was the sort of person who travels and sails independently and was greatly admired by Mrs. Danvers who equates Rebecca to being intelligent, confident, beautiful, and a woman who can’t be stopped. Such unconventional qualities might have irked Maxim, especially after I learned about the social construct of the period this book was written. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
Also, I don’t accept adultery; just laying out possibilities here. Rebecca might have cheated on Maxim because there were already problems in the marriage (just like the second one) and she was exploring her sexual needs. Maybe this might have been the darker side of Rebecca, but IMO it’s Maxim that I’m more skeptical of",thi0092,2022-05-17T03:32:09Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

God, I was pissed when I finished reading and watching Rebecca.  I can think of some real live marriages like hers and it's terrifying which is why it's good horror.

1. Isolation: He isolates her from everything she knew.
2. Neglect: Retains Mrs. Danvers and doesn't even cross his mind that it would be awkward for her and Danvers is plain spiteful.
3. Emotional: Yells at her for stupid shit that is his fault.
4. Blame Shifting: Blames her for being inexperienced when she talks of gossip.

pzmiwt,"This is a very old post but I'm seeing this take so often and it's really baffling me that people are saying Rebecca was actually being misrepresented by Maxim. 

Other characters in the story admit that she's awful, Beatrice got the sense that she wasn't as nice as she pretended to be, Frank gets incredibly uncomfortable talking about her because he can't exactly say ""the previous woman was a bitch"", we have no real textual evidence to suggest that Max is lying or misrepresenting the truth.

 Danvers is obsessed with her and very openly says that Rebecca was a cruel, scheming and conniving person that openly mocked people behind their backs after pretending to be nice to them. That she treated people like toys to play with and enjoyed playing games specifically designed to hurt them. 

Heck, she even bullied the disabled bloke and threatened to send him away to the asylum often enough that he's terrified anytime he talks to people from Manderley that they're going to institutionalise him. If that's not meant to be a reflection of her character then idk what else could convince people.

I find it so bizarre with all of the very clear textual evidence to support Max's description of Rebecca, that people pretend she was a victim of Max's controlling behaviour. By all accounts, she was awful and no doubt would fit the profile for some pretty disturbing levels of traits highly associated with personality disorders. 

I like applying a feminist lense to literature whenever I can, but this instance seems incredibly misplaced. Does the book frame the system in which the story takes place as oppressive? Obviously.

She and Max may have had an open marriage arrangement, but her behavior still went far beyond any acceptable behavior. Being discreet about her affairs was supposed to be part of the deal, not sleeping with her brother in law, trying it on with the Manderley staff, and getting pregnant by her alcoholic cousin. There isn't one sympathetic character in the whole book as far as I'm concerned, other than some side characters like Frank or Ben. 

I started reading My Cousin Rachel right after I finished Rebecca and I actually am enjoying it a lot more.

When the truth about Rebecca's personality and Maxim's killing comes out at the end, however, both Maxim and the main character need each other to an equally desperate amount to continue living (and create a false sense of normalcy), especially once Manderley burns down.

When I saw the year that Daphne Du Maurier wrote the book and the difference between this and My Cousin Rachel in terms of writing quality, it begins to make a lot more sense. It's just unfortunate that anyone would hold Rebecca up to a standard that anyone would want to think is positive in any way. I know Mrs. Danvers is an unreliable narrator who's a bully and is obsessed with Rebecca, but what she said about her did align with what other people said about her behavior. 

I'm reading it as an adult who went through an experience similar to the narrator in some ways, but it's easy for me to see Rebecca for who she is and Max for who is.

I did read Wikipedia, and I found nothing regarding identical passages that could be considered ""detailed.""  The Wikipedia article for Daphne du Maurier states: ""According to Nabuco and her editor, not only the main plot, but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied.""  But there are not examples, and the citation for that statement is just a citation to the book A Sucessora itself.  

This blog post was very comprehensive: [https://theblankgarden.com/2021/01/13/a-trail-of-books-on-carolina-nabucos-a-sucessora-the-sucessor-1934-and-the-plagiarism-charges-against-daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca-1938/](https://theblankgarden.com/2021/01/13/a-trail-of-books-on-carolina-nabucos-a-sucessora-the-sucessor-1934-and-the-plagiarism-charges-against-daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca-1938/)  (Amazingly detailed post, btw - impressive amount of work.)

The blog's author quotes a couple of passages that use some very similar imagery, but nothing that is identical or ""the same.""  

If there are identical passages, it should be easy to show that, but I can't find anything that says, ""Here is a sentence from A Sucessora (translated to English), and here is a sentence from Rebecca.  Look, these are all the same words.""

The most compelling thing that I found (from that blog post) is that there are two passages that both reference the first wife arranging flowers (""flowers"" in one, ""lilacs"" in the other) and the first wife's body leaving imprints in the couch cushions.

wc5xuq,"Mrs. Danvers burned Manderley, in revenge. She realized Maxim must have killed Rebecca, even though he got off legally. It's poetic irony because everything he did originally, in marrying Rebecca and putting up her infidelity all those years was for the sake of Manderley, to promote its beauty and reputation. He killed her to keep someone else's child from inheriting it. He sold his soul for Manderley, so to speak, but then Manderley has become so linked to Rebecca that he can't get away from her while he's there. Manderley burning is both his punishment and the thing needed to let them finally put Rebecca away completely.

Daphne du Maurier considered it a study in jealousy. The protagonists lack of a name is indicative of how she feels invisible and overlooked the whole time.",Far-Adagio4032,2022-07-30T20:13:05Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

Mrs. Danvers burned down Manderly because she was super protective of Rebecca, and felt that the second Mrs. de Winter was a disgrace and disapproved of their love.

Nooo! The whole point of the novel is that the protagonist always lives under the shadow of Rebecca. She always feels like she's being judged and looked down on by others, and that she can't live up to the standard that Rebecca set before her.

It's not completely unambiguous, but I definitely read that as being the author's way of letting us know that they did have a complete marriage in the beginning. It's true when he first asks her he describes the proposed relationship in very non-sexual terms--her duties will be almost the same as they are with her current employer.

rpee8s,">The main character not having a name

Ahhh I loved that personally. It just furthers how much of a replacement she is for the ghostly and overly-mentioned Rebecca.

>supposedly we're supposed to hope he gets away with it?

We're not supposed to root for him

>reeked of her insecurity

That's the point, her reaction to finding out her husband is a murderer is supposed to horrify you

It's not a romance, at least not in the positive sense. It's more horror than anything. In her day, the author was distraught to find out that people thought it was supposed to be empowering for the main character or that it was supposed to be some great romance.

Like all good psychological horror, it plays tricks on your mind. Just because the main character believes these things doesn't mean the audience is supposed to agree with her. It's very much an abusive relationship and the main character doesn't realize it.",,2021-12-27T05:11:10Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
rpee8s,"This is my favorite book of all time so I'm ready to fight you! (Mostly kidding, different strokes for different folks and all that.)

I will say that I strongly disagree that we're ""supposed"" to root for Maxim and his second wife. Our narrator certainly wants us to, but ultimately I think du Maurier created a ""heroine"" who we're supposed to empathize with but be *very* critical of. *Rebecca* is, to me, a psychological examination of the pitfalls of insecurity, codependence, and relationships with an imbalanced power dynamic.

I also disagree that the de Winters ""came out on top."" Again, this is something the narrator is trying to convince us of, but in my opinion that's because she's too insecure to admit that she's miserable. And she and Maxim do seem miserable: she's as in love with him as ever, but he doesn't seem to care about her any more than he did in the beginning. They have no home but roam from city to city, constantly on the run, with Manderley haunting our narrator's dreams. (However, I do agree that I wish they hadn't have gotten away with it—well, what I *most* wish is that the narrator would have had the strength of character to turn her husband in, but this would have been the next best thing.)

Finally, a note on the Jane Eyre comparisons: I do think du Maurier wrote it as a response to Jane Eyre, but I don't think she wrote it as a retelling. Instead, I think she's commenting on a number of elements that she sees as dangerous. In both novels, there's a massive power imbalance between the hero and heroine: the hero is significantly older, more romantically experienced, and well-situated financially and socially, while the heroine is young, naïve, friendless, and penniless. Jane Eyre has a strong enough character, and Rochester a willingness to show humility and treat her as an equal, that their relationship is able to overcome these challenges. But the narrator of *Rebecca* is insecure and lonely, and Maxim apparently is only interested in keeping her around because he likes being adored, and so their relationship is an unhappy and corrupting one.

>The main character only becomes empowered AFTER HER HUSBAND CONFESSES HE MURDERED REBECCA. WTF. It was so quick and sudden and reeked of her insecurity

I definitely agree with this. For me, this was the big ""twist"": not that Maxim murdered Rebecca (which I saw coming fairly early on), but the narrator's reaction.

All told, I love this novel not despite, but because of the narrator. I identify strongly with many of her personality traits, and seeing that recognized and explored on the page is incredibly cathartic and freeing…and also gave me a lot to think about. I also really love du Maurier's prose and very atmospheric writing style—gothic settings are my favorite, and nothing has ever topped Manderley.

rpee8s,"I feel like you are annoyed that the book tells a story about people who behave in this or that way rather than moralizing? Yes this man murders his wife. Yes his new young wife's entire identity is wrapped up in her relationship to him. Yes he gets away with it. Yes his vulnerability in his secret crime being exposed gives his wife an opportunity to feel some equality in their relationship between each other. Daphne DuMaurier wrote psychological thrillers about really complicated people. The fact that she's not interested in telling a moral tale doesn't mean she's unaware of the unethical behavior of her characters.  


There's another thread here about In True Blood. Capote is capable of letting you get wrapped up in the protagonist's perspective and see things through his eyes despite the fact that he murdered a family. There's no way you are supposed to be ""rooting"" for the murdered, but absolutely you see what it's like to be in his mind. And that's real.   


Can you get caught up in Macbeth's marriage dynamics and their drama, goals, etc? Why not with Rebecca?   


Yes there is more moralizing in Bronte. She was a true god-fearing Christian, so naturally her story was about redemption and the very real threat (to her and all the characters in her books) threat of eternal damnation.

We may have a biased narrator, but there's little to show we shouldn't root for the de Winters. Mrs. Danvers is unpleasant, as well as Favell and his incestuous relationship with Rebecca. And in the end, Rebecca wanted him to kill her, which I interpreted as the author further giving Maxim the okay in killing her while also making Rebecca into this genius mastermind who had to have nature step in to destroy her for being so wicked. And her inability to have children reminded me of Lady Macbeth and I sort of took her to be a type of glamorous Lady Macbeth. Even Julyan seems to have suspected Maxim killed her in the end, but didn't push the investigation further, giving the law's dismissal of the whole thing. I think the book had a lot of potential, and maybe the intended horror could have come across, but it got lost with the first 3/4 of it dedicated to her insecurity and the rest of it being rushed.

I do think ""romantic suspense"" is an appropriate characterization of the novel, but ""romantic"" in the classic sense of it being about a relationship—not in the modern sense of ""here are two flawed but fundamentally good characters we're going to watch fall in love and find their happily ever aver."" Think *Wuthering Heights*, not Danielle Steele.

It also wouldn't surprise me if du Maurier did draw from her own personality and experiences when writing the novel because it all rings very true to me. However, I think it would be a mistake to conclude that therefore du Maurier must have intended to portray herself in a good light—on the contrary, I think a significant chunk of the novel is du Maurier doing some hard self-examination.

Finally, I am convinced that Rebecca *was* wicked (and Maxim absolutely should have gotten a divorce), but Maxim was still a monster for killing her and should have been punished.

rpee8s,"No sweat, you're rich in the Internet age, and answers are right there for the asking.  I love Reddit for that!

There was a great deal of experimenting going on in the novel in the era of *Rebecca.*  Novels themselves, as a *mass* mass means of entertainment, were about a hundred years old when *Rebecca* came out.  The pace of experimentation accelerated in the 20th century, and you do occasionally get these little oddballs popping up and becoming popular, like *Rebecca*, *Catch-22,* *One Hundred Years of Solitude,* *Orlando, Gravity's Rainbow*, and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*.  Kind of trying to push this exceptionally rich method of storytelling in new directions.  Unreliable narrators, antiheroes, unsympathetic protagonists, magical realism, genre-mixing, improbable plots.

Not every experiment is going to succeed.  People get used to a certain method of storytelling, and violating the rules can confuse or anger readers.  Make it too convoluted, and readers can't follow you.  Cluing the reader in to an important point the narrator doesn't catch is an art form (see *To Kill a Mockingbird* for masterful handling of this).

Part of the reaction to *Rebecca* is specifically how it's marketed; it's considered either a mystery or a horror novel, and neither of those is designed for re-reading.  If you regard *Rebecca* as literary fiction, however, re-reading becomes a possibility to pick up subtleties you didn't get the first (second, third, nth) time through.  That can be its own pleasure, and in a post-Hemingway literary environment, where books are abundant and the single-read format (mystery, horror, romance) dominates publishing, we've kind of lost the knack of going through a book more than once to pick up any dropped stitches.",McJohn_WT_Net,2021-12-27T20:37:10Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kl82uo,"Of course I don't feel sorry for Maxim. He wanted to possess Rebecca but couldn't so he murdered her. He replaced her with our narrator only a few months later. And lo and behold, she's young, isolated, and so very, very manipulatable. Maxim grooms her easily. 

As the whole book are her recollections, you can even see how she knows this. Though her self-esteem is necessarily low, there are moments of true clarity.  She compares herself to the dogs, a pet of Maxim's; she mentions that it is her youth and naivete that make her so appealing to him . She even withholds her own name, so absorbed has she been into Maxim's web. She is willing to be the possession that Rebecca refused to be.

*Rebecca* takes on an added brilliance in this day and age because we have so much more knowledge of male violence. More than 50,000 women a year are murdered by their current or former male partners. If you've ever watched true crime, the confessions mirror Maxim's almost exactly. The women cheated, they lied, it was all an act, she practically *forced* him to murder her!  There's always an excuse. And they often manage to convince another woman to marry them very soon afterwards.",,2020-12-29T02:01:44Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kl82uo,"I just finished reading it this evening and was so affected by the novel, especially that rollicking third act. Loved the neuroses of the narrator, the complexity of Danvers evil, and that ENDING. Like hitting a brick wall - I'd forgotten all the destruction outlined in the first two chapters by that point.

I do not side with De Winter, as he committed out-and-out murder and our insight to the crime is all through the sympathetic POV of his wife. Rebecca seems to have been a fairly cruel person (threatening Ben with the asylum, whipping the horse until it bleeds, constant cheating, mocking servants, hanging/banging with her gross cousin, etc.)  If the narrator is a masochist, then Rebecca seems to be a sadist. But while she may have been an abusive spouse, but it doesn't justify the crime of murder.

Especially since De Winter knew what she was. She told him all these ""awful things"" (to his sensibilities at least)  she had done five days into their marriage and he chose to stay with her because she would be a good manager for his beloved Manderley. That and he doesn't want to go through a divorce, for social reasons. He made his bed on this one.

And the fact that De Winter doesn't tell his wife he loves her UNTIL he confesses to Rebecca's murder could be read as their relationship not really starting until each has been truly honest with the other (also it seems to be the first time they bone?) But given the passionless relationship described in the opening chapters, it seems more like a desperate manipulative ploy to keep the new Mrs. De Winter in his corner. The narrator's POV wants to make us love him, but once you get to the end and look back... it's hard to see anything but a criminal (and accessory after the fact) on the run. 

Curious about other people's thoughts on one detail: I read Rebecca as provoking Maxim into assisted suicide. We are told she wasn't the type to go down slowly via lingering disease, and that does fit with her combative personality. 

I don't think she expected Maxim to come down and confront her, but she saw an opportunity to take advantage of. She lied about her adulterous pregnancy to suggest she'd be giving Manderley to an heir outside the family. Essentially destroying Manderley, the sole reason he brought her into his life to begin with. The only betrayal sure to provoke him into an attack, as he had weathered all her other betrayals up to this point.

BUT if that's the case - what was she going to discuss with her cousin Favell, as suggested in her note to him? Was he another option for a man to enrage into killing her? He certainly seems the type (I assume he and Danvers orchestrated the destruction of Manderley together.)",ACoolWizard,2021-04-23T05:20:46Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kl82uo,"I think Maxim was gay and a bit feminine not too different from Laurence Olivier. Rebecca being shrewd knew this and told some things about her. He could have actually wanted to kill her not because of her secrets but because she caught up to his. Same goes about divorcing her and facing disgrace. In line with Rebecca's personality, I believe she was the kind to keep her word so she kept her side of the bargain and didn't disclose that she and Maxim were not together. Mrs. Danvers in the book repeats that all the men including Maxim loved her and gave her expensive gifts. This is what suggests that there is a possibility he could have had feminine traits like Olivier. He wanted an adorned wife who was already beautiful to glow things further. I read elsewhere here that Maxim and the second wife first bone after his confession. I don't remember the book to validate this but if this is true, it further supports the homosexual theory.",Pale-Dragonfly-3139,2023-01-28T00:41:45Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kl82uo,"Hell, even my copy of the book advertises it as a romance! I remember the first interactions between the protagonist and Maxim, and thinking ""how will this be a romance? He mocks her and is cruel"". Him reserving affection through their marriage until he reveals the murder seems manipulative and he just came off as sexist (his rants on women over and over, and him proclaiming he would kill Rebecca when they talked a few days after their wedding and seemingly charitably didn't) and cruel. Also, saying that h preferred his new wife to be naïve, innocent, to be left without understanding on certain things is gross.

When I finished the book, I felt disgusted that I was supposed to find it as romantic. Reading up on the backstory made me realize that I may have been reading it 'correctly' all along. Dapne du Maurier had intended the book to be about jealousy and was horrified that people viewed it as a romance. 

I do wonder, beyond marketing, how one could read it as a romance. There are few, very few, romantic scenes overall and when you take those scenes and combine them with everything out they cancel out the romantic aspects, leaving you with an abuser who finds a poor young girl to marry, manipulate, and mold.",seizonnokamen,2021-01-16T16:34:15Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

I thought that too, actually. I noticed he prewarned Maxim that he will get back somehow and, conveniently, Mrs Danvers packs and leaves. It seems like it was a team effort, but at times you notice that Favel doesn’t seem to care for Rebecca as much as Mrs Danvers does. The blackmail in itself shows that his interests existed in other areas, whereas Mrs Danvers would never accept blackmail, for her love for Rebecca was stronger than that. Also, after discovering she had cancer, and apart from that one comment to Maxim, which seemed more from macho spite, he seemed to be over the whole situation.",PristineandPoised,2020-12-27T18:18:49Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

There's no other reason he abstained from his wife? He didn't sleep with his wife before his confession because he was so bottled up, afraid of losing the composure he worked so hard to build after murdering Rebecca that he might break down, confess to his wife and lose the only woman he's ever truly loved. Just because a man has feminine qualities, doesn't mean he's gay. Olivier was feminine and a huge ladies man. He had all consuming passion for Vivien Leigh until her illness tore them both apart. Rebecca was a cruel personality; imagine you get married to a beautiful woman, she's charming and lovely towards you and you're the envy of everyone but in reality, she's mean, cruel and thinks its hilarious because in private she refuses to touch you and laughs because the life she really has with you is the opposite and you can't tell anyone or leave no matter what you do. It's the ultimate evil joke and for a man like Maxim who was raised a gentleman ad to respect marriage and appearances, he's a puppet, a prisoner.

But regardless of how intense his feelings were for Rebecca, I agree that it wasn't as sincere as Ms Danver's feelings. Both Favel and Rebecca didn't seem to be capable of *real* love.

Also, I feel his behavior after discovering her cancer diagnosis was temporary defeat rather indifference. I think he knew he was that insignificant, pathetic thing that would never measure up to Maxim, or in Maxim's world. Never could compete. Rebecca's [false] affection was the only thing he had ""over"" Maxim, though Maxim claimed to not even want her. However she was now gone, but at least he could crush Maxim with the truth of her death, getting the last word on all the disgust Maxim had for him. Maxim would rot in prison and be seen as just as lowly of a person as Favel felt himself to be. But he couldn't even see that through because Maxim found coincidence to be on his side & as such, was still winning...but didn't deserve to. So he bowed out of trying to expose Maxim, licked his wounds, then eventually figured out a fight he knew he could win -- conspiring to take away a sure thing Maxim cared about, the thing that fed into his stature & identity, Manderley.",AnaPebble,2021-10-25T03:45:45Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

But in some ways, it could have been freeing for him. Released from the obligation of maintaining a place with so many unhappy memories.

kl82uo,"Is it perfectly ok to turn a maternal figure into a lesbian as they did with Mrs. Danvers multiple times. Both top motion pictures versions reduced her age. While it's certain that she may not have been very old considering that she was a staff and there have been as little as 8 years between her and Rebecca, we know how the Brits age and since Maxim himself is 42, she may have been closer to 50 even if Rebecca was a couple of years younger than Maxim. The book constantly describes her with a skull's face.

They looked for no less clues to bring up this theory than I have about Maxim. It's misogynistic to weigh one over the other. The real life Laurence Olivier was no Maxim de Winter. He made it quite apparent that he was jealous of women. Marilyn Monroe, Vivien Leigh, Jill Esmond (his first wife) and countless others. His homosexual pursuits are well-backed by people like David Niven and reporters. They all can't be lying. But the world denies it. Just like they deny Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great and Achilles had homosexual relationships. If they don't deny it, they pretend like it never happened. Danny had no clue about Rebecca's true relationship with Maxim. Rebecca falsely led her believe that both Maxim and Frank Crawley were also madly in love with her. Either she's going on an ego trip to protect her desirability or she's keeping up the part of the bargain she made with Maxim if this theory is to be believed.",Pale-Dragonfly-3139,2024-01-11T11:32:17Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

kxdqa3,"If it's not working for you, it's not working for you!

That being said, one of the big underlying issues in *Rebecca* is that of social class -- the middle-class American narrator has married into an upper-middle-class British setting and has absolutely no idea how to deal with the expectations around her new role.  The book focuses all of this through her obsession with Rebecca as the perfect first wife, so I think it can be hard to see, but there are actual skills & experiences that she's lacking due to the difference in their social backgrounds, and I think the reader is meant to understand that she doesn't want to ask Maxim for help because she doesn't want to remind him of where she came from.  

In the real world, some wealthy American women who wanted to succeed in upper-class British society in this time period (between the two world wars) would hire aristocratic-but-poor British women to teach them how to throw parties, decorate their homes, wear the proper clothes, answer their letters, etc etc -- all the stuff our narrator needs to figure out how to do that gets turned into 'I'm not as good as Rebecca'.",changeableLandscape,2021-01-14T23:51:58Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

k6thrd,"I love this book. I've read it twice, bought it as gifts for other readers, and read it out loud to my husband. Her book *My Cousin Rachel* is just as good.

To me, the best/creepiest moment was when >!Maxim reveals that he killed Rebecca and starts tryin' to get all frisky with our narrator--GROSS. Even worse? She is basically thrilled. :O :O :O!<

But truly there is a lot to unpack with the novel. It's been a few years since I read it and I'm overdue for a reread, but I remember thinking it was a novel of a lot of depth, the kind that I could write essays about one scene. To me, looking at the novel as solely a ""psychological thriller"" or ""it's got great twists"" really undersells it by a lot. I mean, it could be described as a psychological thriller for sure, and it does have great twists, but it is so much more than that and one of my favorite works of literature.

ETA: One way to go into more depth with the novel is to consider how the only things we ever hear about Rebecca are filtered; we have no direct experience of her. It's all, Mrs. Danvers-said, Maxim-said, narrator-feels-like. And then considering the narrator is never named. She's telling us her story, but what do you call her? The second Mrs. DeWinter?

k6thrd,"*Rebecca* is my favorite book!

I think that's because I identify quite a bit with the main character (in terms of psychology, not circumstance), and found her stream-of-conscious narration very moving and impactful. I've never read another character like her. Also, I really value beautiful prose and atmospheric settings, and *Rebecca* has that in spades. 

I thought the general outline of the two big twists—that >!Maxim hadn't loved Rebecca but had killed her!<—was fairly easy to see coming (then again, I went in knowing it had been adapted by Hitchcock and so was expecting something crazy). 

However, once Maxim admits this to Mrs. de Winters...the rest of the novel is like watching a car crash in slow motion. >!She finds out he murdered his *pregnant wife*, and she's happy because that means he ""loves"" her??! (""Loves"" being in the biggest scare quotes possible, because the giant red flags present since the beginning of their relationship should have turned into a giant, flashing, Vegas-style sign at this point. He doesn't love her; he's just glad he can control her thanks to the massive power imbalance in their relationship.) Truly, it's like a horror movie: I kept wanting her to run, and she just didn't. She never even *thinks* about leaving. And so, even though things turned out technically all right in the end, she's left stuck in a miserable marriage traveling from hotel to hotel trying to pretend she's happy. (The revelation that Maxim hadn't even had to kill Rebecca to be free of her is just the icing on this terrible cake.).!<

Menderley stressed me out. I felt as if she was constantly being watched and judged by her own employees.

Maxim patronizes her like the child she is and he has no business being with. He loses his temper at the slightest allusion to Rebecca, which makes the MC hypersensitive and even more self-conscious.

Yes, neither Rochester nor Maxim were perfect, they're both typical Byronic grey characters, but they're also very different characters, and so are Jane and Rebecca's protagonist. But describing them as nothing more than manipulated victims does them disservice. And I wouldn't call either Rochester or Maxim ""evil"", they were both victims of their circumstances too.

Well, Rochester a lot more. He was deceived by his wife's family who apparently wanted to profit from a good marriage with a wealthy man by pretty much selling their mentally ill daughter away, who was apparently very aggressive and abusive too, even if she couldn't help it. Rochester could have sent her to some asylum (where she'd have been treated horribly, since proper mental health treatment wasn't a thing in 19th century) but he chose instead to take care of her. He also took in that girl his ex-lover sent her, even though he doubted she was his. I don't think he can be called a bad person relative to the time he lived in. He didn't plan on seducing his governess, on the contrary, he wasn't exactly nice to her at first. I'm not defending him lying about having a wife, but like I said, in those circumstances it's a bit different.

And Jane was no vicrim, she was very intelligent, and chose what in her mind was the right thing and left him. She only returned to him years later, out of her own will.

In Maxim's case, of course murdering your wife isn't defensible, and his new wife really was a naive girl who had no prospects in life so she married the first man who could give her a good name and some status. But she did grow up a lot. Maxim's case was being trapped in a fucked up marriage with an abusive wife who gaslit the fuck out of him, and in her final moments she practically goaded him into killing her. She knew she has cancer, and she wanted to die, so she told Maxim what became the final straw - implied she was pregnant with a child that wasn't his and that this child will one day inherit Manderley and ""ruin it"".",lynx_and_nutmeg,2021-01-12T21:37:21Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kuyxfx,"I agree with you. I never thought of either Rochester Or Maxim de Winter as abusive. and truth is they never treated anyone badly, I mean yes they are both moody and abrupt some times, but have no intention of hurting people. and I'm pretty sure they were both truly taken by their young brides, being fresh and maybe naïve yes, because there is probably no evil in being naïve.

Jane in particular is a very clever girl, able to answer Rochester back and contradict him in many occasions, and that's why he falls for her and in reality Jane never went easy on him, she could have stayed there as a mistress if he was that much of a manipulative man, but she didn't, she had a strong will that one. and Rochester did try a lot and he was a mess after she left him. and I think Rochester was always kind to her, except maybe their first meeting when his horse fell, but still I would never call him abusive, maybe sarcastic.

as for the girl in Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter, she may not be as strong as Jane, but she is fun to be with and Maxim wants her in his life, and he is fascinated with her, and takes her with him to Manderley and marries her when he could have just left her to go to America. I understand that it takes more time for him to express his feelings to her, and she is not sure that he loves her for a long time, but I don't know If I can blame him, he's been through hell. and I would never thought of that girl as pathetic, she claims what's hers and in a very strong way.",upside_down1983,2021-01-13T07:20:21Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kuyxfx,"An interesting take. Upon reading a biography in du Maurier, I had a much clearer understanding of Rebecca. I think du Maurier intended for Maxim to be the true villain. A reading of Rebecca as the villain plays into the sexism that was present in the time of du Maurier’s writing. I agree that from Maxim’s account it appears that Rebecca was a vile creature, but that’s just the point. It was Maxim’s account that painted Rebecca in that way. Presumably because she was an independent woman who was not easily controlled by her husband.",friddell,2021-01-13T05:02:24Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
kuyxfx,"Yes, on the surface it seems like Maxim should definitely be an unreliable narrator, but I'd say there's other evidence of Rebecca's character that supports him, not just his own words. First of all, the company she kept, Mrs Danvers and her cousin, Jack Favell, they were both clearly very fucked up people, Danvers was straight up evil. And the scraps she told Maxim's new wife about Rebecca certainly didn't paint her in a good light either - torturing a horse into submission and revelling in it being injured, something she said about hating all men, etc. That mentally challenged guy in the beach shed seemed terrified of her. And Frank too seemed very uncomfortable and scared at the very mention of her, because she apparently harassed him. I really don't think not wanting your wife to cheat with multiple men, including your own staff, equals ""controlling her"". In his own words, Maxim sort of tolerated it as long as she kept her affairs discreet, he only confronted her when she grew careless and brought them closer to home.

Seemed to me like this was a classic case of gaslighting - Rebecca was a talented socopath who was very good at pretending to be charming and making people love her, but a completely different person in reality.",lynx_and_nutmeg,2021-01-13T11:47:31Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

jgxl7f,"I would argue that u/LorenzoApophis has a point - however, one would need to add some information.

If I remember correctly -

1. Rebecca and Maxim had a ""deal"" - she would be the charming wife and he'd turn an eye to her affairs as long as she didn't bring them to Manderley. She broke this promise (brought men to Manderley) and rubbed salt in his wound that their marriage was a sham. What was her incentive to do that except to hurt Maxim? 
2. She went after Frank, his house keeper and, if I remember correctly, after her sister-in-law's husband Giles to the point that Frank wanted to quit and Beatrice & Giles never came to Manderley while she was alive. As far as I understood, we never see hints that she was seriously interested in either men, e.g. in love. 
3. She taunted Max into killing her - I don't defend him killing her. I'd just like to point out that she could have committed suicide in a thousand different ways. Instead, she intentionally taunted Max by saying that Manderley (his pride) would be inherited by another man's child. She knew how to hit and how to hurt.

I agree with ""living her best live."" I can agree with ""playing the game and taking control of her life at a time when it was difficult for women to do so"". I don't agree with hurting others (see list above) as Rebecca was doing. I might feel more sympathy towards her, if I could see inside her head and find out her motivations - e.g. in ""Les liasons dangereuses"", t>!he villainess describes that she started to jab herself with a fork during meals while smiling because of the strict conditions women had to live under. I applauded her for having lovers and letting them know that she had blackmail material so that they could never boast of having slept with her. However, all this went out of the window when she went after the 17-year old, naive Cecile who had done nothing at all to harm her and who literally posed no threat. That's the major line she crossed imo.  !<

jgxl7f,"Dusting off this older thread now that the movie is out on Netflix and I just watched it. 

What I have always found befuddling (and fascinating) about the novel is that du Maurier could have been making a feminist point, or the exact opposite. No one really knows, but the fact that it was written in 1938 means it was likely deliberately one or the other.

The two women in the story perfectly embody the angel and whore archetypes that have pervaded every story ever told about women. Rebecca is accomplished and lives life on her own terms; because of that she must also be promiscuous, subversive, manipulative, deeply disrespectful to her husband, somewhat mentally unstable… all the things men despise and women warn other women not to be. Our protagonist is the angel. She follows traditional gender rules, yet we are expected to side with her as she breaks legal ones (aiding a murderer) and stands by an objectively violent man who murdered a woman he couldn’t control. Like all angel archetypes, she is kind and optimistic and naïve, but controllable and almost stupid in her willingness to shape her life and identity around a man. Not just any man, but a wealthy and influential one who overpowers her in every way that mattered in 1938. She needs him, and is a “good” woman. Rebecca didn’t, and is a “bad” one.

What I’ve never understood is, is the author laying these archetypes out as a commentary, or is she telling a gothic romance story the way most people in 1938 would have told it? The mystery is what makes the story so compelling, and valid today. Women’s power and place have been sources of controversy forever, her value to society subjective in a way that a man’s is not. The story ultimately asks what it means to be a “good” woman, and does it come at the cost of brilliance? Many women today would say yes… but then we’re not out there cheating on our husbands :)",kaelidoscoped,2023-08-12T01:00:37Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
jgxl7f,"You’re totally right, Rebecca was definitely all too prepared to sacrifice everything and everyone to get what she wanted. She was a master manipulator and it’s safe to say she was shrewd and selfish. 

However I also can’t look past the fact that she possesses many qualities which men in that time might have possessed, and did many things that men of that time and status might have done without exactly the same consequences (selfish, controlling, extremely intelligent, kept lovers, arguably open about her own sexuality). So I can’t help but think that the author may have flipped these gender stereotypes on their head by associating them with Rebecca and juxtaposing them with the traditional, subdued version of femininity as represented by wife 2 (which the reader is arguably led to prefer). And if that’s true, is the author saying that these types of qualities will always be abhorrent in a woman? Or is it simply a criticism of her nonexistent morals?

I guess what I’m trying to say is that when I read Rebecca for the first time I hated her because I read the book whilst scrutinising her as a person. But the second time, I find myself sympathising with her because of what she represents. But at the same time, I totally get your point!

That’s a very accurate description of Rebecca - totally agree with that.

Would you agree that if you look at her character more of a symbol, she could represent a kind of emancipated female in a man’s world?

I don’t know, there is something really cool about her! One of the things I think was so expertly done in the book was the way she died; her husband murdered her - so it seems like he was in control. But, as we know, Rebecca tricked him into committing her own act of suicide for her, just like she always expertly manipulated men into doing exactly what she wanted.

nw3jn4,"I agree with what everyone else has said here, plus you have to talk about Manderley. This is Maxim's ancestral estate, that he loves, and his identity is tied up in it. It was for Manderley that he kept silent through his marriage to Rebecca, and all of her affairs, and didn't try to divorce her--because that would have caused a scandal, which would have brought disrepute on both his family name and also the estate itself, which is a physical embodiment of that name and family heritage. Rebecca simultaneously brings Manderley into a greater state of beauty and repute than ever before, and she pollutes it. Because Manderley is Maxim, in a real way, he has also been polluted, sold his soul for the sake of reputation and pride. Until he ends up killing her, which was the only way he could both keep his reputation and get rid of Rebecca.

When Maxim meets the girl, they are in Europe. They're away from Manderley, he probably feels free, and he falls in love with this girl who is in every way the opposite of his psychotic wife. He thinks that by marrying her he can begin again, he can make his life pure and fresh and innocent, and wipe away the stain of his marriage to Rebecca and everything that it entails. But, of course, he can't--because as long as they stay in Europe, they're just sort of playing house, pretending. Once he actually takes her back, then he finds that Rebecca is not really gone. She is everywhere at Manderley, and now the beautiful estate that used to be his home and his pride and refuge is instead a constant reminder of his own guilt, of all the awful things that took place there. He thought by killing Rebecca, he could keep everything good about Manderley and get rid of the bad, but that's just not the case. This is why Manderley has to burn down at the end. As long as it existed, it would continue to be the reminder of Maxim's terrible marriage to Rebecca, just as Maxim himself has been seared and forever changed. There is no Manderley without Rebecca anymore, just as there is no Maxim without Rebecca. The only way forward is through destruction--a total destruction of the house, but also of Maxim's existing life, his sense of identity and his place in the world. That's the way they're able to make a real marriage and relationship, too, not as the girl coming into his life and trying to fit into it, but as both of them making a new life together, from scratch.",Far-Adagio4032,2021-06-09T20:34:02Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

nw3jn4,"Yes he's a good character, and as such he acts like a real person, and real people are often deeply troubled and flawed, especially if they have had miserable trauma in their lives. Let's keep in mind that we are talking about someone who murdered his first wife. Regardless of the fact that she was abusive and toyed with him, she was a terrible manipulative person. But still, he suffered through that abuse and manipulation, then killed her, then hid her body, then spent years covering up this fact, hiding it. That's gonna mess you up!

Yes he likes our unnamed protagonist because she represents, to him, an option for redemption. She's innocent and open-hearted, and he finds that refreshing, wishes to feel real love again. But as we've already seen, he's a messed up guy. The great tragedy of their personal romance is that she is able to redeem him, give him a second chance in life, but it requires her to lose that innocence and go through heartbreak of her own. By the end, they are more equal and his past is burned away.

As for him not behaving rationally, yes of course not. He's a person. But what he's thinking- like many controling people, he's afraid of losing something (his innocent sweet wife) and so he controls her to try to prevent that loss. He's also defending himself against his own trauma- remember he's an abuse survivor who is hiding the fact that he killed his wife. Obviously he's going to have all sorts of maladaptive ways to defend himself against that.

The confession is the first step towards his redemption and her maturity. You can't have experience without loss of innocence, and you can't have redemption without confession. They dovetail and it changes their marriage. She becomes his partner and confidant at that point. Before it, yes he was the authority and she was basically childlike. Before that, their relationship was on the terms of him saving her from poverty, him bringing her like a princess to his castle, him controling her. Afterwards, they are partners and depend on one another. She helps him with the trial and shares his burden, but it means he has to face who he is and lose his little pet.

I love Rebecca, but it's basically a rip-off and modern version of Bronte's Jane Eyre (which I also love), and the story-lines are in some ways exactly the same.

nw3jn4,"Yeah it's such a good book. You could read it that way too because everything we know about her comes filtered through other characters- Maxim, Danvers, her society reputation at large, the 'cousin' character. Taking Maxim's story at face value (which is what the second Mrs. DeWinters does), she's abusive and manipulative. But DuMaurier is good enough that other interpretations are possible but since our protagonist is the second Mrs. DeWinters, this is the perspective we get. And she's more concerned with the relief that Maxim didn't love Rebecca than she is with the fact that he killed her! Jealousy and insecurity can really warp your mind. I love this book, but those two are made for each other!  


That's why I think it would be cool to see the story told in a new version. The obvious thing to do would be to make Rebecca and Danvers lovers, make Maxim really pissed off that his wife is a lesbian. But that's too obvious and melodramatic. I'm sure some clever imaginative person could really put a better spin on it.

If you want to stay generally in the Jane Eyre world, Wide Sargasso Sea is a good spin on it, a prequel that tells the story of Rochester's first wife, Bertha, written by Jean Rhys who is a brilliant novelist in her own right.

905qmm,"I think that Rebecca is such a good examination of how a weak character can lead to a fantastic book. Too often, writing advice leads to the concept that your lead character must be strong. They can be terribly flawed, but if they're a weak person, they won't grab a reader's interest. 

I think of Rebecca when I see that sort of advice. Because, done correctly, a weak character as a lead can still create compelling literature. It is the care of the craft that leads it to being such a good book.

6e7lh0,"Hi Rebecca,

I loved your account of Henrietta Lacks, and the way you covered both the science and the human aspects of Henrietta and the Lacks family.

Most science reporting today glorifies advances in medical technology. The dark side of institutional medical practice, such as the enormous number of injuries and deaths resulting from medical care, or how tremendous pressures from the commercialization of care have led to emphasis on numbers from lab tests (in practice and in medical education) over the traditional healing relationship in which a doctor appreciates the patient in front of her as a person.

Also, there seems little acknowledgment among science writers and press of the remarkable healing abilities within the human beings.

Norman Doidge has broken the ice with his best selling books on neuroplasticity and healing in *The Brain that Changes Itself* and *The Brain's Way of Healing*.

Stephen Porges begins to address how healing grows out of a social context, and the brain's social engagement mechanisms in his book *The Polyvagal Theory*.

What is your vision of the future of the way we care for people in need? Do you see a role for complementary medicine? Will modern medicine recognize the role of the human element in a way that is more than lip service? ",,2017-05-30T16:30:07Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery

6e7lh0,"Thanks for this question -- this is something that comes up often, and I feel it's very important to clarify.  Students often assume that since they can't imagine how I got the facts in that scene (or others I didn't witness first hand) that I must have made them up.  The short answer is yes, this reporting for this scene started with something that was documented in her medical records.  

I've answered this broad question, and also walked through how I reported that  scene above specifically on the FAQ page of my website here: http://rebeccaskloot.com/faq/#questions-writingimmortal (it's the first question under the heading of ""Questions On Writing The Immortal Life..."").  

As for whether I hesitated to include this in the book, absolutely not.  As I said in response to a question below, Deborah always said she felt very strongly that it was important to tell what she called “the good and the bad” of the family story — the violence, the sexually transmitted diseases, the abuse, and everything else — because it’s all part of the story of what happened when the world got Henrietta’s cells and her family lost Henrietta as a mother. And of course, Henrietta’s cancer was caused by one sexually transmitted disease (HPV), and made more aggressive by another (syphilis) — those details are an essential part of any story about the HeLa cells. And the story of Henrietta finding the tumor herself is an essential part of her story:  It really shows what a strong and wise woman she was. She knew something was wrong, and she did a self examination to find it, then demanded medical care for it.  That's an important lesson for every woman to learn from. 

As a side note, a mother in Tennessee tried to get the book banned from local high schools by saying that scene was pornographic.

6e7lh0,"My book proposal was about 75 pages long, and it both outlined the story I was hoping to tell, and also included a lot of sample writing, so editors could see what the book would really look like.  I read so widely while working on the book, in part because there weren't many books out there that served as models for what I hoped to do.  I knew I wanted it to read like fiction, but be entirely journalistically accurate, and that I wanted it to have multiple narratives I'd braid together, with multiple time periods and characters.  I did a lot of reading in fiction to help me structure the narrative of the book (I've talked a lot about that here: http://rebeccaskloot.com/writing/writing-resources/), and a lot of nonfiction to help me think about the reporting and how I wanted to present it.

The only ""competitive"" title I had to list for my proposal was A Conspiracy of Cells, which was written decades earlier and was a totally different book (and was, in fact, something I wrote about in my book as part of the family's story).

Today the Lacks family spends a lot of time talking about how proud they are of the cells and all the good they've done for the world; their issues are more with the ethics of how the story unfolded -- the lack of consent, the fact that her children, and then grand children, were repeatedly used in research without their consent as well.

The one thing I like teachers to know is that I've put together a detailed page of my website with info and special features for students (I strongly recommend all students listen to the RadioLab episode linked there).  I put this together in part because I get so many requests to talk to classrooms, I can't do them all.  So this page answers a lot of the frequently asked questions, and also provides lots of added resources:  http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/teaching/

As for the book's takeaway, I don't have just one. Here's a bit on that from the FAQ page of my site, where you can find lots more info:  What people take away depends in part on each individual reader, because there are a lot of potential messages from the book: it’s about trust, race and medicine, class, access to education and health care, it’s also the story of a family and the impact that losing a mother can have on her children, and much more.  It’s also about the fact that there are people behind every one of the billions of biological samples that are used in research every day. I can’t count the number of e-mails I’ve gotten from researchers who say that they heard me talking on the radio or read the book and had this very powerful reaction of saying “Oh wow, I had no idea. I did my dissertation on HeLa cells, I work with them every day in my lab—I owe a lot of my career to Henrietta’s cells, and I never once stopped to think about where they came from, whether she had given consent, or whether her family might care about that.” These are questions that scientists don’t often think about. I also hear researchers saying that after learning the story of the HeLa cells, they no longer complain about the regulation of science and the mountains of forms they have to fill out for every study they want to do. In the book, you find out the history behind those forms, why they’re now required, and why it is important. Those are crucial take-home messages.

But this is also a story about the fact that there are human beings behind every biological sample in a laboratory, and behind every scientist as well. The scientists in the HeLa story have long been demonized in ways that weren’t factually accurate, so I hoped to set that record straight.",RebeccaSkloot,2017-05-30T15:42:53Z,Rebecca,COMMENT,Mystery
6e7lh0,"Well, the best advice is just to start writing in some ways.  But for me, I have to have a road map, which is what keeps me on track. I'm a big believer in really planning out the structure of my stories (I use index cards), which helps me stay focused.  But you do have to let yourself follow tangents to some degree, because they can often lead to important parts of the story that need to be included.  When I find myself ""drifting"" into a tangent that's not part of what I intended to write about, I will stop myself and write a note saying SHOULD I TELL THE STORY OF X HERE? Then I will stop and leave that as a note to myself and go back to where I was planning to go.  Then in reading it later, I will often see that note and be like, Nope, you definitely didn't need to do that here. Or sometimes, yes, you do.  If I really feel like I need to write that tangent out, I'd do it in a separate document titled X TANGENT or whatever, so I have it to use if it ends up being necessary (in part because those tangents can often just lead to whole other new stories for the future rather than being needed for the current project).

Someone from an older discussion thread I read had said how usually the narrator in books tend to be our protagonist  and are written as strong characters. But here we (me, personally speaking) attributed the narrator as the protagonist as a force of habjt and didn't even realize how weak or unhealthy her personality was until I heard a third party point it out.

I was also thinking after the fact how there is no sound morally and ethically speaking main/supporting characters in the story. The narrator, Maxim, and Rebecca all have huge flaws. Even Mrs. Danvers or Frank weren't there without questionable personalities. I think I will have to go with team Jasper next time I read it I have to pick sides.

otl2to,"This was something I came across the first time I read the book, and it makes perfect sense when you re-read it with that mindset that the whole thing is being expertly manipulated by the maid. But I feel this somehow gives a little too much credit to Nelly as some sort of mad genius who has merely to pull the strings and have her puppets move as she wills.

I am of the opinion that instead, it’s more likely to assume that Nelly is merely an unreliable narrator. Other than the very short interactions of Lockwood with Heathcliff in the beginning and near the end of the novel, the entire novel is either told straight from Nelly’s mouth, or is a retelling of what Lockwood heard from Nelly herself. But this is all still told from Nelly’s perspective ultimately, since Lockwood has no ulterior motive to color the events he heard from Nelly, and indeed, seems more than willing to believe everything Nelly says without question. This is despite things clearly being shown in Nelly’s own words that she may not be as trusting as she may appear to the reader who focuses on Heathcliff’s alleged villainy, despite the fact that he doesn’t appear anywhere near as demonic in his interactions with Lockwood than what we hear from Nelly. We know Nelly dislikes Heathcliff, so it is not unreasonable to assume she would paint him to be in a darker light than what he actually may have been. The only other objective evidence we see are the letters Nelly produces and shows Lockwood, but could there also have been other letters Nelly didn’t show Lockwood that would have painted a slightly different picture? No one can really say, but it goes to show that your opinion of someone can be seriously skewed if you only hear one side of the story, as Lockwood did from Nelly.",Tooko1005,2021-07-29T00:36:17Z,The Maid,COMMENT,Mystery

yqsb3o,"Huge fan, wish I got this in earlier! Love this AMA. Just finished reading Gone Girl then watched the movie. The book was Amazing. Question: How much of a voice did you have in the film adaptation? I ask, because many parts of book Nick's character were lost in the movie, in my most humble opinion. In the book, I could really feel the desperation from him as he interviewed past Amy victims. In the film he just kind of bumbled along. The ending was a bit different too, with Nick's final words redacted as well (something along the lines of ""I feel sorry for you, because every day you have to wake up and be you"". It felt perfect, because as a reader you know it's never going to be ok. Sorry, I guess my question is, do you feel Nick was minimized a bit in the film, and was this a conscious choice, and did it really even matter or impact the meat of the story, in your opinion?

I felt cyclical female aggression and violence hadn’t been tackled. I realized I could attach it to a mystery to give it a real engine, For Gone Girl, I was both obsessed with how marriage—particularly the wedding-industrial complex and the early years of marriage— really triggers the traditional male/female roles (I’d just gotten married and was thinking a lot about this; I suddenly had the urge to put on flowered aprons, which was a wholly new instinct to me.) I combined that with my obsession with true crime—how the cases that most often got national coverage were ones with Pretty White Girls.

16gxk4w,"There's a theory of feminist literature called... Jesus I can't remember now, and google is failing me. But it's called something like Diana Mythos? 

Anyways at the risk of half remembering and explaining badly, it goes something like;

Men get to be all kinds of shapes and sizes in fiction. Bad, good, strong, weak, interesting, flawed, balding, paunchy. He's both Robin Hood and he's the Sheriff of Nottingham and he's Prince John and he's King Richard, she is ONLY Maid Marion. For centuries and centuries of written text women got to be only a much narrower set of characters - virgin or whore, MAYBE if you're lucky mother or crone. It's usually narrow, usually defined by her relationship to the hero, who is always the man.

So, there's a kind of power in any story that has agency. She might be doing something bad but at least she's doing SOMETHING, jfc. It's way out there stuff, it's not that anyone's saying it's morally okay, but it's nice to have a fantasy of power out there. No one ever argues about that Hannibal Lecter was GOOD or whether or not showing him on tv is misandrist, just that he was fun as hell to watch and you low key couldn't take your eyes off him. Let women be in the same space.

The first example I heard it spoken about was the comic books ""Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist."" The best example I can think of is Rosamund Pike's character in I Care a Lot. Just show us women in more of our atrocious facets, please, Christ, please.

I don't know if the argument holds up to including Gone Girl as a text. I've never read it, just absorbed it through cultural osmosis. I don't like the idea of it personally because I think it's left a gross cultural legacy in terms of disbelieving victims of abuse, plus from what I can understand it plays into some gross bunny boiler tropes.

 But in the context of this framework, I can see how someone would read it as a feminist text.

(I'm not advocating this take and I'm on a lot of dayquil.)

It also may just be as simple as the fact that it passes the sexy lamp test;

16gxk4w,"""feminist story"" doesn't mean ""story about a feminist"". One of the most common issues with the way women are portrayed in stories is that they have zero agency. Gone Girl takes a familiar narrative--woman goes missing, husband desperate to find her, sparks support nationwide--and turns it upside down. She's orchestrating all of this, she's manipulating the public opinion, and she's always been one step ahead.

What I find interesting is that people have no problems with indulgent, charismatic, intelligent villains. There's no shortage of Hannibal Lectors, Jokers, or Patrick Batemans. We can even empathize with aspects of their worldview, because in spite of us clearly understanding that they are evil and wrong, they reveal something about society that is evil and wrong as well. What makes Amy Dunne so different?",rowrowfightthepandas,2023-09-12T19:00:00Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,">I see isolated feminist moments like the cool girl monologue. But, at least by my reading, the point of this monologue is less that trying to play to male fantasies eventually drives people crazy, and it’s more a supremely inauthentic person projecting. Amy’s act didn’t start because she wanted to appeal to mediocre men; it started with Amazing Amy. She makes a feminist point, but that doesn’t make this an inherently feminist story.

I think you are vastly underestimating how much that monologue connected with women.  Multiple women I know IRL retyped that passage to put it up on their social media.  I have never seen that happen with another piece of writing.

Amy is a crazy person, but the cool girl thing she is describing is a real pressure women face.  Perhaps a bit less so than when the book originally came out, but it is 100% a real pressure.  

>Now, I’m a guy so maybe I’m missing it, but here is my basic read on the story: a guy puts on a bit of an act to get a girl who’s out of his league. He loses his money, his mother gets sick, it quickly becomes clear the marriage doesn’t work, and he has a kind of gross affair with a younger woman. This all makes him a standard bad dude that you feel a little bit of pity for because he’s had a tough go of it but ultimately you dislike imo.

I believe Amy's money paid for the house and the bar.  A big part of why she feels trapped is that her money has been invested into the life he wants.  She trusted him and he trapped her in a dying rust belt town.  Then he fucking cheated on her.  I think he is more of an asshole that you are acknowledging here.

Personally, I don't think of Gone Girl as a feminist book.  Feminist is not a label I tend to put on fiction.  But I would day that Gone Girl is an incredibly feminine book.  It looks at the world through a female lens.",elinordash,2023-09-12T19:00:24Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"Echoing what the other commenters have said, this is a story about a woman who falls outside the usual female literary/media paradigm. She's a villain and a bad person (albeit a complicated person), but she's also incredibly interesting. Male literary main characters get to run the gamut, but for female main characters, there are few iconic ""evil"" or outright manipulative to evil effect characters. Maybe more so now then at the time Gone Girl was written (2012), but how many female evil characters that were the main character of their book or movie can you name off the top of your head? 
  
At its core, Gone Girl is a thriller, and Amy is one of the main characters of it. She's the bad guy (although she certainly has reasons, disproportionate though they may be, for her decisions) and that decision and the nuanced portrayal of her was a feminist choice of the author.",ollieastic,2023-09-12T19:39:10Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

It’s feminist because it allows us to have a female protagonist that’s not a good person and we can witness her story. This is not something most female characters are ever shown doing. 

We should be able to watch gone girl the same way we watch breaking bad or dexter or Hannibal. The fact people are shocked at what she does is very telling of the way misogyny is normalized.",rav3style,2023-09-12T19:47:03Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"Let’s redefine what you think of as feminism and/or feminist. Feminism doesn’t mean women are better or more powerful or anything like that. 

Feminism exists to center the experience of women. Full stop. Feminist theory in literature means we are writing and/or reading books that care about what the female character wants, needs, is, does, sometimes specifically within a patriarchal power structure, sometimes without. 

The feminism of Gone Girl isn’t girl power. It’s the dismantling of patriarchal assumptions of what a female protagonist should be. The first half creates that myth, while the second half goes topsy-turvy. 

If Amy is Rapunzel locked in her tower, a very very very simplified view of the feminist reading of this book, is that not only does Amy climb down her own hair to escape, she also destroys the tower stone by stone. And yes, she built that tower. But we care most about her, and her experience of the world, not about any body else’s.",seanmharcailin,2023-09-12T22:27:02Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"I’m not bringing anything that hasn’t been said by anyone else, but I will say that Gone Girl does a good job of displaying White Female Rage.  Aka at some point almost every women has felt what Amy has felt at some point in their life.  They feel used and discarded.  Forced into a maternal role to make the men they date/married rise to their level.  Women have to be perfect for men.  They can’t be seen as a work in progress that need to be supported.  women are chastised by general society if they don’t condone mediocre men or help them become their “best” selves.  But men refuse to do the same.  I mean it’s pretty common to hear of men that left their wives because they got too sick or for a younger women.  

Gone Girl’s Amy is an embodiment of the down right resentment some women hold towards men.

And while it isn’t right, it cathartic to watch.  How is it any different than when men watch revenge stories like John Wick?",qwertysparrow,2023-09-12T19:51:15Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"This is a very surface analysis compared to some of the others, but part of the ""allure"" is tricking the trickster.

Men lie and manipulate and trap women who are largely stuck as the victims. They get what they want, and the women suffer for it. 

In Gone Girl, Nick thinks he's getting what he wants. He deploys the same tactics to try and trap and ""conquer"" Amy and get away with his shit behavior. But Amy is not who he thinks she is. She is 10 times the bad person Nick is.

It's about seeing him get fooled. He thinks he's playing the game, so many men play and succeed. He thinks he gets to have his perfect happy life with the woman he lied to and hurt and cheats on, and there's no consequences. But Amy is fucking nuts. He loses his little game and then some. 

Nick and Amy are representative of the swaths of people in the larger picture. It is not Amy as an individual who is exciting or feels feminist. It's the concept of women flipping the chessboard on the men that Nick is a stand-in for and seeing them get their comeuppance. It's very much an escapist narrative of punishing the patriarchy by subverting their expectations. 

Amy goes ""too far"" because she, as a character, is representative of the female rage that has simmered and festered. Their story as individuals is compelling, but the broader narrative of getting back at the forces that have beat down and trapped women is what is tantalizing for feminist analysis. It's the concept of ""what if we just snapped and went fucking apeshit and let them see what we are capable of? what if they get to taste the bitter pill they've shoved in women's throats for thousands of years?""

What you miss as a man is the resentment a lot of women feel at their core for how we get treated and how we see ourselves and other women being used. Seeing what Amy does isn't just narratively compelling. It's cathartic. Most people wouldn't ever do the things she does, but the fantasy of just snapping and getting to be the shitty person without consequences for once against your oppressors.",snaughtydog,2023-09-12T19:56:26Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

I think the idea is that if a character like Amy had a positive outlet for her brilliance, she might not have turned it to something so evil. I think there's something feminist about this idea of a highly intelligent woman just wasting away as a housewife with an unfaithful, ungrateful husband and then turning that intelligence into a weapon. It's both the natural consequence of and also revenge for wasting and stifling women's capabilities.

It's like this battle cry: we are not going to be ignored. We are not going to be taken for granted. We are not going to be used. We are going to show you how powerful we can be if we don't keep following the rules society sets for women.",Cathode335,2023-09-13T05:30:38Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

Seeing that Gone Girl is more of a commercial booktok plot, many new readers might have focused on that part as a main message.

EDIT: Maybe because Nick is such a huge good for nothing, lazy, cheater that some women might want to see him suffer. He might represent their own exes.

16gxk4w,As a feminist the main feminist take I have of the book is that Amy is so unlikeable. Feminism doesn’t teach that every woman is perfect and kind and our farts smell like roses. Amy is the female representation of psychopathy. Psychopaths are mostly men but not exclusively. The standard media representation of gender roles are reversed in Gone Girl. It was a risky move because the media don’t usually respond well to that narrative but it was done well.,Humble-Doughnut7518,2023-09-13T05:59:35Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"Feminism isn't the belief that women are inherently good or better than men. It's the belief that women are potentially *as good* as any other person, and that means they also have the capacity to be just as bad as everyone else. Gillian Flynn's work is very much a reaction to the idea that only 'good', nice female characters are allowed to be protagonists. Her female protagonists are often some combination of selfish, sexist, lazy, and downright cruel.

Which is to say: You're 100% right, Amy is a total psycho. The 'cool girl' quote is about Amy's own internalized sexism and anti-feminism; it's a long rant about how she hates other women, and how she's the only 'valid' one wrt her relationships with men.

The book is feminist because it's writing the kind of book that would normally only star a male character (think Patrick Bateman, other classic 'bad guy' characters), but it stars a female character. That's all. Amy isn't supposed to be good or kind or 'cool'. She's a 'gone girl' physically-- she disappears-- but she's also gone metaphorically: there is nothing in her heart.

But a lot of people, so accustomed to only reading books where female main characters are feminist paragons, miss this and think Amy is admirable. That's where you get the 'use this as a litmus test for your boyfriend!' BS. You didn't fail. The test was a dumb one to begin with.",w3hwalt,2023-09-13T12:32:13Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"I didn’t take it as feminist at all. I read it for the first time about 6 months ago. I took it as a very detailed portrayal of a severe personality disorder that was exacerbated by an emotionally immature partner who deceived and took her for granted. I thought they were both terrible people. 

But Amy was far more complex than simply “evil”. I saw nothing redeeming about her in anyway that affirms equality/agency for women. Some of the internal dialog and interactions between characters might have dipped into feminist theory here and there. But “women are just as evil as men” seems too reductive to me. This was a book about psychopathy within a marriage that was basically like most marriages. Boredom. Selfishness. Deception. Psychopathy. 

Publishing the book could be considered a feminist achievement for the author. A female psychopath is sort of unique I guess? Was Single White Female a feminist movie? One of the more delicious aspects of Gone Girl was that the author artfully deceived the reader. Readers are likely to sympathize with one character over the other until there is a beautiful, slow roll out of holy shit! This bitch psycho! I think the author teased an easy “feminist” stand up for your rights sort of narrative and then completely turned it on its head. 

Feminism is not “women good/men bad”. That’s why it’s hard for so many people to analyze via a feminist lens. Anyway, great book. People should definitely check it out.

The audiobook has a reading of an older manuscript that describes Amy’s family/childhood very differently than the final book. It was more on the nose about feminism. It was also way less interesting than the story that got published.",1KushielFan,2023-09-13T13:44:59Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"I don't necessarily think you would fail the litmus test because you do recognise *one of* the feminist points made by the cool girl monologue. The bar is low. 

I was one of the first people I knew to read Gone Girl, and enjoyed it the first time I read it, in that it's clearly a revenge / power fantasy, and in those the protagonist often acts in non-heroic ways that are justified by righting a wrong done against them. You can argue whether the level of punishment fits the crime, but that's not really the point - the point is an exaggerated feeling of triumph over people / the kind of person who has wronged you. Men have had a lot of these stories, women haven't had many if any, and often 'revenge stories' were still made to be titillating to men - e.g. rape revenge horror movies often focus heavily on the rape, and then even then the revenge will be largely gory spectacle and not emotionally satisfying. Midsommar was also like this for some women, the fact that a woman won over a man that treated her badly was emotionally satisfying (BTW you can think this and also be aware that this is not the point of the film/book). It really doesn't happen in media that often, particularly not with actual aggressive behaviour that the narrative doesn't shame versus symbolic winning.

That said, I still knew that Amy was equally supposed to be a sociopath, you were supposed to be horrified by the lengths she was willing to go to, and that you were supposed to leave the book with ambivalent feelings about it all. & as other women I knew, particularly ones I'd recommended it to, I did notice that some of them didn't have these ambivalent feelings, which got me questioning if the text was genuinely setting out to provoke them.

I came to re-evaluate the book after reading the other two actually - Sharp Objects and Dark Places - when I realised >!they also take place against a background of low level misogyny BUT the killer, the immediate problem, is a woman, every time. Often a mother - Amy finishes Gone Girl a mother too.!< So now I think Gillian Flynn is not making well-thought out commentary on gender roles or attempts at psychologically and morally complicated revenge fantasies for women - I honestly think she has some sort of issue about mothers, about mother-daughter dynamics to work out, and it's just a coincidence that Gone Girl blew up rather than either of the other two.

It feels a bit dismissive to say that about a female author - oh, she's just got mummy issues - and I did feel guilty about that until Gone Girl got cited in the Heard vs Depp trial. Whatever your take on that trial, a work of fiction should NOT have been used to present a supposedly plausible scenario for a real life court case. And I never heard about Gillian Flynn commenting on it at all - which, if she cared about the rammifications and deeper meanings behind her work, I think there would be no reason not to speak out.

So I think if there is feminist commentary in Flynn's work, it's more to do with motherhood and parental dynamics (like how Amazing Amy makes Amy what she is) than to do with a battle of the sexes.",livingadhesively,2023-09-12T19:36:47Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"It’s not really that it’s a feminist book, but a cautionary tale for feminine rage. Like the particular WAY Amy snaps is a way many women feel as though they can when the small insults in their lives gets to be intolerable. And relationships with parents, the public, and partners CAN get intolerable in this way for women more than you’d think. Like if you let the rage win, this is where it’d take you—and it’d be a dark and shitty  place to be. 

So when I read Gone Girl, I realized that I did identify with her rage, especially the Cool Girl monologue, which felt like a very modern expression of how we contort ourselves as a woman to be attractive. Also, painfully, how we see our friends contort themselves. And then see ourselves or our friends mistreated and abused in some relationship is truly infuriating. 

So literature is a safe place to realize that you DO identify with the rage, but also why indulging it is so destructive. Of course Amy is the villain, that’s the point. She’s the worst version of what that rage could be.",chocoheed,2023-09-13T20:23:52Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

As a piece of writing, it is almost post-feminist in the sense that its central character is not limited in ways female characters often are. The author Gillian Flynn kinda said that writing this unlikable female character was feminist act for her as a writer.

And the cool girl speech was a feminist moment for lots of women who didn't necessarily have words to describe this exact thing... and so it has a historical place in a  consciousness raising sense.

But both of these are ancillary to the story and plot - which were not and were not intended to be especially feminist. Just fun.

16gxk4w,"This exactly. Gone Girl isn't as much a feminist manifesto as it is a satire on American marriage. Amy is more obviously and exaggeratedly evil, but Nick's actions are sinister in the carefree way that's expected of husbands. 

Over the brief course of their marriage he turns an independent, successful, prideful, type-A, intelligent woman into a Stepford Wife. When they move to the midwest Amy hasn't done anything bad yet, but Nick had already started treating her like a villain. He doesn't ask her if she wants to move even tho she would have said yes. He resents her for her money even after she gives him all the funds to start his dream bar. She's in a foreign place, taking plates and hosting potlucks like a dutiful wife but Nick still frames her as a stuck up New Yorker. He never vents about his frustrations he just gets mad at her for trying to get him to open up. He spends her money during the recession then shuts her down when she brings it up. Their whole marriage he neglects her, and after his mom passes he basically acts like she doesn't exist. She was a wealthy, successful writer who moved to podunk nowhere for him, let him blow her money, cleaned the house while he played video games, played nice with his old country friends, and yet he acts like her mere presence is a bother to him. 


Amy is quite extra, she does have very high standards. But she continuously lowers them to please him. She would never do this for any guy but Nick initially poses himself as on her level. He plays the role until he doesn't have to. She holds on cause she wants it to work, he's made it work before, and because she does love him even if she also loves the idea of their relationship. As batshit as she is, the book does make it clear all the reasons that she loves him. Nick doesn't really seem to love her as much as he loves that he bagged a smoking hot fuckmaid. She's high maintenance but Nick won't even put in a normal amount of work. He often won't even do the bare minimum that the other husbands do. And Amy is so smart that she thinks she's letting him. But Nick exerts passive control over her. She makes herself smaller and smaller just to please him in hopes that he'll give her the smallest amount of love that she desperately craves. I would even call it abusive. The reason most don't see it that way is cause it's so common and so subtle.

The way Amy retaliates is an inverse of Nick. She's very intentional, calculated, high concept. But all Nick had to do was put his weight on her then go limp. She was chained to him, then he gets stuck with her. Nick weathered Amy down into a perfect housewife. Amy forced him to be a perfect ""loving"" husband. 

I wouldn't call Amy the villain cause Nick isn't the protagonist. The book tells both of their stories side by side. And you're not really supposed to root for Nick anymore than Amy. They're both smug assholes, and the book and movie make that clear. Nick doesn't seem as bad cause he wasn't trying to break Amy down. He wasn't trying at all. He wasn't trying to love her, protect her, or even notice her. He didn't care one bit that Amy became a tortured shell of her former self. Meanwhile Amy was trying hard the whole time to please him, show him she cares in her way over the top way. She put in all the effort in their relationship and put in that same effort into breaking him down the way he broke her down.

It’s cathartic for women to watch Amy snap and see Nick, who clearly thinks he’s so smart, get outsmarted.

16gxk4w,"Isn't it an accepted trope that to be likeable a character must repent their bad ways? Male or female?

Anyway, she is a total sociopath through and through. I think the feminist angle is just that she manipulates males by playing up to archetypes that stroke the male ego. Also, it comments on how reactionary she is, ultimately trapping herself through trying to break from roles males want of her. At no point does she think ""who am I without this conflict? Can I self actualise outside of the male gaze?""... And she kind of tries to self-actualise but finds she is not as clever or as strong as she would like to be and runs to another man she can manipulate... And ultimately traps herself at the end by believing in the fantasy of Nick's lies on TV... He was being disingenuous on TV to manipulate her and she fell for it.

It is ultimately a tragedy where no one wins and the couple are trapped in their dishonesty.

I agree with OP that is not very feminist. It comments on how women must navigate this patriarchal world.

Mostly, I think Gone Girl has much more lucid cimmentary on the themes of perception/truth/manipulation within mass media narratives. Nearly every conversation has something to say on these themes, and the structure of the film has the audience constantly rezevaluate their views of the characters. The characters are the same people all the way through, but how we feel and think about them is constantly changing as we gain new information. It's very good at deconstructing the 24hrNews cycle and media focus. If I had to study Gone Girl then I'd probably go for that angle as it is a much richer seam to delve in and you can include the feminist commentary and contextualise it with how the media uses women in specific roles with specific boundaries of behaviour, and that women who fall outside those boundaries are mis-represented and devalued.",Chip_Pan_Fire,2023-09-13T07:39:22Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

I've followed these conversations for years and it is astounding to be on the male side of it and be hearing the exact same things at a much older age that you were hearing before.  It doesn't matter how much YOU change, if men are abstracted you can be assumed to not know.  You sort of, understand that the women saying it and the men they're saying it to morph over the years and there's ALWAYS going to be jerk men around who don't get it so the conversation doesn't grow up.  So many conversations just are unproductive from the jump.

With Gone Girl, I think what's interesting is the Madonna/Whore dichotomy and the various roles women seem to be assigned in fiction has changed over the years but many people don't really appreciate just how much of a change it has been.   There was a period where frankly Women roles were often needing to be shown as ""better"" than the men they were on the screen with often with cliche ""interactions"" meant to show somehow the superiority or deficiency between the two characters.   But the rule tended to be, ""in a good way"".  Somehow, when you wrote that character, the character was almost always in the right.

Gone Girl is almost an adult Cruella Deville - so unrepentant and so overtly  bad and active in the story, its easy to fail to realize just how many other women characters are forced to be ""overly nuanced"" or ""secretly the victim"".  It's such a trend that both Malificent AND Cruella Deville now have live action prequels ""softening"" them.

So for me, the Feminism in the character is about going all the way to the point that you can write about anything again.  I'd I'd fully admit - it would play much differently if Gillian Flynn was an author named Bob Jones.",azzers214,2023-09-13T18:37:08Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"There is no “irony” here. Feminist readings don’t require that the female protagonist is entirely unconnected to male characters. Feminist scholars have done decades of research to highlight the *many* important female characters (villains and otherwise) and female writers in literary history. Are there equal numbers? No. But that’s different than claiming that “for centuries and centuries women got to be only virgin or whore, mother or crone.” Lady MacBeth is much more complex than just her relation to MacBeth. I could go on—if you want complex female villains, Austen’s Lady Catherine DeBourgh or Thackery’s Becky Sharp are perfect. Or what about the White Witch in Narnia? Anna Karenina is a deeply flawed and yet fascinating woman, both hero and anti-hero. 

I’m saying that Gone Girl is participating in a long literary tradition of the complex female villain. That’s a good thing, but not a new thing.",Fun_Ad_8927,2023-09-13T01:19:40Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"Arguably no, in real life. In fiction, female characters who display similar behaviors to standard “asshole” men characters are often punished for their behavior or treated as much worse than their male counterparts. Alternatively, some people argue that it’s not realistic to compare male “asshole” behavior 1-to-1 with women doing the same behavior, because women engage less frequently in a lot of those standard behaviors (ex. Its much less common for a woman to completely offload all emotional/mental labour onto their male partner in a heterosexual relationship, compared to the inverse dynamic). So I’ve seen some people argue that the actions of manipulative, neglectful, toxic women present differently than those of manipulative, neglectful, toxic men. Societally, a lot of the female-coded behaviors are viewed as much worse/crueller/more evil than the male-coded behaviors. So some might say that Gone Girl flips the script, and treats the male-coded behaviors as the more evil action for a change.",JuPasta,2023-09-13T03:48:33Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

16gxk4w,"Sorry, good point, I don't mean to move the goal posts on you but since I was being a bit unclear - I consider that kind of content to also be a type of feminist media in the same way Gone Girl is. A new wave of Women Behaving Badly. Hothead Paisan ran in the 90s, it was more of a conversation then.

I don't think it's always good or useful and I think it can double back around on itself to become actively sexist when it's paired with objectification, but it's a trope born out of girl power, as you say.

I think you're dead right about meanness, though (although that's getting better too) but I also think there are still pretty intense taboos about the violence when you get out of the comic book genre and into the more realistic. Not to disprove my own point but look at Orange is the New Black, and the kinds of stuff we saw on that show we don't usually see elsewhere.",monstrousinsect,2023-09-13T00:09:28Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery
16gxk4w,"To a certain degree, but there’s also kind of a sub-genre of thrillers and crime dramas where the protagonist could be considered a villain. It was actually pretty common in the age of the pulps - the Parker books and most of Jim Thompson’s output feature protagonists who would be villains in any other work. The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1280 by Thompson are probably some of the finest examples of this kind of story ever written, even if they’re kind of the same book. Patricia Highsmith, an obvious influence on Gillian Flynn, had her most famous creation fall under this umbrella, too - Tom Ripley from The Talented Mr. Ripley and other novels. Modern examples could include things like the movie Nightcrawler, the novel The Butcher Boy, maybe Breaking Bad, and definitely Gone Girl, at least the sections from Amy’s POV.

Flynn was called a misogynist by some readers and critics when they book came out, and she pointed out there’s a long tradition of morally bankrupt men being protagonists, she didn’t understand why she was getting so much heat for giving women the same opportunity.",NeoNoireWerewolf,2023-09-12T20:28:44Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

Flynn was the screenwriter for both but had eight full hours to adapt 252 pages of story with SO versus 2.4 hours to portray 405 page. Flynn was able to not only fully capture the ambiance, plot, and main themes of the novel but was also able to expand the roles of a number of side characters who were originally limited by the novels first person narration.  The casting for SO is also impeccable. Amma and Adora in particular were played so skilfully by Eliza Scanlen and Patricia Clarkson.

3d1g6e,"Gone Girl is the most polished novel of the three. There is a very common style that the three share, and it almost seems like the first two were practice for Gone Girl, which was written most recently. So GG would be #1.

Thennnnnn... Dark Places #2, Sharp Objects #3. DP probably has the most ""problems"", but the story and characters are more compelling. SO, if it can be said to have one, has a better moral. Without giving anything away, the moral could be the cycle of self-harm: infliction of pain, suffering, healing. You cut, you hurt, then you clean the wound, bandage and heal. I read a couple reviews before I read SO and it was common to see that the book made people want to self-harm. I disagree, but I am someone with my own self-harm habit. I dont cut, I forget the word for what I do, but I think its what Natalie Portman does in Black Swan (I havent seen the movie, only heard about it), but I tear the skin around my nails. So to an extent, I can personally relate to and understand SO. (EDIT: Just want to say that I am working very hard to stop this habit I have, but its a ten year habit and I find that I often do it subconsciously. But I'm working on it.)


However... I still rank it third because it just plain wasnt as satisfying as DP. And neither were, in my opinion, as satisfying as GG. Still good, but obvious that the *quality* of writing just isnt as good. Flynn grew as a writer, as an author,  by writing SO and DP.

>The only complaint I have about this novel is the very end because the story is uncharacteristically resolved in comparison to Flynn’s other books.

I found the ending to be in-line with her other novels. She writes suspense and deep, intriguing characters well but the writing sharply declines right after the big climax and kind of muddles through to the end.

Into the Water (same author of Paula Hawkins) was another good book that I couldn’t put down. It’ll eventually be a movie, and I’m also scared it won’t do it justice.

Did you write the chapters more or less sequentially, or were Amy's journal/POV chapters a very separate writing process you later integrated in between Nick's chapters?

I'm really excited to see your AMA--I teach literature at a local college, and I literally just finished teaching *Gone Girl* last Friday. My students greatly enjoyed it, though many were upset at the ending (they really want people to be punished for their bad actions--poor naive kids). 

Your book was a great addition to my class, and I hope that other people are teaching it--very fun, lots of great conversations about structure and craft. 

My two questions are these:

23ojta,"There's a long history of putting social criticism in a villain's mouth. (For example, the most cutting critique of sexism in Westeros comes from Cersei Lannister, a villain.) In *Gone Girl*, [Amy](/spoiler) makes an amazingly bitter and cutting critique of sexism, but she's a *villain*. So people can choose to swallow her critique or not; she's either saying something daring and incisive or she's just a crazy bitch.

This reads to me as... sketchy, especially when you then write your villains not as their own kind of villain, but as strawmen built by people who hate (in this case) women. Having a woman whose methods of doing evil include [pregnancy scares, false rape accusations and eventually *spermjacking*](/spoiler) reads like someone from /r/MensRights drew a picture of what they think a woman is like. It's roughly as insulting as having a black villain who defrauds the government for welfare money, manipulates white liberal guilt for cynical profit, beats up gentiles at the behest of his Jewish masters, and rapes white women. It takes one stereotype--the Manic Pixie Dream Girl--and cleverly subverts it by turning her into *another* stereotype, [the man-eating witchy feminazi hag](/spoiler).

I suppose I didn't really have a question; I just wanted to say that. The book certainly got a reaction out of me; I think it's the third time ever that reading a book has made me angry at *the author*. You're not going to please everyone, but you did have enough of a reaction on me that when I saw the post, I had to come here and write this.

When I completed all three books, a part of me felt empty, like something is missing and can't be replaced. And I have not felt that for a very long time, about a lot of things. So, thank you, for the characters that are so real, and for me, even somehow likable. 

People are not black or white, the grey matters, and that's what I find in your characters. So brilliantly portrayed by you. I have to mention, Dark Places is my special favourite. And your perfect sketch of ""Cool Girl"" in Gone Girl, is by far, the most cleverly expressed in words. I love Sharp Objects too.

23ojta,"Hi Ms Flynn.

My SO had read Gone Girl for a book club a while ago. I read it for the first time a few months ago. She was amused as I talked to her about the book as I was reading it. About halfway through I began drawing parallels between Nick and Amy's relationship and our own, and she got a little disturbed. I actually called the framejob pretty early on, but still found that we were very similar in a lot of aspects.

It amuses me that so many people are horrified at the characters. I find that they're characters who are very loveable. They're both fairly extreme, but they've managed to find each other, balancing each other's neuroses. I feel that the only alternatives to what they have are destroying two other people, being alone, or being incarcerated. 

So I guess thank you for creating a narrative where we see an oasis in a desert of normalcy. I appreciate having a reference for how to make peace with my inner demons.",martin_grosse,2014-04-22T16:52:32Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

I read Gone Girl just because I saw you were doing an AMA, and it ended up being so captivating and thrilling that I couldn't put it down.

As the story fleshed out and Amy became more apparently psychotic, I can only say it was a personal journey for me and I evolved as a person after finishing your book, so thank you for that.

I am excited to hear a movie is being made, and that you wrote the screenplay. Since the book is in a back-and-forth format between perspectives and one half of the first part is a ""creative-retelling.""  I can't wait to see how it translates to the screen.

My questions: what was your writing process for this book? Did you write Nick's parts first then later fill in intermittent diary entries from Amy, or did you do it in sequence? Also, how long did it take for you to write the book- from the time the idea popped into your head to when it was time to start publishing?

Do you have any more books that you're writing that you can give us a little peek into?  I've been going through good thriller withdrawal since I finished reading all of your books last summer.  

Also, are any of the characters or events in the books (such as the massacre or little girl serial killer) inspired by people in your life or true events that you may have witnessed at some point?

When you write the characters, do you base their appearance on real people, actors, your friends, family, neighbours etc?

Is Sharp Objects going to be adapted?

I've read Sharp Objects and Dark Places several times each, but Gone Girl only the once. It's just as brilliantly written but I found the characters unlikable enough as to feel I was finishing the book out of obligation =(. I'm sorry. I know many of your characters are not meant to be Mary Sue perfect people and I love that, I love that they're flawed. But the character from Gone Girl made me just kind of want them both to die =(

You write damaged/dangerous children very, very well. Is there a reason why you focus on kids, and on the characters as kids?

Do you plan any more stories featuring dangerous/broken kids?

23ojta,"Hi! Thank you! Last year was all about the Gone Girl screenplay, so I am only just now leaving GoneGirlworld and having room in my brain to start the next novel. It is a big, sprawling American folkloric tale of murder. I also, oddly enough, am doing a YA novel after that. No vampires. As for unlikable characters: I've always said I don't mind if a character isn't likable as long as he or she is understandable. Do I get why these people are doing the awful things they do? I think that's why I often include backstories about childhood—if you understand what circumstances or people created a person, I think you have more empathy. And humor. Libby Day, Nick and Amy Dunne—they do awful things, but they're very self-aware and fairly funny at times.

23ojta,"I'm always curious too. I think the reassuring thing is, the more you hear about other writers' processes, the more you realize there is no one right way to do it. You write in whatever way gets the job done for you. I personally don't outline: That would take the fun out of it for me. I like to spend a lot of time on my characters, figuring out who they are and what led them to whatever awful situation I've put them in. For Gone Girl, I knew Nick and Amy had to be very believable, so I made ipod playlists for them, and knew their netflix queues. I wrote scenes of them in childhood from other people's points of view: A scene of Amy in highschool, written from her friend's POV, or Nicks kindergarten teacher writing about parent-teacher conference night. Stuff I knew I'd never use, but would help me flesh them out. I do that a lot when I've hit a writer's block--it keeps me writing and sometimes helps solve a problem. Amy's Cool Girl speech started as a writing exercise, but that one I liked so much I kept it for the book. Once I have a first draft, then the actual real work for me begins, because then I can see the novel as a whole and see what needs work. I do tons of rewriting; it's where the book becomes a book.

pm51mp,"Somehow I had managed to remain in blissful ignorance of Gillian Flynn's body of work until one day when I was walking back from the library with my sister, who had just borrowed out a copy of *Gone Girl.* She told me she had reserved the copy because David Fincher was making a film based on it, and gave me a loose synopsis of the first act of the book (wife gone missing, her side told through diary entries, everyone suspects the husband).

After hearing this I then mention ""oh it's probably-"" and ended up describing exactly what happens in the book, because, to me, it was the most obvious twist someone could write with that setup.

I still ended up really enjoying the book. Especially the characters (I maintain Nick is just as much a sociopath as Amy, just in a much more subtle way). My biggest complaint is that the last act of the book is resolved far too quickly, and involves some suspense-stretching contrivances to work out, though I do love the ending.

I (30 y/o man) definitely am reading it as a cautionary tale, but as a *what not to do* when marital problems arise. I see a *lot* of my past self in Nick and it’s definitely difficult being confronted with it. 

I also have experience working in the criminal Justice system and it’s definitely an indictment of the media when it comes to true crime (ie there’s no longer such a thing as an untainted jury). Cable news, Nancy Grace types, certain podcasts, and social media create an environment where a fair trial is impossible and it’s not particularly an arguable point anymore. 

Like I said, I’m only halfway through but Flynn does a great job of making the reader *want* to dislike almost every character so far (except Go) but we feel ourselves sort of “rooting” for certain characters depending on our perspectives.

3bhdxl,"""The next *Gone Girl*"" seems to have been the most popular marketing gimmick for a lot of books in the past few years. Psychologically twisty books in that vein, most of which I enjoyed reading:

*Dark Places* and *Sharp Objects* by Gillian Flynn (obviously)

*The Silent Wife* by A.S.A. Harrison (another twisted marriage)

*The Good Girl* by Mary Kubica (the ending will make you hate the author)

*Reconstructing Amelia* and *Where They Found Her* by Kimberly McCreight (very similar in tone with Gillian Flynn's works)

*Everything I Never Told You* by Celeste Ng (light on plot, heavy on twisted family dynamics)


And some twisty works that were written pre-*Gone Girl*:


*Notes on a Scandal* by Zoe Heller (probably the best book of all of these, on par with *Gone Girl*)

*What the Dead Know* by Laura Lippman 

*In the Woods* by Tana French

*Before I Go to Sleep* by S.J. Watson

But once the tedium of real life hit, and it was no longer fun, she was lost. Then his infidelity surfaced. She got pissed. I mean, in her mind, she married down. Then he cheated on her? That’s when the psychopathic behavior rears it’s very ugly head. Don’t get me wrong. She’s awful! But I found the book more nuanced. Also, the extent to which she goes to in order to “win” is insane.

Dark Places is (edit, got it mixed up with the third, Sharp something) — an exploration of childhood trauma set to the background of farm foreclosures and the Satanic Panic.

2kh4t4,"Okay, but in addition to movies that both capture the tone/impact of the source and play it so close to the original that they're practically interchangeable, like Gone Girl, there are movies based on suspense novels and other books with twists that some people don't want ""ruined"" by seeing them played out onscreen before reading the novel. 

There are a lot of perfectly good movie adaptations that I wouldn't see before reading the book, just because I would rather watch the story unfold organically in novel form first (especially if it's an author I'm particularly attached to). 

This is especially true for serial film franchises - read the books first or live in fear of spoilers for years in between film releases (not to mention half the fun of those franchises is the anticipation and discussion, which you have to either cut yourself off from or resign yourself to hearing all about secondhand from those who read the books early). 

Watching the movie *always* before reading the book might work for you, but I really don't think it's applicable here in the case of Gone Girl, which OP was specifically asking about, or as a general rule of thumb for movie adaptations. ",,2014-10-27T19:08:18Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

5eadpk,"I really loved the book. Now people call it ""overhyped"" because that's what people tend to do when something becomes popular—but I think it was hyped for good reason. 

It wasn't the first book to feature a dangerous, dark woman but it *was* the first to do it so openly and unabashedly in modern times—and I love that. Have you read Gillian Flynn's quote for why she writes such dark female characters? It's more of a mini-essay but it's wonderful and I heartily agree with her. Most of us women aren't as dark as her characters, of course, but we're also not the sympathetic ""flawed roses"" that many authors make us out to be. I loved that the story explored the rage of women (expressed through one woman and her thoughts). I said this recently in another thread, but I think many women can relate a lot to Amy: the fury and despair over feeling like they always have to be perfect, that if they don't kow-tow to a guy they're suddenly a ""shrew,"" or ""harpy,"" or ""bitch,"" and the ugly realization that society (and men) often see them as objects to be ""traded for a younger, prettier model.""

Yes, Amy was a sociopath and no, most women are not sociopaths—but Amy's thoughts on gender, and male vs female dynamics had a lot of truth and merit to them. I believe the Cool Girl stereotype is true; women are often pressured to act dumb, like sports, drink beer, and other such guy-ish things so they can seem like ""they can hang,"" and ""they're one of the dudes, a really *cool* chick""—oh, but they also have to be hot. But I don't really see as much pressure on men to be hot *as well as* watching romantic-comedies, going to spas with women, and enjoying shopping. I'm not saying there's no pressure on men at all, but way less of it. After all, a girl who drinks beer to please her man is a ""cool chick"" but a guy who watches Fashion Week shows to please his girl would be called ""whipped"" or ""a pussy, come on dude! You're watching fashion shows just so she can like you?! Where are your balls, man?"" 

I think you guys get my point. 

Both Amy and Nick were awful people. I think the difference is, Amy's nastiness bloomed in much darker, dangerous ways because girls aren't allowed to express rage as openly. She fel stifled, unwanted, and made to feel like a toy doll her whole life and this messed her up. But as long as her husband pretended to be perfect along with her, she'd act normal. When Nick decided to ruin the perfect persona by being, well, lazy and a cheater and a flawed human—well, I think Amy's rage was justifiable. It's not fair, is it, that she was expected to pretend to be perfect her whole life...but her husband could get away with ruining his act? 

The murder, obviously, is not justifiable. Nor are the actual crimes she committee. It's just her anger I get. 

Nick was terrible. I feel like he pales in comparison to Amy's violence but when you *look* at him, he was a terrible guy: a cheater, unwilling to communicate with his wife, petulant, a penchant to blame everyone else for his issues, misogynistic in his thoughts... He was a piece of shit. 

And ultimately, I don't think Gillian Flynn set out with the goal of creating a feminist novel. But I think in writing a female character that so few authors dare to, and really tapping into her world, and making certain observations about gender and sex and violence...she kind of inadvertently created a feminist book. I see nothing wrong with that. 

And I loved the ending. It was so frustrating but I love that the author *went there.* Cause in real life, sometimes our endings are unhappy and ugly. 

Sorry for the essay, I just have a lot of thoughts about Gone Girl lol. ",RomanovaRoulette,2016-11-22T16:48:02Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

2j0bf0,"The most troubling thought to me about the ending to Gone Girl is the inevitable fate of their son.

Amy does not impregnate herself out of love, but out of self-preservation. When the son starts behaving in a way that does not satisfy that need any longer, I imagine that Amy would simply set up the son in order to destroy him.

You can make the argument that the fate of the principal characters was brought on by themselves (except for the victims of Amy's lies from her past). If Nick doesn't cheat, Amy doesn't frame him for her murder. If Amy had planned/protected her escape better (not talked to Greta), she would not have had to call Desi. If Desi had not acted like a creepy weirdo prison warden, Amy would not have stabbed him.

But the son has no control in this. For those who don't have kids, they look to their parents for love and guidance, and they do not understand, particularly at an early age, the consequences of their actions. What bothers me most is that Amy would likely punish him regardless of that fact. Beyond all else, I can't imagine her treating him with love, and that's just so tragic.

For Gillian Flynn, it was a really smart way to give Amy a way out, but it opened many more dissatisfying thoughts for me around the son's fate.

98zyal,"I actually think Gillian Flynn is a really good writer and has a great story-sense (and I am really loving SHARP OBJECTS at the moment). 

She wrote the script for GONE GIRL herself, and I think in collaboration with David Fincher she really honed in on the meat of the story in a way that it amplified the almost trashy, pitch-black comedy elements in a way that really worked cinematically. I’m aware that it’s very streamlined compared to the novel, but I think that works in its favor because it becomes this hyper-focused, hilariously bleak polemic on American marriage, basically. It’s not trying to be this sprawling mystery, it’s just becomes this funny and mean thriller and it packs way more of a punch. And the actual filmmaking itself is superb and Fincher is just totally in tune with the script Flynn wrote.

Generally I just think it’s a more powerful and satisfying movie experience than it is a reading experience. That’s not a knock on the book, which is very good, but the movie is *great* - as its own thing. ",,2018-08-21T06:57:46Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

So you'll lose that. You'll lose some of the surprise of the other plot points as well, but I think the book will really solidify the characters and how almost perfect Amy's plan was. 

I think some things the movie misses are: 

- Why did Nick stay? The movie, to me, made it a little confusing why he stayed. The book showed a little more of the relationship with his father. 

- Amy seems a bit smarter and Nick seems a bit dumber in the book. 

- I thought the cop was perfectly cast. The cop chick was my favorite side character in the book!

The whole book is set up to make you really dislike Nick which I thought was unusual and gripping because there seemed to be really nothing in him worth supporting especially when his chapters are intercut with whole pages from Amy's diary which is filled with a character you (as a reader) can relate to, you laugh with her and sympathise and obviously once her true character is revealed and you come to know  that she's alive and the whole intended purpose of the diary is to make the reader fall in love with her you snap because you realise you fell for it!  The jokes on you and suddenly the tables turn and you find yourself in the same shoes as Nick, feeling betrayed by her and hurt, almost embarrassed that you fell for the ""cool girl"" Amy Dunne. So aside from the format the writing itself is actually brilliant, its quirky and descriptive and totally relatable which is why, in my opinion, it gets you so hard when you fall for these set traps in the story. Obviously some of the characters are more fleshed out in the book but actually I was surprised at how much they fit into the movie and how well they did in keeping true to the book. Themes wise I think you'll find theres a bit more going on in the book than in the film, the film for obvious reasons had to be a slightly simplified version of the book but like I said before I think you'll be surprised at how well they adapted it... i think that mostly comes from Gillian herself adapting the screenplay. SO all in all I recommend the book as a good read, knowing the plot/seeing the movie won't massively affect the enjoyment of the book its still a thing of greatness BUT if you don't want to or decide not to I urge you to read anything else written by Gillian Flynn, I've read everything she's written and they're all fantastic. Hope this helps, sorry if it doest I'm fucking tired.

TL;DR: The film is a great adaptation but the book is still worth a read.",mickeyunlikethemouse,2015-03-09T23:06:18Z,Gone Girl,COMMENT,Mystery

Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.

I’m not saying you should read The Magicians on these grounds but I really want to know if anyone else besides me picked that up or noticed how very much The Magicians borrows from The Secret History.

Have in mind -- I was VERY engaged until that halfway mark and there's not really anything in particular that happened in the story which was a turn off, it was just not as good as it started and I slogged to the end with a new mindset in which I anticipated what I thought would be lazy and surely enough -- that's the direction the story went in.

I cared for every single one of the main group and was looking forward to get to know them... at the start. Yeah Richard is an unreliable narrator, but just because he's boring and suffers from a severe lack of personality it doesn't mean that the rest of the group should therefore all be lifeless and copies of one another.

It's like Donna knew how to write one (1) person and just copy pasted a sort of template among the main characters.

Not sure why that's the case, I think it's the focus of the story. The Goldfinch really encapsulates something like 10 years while the Secret History stretches more like two years or less.

I didn't feel like there was cohesion in a unified ""this all makes sense"" kind of way - just a series of events with characters coming in and out of them. I also think Henry's solution to the problem near the end was a bit deus ex machina - wouldn't Charles still have had the legal issue and the instability that everyone was concerned would out them? I don't see how Henry's solution would have resolved that.

Personally, in The Goldfinch I loved everyone so much beginning to end. I agree, Boris really was amazing!
However in The Secret History as I got further into the book some of their personalities began to grate on my nerves and their actions baffled me at times.

BUT people who love The Secret History DO NOT LIKE The Goldfinch and vice versa- it is comical how unanimous this is. I always read a thread when Donna Tartt's books are being discussed and have gone through so many posts. 

For The Goldfinch, there are many criticisms (much more than TSH from what I observed). It is too long, should've been crisp, not much is happening, ending feels rushed etc. I don't think any of these are wrong but I still loved it, I would re- read it again.The thing about TG is its spectacular writing- the book is very writing driven and not plot driven at all.  A lot of pages are about the MC's emotions. The whole book feels like a vibe, more than a story. Honestly I can say the story or plot is very secondary, it doesn't even matter much. And usually I prefer plot driven books, go figure ! 

Some sections in the book can drag, so if you give it a shot and feel so at a certain point in the story, try rushing past those pages (I didn't have to but again I'm assuming you being a TSH lover won't like The Goldfinch hah!) and see if it works for you.",PinkMoonbow,2023-07-28T09:43:06Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

Maybe if it was told by a character who was interesting and had stronger feelings about themselves and the people they're surrounded by... they would've likely tried to make their own actions seem sympathetic regardless of whether or not they actually are... but a boring character idealizing unlikable characters just doesn't really do it for me.

1ahxrcs,"I think this book is one you can read at a surface level and catch most of it, or need a Classics degree to parse the minutiae of it. Very broadly though, Henry's ""problem with his passport"" is very much an inability to move forward. A death scene like this was also done in Harry Potter (I do wonder if the writer of those books, SheWhoShallNotBeNamed, may have taken direct inspiration from this) in the guise of a train station. In The Secret History, it's more of a split between The Fields of Asphodel and Limbo, which could make sense as Henry was a Catholic who really began to believe in Greek mythos. For more, read Dante's Inferno and the Odyssey.

Dreams in Greek Mythology would be viewed as prophecy, though those dreams could be a deception and you don't understand the true purpose of it. In this situation, they believe Richard has a fundamental part to play in their misadventures but are completely unaware what exact part he will ultimately play.",nartak,2024-02-03T21:27:04Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

At the very least, it would have encouraged me to smoke more cigarettes.    


As an older reader, I could appreciate the prose and the tale; but ultimately, there were always moments that struck me as rather ridiculous.

10ymnen,"I don't really like the secret history,but I think you sell the author short by looking for a unifying CSI-type plot in anything those people did.  I don't think that's what tartt was writing about.  I think she was writing about human nature and human relationships.  it doesn't really fit to a procedural type of theory because that's not the way people are.  I see just about everything in the book - especially the ""story"" and how it unfolds - as a direct and organic outcome of who each of them is and the ways their personalities react to and act on one another.  

to that extent I think it's a clever echo of actual Greek tragedy, where a person's fate is written right into their bones and happens to them because they are them.  

I disagree that Henry ""respects"" status and trust funds.  I don't know many profoundly gifted, certified-genius people.  none of us does I guess, because they're so rare by statistical definition.  but.  I've known a few and I think I've known a few status-respecting snobs too.  I think Henrys detachment fits better with the PG profile.

kfd5a8,"wow, so opposite. god the first few pages are so dull and drudge. I too love an unreliable narrator, but this one just had the life sucked out of him from the very beginning...

if you want a gripping first few pages, hell, gripping from the very first line with unlikeable characters, read Rebecca.

I'm really starting to wonder what people see in this book (The Secret History) and where they're coming from because atmospheric writing is not enough to keep me engaged for over 500 pages much less five. And with the attention span of today's society, I would venture to say that's probably also the case for most. So I'm deducing there is a deeper underlying reason why people like this book other than the ""atmospheric writing"" that people are purporting is the reason. I read an astute observation somewhere that people who like this book either miss the point entirely, or want to be a part of that lifestyle or both...

which doesn't say much other than: they're basic. no offense or anything. I'm just appalled at how much I find myself thinking: ""wow I literally don't care."" so many times throughout this first chapter. and genuinely wondering what the appeal is other than, other people must be living in such a drudge way as well to find this remotely interesting or fascinating in any way...

really want to give this book a chance because I hate wasting my time and money on a bad book... but, it's starting to be irritating how boring this book is compared to the hype, and I think it makes me a bit melancholy about humanity if I'm being honest.",Minute_Contract_75,2023-12-24T00:54:44Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

But what I can say with certainty is that this book has atmosphere! After The Secret History I read Donna Tartt’s famous novel The Goldfinch, and after doing so, I can say that Donna Tartt is a goddamn genius when it comes to language and creating an atmosphere. She’s compared to Dickens,actually,and if you read The Goldfinch and are familiar with Dickens’s Great Expectations, you will see why.

Like the characters in the book I am a Classics student at university and it was recommended to me for that reason and I read it during my first term at university. It had a huge effect on me and it was the first time I had really *loved* reading a book since I was 15 or 16 and as a result I got into reading again. Before I read *The Secret History* I read maybe one or two books a year, now I read more books per year than I can keep track of. But I love it for more reasons than that. I think it's fair to say that I have never spent more time thinking about a story than I have with this book. Ever since I first read it I've thought about it once or twice a month and even now, years after first reading it, I'm still getting revelations about the plot that didn't occur to me the last time I read it. For instance it only recently occurred to me that >!the reason Henry decided to tell Richard about the murder during the Bacchae was because, by taking Richard into his confidence, he knew that Richard would tell Henry if Bunny ever confessed to Richard about the murder, and therefore Henry would know to act against Bunny!<. That's kind of obvious I know but I'm slow lol. But that's just one example. I have plenty of similar revelations about the book that didn't occur to me until reflecting on it for a long time. I also love the whole theme of disillusionment throughout the novel - not just with the friend group but with everything they represent -- romanticism, aristocracy, classical education, hedonism -- all of it is destroyed in the final act of the book. >!Even Julian, the wise and benevolent mentor goes from an eccentric but loveable authority figure to proving himself to be a coward!<.

My first reading I actually listened to it as an audiobook with no idea what it was going to be about (had a long drive). Donna Tartt narrates and I think that made me fall in love with it even more, hearing each line the way she intended it to be read. The next few times I *physically* read the book (I spaced each reading a few years apart to keep it fresh) and found new things to think about each time. 

Rich character development (totally agree - all unlikeable but still drawn to them), fascinating plot… I love that Richard was the Everyman most of us, as readers, could more or less relate to…who got to peek behind the curtain and bring us into their privileged and bizarre world. I always found it to be a haunting story but with a satisfying conclusion. Sticks with you for a long time after reading.

I mean..I had some classes with 6 students total in 4th year chemistry courses!

Anyway, Donna Tartt's prose was fantastic. I don't encounter this type of writing often, as I don't often focus on reading literary fiction, but Margaret Atwood's writing is someone who's writing is on a similar level and I enjoy just as much. 

I've read two books similar to The Secret History; If We Were Villains (similar on the surface, but the depth of prose and atmosphere didn't quite get 'there' for me), and The Likeness by Tana French (group of PhD lit students living in a big old house in a quiet hamlet; the first 100 pages of police detective prep is a bit of a slog, but once the story gets going it's really good.

n1xehx,"I read *The Secret History* a while ago - too long to speak authoritatively towards the details of your post. But I have a visceral memory of reading it and the novel is honestly one of my absolute favorites. Probably due for a re-read. 

I sometimes flippantly refer to it as ""rose-colored glasses: the book."" I think a lot of the power of the work comes from how none of the secondary characters change through-out the story. Rather what changes is the lens through which the protagonist views them. Initially, everything is dripping with pathos and the group is an olive branch of normalcy and friendship. Then later the cracks start to show and an the idyll is lifted to show broken and terrible people. People who play at exalted language and enlightenment but are unworthy of basic fellowship. 

In guessing at your third and fourth points, though, I think Richard did strongly empathize with Charles even to the point of seeing Camilla as a sister, sexual attraction and all. Perhaps the reason so many men were attracted to her was another element of the parting of the veil - nothing changed but Richard became more aware of it and it is super uncomfortable for both him and the audience by proxy. Richard alternatingly unsure if he wants to be with her or wants things to be as before (perhaps even with a little of a Holden philosophy about him). I unfortunately do not have a strong memory of Judy.",XBreaksYFocusGroup,2021-04-30T17:52:48Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
n1xehx," 

I love The Secret History! One of my favorite books of all time and Donna Tartt is one of my favorite authors. As you said, the characters really stick with you and even though I read it about a year ago now, I still think about it regularly. It has been a while since I read this book however I can try to give you my two cents.

1. I think Henry killed himself for two reasons. In his eyes, his suicide was a poetic death something befitting a tragic hero. He would view himself as a martyr whose sacrifice allowed his friends to live on with their lives without having to face the consequences of their actions.  Secondly, he realized that they were on the verge of being found out and his whole world was collapsing. Henry never fit into the modern world. None of them really did but Henry was always the extreme. He was the best with the ancient languages, was obsessed with the 12 Great Civilizations, was the mastermind behind the Bacchanal but didn’t know about basic medicine or the moon landing. He didn’t fit into this world. Henry was a sociopath for whom the classical world provided a sense of superiority over others and a justification for his terrible actions. I remember there is a scene where Richard is talking to Henry in the garden and Henry says as much. That is why he was so close to Julian and longed for Camilla. They were his links to his idealized Classical World. The only people who were reasonably able to understand him. However, once Julian turned on the group and Henry pieced out that they were all being used as Julian’s personal experiments, something in him broke. He never cared for other people and would have preferred to live in his  Homeric fantasy, no matter what was the human cost.  Once Charles entered the room with the gun, the game was up. If he hadn't killed himself and killed Charles then there would have been an investigation and Camilla would have never forgiven him. They would have almost certainly been found out. If both of them lived, one of them would have broken under pressure. Charles was already raving mad and drunk and out for blood. What was stopping him from snitching on everyone? Either way, his life is over. He would either end up in prison or isolated and betrayed by the only people who understood him. Think about the epilogue. Everyone, including Richard and Camilla, ends up leading fairly benign lives. Francis is forced into a marriage, Richard is a lonely academic. Camilla is caring for her grandma and Charles is in rehab in Texas. Henry could have never assimilated into the world like that. In his mind, Julian and his friends allowed him to live in ""the Classical World of Homer and Plato"". Thus, he made the decision to kill himself. It was a poetic and heroic death in his mind. One that allowed all of his friends to live on with their lives without facing justice for their crimes while he could be a martyr. 
2. I think that is the point. You really see everything from Richard’s point of view. Indeed, any outside observer would probably think the whole crew is just a bunch of pretentious psychopaths. Bunny is a bit annoying, manipulative, and racist. However, nothing that he did justified killing him. However, Richard tells us the story in such a way that we see Bunny as this evil nuisance who must be eliminated. I think that is a testament to Donna Tartt’s writing. She really allows you to get swept away in the minds of the characters until you find yourself almost agreeing with them on taking out Bunny. I agree with you. Henry or Julian are the true villains of the story. However, Richard does not see it that way and he (Tartt ) is such a powerful storyteller that we buy into his view until you step back and look at the whole thing. 

I highly recommend reading the Goldfinch. It is not as good in my opinion as to the Secret History but it still holds up. You are right about the female characters and that is by design I believe. In the Goldfinch, there is a similar situation, and (minor spoiler) there is a moment where you realize the narrator is viewing women through rose-colored glasses. The same thing happens here. Richard views Camilla as this almost mythic seductress who is everything he could possibly want. For me, the Henry and Camilla thing came out of left field and I interpreted it as Richard not seeing the whole story in regards to Camilla. It’s the same thing with Judy. She is just a foil to Camilla. A basic girl with no depth. I do not think that Tartt is writing the female characters in a negative way but writing them as a man like Richard would see them. Either as something a bit beneath him or as a “Pixie Dream Girl”.

n1xehx,"If you haven’t read the goldfinch- definitely do! I liked it better than the secret history

Totally agree on your points. Especially #2, Bunny really was an asshole but as you read the book you almost feel chastised for thinking “he deserved what he got”. You see all the fallout with his funeral and how fucked up his so called friends were to do this to him. No matter how heinous he was as a person his friends had no right to take away his life. 

I also agree on camillas character she is mostly there for the male characters to fight over and suffers as a result. I do wish Donna fleshed her out more but since we’re seeing things from the male characters POV it’s possible we’re seeing her as Richard sees her. I don’t remember all the details but he seemed pretty infatuated with her so we might just be getting the one dimensional manic pixie dream girl character because that’s how he sees her.

ow35ga,"I don’t think she is. I really, really like Tartt — that’s my disclaimer. I *wish* she was being more critical of them, honestly, bc I love her writing style — but one of the reasons I like The Goldfinch so much more than The Secret History personally is the relative lack of completely insufferable characters in The Goldfinch — both books are totally populated by flawed, sometimes super shitty humans, but The Goldfinch’s flawed characters aren’t quite as precious about it & I don’t think you as a reader as supposed to find their flaws admirable or romantically tragic like I think you are in TSH. (Yikes, tangent.) Anyway, I’d love to be proved wrong! 

What makes me think you’re not is largely what little I know about Donna Tartt from that era. She wrote it surrounded by a literary in-crowd, including Bret Easton Ellis, and at a small town prestigious college like the one in the book. Obviously I can’t read her mind, but all of this circumstances make me think the characters are meant to be mysterious and alluring, if a little ridiculous, but not *primarily* ridiculous. If that makes sense. 

I’ll tell you, if you re-read that book as a cynical 40 something like I did, there’s a lot more eye rolling at all the pince-nez wearing & giving a shit about reading stuff in the original Greek than when I was 21.

ow35ga,"Sometimes what is obvious to me is not obvious to everyone else. She is mocking Bunny. New money with audacity that is sacrificed in favor of the elite mind. It is obvious that she views the classical mind as superior to the modern. She even mentions this when Richard is in his second meeting with Julian. Remarking that the modern mind meanders onto tangents while the classical mind is decisive. This discipline of the mind is attained through taking on seriously and communing with the minds of antiquity. Taking the pursuit and study of the ancients seriously not simply dancing around the edges as Bunny has done. Bunny didn’t take it seriously so he was left behind. He was unable to transcend his nature. 

She even has a clear disdain for Protestantism. Charles and Camilla are Catholics and Julian explains why later on when he touches on Dante and Milton. Any serious reader will come to this conclusion on their own long before they ever read this book. Protestantism is the beginning of the end for the classical mind. It is new and audacious. It is rife with bigotry and unawareness of its own hypocrisy. Biting, sexist, concerned with money, deficient in its ability to read its own scriptures. (Dyslexia where you read the words but they don’t make sense to you or are out of order.)

Bunny picks up where Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer left off. If Tom represents the character traits found within emerging capitalism in the old American South. Bunny is what capitalism has grown into in all of its over exaggerated glory. Exaggerated bigotry employed by both Twain and Tartt expertly. While Catholicism was built out of the Roman mind and the classical reverence for esoteric wisdom. She consistently mentions Bunny’s dislike for Catholics and Jews both of which predate Protestantism. It is obvious that this is a very cathartic book for the author. What makes the book hard to put down is that she is unflinching in her judgments. The only way to see her commentary properly is to hold many of these same views yourself. Long before you ever pick up her book. There is only one path and it is The Secret History, Shakespeare, Milton, Plato etc.. You think your politicians and leaders spend their free time watching tv or sitting in church pews? No, they are classically trained minds and they are as committed to preserving the wisdom of antiquity as a late night bacchanal.",,2022-04-23T04:41:23Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

Also the idea of a clandestine class of sophisticates gathering and indulging highbrow sensibilities is appealing to me.   
  
I can kind of see where you're coming from in saying that the characters don't seem to learn anything, but that just makes it all the more believable for me. My enjoyment isn't based on characters learning things.",Jacques_Plantir,2020-04-20T13:45:41Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
g4sesv,"I’d be happy to elaborate further.

In Henry’s death we also find the culmination of a second prevalent, Greek-inspired, motif in the novel, katharsis. Greek tragedy or drama were intended to have a, well, cathartic effect on the audience, allowing them to reach a sort of heightened state of mind. The actual tragedies in the novel have a similar effect. With each death, the characters are lifted further and further out of their fog of blasé, eventually becoming fully aware of the harsh truths of reality.

Then we have the setting. Or rather, the nature of the setting. The fact that our main gang studies classical literature has a huge impact on their world and so the novel. The text is packed with references and allusions to different classical works, with just a few post-classical pieces sprinkled in there. This is combined with an almost blatantly obvious disregard for any of the literature from the immediately preceding decades. By ignoring any sort of influence from writers like Garcia Marquez, Julian Barnes and Günter Grass, Donna Tartt creates this sort of microcosm of temporal limbo, dictated by a period between Homer and Sylvia Plath.

(Wow that went pretentious... But I have a point! Bear with me.)

From the clues we’re given, it’s pretty safe to say the novel takes place in the late 1900s, and these clues give us this delightful contrast between the modern but flighty, and the ancient but ever lasting. These are reminders of the world beyond that of the main characters, and serve the EXACT same function as many of the similes in the Iliad, that remind the reader of the world beyond the battlefield at Troy, the world that the characters have left behind.

One final thing that I probably should’ve mentioned in my earlier comment is the theme of trying and failing to transcend ones own humanity. This is something that occurs again and again in classical literature, and always ends in being smote by the Gods or something. It even happens in the Bible, with the Tower of Babel. The whole purpose of the gang’s ventures into the forest is to try to achieve that Dionysian transcendence, but of course it ends in tragedy. 

So yeah. That’s my overlong take on The Secret History and also why I love it so so much. I hope this can help you enjoy it even more.",ensambarn,2020-04-22T15:42:04Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
s3nczu,"Based on what I know of The Secret History (which I read 100 pages of and DNFed), I'm fairly certain Tartt took heavy inspiration from Nathaniel Hawthorne's *The Marble Faun* (a book I also didn't like).",jefrye,2022-01-14T11:01:08Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
s3nczu,"The Secret History stands out, but a few other books occur to me as being similar enough that you might at least skim the descriptions online, check out some Goodreads posts, etc.

As I read The Secret History--which I did like very much--I couldn't help but notice that the writing seemed to call attention to itself at times. In recent years I've tended to prefer writing that's transparent, and that slips into the background. There are certainly exceptions. Anyway...

If you're looking for stories in which there is a mix of horror, mystery, and some connection to real or imagined ancient mysteries, a few books come to mind. I'll include ""genre"" books. To paraphrase Louis Armstrong: there are just two genres of fiction--good and bad.

**Aegypt** by John Crowley. Ancient mysteries: check. High quality writin': check. Characters who live and breathe in front of you: depends on the reader. Aegypt is the first in a series. Consider reading Crowley's standalone **Little, Big** first.

**The Anubis Gates** or **Declare** by Tim Powers. Powers writes ""secret history"" stories that are interwoven with historical events. His telling doesn't contradict known facts--it re-explains them. Very clever.

**The Library at Mount Char** by Scott Hawkins. Some folks might write this one off as ""just"" genre fiction of some kind. The writing works for the story, but you wouldn't necessarily roll the sentences around on your tongue all afternoon. But if you don't mind an uptick in horror relative to The Secret History, and the arcane cranked up to 11, then you might like this book. I almost left it off the list as unlikely to meet all your criteria, but no worries if it doesn't interest you.

**Blood Meridian** by Cormac McCarthy. Prose? It sure isn't comfort food, but WOW. If you enjoy spare writing, McCarthy's one to check out. Plot? Not even going to try to summarize. Characters? He's fathered more than a few memorable ones. How we can paint so much with so few words is a wonder.

To me, it doesn't matter whether they meet again or how they relate to one another later. Whoever they meet next, whether they stay together or not, the basic story will be the same: brokenness. To be sure, Camilla and Richard could meet again and start a love affair, or we could follow either of them across another story. What that would reveal about their character would be the same as what The Secret History revealed. You can imagine it, you can read it, but to what end?

Also we have a sense of their comings and goings; their interactions that paint them in more vivid colors than narration of from cradle to the grave.

As the plot unravels and their personality differences become more apparent they lose their united front. Near the end of the book a minor character comments that for twins they don't look much alike at all."" This could be another way Donna Tartt is showing how Richard idealizes them and makes them conform to his expectations but by the end he realizes he was wrong as everyone's facade crumbles.

Edit: Ooh, I also continued reading about secret history and apparently mainly people interpret Richard as a closet bisexual/homosexual and as one reviewer said, ""Richard is attracted to Camilla's ""boyishness"" as well.

3l8pwb,"I liked this book. I read it in college and found myself relating to the narrator not because of his situation but of his desire to enter a world where only a few may see.

I've mentioned this in another thread but before reading this book, I had not long ago read Brideshead Revisited which I think shares a great deal of themes and elements with The Secret History. For example; issues regarding the odd nature of catholicism. Bunny died because of many things: one being his poor taste in attacks with which one of the twins (i think) countered with ""protestants are social climbers"" -- which was a description of Charles Ryder's situation when he befriended Sebastian Flyte. He was mooching off of Sebastian. In the same vein, you could see that it reflects the same deal of shock for both Richard and Charles Ryder when they entered into this odd world of the rich and the obscure.

The narrators describe their, according to Charles, profane memories in a very nostalgic and nauseatingly sweet manner. Funny enough, Waugh has since written a form of apology and self deprecating introduction for his book describing his disgust of nostalgia and the glorification of decadence (which is funny because Richard does the same at the start for his stay in college and for the murder).

Both books have overtones of religious nature to it in my opinion. The one being about the desire for a paganistic lifestyle and the other, well, an actual practice of free spirit and roaming. Both of which doesnt reflect the catholic lifestyle. Both end under the operation of a divine force, which was what Waugh said about Brideshead. Surprisingly enough, the sinners are all punished and everything goes down the drain for all of them. Both books. If by divine operation, Waugh meant strict justice and karma then I agree. All the false glamour of money and materialism fell down.

In Brideshead, a most interesting thing that always crops up in conversations about it is the ambiguous nature of Sebastian and Charles' relationship, which I could also say about Richard and Charles Macaulay (hey remember when he forgets everytime he has sex with Francis?). Both Richard Papen and Charles Ryder have ambiguous relationships with not so ambiguously bisexual alcoholic guys who both look so like their respective sisters, sisters who happen to also have a weird relationship with said alcoholic brothers, and sisters who happen to have had both an unfaithful relationship and ends up somewhat attracted to the narrators of their respective stories. We've come full circle.

Both books can portray a mood so accurately, too. I could feel the agony and suffering seething from the pages after the death of bunny and I remember thinking ""when is this all going to end?"" Yet i loved reading every page.

Definitely liked The Goldfinch more, I was sucked into that one entirely-- holed up in my room without sleep until I finished it. I didn't have trouble taking long breaks from the Secret History though. 

Not sure how I felt about it. I was underwhelmed by the reliance on class to differentiate between Richard and the others, and felt his infatuation with Camilla was unfounded, though I like /u/internetonsetadd 's definition of her as ""nymph-like,"" a quality I hadn't previously considered. However, as Camilla was one of the few female characters (other than the annoying flatmate- Judy?), I was irritated with her lack of agency. I thought the feminine voice was missing from the story. 

I found Julian to be a pompous ass the entire story, and didn't relate to the connection every character felt with him. 

I suppose overall, I felt disconnected from all the characters- there wasn't anyone I felt strongly similar to or that I found myself rooting for. However, the plot kept me engaged and driven.

3gi39r,"I finished The Secret History last month after letting it collect dust on my shelf for almost ten years.  I loved it, and I was kicking myself for not picking it up sooner.  

I won't pretend to have even a basic knowledge of Greek mythology, but I think the characters, their motivations and actions can all be understood to exist within an [Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian).  

Julian props up an Apollonian framework (self-satisfied reason and logic) within which his select group of mostly privileged, arrogant students are able to establish a scholarly, elitist identity, and guiltlessly rationalize their egoistic actions.

Richard yearns to escape his family/class background, and throughout much of the book he seeks to gain acceptance inside Julian's inner sanctum, buying into the facade, helping the group struggle against Dionysian forces (Bunny, and later Charles), always assuming that if he applies reason and logic to unraveling the group's secrets, there will be something reasonable and logical to discover, especially with regard to Henry's role as philosopher-mastermind.  

This, of course, isn't the case.  The group, its secrets and the emotional state of its members are heavily stressed by actual applications of logic, namely law enforcement.  By the end, it's revealed that early on Henry was seduced by Dionysian impulses, and that much of the behavior Richard assumed to be carefully plotted and rational was in fact chaotic and emotional.  And Julian's Apollonian framework just kind of evaporates.

Anyway, that's my cursory take.  I'd be interested to know what people think of Camilla and her role.  She struck me as being very nymph-like, but I'm not sure what mythological significance that has to how she related to and influenced the other characters.  I also feel like there might be some overall commentary on Generation X, but I don't quite have words for it.",internetonsetadd,2015-08-10T22:21:14Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

Tartt was likely inspired by the classics you named and more but she didn't use them in a particularly overt way in this novel; that's just part of a liberal arts education. *The Secret History* has its own unique combination of elements which make it a modern classic.",nickelundertone,2022-03-30T21:31:52Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

8jrzon,"The Secret History is my favourite Tartt book!
I love how it’s a murder mystery which tells you who dies and who kills them on the first page, yet can still be incredibly compelling. Grew to love all the characters, even when I hated them. The protagonist is a bit vacant though. 

I am pretty certain it was Henry who killed the farmer, but cannot fully remember. At least I think it works best if the group did go fully savage. The entire book is about faking til you make it, the protagonist pretends to be like the Classics group and so fits in, while the Classics group pretend to be a cult until they genuinely become one. 


Bunny was an arse but probably the most human character, I found him very interesting and even more so with the knowledge of what would happen to him. The ending also deserves praise, it’s pretty abstract but works so well to show that after everything that happens - all the pretentiousness and lies - maybe, just maybe, the world they wanted to live in came true.


The Goldfinch also is great, very Dickensian while being contemporary America, if a little too long. The Secret Friend is a solid book, very detailed and thematically juicy, but not as exciting or memorable as the others.

8jrzon,"I doubt that Richard had a relationship with Julian. I always saw it as more of a mentorship kind of thing, maybe somewhat familial even. I like how this made Julian bailing on the Greek class towards the end so powerful. What a hypocrite.

Regarding Bunny, he was so obnoxious it was hilariously funny. But you know, that never really warrants murder... 

Man, I loved The Secret History. Though I got sucked into the pretentious literary part of Tumblr and that took a lot of the fun out of it... I mean, I did start out adoring the pretentiousness and the aesthetic, but at some point I realized that it was *so* white and eurocentric. However, during my last reread, I *finally* noticed that it was very likely satire and the book blew me away a second time. Read it with this lens on and it will definitely enrich your reading experience.

I love Donna Tartt full stop. You might enjoy The Goldfinch more since it has pretty similar themes. I never got around to finishing The Little Friend because I lost my copy, but I remember being similarly fascinated. The Goldfinch, meanwhile, topped the Secret History for me.

1krxqd,"I've read The Secret History a few times, and the second half is definitely slower than the first. I think it's because the climax of the novel really, is Bunny's death, and because you know this is going to happen you want to know how and why, so you have this anticipation and build up to it, whereas the second half is exploring the consequences for each of the other characters.

That being said, for me second half isn't any less enjoyable, even though it slows down I think it's interesting how each character deals with his/her actions in a different way. They all begin to crack at different points, and I think it's fascinating reading to see how far they are going to fall, and how much they change. I also think it's interesting how of all of them, it seems to affect Richard the least, it was only on a re-read that I realised he really isn't the most likeable fellow, he's not even a particularly good person, but because we only have his point of view, his flaws aren't as obvious to the reader as the other's are.

I think the only part where it drags is when they are staying with Bunny's family, that whole section could have been condensed a little. I really love it how Henry's character is reminiscent of a Greek tragedy, it's such a fitting ending to a great story. I do think it's worth a re-read, there are little things you'll notice that you missed the first time which I think will add to your enjoyment of the novel.",FatPinkMast,2013-08-21T04:55:29Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
1krxqd,"I did.

Back in the fall of 1990 I started grad school and I didn't have a TV. I only listened to the radio. But I decided to get one magazine to keep me in the loop about social and entertainment issues. That magazine was *Vanity Fair*. Boy was I happy. I got to see Demi Moore painted! But they also had really good reviews of books and talks with authors. One such review was Donna Tartt's *The Secret History*. They even ran a small part of the book in the issue. I was so enthralled. It was part of the beginning of the book and I really enjoyed it. I had just graduated college in 1990 and was still in school so I was going through a sort of *Heathers/Big Chill/Less Than Zero* phase. I wanted to read it so bad. But I never did. My school work picked up and then I ended up forgetting about it until about 5 years ago. I went and got it from my library and really was looking forward to enjoying this book now.

I really enjoyed the first part. I went to school in Amherst MA which is near VT and Bennington College (which is what this whole thing is modeled on.) I loved being taken back too that time in the 80s. Then things started to change for me in the book. The part that really made me go '*ok just get through this and it will get better*' was the part about winter session and the elements (I don't want to give out spoilers.) then it just got kind of hohum. 

I felt kind of jipped. I wanted to find the article in *Vanity Fair* and tell the author how I felt. But since I took so long to read it I just moved on.  It was a really good premise and a good first part. I just believe she could not keep it moving and me happy. It was her first book so I just let it go.

Did you know she recieved $450,000 in advance for the book, and it was her first novel!

You know I wish I could go to the library and look through old *Vanity Fairs*. I bet there were more good books out there that I missed.

152m624,"There's a lot of description in The Secret History, and it is already being considered a modern classic, so (while less social media use would probably be good for a lot of us) I don't think it's really your attention span.

On here people often encourage dropping anything with any literary value the second you're not enjoying it (really because they aren't wiling to read anything like that, fullstop)...but you're not actually obligated to enjoy every second. Think about what else you're getting out of it, learn to appreciate by learning more about how the writing works (simply reading helps develop the ability to analyse a text, but it is also a skill to actively learn, look into close reading), just accept being ambivalent sometimes or that it doesn't matter if you end up remembering a section as 'the boring bit'. If you understand the writing well enough, you can think about why it didn't work as well, even (like the parliment scenes in Phineas Finn. The problem is it's too vague, possibly because Trollope, with his strong interest in real politics, didn't know how to handle a purely fictional government. It doesn't sufficiently depict either the detail of a real political issue or develop the characters of many of the fictional politicians. He improved on it later by focusing more on the characterisation).

Either way it's not the choice some will want to make it between reading good writing or only reading for mindless entertainment.

17gkrdm,"I agree that We Were Villains has pretty one dimensional characters, but I wouldn't say it's predictable IMO. But The Secret History is one of the best books I've ever read, and the prose is stellar, so I didn't expect If We Were Villains to come close.

You're comparing a popcorn book to literary fiction. If We Were Villains is the younger, dumber cousin.

The Likeness by Tana French proves to be better written, ans in the same vein, but again TSH is just unmatched. I'd recommend you pick up some backlist Margaret Atwood to scratch that itch. Surfacing was *amazing* and packs so much to examine in a neat 250 pages.

17gkrdm,"AMEN. The only book I’ve DNF-ed twice, and I will battle my way through just about anything.

I was waiting in line for free tickets to Shakespeare in the Park back in 2017 and they were giving away copies. I took one, attempted to read it, thought it was trash, and put it on the bottom of my bookshelf. 

This year I saw it popping up all over BookTok, and not just with the Colleen Hoover and Taylor Jenkins Reid crowd. I recently read The Secret History and found it pretty middle of the road: bloated in the first half, but fairly compelling as the plot began to pick up. My sister read If We Were Villains, and gave it five stars, so when I was looking to pad my GoodReads reading challenge a bit, I gave it another shot. Oi. 

The prose is awful. It reads like the worst fan fiction. The characters aren’t even wooden, they’re more like wet cardboard. The depiction of a conservatory theatre program is vague and poorly drawn, and the Shakespeare quotes had me groaning every other line. Rio didn’t even attempt to write human characters. No one would behave as they do, they wouldn’t speak as they do, etc. Awful awful awful excuse for a novel, not worth finishing. I could go on and on and on.

17gkrdm,"Coincidentally this is the book that I’m currently reading and plan to finish tonight, so I’m going to avoid reading the full post until after in order to avoid spoilers, but to respond to the headline:

I read The Secret History earlier this month, which is very similar to If We Were Villains, and I have to say I’m enjoying Villains SO much more. 

I do have some issues with it (Richard seemed to go from friendly to downright abusive in the matter of pages with very little explanation as to why beyond being unhappy with the casting, and the characters constantly dropping Shakespeare quotes in the middle of normal conversations seems very unrealistic). Buy beyond that, I think the pacing is pretty good, and the time jumps keep me interested in hearing Oliver’s version of events, even though it’s clear he may be an unreliable narrator. 

That said, my feelings on the book may be skewed because I’m reading it nearly back-to-back with The Secret History and it’s impossible NOT to compare the two, but overall I’m enjoying If We Were Villains…curious to see if my opinion changes once I reach the final two acts in the book.

EDIT: I finished If We We’re Villains 20 minutes ago and have decided that I strongly prefer it over The Secret History.

17gkrdm,I agree with you. I read „The secret history“ first and I really struggled to finish „If we were villains“. The characters were so hollow and the whole time I felt like the author copied from TSH.,Pleasant-Bicycle7736,2023-10-26T11:46:01Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery
17gkrdm,"I definitely do not agree! (part 1)

\-TSH and IFWV are completely different books, which have been likened mostly for marketing reasons. TSH is a satirical book about obsession and about using knwoledge as a way of creating harsher class divisions, it's really more about *class* . IFWV is a tragedy in the teather sense, which means that from the beginning you know what happens but the outcomes can't be changed, and it's about *identity*.

In TSH the characters want to kill Bunny for relatively stupid reasons, they convince themselves it's necessary, they want to do it, and nobody pays for it because they're rich priviledges white kids - the real twist of the book would have been them going to jail. Their lives fall apart because they *make* them fall apart, not especially because they feel guilty about killing Bunny- they don't give a damn, they're too self-centered for that. In IFWV James did not want to kill Richard, none of them wanted to see him dead, even though he's not only extremely unlikable but straight up violent and dangerous. The murder is an  accident, one of them ends up paying for it and everyone's lives crumble, because of this awful thing that happened.

As for the setting yes,it's the same. But like, The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye are both set in New Jork, doesn't mean anything.

\- Saying Shakespeare should be listed as co-author just because of the quotes and scenes they enact is like saying that Homer should be listed as co-author for The Song of Achilles. Be for real, just because they're actig out scenes doesn't mean that the *meaning* and *context* of the scenes is the same. The interesting thing about this book is actually to see how the personal lives of the actors bleed into the Shakespearian scenes they are portraying. The author didn't add them to show you she knows her Shakespear any more than Madeline Miller followed the story of the Iliad in TSOA to show you she knows Homer. Also yeah, the characters quote Shakespeare in every other sentence because they're annoying obsessed theater kids! They live and breathe Shakespeare, their school is slightly cultu-ish about it too, and I don't know if you've ever hung out with theater kids but I tell you, if a musical theater cast irl went through what these characters did, they would 100% be *singing* lines from Hamilton and Les Mis. It's just slightly amped up for literary purposes. And right at the beginning, when the MC is talking to the the cop we realize that everyone outside of their context thinks that what they do is cringe too. And to be fair, *in the Secret History people talk in Ancient Greek that's cringe as Hell* (not to mention unlikely? but I won't get into that) and icon queen boss bitch Judy Poovey makes it clear.

\-The book isn't male gazey, you're just experiencing the POV of the *male MC*, who not only is attracted to Meredith but also spends most of the book trying to convince himself that yeah no he's totally attracted only to Meredith because she's a female woman with breasts and soft lips and totally not attracted to his male roommate. We know she's not only that, and part of her conflict in the story is the fact that everyone seems to see her that way, and she herself had taken the habit of presenting herself as the femme fatale because that's the role that she has been assigned. But I'll come back to that. Also by these standards TSH should be male gazey too - shall we talk about how Richard sees Camilla? Talk about one dimentional. It's part of having a first person narrator, we see characters the way the narrator does.

\-IFWV is a tragedy, and there are no big revelations in tragedies. That's not what tragedies are for: tragedies are stories that begin when characters are relatively happy and then it ends in pain and suffering for all. What you're probably thinking about are dramas, aka stories when the characters are not so happy in the beginning, they encounter obstacles and suffering throughout the story, but eventually it all ends well. Most Ancient Greek plays are tragedies, same goes for Shakespeare. So what's the point of tragedies, then? To quote Hadestown (and be the annoying theater kid): *""To know how it ends/And still begin to sing it again/As if it might turn out this time"".* Which is why we still keep retelling Greek Myths over and over again. ML Rio  did the same with a Shakespearean play and not with a Greek myth. The tragedy of this book (which is what happens in every tragedy anyway) is that if the characters had all made different choices, if they had communicated better, then none of that would have happened. You're supposed to know that the two male leads have romantic feelings for one another, because part of the tragedy is you yelling at the book ""you dumb idiots why don't you just talk, so none of this would happen?"".

Also we should stop yelling ""queerbaiting!"" each time stories don't specifically state charaters' sexual orientations and don't explore same sex relationships in a physical way - especially when their inability to cope with their feelings for one another is what causes their downfall. Good representation isn't just representation à la Heartstopper, *this* is also pretty good representation. God knows if any queer person I know hasn't had an ambiguous relationship with a close friend while they were figuring themselves out. And for that matter, TSH does the same with Richard and what's his name, the tall twink, Francis.",Avocado-Toast9,2023-10-27T10:18:03Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

I can easily admit that 'The Secret History' is overall a better book, I just couldn't stand how philosophical it tried to be.

I sped through the book up until the Vegas section. Once I made it to Vegas, I found myself particularly unmotivated to read. Tartt’s descriptions of excessive drinking made me feel literally sick to my stomach (which, one could say, is a compliment to her writing). 

I’ve found a common criticism of Goldfinch to be Theo’s lack of deliberate action: life happens to him rather than he creating a life for himself. I loved this aspect of Theo's character. To me, it made him seem much more human. I felt his character was well-developed. Boris and Mrs. Barbour were beautifully developed as well. And I don't know if I have loved a character as much as I loved Hobie.

I read the final 200 pages in one sitting. Generally, I think the events in the novel took place as the reader hoped they would. This left me satisfied but slightly unmoved? I am curious if anyone else experienced this.

gk6vlf,"I'm writing this 16 days after this post was made but figure I'll contribute anyway.

I've come to love this book. I listened to the audiobook and it was treacherous. It was like 35 hours long and Tartt's writing is so detailed and sometimes meandering. I almost dropped it halfway through because there were so many parts where the most mundane things were described in the most detailed way. I remember it was a part where the characters were shopping for plateware or something and I just couldn't get through it. I'm glad I did, I think the characters are really thought out and complex, probably more so than any book I've ever read. For me, the magic of Tartt's writing is what is not explicitly said on the page but rather implied in such nuance. You can grasp things about the characters, their pasts, and what has happened to them during the time jumps without explicitly telling you about it. And Tartt perfected that in the Secret History. Some people don't like the direction she took the book in the last 3rd but I really enjoyed the utter despair and all the twists and turns. This book and The Secret History are interesting in that the main characters are pretty similar and kinda bland, but the supporting characters are so colorful and interesting.

The movie adaptation is good if you're not looking at it as the end all be all adaptation because it doesn't do the book justice at all. However, the film is beautifully shot by the master Roger Deakins and it is fun to see some of the locations and characters brought to life in certain scenes.

She's a ""literary"" writer, so I don't think we'll ever see Donna Tartt become a household name amongst the general public, but people who know anything about modern literature are well aware of her.",hobbitzswift,2022-09-25T23:55:58Z,The Secret History,COMMENT,Mystery

9jk8ef,"The Goldfinch is probably my favourite book of all time. It's the only contemporary novel I've read that gave me the same feeling as Dickens, Tolstoy etc. did when I was younger: relishing in language, beauty, taking its time. I loved living with Theo, if you know what I mean. 

It's very in vogue now to write short, minimalist sentences, and imply everything, and have a bunch of soulless clever characters, but I get tired of that so quickly. The Goldfinch was as rich and satisfying as a chocolate cake.


And it's funny -- I always thought the Secret History was a more compelling read, a page-turner, and that the Goldfinch was more complicatedly good. It was a more literary novel, I think, which is why I wish they weren't making a damn movie out of it. The Secret History, on the other hand, would make an excellent film, but alas.


Anyway, just blabbering because Tartt is, to me at least, the greatest living author we have. Her writing is magical. I can't count how many people I've recommended her to.

I haven't read The Little Friend, but in both The Goldfinch and The Secret History, Tartt's main characters are aimless and lack agency. The entire plot of both books is a character with no particular gifts, direction, or even moral value drifting along in the wake of more active characters. Boris is absolutely a brilliant character, because he is 100% of the action of the book. The prose is beautiful. But the plot is just so lacking, and the character is a hollow shell.

I agree with you that the plot is ... well, not hardly there.  it's more like a wire that's just there for her to string her descriptive baubles on.  and it had holes that really *annoyed* me.  an underage kid is at ground zero of a terrorist bomb, is *known* to have been there, and he just dusts himself off and is allowed to just saunter home with a masterpiece under one arm? and then proceed through the next several months with practically no formal intervention or followup?  bullshit.  even in whatever era she set this book in, just really bs.  but ""we"" need Theo to be tragic and nihilist for many hundreds of pages, so bs it is.  

I did really like the atmosphere and suppressed desolation of the middle part.  that was really finely observed.  makes the previous x-hundred pages all the more irritating. 

 Boris is adorable, but he's a caricature.  

Hobie ... well, I typed Hagred at first, so that's who I think he's a blatant ripoff of.

It is written as well as the Secret History, but I like the characters more: what an interesting character is Harriet, the almost-teenage weirdo tomboy growing up in snake-infested Mississippi! And Danny's family... And everybody else... Such a gallery of interesting people! For me, Donna Tartt could just talk about their daily life without anything substantial happening, and I just would go on and on and on listening to her for thousands and thousands of pages without ever getting bored.

The characters are well-defined, psychologically realistic. I am sorry, but in all honestly they interest me much more than rich college kids studying Greek. How would these characters act given their history, their environment, their circumstances? I want to see, I want to know what's gonna happen. Here lies the interest of the book.

I have always had a weak spot for stories that often feel like kid adventure books, mixed up with more serious, scary, adult things, and here there is plenty.

9llowq,"What an empathetic reply, thank you for that. Also, for going into depth on the background. Yes, I have read the foreword, too & found it interesting that he would have wanted for the book to be released in 5 steps (financial reason).  

I’m a little bit over page 150 and wonder if it would have made a difference had it been released eg one part per year. Would readers have stayed loyal over the time & have awaited the next part in full anticipation?  
Hardcore fans, maybe. I believe, Murakami did so with his 1Q84.  

How you describe the various topics it touches, art and life etc. I like that. Very often, it’s the form how these are presented, and I’m not talking about language here. I admit that books like The Secret History, Confessions, Perfect Days, .. are easier to read in the sense of: the author has done all the work for you, prepared a framework and tada! a nicely-structured outcome, or message for the reader.  

Two books,  
where it was the language which had me utterly, fascinated were Andrés Barba’s “Such Small Hands” (it’s excellent, absolutely recommended) and the very modern and Zeitgeist novel “The Pisces” by Melissa Broder (also, great - but definitely, for female audience). In both cases, I couldn’t care less about how long the story would continue, it was the language as such, which worked so well with me.  

I will continue reading the Bolaño because all the comments to this post give me the impression that this book, is worth spending the time with. It requires a different openness, though. You can’t approach it as you would the average modern novel.

10. The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey
This book changed how I look at money.  There's no big secrets or magic formula, just simple, common sense information.

09. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky
This was like a page ripped out of my early high school years.  At times the book's diary entries mirror the journal I kept.

08. The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell
Like all of Gladwell's books, this one pulls back the curtain on life to see that most times there isn't as much luck involved as assumed.

07. The Road by Cormac McCarthy
This is every father's anxiety filled nightmare.  The fact that someone wrote it all down assures me that I'm not the only one worrying.

06. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
Despite the high school English teachers of the country (myself included) forcing this book down the throats of young readers nation-wide, this is a great story and one of the few ""classics"" worthy of all the praise.

05. Superstud by Paul Feig
This is one of the few books that I have found to be laugh out loud funny, but that's probably because it was honest and embarrassing.  Few people would ever have the courage to admit to the what Feig did, although many of them are guilty of some of the exact same things.

04. I Love You, Beth Cooper by Larry Doyle
When you were an awkward teenager, reading about the mishaps of a follow brethren is funny because it's true.

03. Columbine by Dave Cullen
This will be the next book I write on so for now I'll just say, most of what we thought we knew was wrong.

02. The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson
If only all history books were written like this, but then again not all historical events are this interesting.
