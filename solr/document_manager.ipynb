It's been a trend I've noticed that people, especially starting on Twitter, are going out of there way to find unreasonable ways to vilify Rowling and everything she does, even going so far as to go retroactively and repainting and decontextualizing  things to paint her as ______ whatever the agenda is. First, it was calling her out for making Dumbledore gay after the books came out (wrong; he was always gay, and it was alluded to in the books and the filmmakers knew it as well but wasn't a major plot point in the books because it didn't matter to Harry's story), expanding on stuff on Pottermore, supporting Johnny Depp (we all know now that Heard was the abudedr and Rowling was right to support Depp at the time) etc, and now this (apart from calling her anti-Semitic because she used goblins in her books in the way traditional eastern European folklore shows them).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Indian, Padma and Parvati Patil were literally some of the only South Asian characters I'd read in any books (apart from Tolkien making the eastern men evil henchmen of Sauron riding elephants), and it was good to see them being fully realised characters with personalities and purposes in the narrative instead of being caricatures like they are on say The Big Bang Theory (Rajesh Ramayan Kuthrapalli, a north Indian fellow with a south Indian last name who has a lakhpathi father who's an itinerant gynaecologist, doesn't speak Hindi and can't even tell the difference between a random Bollywood film and one with Aishwarya Rai, is a caricature).  And most of the POC characters in the Potter series are like that, actual representations with engaging personalities and lives. Sure, some of the named seem generic but considering the main character is Harry Potter, and the books were intended for growing children they're still better than ninety percent of mainstream books where it's all about certain races only. And these people making a hullabaloo on Twitter completely ignore the characters themselves and try to make her look evil incarnate by associating negative connotations to names without actually taking anything else she's written into consideration.
