18szjqh_1,18szjqh,"One thing I think is interesting about the book, completely divorced from politics is how interesting the concept of the Mobile Infantry and Federation military is today and is even novel after decades of science fiction being built on it.  It’s notable for popularizing power armored super soldiers as a trope but I also think it’s a very interesting reflection of the pentomic period of military thinking, where people genuinely thought nukes would be a commonplace tactical occurrence in regular warfare.  If you look into the history, for a brief period in the 50’s people genuinely thought that people would just start hucking nukes around battlefields and the only way a conventional army could survive was by being very mobile and wearing hazard gear at all times.  The MI is a tiny force, and power suits allow troops to be spread out and travel over long distances to fight effectively on a battlefield that could be nuked at any moment.  It was a clear reflection on the way people thought that warfare was heading and despite knowing better now it’s a very interesting concept.  Heinlein sets out to create a conventional military force that could survive getting nuked constantly and I think mostly succeeds.   A lot of detail is skipped because the narrator assumes a level of familiarity by the reader that we don’t have because we’re not actually living in Starship troopers but the base concept is still interesting.",EagleBeaverMan,2023-12-28T19:52:27Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,1
18szjqh_2,18szjqh,">When I say the book consists of nothing but philosophy, I mean that. T

That is the point of the novel. Heinlein loved to take familiar economical, political and cultural structures and use scifi to place them in unfamiliar contexts to see how people change their minds about them.

In Starship Troopers, he poses the question ""what if society was run exclusively by the people who are invested in protecting that society?"". Teachers, nurses, doctors etc. He chooses soldiers because nobody puts more on the line for society than a soldier.

And he creates a setting where that civic choice makes sense. In ST, humanity is just one of many intelligent species in the galaxy. And they're all in competition for the scarcest of resources, habitable planets. He makes the point that in this galaxy, humanity had the choice of either expanding what they have and defending it, or having it taken away from them with extinction as a result.

And he explores that initial question with many scenarios. Does a criminal have the right to burden society with the consequences of his actions? Does someone who refuses to be personally responsible for society have the right to have a say in its running? Would humanity come together in a scenario where the alternative is getting wiped out by rival species?

In ST, it results in an interplanetary humanity that is internally peaceful. Even the people who don't obtain the right to franchise are well cared for. Criminals are dealt with harshly but not unfairly, they simply aren't granted the right to burden society with their extended care and rehabilitation.

But the biggest twist of the novel is that in the bug wars, it's humanity, not the bugs that were the aggressors. The competition between species had made us that aggressive towards outsiders.",TheBluestBerries,2023-12-28T17:57:16Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,2
18szjqh_3,18szjqh,">I am sure there are many out there like me who are more familiar with the Paul Verhoeven film adaptation from the late 90's. That adaptation treats its source material as a satire, lampooning many pro-military sentiments in what is clearly a huge critique of fanaticism and military aggression while still showcasing fun action scenes. Before reading the book, I was expecting something similar, only with the main themes being presented as more earnest. What I did not expect was scene after scene of Heinlein's obvious stand-in characters explaining his philosophy.

The film was originally written as a separate story, unrelated to the Starship Troopers novel. Then during development and pitching of the script it was tied to the rights for the novel, and tweaked to fit. Then when Verhoeven got involved, he moved the film further from the book again, and he put the focus more on the satire aspect.",NoNudeNormal,2023-12-28T18:57:45Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,3

Starship Troopers isn't even the worst offender (stuff does, at least, actually *happen* in Starship Troopers, and characters progress and change somewhat as time goes on).

Honestly I think this is where people go wrong.

The last few years it feels like a lot of young authors *can't* write about a position they don't themselves believe in.

As a result, some younger readers seem to struggle with the idea that an author might write a story counter to their own beliefs.

But a lot of old scifi was basically 3 philosophers in a trenchcoat. Many authors of the time would write stories to explore a philosophical position, not to express the authors core beliefs.

Like how Vernor Vinge wrote both ""The Ungoverned"" and at almost the same time ""Conquest by Default"" despite the two stories taking totally opposite positions.

Heinlein explored many ideas about governance and society across many of his stories. Starship troopers was more an exploration of what an old fascist society might look like and what it might look like to be raised in such a society - for example with dissent being discouraged by threats of being classified as disloyal.

Or how they're eternally at war and nobody questions why they *need* to be at war when apparently other species can ally with the other side.",WTFwhatthehell,2023-12-29T00:12:45Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,5

If anything, it helps me understand where people who disagree with me are coming from. Some of Heinlein's philosophy seems regressive from our perspective, but on some issues he was amazingly progressive for his time.

I remember when I read Starship Troopers. I had just gotten my bachelor's degree in Philosophy and was sick to death of thick, heady, inscrutable academic mumbo-jumbo.

18szjqh_8,18szjqh,"First, completely disregard the movie, Verhoeven used a few names and changed literally everything else.

Second, consider the author, his life experiences, the time he wrote the book, and how his point of view comes across in his other works. Heinlein as an author loved to challenge readers with radical societal changes. He used science fiction as the impetus for change so that readers could think more critically about the change itself.

Starship Troopers explores a future where our species has learned it's lesson about infighting. The bloody world wars are brushed off as happening in the distant past, and now most people live in harmony because the monopoly on violence is controlled by people who have *used* violence, and seen the results firsthand. Who would order their sons or their neighbors sons to fight and die over something as trivial as national borders after seeing comrades torn apart by explosives? Violence must be a last resort, and only people who have proven they've learned this lesson are allowed to vote at all.

The conflict with the bugs, and Johnny Rico's experience in war, all serves to create a story that most people can follow. It's a framework for philosophy, letting the reader learn for themselves how horrible war is even when fully justified. Johnny sees his friends fall, and he hears after the fact about his friends dying helplessly in space, and he *learns*, not just in his mind but in his soul, that there is no such thing as glory. The MI fight because a fight needs to be fought, and they can trust that the fight is just because *everyone* in the military, from top to bottom, is a soldier. The Sky Marshall must have commanded an infantry regiment (which means go through boot as an officer, then climb up from 3rd Lieutenant) and a capital ship.

I honestly can't even remember the course of Starship Trooper's plot. I only remember the first chapter because 'oh there are other aliens in this book and Dizzy isn't a girl and he dies and isn't important at all' and some of the lines.

The overall philosophy of the book is pretty disturbing but damn does it have some banger lines.

>Anyone who clings to the historically untrue and thoroughly immoral doctrine that violence never settles anything I would advise to conjure up the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler could referee and the jury might well be the Dodo, the Great Auk, and the Passenger Pigeon.

Hilarious imagery. A shame Heinlein would frequently go from funny 'I get that' bits to more disturbing 'you're not wrong but I kind of concerned this is how you want to emphasize things.' 

But some of it really is just great lines;

>Moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level.

That Heinlein couldn't just let sit or explore. He had to go somewhere freaking weird and kind of fascistic with it, if he went anywhere with them at all. 

Stranger in a Strange Land is probably a greater and deeper exploration of Heinlein's attitudes but it was also written later in his life after he'd become a weird combo of a conservative libertarian authoritarian hippie and is a very different kind of book than Starship Troopers.",Lord0fHats,2023-12-28T18:02:18Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,16

Fascism is usually defined by, in no particular order:

1: Strongman leadership

2: Constant war or militaristic posturing against external forces

3: Emphasis on the importance of everyone having a role to play in the state, traditionally using the metaphor of ""corporate"" (in the Latin sense of a body, like the word ""corpus"", not necessarily like a business entity) with the emphasis that people in the state should be working to further the goals in the state, as if they're the limbs of a greater body

Except there is no actual fascism in the book. It is nowhere to be seen. Fascism is not some mysterious thing. Nor is it descriptor for whatever politics we don't like or consider 'right wing'. It existed concretely in explicitly fascist statecraft and in explicit political philosophy. And you don't have to dig deeply into fascism to begin to show the contradictions with the book.

>""Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State"" - Benito Mussolini 

Imagine getting Hitler and Mussolini into a room and telling them your idea for a new Fascism. Imagine telling them with a straight face that your Fascism is going to have a civilian, multi party government. That it would have a Federal structure subject to law and that the states would have a great deal of freedom from the central government. That rights will be protected by a constitution. Oh and that any citizen would be able to vote in free and fair elections. That Free Speech would be guaranteed.  That the general population would have no interest in the 'volkish' national community that transcends and supersedes individuality. That militarism and jingoism will be discouraged. And that the military would be strictly limited to a tiny volunteer force. 

Do you think they would give you time of day? Or do you think they would consider you rather a decadent liberal? Do you think that your protests that the franchise is limited to those who do community service, and that there is a bit of flogging in the justice system *change their minds on that*?

If Heinlein believed that the Federation in Starship Troopers was Fascist then he was a fool. I don't believe he is a fool though. I think the obvious way of interpreting Starship Troopers is as a cold war allegory, with a specific focus on the issue of the draft vs a volunteer military.

Starship troopers' government was a limited democracy, with the primary principle being that without service and service that was by nature a personal sacrifice, you could have no franchise. It was a society that had suffered from unfettered democracy, where the unlimited franchise of all people led to a series of devastating wars, and then had been rebuilt by war veterans who had been sent to fight by people who had no skin in the game. So when they seized power, they used ""benevolent"" authoritarianism to ensure that all people who wield government power had an intimate understanding of the negative repercussions of it. 

This is contrasted by ""The moon is a harsh mistress"" which is straight up almost anarchist level of libertarianism, where the lunar society is run completely by private interests, where marriage, industry and even public works are independent of the overbearing earth government who only seeks to suck the moon (which started as a penal colony) dry of the products of these people labor.

We literally do all of these things today, they're just called different things so you don't recognize them.

What the book refers to as 'civilian' we'd refer to as a green card holder or permanent resident. 

The starship troopers government is simply one where everyone is a permanent resident at birth, and nobody is born with birthright citizenship, so anyone seeking citizenship must go through a naturalization process. 

Governments can achieve the things you describe with or without universal franchise. Some of the most corrupt nations on the planet are ones where everyone ostensibly has the right to vote.

The entire point of the selection process is to reduce the impact of those who are selfish. You put yourself through great stress and peril all so you can vote, and voting is the only thing you got. So the type of people who think they deserve something beyond voting for citizenship would be terribly uninclined to gain citizenship in the first place since they get nothing for it except the right to vote.

By that metric the Allies in WW2 were fascists. In any case the Federation does not privilege security above everything else.

Why would they have bothered with all the liberal rights and freedoms they have, and instead just gone full totalitarian?

18szjqh_58,18szjqh,">Feel free to point out in the book where that's said, cause there's quite a few quotes in there where the characters all point out that it's the military.

There are a few, but one that stands out is when they go up to enlist in Federal Service (page 31):
  
> “So why don’t you boys go home, go to college, and then go be chemists or insurance brokers or whatever? A term of service isn’t a kiddie camp; it’s either real military service, rough and dangerous even in peacetime . . . **or a most unreasonable facsimile thereof.** Not a vacation. Not a romantic adventure. Well?”
  

Emphasis mine. The insinuation here is that there are non-military things. There are other examples, but they are limited and wrapped up in character biases. It is also mentioned to Rico that no one can be turned away from Federal Service if they volunteer, so there are plenty of non-combat and non-military jobs. Things are put into military terms (Labor Battalions, for example), but that doesn't mean it's ""military"" in the sense we mean in the real world. 
  

>Or just stop making shit up.
  

Resorting to ad hominem, brilliant. 
  

You seem to have a problem distinguishing *the opinions of characters* from the way Heinlein sets up the world in Starship Troopers:
- Rico is an unreliable narrator who goes all in on the MI after training and a few experiences there. He is heavily biased towards seeing the military in a positive light and, since he is recounting things to you and not experiencing them real time, that shading is present throughout the book.
- The individual in the quote above is heavily biased towards ""proper"" military service since thst is the route they went.
- Some of the quotes provided in your/Diggumsbiggums post are from characters (like Rico's Father, the doctor giving him his physical, etc.) who are vehemently anti-service and anti-military, and they know that you aren't guaranteed a non-military job when you sign up. They equate any Federal Service with the military.
  

Here is a pretty good essay on the very controversy we are circling: https://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/ftp/fedrlsvc.pdf. I disagree with their outcome, but it's a good essay and they have useful quotes.
  

It calls out some things from Heinlein from *Expanded Universe* as he responded to critics like you. In Heinlein's own words:
  

> ""Veteran"" does not mean in English dictionaries or in this novel solely a person who has served in military forces. I concede that in commonest usage today it means a war veteran…but no one hesitates to speak of a veteran fireman or a veteran school teacher. In STARSHIP TROOPERS it is stated flatly and more than once that nineteen out of twenty veterans are not military veterans. Instead, 95% of voters are what we call today “former members of federal civil service.” [ellipses and emphasis in the original]

Starship Troopers is about two pillars of American Democracy that were controversial in the Korean War era and its aftermath:    Civilian control of the military and birthright citizenship.  The book is Heinlein's thesis against both.       

In 1950, UN forces (aka Americans) invaded the Korean peninsula and pushed the communists all the way back to Chosin (Klandaathu) where they were were expected to surrender.    Instead, a million Chinese soldiers swarmed across the border and encircled the Americans, who only escaped despite heavy casualties.  The military wants to go nuclear, but the civilians overrule them -- Truman fires MacArthur and an armistice is negotiated that splits the peninsula in half.   

Meanwhile,  the other hot-button topic of the day is the expansion of the franchise to poor black southerners, often of limited literacy.   Historically, the south has used all manner of oppression to limit the right to vote -- poll taxes, literacy tests, etc.

If you think Farnham's Freehold has 'race issues', you've clearly missed the entire point of the novel.

Heinlein had an *extensive* track record on racial equality. Claiming otherwise is simply incorrect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein#Race

> The ""civilian government"" of Heinlein novel is effectively comprised of ""party members"" inside a one-party rule society.

No, it wasn't. It was merely comprised of veterans. It was no more 'one party' than our own system. Indeed, this is another ""you've missed the point"" if you think that Starship Troopers involved some sort of authoritarian state - Heinlein's argument was that such a state would be less amenable to authoritarianism, not more. You might disagree with his ideas, but you can't argue that pro-authoritarianism is a theme in Starship Troopers.

> Kids have a right to grow up being educated, not being used as sweatshop labor.

Child labor laws had existed for decades before the New Deal. In terms of education, the New Deal only dealt with it peripherally. It financed construction of new schools via PWA and provided jobs for teenagers (16+) via programs like NYA.

But neither child labor laws nor funding schools were a significant component of the New Deal.

> Bank customers have a right to get their deposits back, even if the bankers are crooked.

The FDIC was a response to honest banks failing, not fraud. The purpose was to restore confidence in a banking system shaken up by economic turmoil. It had nothing to do with ""crooked bankers"".

You might be referring to the SEC, but that really had nothing to do with ""crooked bankers"" either. It was primarily about regulating the degree of risk that investments could assume.

He could have spent four years working as a fry-cook in a military base and gotten his citizenship that way, or done Admin in an office building, or any number of other easier options. He chose the hard path, knowingly and willingly.

Definitely a hole in the system there in my opinion, but I don't recall offhand if there's any mention of being allowed to try again in a different path if you couldn't hack it as a soldier. Dishonorable discharge is one thing, but they made a big deal of how recruits would have a quiet conversation with the commanding officer and then be gone by the end of the day and how the company lost half its recruits that way very quickly.  
Seems like recognising you're not cut out for the Mobile Infantry is treated with respect and dignity, and surely the opportunity ought to be there to find another way to serve if the drive is still present.  
Perhaps there is and Rico simply doesn't recognise or linger on it, it wouldn't be the only time he was laser-focused on his own view of the world in the book.

I've spent my entire life watching my shitshow of a government dismantle every major support-system and national service piece by piece and sell it to their friends for profit.

Is the system in Starship Troopers a *good* system? In-universe it seems to be. It's certainly not perfect, and it has plenty of questionable aspects, but frankly so does the USA's system of government and mine.

tuwmg7_6,tuwmg7,"Quite different. Heinlein liked to use his books to explore how different social and political constructs would work out if our circumstances were different.

He started out as a liberal democrat himself but as he got older, he started to see that as populations grow, protecting one interest group's freedoms often meant infringing on other freedoms. And he started to get the idea that while small populations could be very liberal, large populations needed increasing control to stop different groups from hurting each other.

Starship Troopers (the novel) had a very simple premise. Imagine there are multiple intelligent species in the universe. That would make every habitable planet a treasure beyond treasures. An oasis in an otherwise hostile galaxy.

In the novel, humanity has a very rigid society where only those who contribute to society get a vote. Basically, everyone's well taken care of but only teachers, doctors, soldiers, etc. get to vote, run for political office and so on.

The book mostly focuses on the philosophy of soldiering. What it means to make yourself personally responsible for the society you live in.

Within the context of the book, it made sense. Humanity was spreading across the stars in competition with other alien species. Humanity couldn't afford another world war or division within the species itself so it developed a very rigid society.

The movie took some elements of that notion and turned it into a fascist caricature for an action movie. Some people still just read the book and try to make the point that it's just Heinlein's love letter to fascism.

tuwmg7_11,tuwmg7,">You can still like the book, and you can still think Heinlein wasn't himself a fascist. But the society he wrote in this book definitely is.

It really isn't. The point people often ignore is that everyone in the society in starship troopers is free. Nobody goes hungry, lacks access to medical care or education. You're welcome to hold a point of view that is entirely contrary to the regime. 

And while the book focuses on the military, it makes it clear that there's many paths to franchise. Teachers, doctors, nurses, anyone who places themselves into the service of society has an easy path to the right to franchise.

The book essentially contrives a situation that poses the question, what if those who control society had to make themselves personally liable for that society?

>During the opening chapter, on a ""show of force"" raid that's meant to be merciful, Rico actually does little to avoid casualties

And the way the book contrives that situation is by posing a universe where multiple intelligent species are in competition for habitable planets. Every species wants to spread and that makes habitable planets incredibly valuable oasis in a hostile universe.

With real alien competitors, humanity could no longer afford to be in competition with itself. It could no longer afford to tolerate humans who do not place society's interest first to have a controlling influence over society.

>Finally, despite this being an advanced society 700 years in the future, the punishments for civil and military infractions would already have been considered brutally excessive in 1958. The US Army stopped flogging people in 1861. I'm pretty sure they didn't ever hang people for punching an officer.

This is a great example of that. It's not meant to hark back to when we still did physical punishment. The book makes the point that offenders really don't have the right to become a long term burden on their society. Corporal punishments are fast and have a low impact on society. Offenders get sentenced, punished and released back into society with minimal cost for society.

Irredeemable offenders are removed from society through capital punishment. Again, no right to be a continued burden on society.

The opening of the book explains that humanity's first contact strategy is to make it perfectly clear to alien species that humanity is not worth messing with. It's a shock and awe introduction intended to prevent lengthy wars. With an acceptable collateral damage margin.

That's also why the bugs are the focus of the book. That shock and awe introduction that worked so well on the skinnies, did not work at all on the bugs. The bugs are the first species humanity encounters that does not value individual life. The bugs weren't shocked and awed when humanity destroyed a bunch of their drones and thus war erupted.

>it's not clear to me whether Heinlein is in favor of the society he depicts or not. 

Heinlein's opinions are clearer when you read his entire body of work. Essentially he started out as a liberal democrat but as he got older he started to notice how protecting one group's freedom's often meant curbing other freedoms. 

He developed a mindset that low population societies had far greater capacity for freedom. While heavily populated societies needed increasingly more rigid control to keep it's constituent groups from clashing with each other over conflicting demands and philosophies. A densely populated society or planet would need very rigid control to stop it from tearing itself apart with war.

A lot of his novels explore familiar social and political constructs placed into entirely new contexts.

Starship Troopers explores the necessity for a rigidly controlled society in a universe where humanity has to compete with other alien societies for it's place in the galaxy.

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress explores social constructs for a society living in a very high risk environment while also dealing with an extreme gender imbalance.

Time Enough for Love has an immortal protagonist whose lifespan allows him to live many lives on both very free frontier planets and rigidly controlled overpopulated ones.

tuwmg7_12,tuwmg7,">The society has restricted franchise, meaning people have to earn what democracies regard as our most fundamental right.

That's a pretty recent development. At the time of WWI, most British men who served couldn't vote. And then when it was given to all men 21 and older, for women you had to be 30 and landed.

When the US was founded, about 10 to 15% of citizens could vote. The franchise was restricted to people who had ""earned"" it by having sufficient wealth / property. It's barely been over 100 years since women were granted the right to vote across the US.

Heinlein saw how what you call ""our most fundamental right"" was restricted and granted by government. 

At least in Starship Troopers, anyone and everyone who wanted to earn their right to vote. The government was forbidden by law to prevent anyone from doing that...unless they were so mentally incompetent that they couldn't understand the oath.

Oh...and I live in Florida. Are you aware of the current state government's attempts to restrict that ""most fundamental right""? Are you aware of the multiple ongoing attempts in many states that are designed at trying to restrict voting? Clearly there are plenty of people in governments in the US who don't believe that voting is a fundamental right that belongs to all citizens 18 years and older.

Personally, he changed a lot over his lifetime, starting out liberal democrat and ending up conservative. His conclusion was that freedom is something low population societies can easily afford.

But the more densely populated a society becomes, the harder it is to protect people's liberties. Protecting one freedom often means curbing another. Which meant to him that the more densely populated a society becomes, the more rigidly that society needs to be controlled to prevent people from tearing society apart with war and conflict between different peoples and interest groups.

Starship Troopers explores what kind of society humanity would need to create in a universe where humanity is in competition with other alien civilizations for the available habitable worlds in the galaxy.

Heinlein poses it would be one that can't afford internal strife within humanity because those alien societies would outcompete us. So he writes a society where only those who contribute to the greater good get a say in the running of society. There's no space to be governed by bickering interest groups.

Citizenship comes at the end of a term of service, not during. The novel describes how only 10% of BootCamp trainees make it through. The remainder washes out (no citizenship) or get non-combat roles that do result in citizenship.

Dubois citizenship is notable because he obtained it through military service. He's already served and to his listeners that adds weight to his words.

>That doesn't negate my points. Or justify chemical and biological weapons.

What is your point exactly? Everyone goes to war and there's nothing particularly fascist against first strikes. The greatest democracy on Earth loves them. Just like there's nothing fascist about chemical or bioweapons.

Pretty much every nation on Earth handled the Geneva convention by simply inventing new horror weapons that aren't considered war crimes for no better reason than the Geneva convention never having been updated.

>Okay... That's still an extremely authoritarian approach.

Is it? Authoritarianism is defined by enforcing strict obedience at the expense of personal freedom. Starship Trooper's society isn't considerably stricter than ours nor does it try harder to limit personal freedoms. It simply doesn't wish for criminals to burden society long term so it chooses punishments that are faster and less expensive to return offenders to their lives much faster.

Most classic totalitarian regimes would do the opposite. Turn offenders into slave labour for society.

You can be mad that the director hijacked the book's story to tell his own, but the one he told is also a valid story to tell.

As to why he told the story he did, he lived the first 8 years of his life under Nazi occupation in an area of the Hague that was routinely bombed, including the house next door. His early memories include ""images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger.""

He wanted people who thought they were just catching an action movie to see the nihilistic brutality beneath the sexy veneer of fascism. I guess he found that worked well with the society in Starship Troopers, since many people feel it was fascist to begin with.",casualsubversive,2022-04-03T06:29:23Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,21
tuwmg7_22,tuwmg7,">Freedom of opinion doesn't exclude the possibility of treason. Rico's parents were quite vocal against the service and they were allowed to be anti-state just fine.

Saying you wish the military didn't run things is *considerably* short treason in a free society. Rico's parents were vocal against *serving,* not the government, and those conversations were at home.

>Citizenship comes at the end of a term of service, not during. The novel describes how only 10% of BootCamp trainees make it through. The remainder washes out (no citizenship) or get non-combat roles that do result in citizenship.

>Dubois citizenship is notable because he obtained it through military service. He's already served and to his listeners that adds weight to his words.

You said, ""Teachers, doctors, nurses, anyone who places themselves into the service of society has an easy path to the right to franchise."" Why would doctors and teachers wash out of doctoring and teaching?

Besides, the doctor makes it clear he is a civilian employee, because he does not wish to serve in the military. And not all teachers can teach Dubois's subject—""we had known that he was a **veteran** since \[the course\] must be taught by a **citizen.""**

So, it's pretty clear military service is the only path to citizenship. The people who don't become ""real soldiers,"" as the enlistment guy puts it, are just doing non-combat jobs. The same way that loads of WWII GIs were still doing lots of random jobs for the Army in the 50s when Heinlein was writing this. Jobs like having stuff tested on them—one of the things mentioned.

It's brutal corporal punishment. Authoritarian regimes love brutal corporal punishment.

In theory a democratic society allows voters some control over how that violence is utilized.  How restrained or unrestrained the government is in its use of force, and where that violence is  directed.  
  
The reality is that most democracies of any substantial size function more like oligarchies or plutocracies, than genuine democracies, and that even at smaller scales representative democracy requires a level of personal investment from it's constituents that it is difficult to achieve and virtually impossible to maintain.   
  
In the context of starship troopers, the quote is accurate at a theoretical level and the glorification of violence used as a propaganda tool within the setting makes the notion appealing, it's an effort to leverage that to encourage the high level of investment necessary to maintain a truly representative democracy.

If you cannot, or will not, match violence with violence, or some unassailable defence, your ideals will not perpetuate. In much the same way as philosophy consideration is only available those with adequate leisure time, high ideals are only available to those who can reliably defend them. George Carlin accurately spoke on this subject. People talk a lot about ""rights"". Rights are bullshit, if they can be taken away, and they regularly are, they aren't ""rights"" they are simply privileges afforded by society, or the state.

7guuzi_3,7guuzi,"A *Troopers* thread means lots of Verhoeven posts.  I recently came to a conclusion as to why that bothers me.

Movie adaptations are necessarily different from the written source material.  That's just part of their nature.  So we can have a discussion as to how faithful an adaptation is and why compromises were made.

You can't do that with *Starship Troopers* and Verhoeven's movie.  This is because [Verhoeven didn't read the book](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/paul-verhoeven/).  He willingly discards the bulk of the material out of hand.  So he takes the most superficial elements of the book, bug war in space, and then slaps his own narrative on top.  That would be fine if people (perhaps including Verhoeven himself) didn't think that this meant that he somehow had an insightful take on Heinlein.  Verhoeven couldn't possibly have insight on Heinlein because he himself ignored that avenue.  The substance of the *Troopers* book, politics and culture, are replaced with two-dimensional fascism.

Then there are the people who maybe saw the movie and read the book.  They are also posting about how stupid and fascist Heinlein is.  My counterargument is *The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress* where convicts are exiled to the moon for life, form their own culture around plural marriage families, and then fight back against an Earth that treats them as slave labor.

I am not claiming to be a Heinlein expert, but I think he succeeds at asking questions of his readers.  He's not dictating.

7guuzi_4,7guuzi,"I mean, of course it's true. Imagine the most peaceful, egalitarian society you can. Now imagine some assholes get together and start claiming territory, imposing their own will and values on society. You can't stop them without using force, because they're using force against you. It's just a fact, based on our nature as biological organisms that feel pain and can be threatened, coerced, or killed. The only possibility (that I can think of) for escaping this truth is by modifying the human species itself so as to make the application of force irrelevant or impossible. 

All of that being said, Rat-jackass' fascist diatribe was meant to be a criticism of fascism by Heinlein, not an endorsement of it. His other works, such as The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress and Stranger In A Strange Land informs us of this. Heinlein's own political views were somewhere between the American tradition of individualist libertarianism and the European tradition of libertarian socialism. Starship Troopers depicts a sick society, where the only people who are allowed to wield political authority are those who have pledged their lives in service to the State, especially the military. This means that their society is run exclusively by people who hold militaristic and authoritarian values, and this is reflected in the Federation's interactions with other entities, institutions, and alien races. 

What kind of world would it be if our leaders were all people who used to wear skull earrings for each combat mission they'd been on, people who celebrate the application of force and death?

7guuzi_29,7guuzi,"It's been a while since I've read it, so my points may be slightly off, but the basic set up is:

Serving the state is open to everyone; most do civil service, some do military service. Those who don't serve are treated fairly and can prosper (like Rico's family). The benefit of serving is the ability to vote. The book never really mentions what voting entails (other than some form of representative democracy; there could be referenda or other nonsense). The book does imply that those in power will be citizens and will be held accountable for their actions if they disrupt the public good.

That's a few years of service under (intentionally) harsh conditions to create a sense of ""the good of the many before the good of the individual."" Nominally, that would encourage voters to favor decisions that are good for the whole (which implies a paternalistic attitude towards 'civilians' - set up laws so that everyone can prosper because service has instilled a sense that you need to protect your community). I feel like this tends to disregard brigading or the tribalist tendency of humans, but Heinlein implies that super harsh federal treatment beats that out of you.

The result is more like Rome than Sparta to me. You can serve the state and be rewarded with political authority in the state. Helots were basically serfs (or a rung above slaves), which is not the position given to Civilians in Starship Troopers. Civilians are basically interchangeable with a vast majority of the American populace (except, instead of not voting, they are ineligible to vote). 

If my recollection is correct, the government is predisposed to the use of force (because it's taught as the prime mode of action) but it's utilitarian in its application. The federation is allied with other aliens and at war where necessary. The use of military strength seems to be more focused on maintaining a position of authority than outright expansionism.

ta8cv3_1,ta8cv3,"It is not pro-fascist. Robert Heinlein wrote many books each of which experimented with different political systems and moral views. In Stranger in a Strange Land he experimented with free love, in Moon is a Harsh Mistress he toyed with anarchism, and in Starship Troopers he explores nationalism and civic duty. 

The only thing which seems fascist about the book is its focus on the military, as well as its postulation of a nation in which military service is a prerequisite for certain political rights, to vote and hold office. The book, you might remember, lingers a great deal on moral questions, and most of the book is spent in dialogue surrounding these issues. 

Why would a nation require civilians to serve (and it need not be military service) in order to “earn their franchise?” The book answers by saying the relationship between state and citizen is one of mutual obligation, and that if you want your commitment to the state to be taken seriously, you should have at the very least paid your dues, and possibly risked your life in doing so. 

The book also touches on the fact that every citizen of every national community is deeply implicated in the violence which was required to found the community, and which is needed to continue its survival. It is open to the fact that the wars which a nation wages might be unjust. The book very clearly references the Korean War (“your just as dead if you’re killed in a police action as in a real war” something like that) and honestly takes an ambiguous stance towards the war against Klendathu, which the humans started. The initial raid against the Skinnies is hardly made out to be glorious. 

In the end, the book is about a young boy who becomes a man, and in doing so learns about this difficult concept of citizenship. Heinlein crafts a world specifically to explore these themes.

Heinlein's ideology as expressed in the novel strikes me as less ""blood and soil"" and more military-industrial utopia. The ""veterans"" took control from the ""social scientists"" following a nuclear war and now while the Federation is nominally democratic, it's instilled with a very 1950s American sense of military discipline that smooths over the rough edges of actual democracy. Also, the Bugs are often identified as Heinlein's own projection of the horrors of Chinese communism, where there is no individuality and everyone is a designated worker, fighter, or whatever. This contrast between Good American Technocracy and Bad Asiatic Technocracy is more fundamental, to me, than the question of whether it's fascist or not.

Heinlein's later books mostly abandon the Cold War ideological musings to focus on free love and incest because he was a very horny old man. I would say both *Dune* and *Left Hand of Darkness* do horny sci-fi much better than *Stranger in a Strange Land*.",scythianlibrarian,2022-03-09T17:01:54Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,3
ta8cv3_4,ta8cv3,"The only place I've ever seen fascism in regards to Starship Troopers is from the director of the 90s live action movie. If I remember the quote, it was along the lines of ""wanting to highlight the inherent fascism of the military"".  Something to that effect. 

Completely at odds with what the book was about. Diving more into the movie, the script was a random sci Fi story (starbase 16 or something was the original title), they slapped character names and some of the plot from the book in to it and called it Starship Troopers. 

The director did a bunch of things to make the military, in general, look incompetent. He also pulled heavily on Nazi uniform styles and propaganda mixed liberally with allied propaganda. 

The movie is disgusting. About the only good thing was the topless shower scene viewed from the very first row of a packed theater. It was a two story tall boob. Yay!

The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is my 2nd fav of his books. Stranger in a strange land is great for discussions but really isn't all that odd. Compared to ""A Brave New World"" with the 8yr old classes having sex play education, it's not really wild. Kind of looks at what it means to be human. 

Time Enough For Love is odd if you haven't met the character Lazarus Long before, but the biggest thing is that in the middle of the book Heinlein puts together all of his greatest lived wisdom. It's really similar to Marcus Aurelius' ""Meditations"".  

The book ""Friday"" is really fun. The main character is a bioware enhanced security courier, kind of like Johnny Mnemonic. Heinlein plays with social constructs around family development, amongst other things. Has a bit more action and reads kind of like a spy novel.

ta8cv3_5,ta8cv3,"> I've been told this book is pro-fascist but I didn't see anything encouraging fascism? Or do people mean like ancient-Rome style fascism (if you could call it that)? Was curious on people's thoughts.

Most people who say this know little of Heinlein's work and are just parroting what they read online or what someone else told them.  Some may have seen the movie and assumed it the book had a similar tone, which it does not.

Heinlein went through many political beliefs over his life, from socialism to conservatism to frontier libertarianism, but the important thing to remember is that a writer is not their work.  It's perfectly possible to explore the positives of a military dominated state, glossing over the negatives, without making oneself a Fascist.

Starship Troopers is essentially a coming of age story.  Citizen of the Galaxy is similar in that respect, as is Tunnel in the Sky.  Both are good reads.

> Also, what's another good book of his? My coworker recommended citizen of the galaxy (IIRC) , but Heinleins got a ton of hits it seems.

I would say most of Heinlein's ""juvenile"" novels are good, as are almost all of his short stories.  His more ""adult"" novels are weaker, but his crowning achievement is his Lazarus Long ""series"", starting with Methuselah's Children and Time Enough for Love, and leading through The Number of the Beast, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset.

As for what to read next, there's nothing else in Heinlein's oeuvre really like Starship Troopers, but I would recommend The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.  If you enjoy that, then read the Lazarus Long series mentioned above.",sirbruce,2022-03-09T19:34:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,5

What you will find in Starship Troopers is a political realist take on liberalism, but because it is not an idealistic NobleBright utopia, some people confuse it for fascism.

It doesn't help that among those who mistook it for fascism were the directorial team of the film adaptations who were hoping to parody fascism- and so tried to lean into a fascist aesthetic for the Terran Federation in order to mock fascism.

* military dictatorship
* military citizenship

It is the way it is because it works and no one has seen reason to change it. The government provides for the people and should that change, revolution is expected and required.

Anyhow, if you want the complete message Heinlein was trying to get across, read Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.

ta8cv3_29,ta8cv3,"Way late to the party but I recently read the book and found myself here.

Maybe you are getting the movie and book confused, as Verhoven tried to make Heinlein's ideas look fascist. He also failed in that, other than the ascetics of the Nazi uniforms. He fundamentally misunderstood what fascism is and fails to show how libertarian philosophies are totalitarian, fascist or crypto fascist. There is NO decent allowed in a fascist state because the state forces its beliefs upon you. Clearly there are a lot of objections to government and military in Starship Troopers. Civilians openly mock the military, and nothing happens to them.

Almost every country in history has had a militaristic period, and all countries use propaganda. Neither of these things are fascist or totalitarian. Nowhere does it state that the federal government is run by the military. Anyone who has given service to the federal government can run for office, the military is just one way of service. We see the world through Johnny who is in the military, so of course we get a better view of that side of things.

So far as we know humanity is defending itself against annihilation from a genocidal species that doesn't care about individuality or freedoms. They are fundamentally opposed to it because of their evolution and incapable of individuality inherently. The book also makes the point that the Terran Federation's military aim and mission is to demonstrate what they COULD do, while inflicting as few casualties as possible. To demonstrate that humanity is not to be messed with and nothing more.

Johnny's father built a successful company, became rich, and had children. So, Johnny is a ""rich kid"" and still joins the mobile infantry. You can become rich without federal service, and it seems rather common. Civilians and citizens both are able to achieve the things they desire. There is every type of person in their society, they don't discriminate by race or class or sex. They don't force people to join federal service and even their recruiters are there to warn conscripts and dissuade those who don't have what it takes.

There are also far more ways to gain citizenship than what is immediately revealed in the book and any federal service is a guarantee of suffrage. Every civilian has the option to earn citizenship through voluntary service. Since they aren't conscripted, and because of the voluntary choice that comes with the risk of self-sacrifice as a possibility, you gain citizenship.

Heinlein absolutely wants you to think critically about his ideas, but he wrote the book to show that people NEED to be willing to defend the sovereignty against existential threats or they will cease to exist. Should those who have given service have more say than those who do not? Those who volunteer for federal service have proven that the whole is more important to them than the individual. This isn't something you can coerce people to believe, each person has to decide that for themselves freely.

If you remember even though Johnny's father discouraged his enrolment in the beginning he comes around in the end, joining the mobile Infantry himself and serving under his son. For the individuality and liberty to exist that everyone enjoys, you need citizenry that are willing to sacrifice themselves to defend it freely but not unnecessarily. Thier willingness to serve and or to put themselves at risk should be encouraged and commended. His father realizes this in the end and decides to take on the same duty because it's the right thing to do.

Your criticisms seem pretty shallow to me, to the point of intentionally missing authorial intent or it just going over your head. This book is an examination of what civic duty is and why militarism is. It also provides examples of the real danger communism and Marxist ideology are to individuality and liberty. A free society that maximizes the desires of each individual's human nature will always have to contended with social constructionism that is designed to coerce others, it is fundamentally opposed to individual freedom.

You betray yourself with your smug sarcasm and condescension in my opinion. It would behoove you to focus on debating the fundamental principles instead of just assuming you are more intelligent than those who you debate or have discussions with.

If you ever read this good luck in your future, I truly hope the best for you.

“Political tags — such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth — are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire. The former are idealists acting from highest motives for the greatest good of the greatest number. The latter are surly curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in altruism. But they are more comfortable neighbors than the other sort.”

1039fb6_2,1039fb6,"Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. I got into sci-fi as a teen back in the early 80's, at about age 11. I turned 12 in '83 and my aunt set me a science fiction box set, which included *Dune* by Frank Herbert and *Startide Rising* by David Brin, as well as *Starship Troopers.*


I've read and re-read these books multiple times over the last 30ish years, and in some way they've all been part of developing who I am. 


*Dune* was a story of a young man who is forced to take on his father's mantle after his death, and my father killed himself.  I would look for ways that I was similar to Paul, but in the end I found I was not like him, in large part did to the lesson that anger and revenge will derail your life's path. Paul saw it coming and did it anyway, a pawn of forces beyond his control.


*Startide Rising* taught me that even when the forces beyond your control are kicking your metaphorical ass, you have to keep working on what is important. Focus on what you can achieve, and the rest will come, although there are certain to be surprises. 


*Starship Troopers* is probably the book I read the most as a teen, easily two or three times a year between age 12 and 18; I still read it every year or two. I get some of the complaints about Heinlein and his writing, as well as his personal life, but I also have enough distance to look at his writing as not only a product of his time, but also being ahead of its time and hugely influential.  

He had strong female leads in sci-fi well before it was commonplace. Sure, they were very sexual in universe, but I defy you to look at history and tell me a time and place where this was not true in life. 


For example, *Tom Jones* by Henry Fielding is a set in its own time, mid-18th century England, and the plot revolves around young people having sex out of wedlock and the ways this affects their lives, with particular distinction shown for the differences between men and women, as well as  between rich and poor.  As difficult as it may seem, these same forces played out 200 years later when Heinlein was writing, and he used what was an undercurrent and brought it to the surface. It's easy to criticize, because he often took things people whispered about and brought them out into the cold light of day. Look into the controversy surrounding *Story of O* published in 1954 and you can see the background against which he was working. 


As far as *Starship Troopers* goes, it was juvenile fiction for Cold War boys. Taking it out of context and applying the values of the 2020's is doing a disservice to the book and the reader.


Yes, the values of the society portrayed are not our values today, but neither were they the values of 1959 America. They are the values of a fictional future society based in part on second hand mid-century American values; having the main character be revealed as Filipino at the end of the story is a touch of genius in that regard given the history of America and the Phillipines to that point; The Spanish-American War and the subsequent American wars of subjugation in the Phillipines were in living memory. 


There is a growing trend these days to evaluate art based only on a specific current, and rapidly evolving, understanding of what American society *ought* to be,  instead of looking at is as a piece of is time, which is also a disservice to artist and viewer/reader/listener.


You take context out of the equation and you miss the sublety.


I find it disheartening that there is a movement to discard so called ""problematic"" art, and history too,due to it not meeting a narrow definition of what is acceptable; whether that definition has a political bias is immaterial, as the ""problematic"" stuff gives us the most ground to cover. 


You take someone who wants to ban ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" because it doesn't fit the model of 21st century consent, and they ignore (or perhaps are ignorant of) the fact that it was written and performed by a husband and wife team with a big knowing wink to their audience about how women wanted the physical company of men, but the morés of mid-century American society wouldn't allow this.  The song is all about subverting the rules, with knowing consent from both parties. Consent was just as important them as now, but our view on the subject have changed. 


Then you have people who interpret *Starship Troopers* based only on their individual experience. This method is devoid of understanding both the importance of the audience it was written for, as well as the fact that the society portayed in the book are completely fictional.


My favorite dumb argument against the book is that it somehow promotes fascism. 


Dumb.


The book is neither for or against fascism, but it is anti- commmunist. 


The position I see time and again is that the humans are very militaristic, and base the whole around the military. This isn't correct. True, in the book the society grew out of soldiers who were betrayed by their governments by drawing them into o devastating global war as well as abandoning them duringand at the end of this war, but it is specifically called out that not all the Veterans were good people. In universe, the people of Earth looked down on the military as a whole, and it had a very minor public role to play, right up until the Bug War. Only the human interstellar colonies had a view that the military was worthwhile, but they were out away from the center. 


They even call out in the story that their system of only allowing Veterans to vote and serve in public office didn't lead to a better quality of leadership, simply that it works well enough that they haven't had to replace it, with an implied ""yet.""


I've read extensively from books that were published before I was born, before even my parents, grandparents, and great-granparents were born, and if you look at it closely enough, all these bygone generations have a similar viewpoint to our own, although it's often buried in etiquette, unspoken rules, and the details that get lost or left out on a junior high-school history test.


If I couldn't look at move past the surface ""issues"" of people, past or present, them I would be tempted to believe that all white people in America were pro-slavery and that being informed about the people who lived in and led the Confederacy was somehow an attack on all white people; in fact, there were abolitionist movements that sought to redress the injustices of slavery.  John Brown was an asshole, but he wasn't winning by slinging words so he turned to violence; terrorism isn't the way, but it is often brought about by marginalized people who are ignored.  We ignore this lesson at our peril. 



If you've read all this, you may have guessed that I don't like the arrogance of narrow minded people telling me I shouldn't like something ""because reasons"" instead of presenting me with well thought out and researched arguments.  In the end, I may not agree, but at least do me the service of treating me with the respect that assuming I have intelligence implies.",borisdidnothingwrong,2023-01-04T20:01:35Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,2

1039fb6_4,1039fb6,"Starship Troopers and Forever War both serve as great book ends to how war and the military are viewed before and after Vietnam. 

Troopers, published in 1959, portrays the military in a heroic light and as the saviors of humanity over a brutal, irrational enemy. Very much how people in the US saw the military and the Nazis during WWII. 

War, published in 1974, really shows the way that the view of the military by Americans had really changed. War was no longer glorious and the politicians no longer good. Lives are sacrificed needlessly over misunderstandings and the only ones who benefit and entrenched political and economic elites.

9yrbkj_1,9yrbkj,"Let's count the ways, using a generic encyclopedia Brittanica definition of fascism as: 

""...extreme militaristic [nationalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nationalism), [contempt](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contempt) for electoral [democracy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy) and political and cultural [liberalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism), a belief in natural social [hierarchy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierarchy) and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a *Volksgemeinschaft* (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation."" [citation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism)

&#x200B;

1) **Extreme militaristic nationalism.** We definitely see this in the book, especially with the enthusiasm of the young people to serve even in defiance of their parents. 

2) **Contempt for electoral democracy et al.** Would you agree a society that extends voting rights only unto those who have survived military service has a ""contempt"" for electoral democracy? Those who chose to work in service-level jobs, to start families, to pursue academia, or who suffered disabilities were all unable to vote. Certainly you cannot be in favor of democracy while extending it so narrowly. 

3) **Natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites.** It has been too long since I read this but if I recall, people with certain preternatural skills rise up to high positions and poor people are VERY looked down on socially, romantically, and in terms of opportunities presented except in rare cases. Would you agree?

4) **Subversion of individual interests for the good of the nation.** I bet you can think of some examples where this is happening in the book. There are social expectations of sacrifice, literal sacrifices being made, and people's expectations of themselves. 

&#x200B;

I wonder if it might be difficult to read this as ""pro-fascism"" because we live in a time with a surprising amount of low-volume, commonly accepted fascists beliefs. I'm old enough to remember when people held contempt for our military, who was viewed as being too pro-itself--always seeking a bigger budget to fight more wars and kill more people. People protested wars in far greater numbers than we do now. We also see open support of voter restriction laws that make registration and voting onerous. Previously these laws were viewed as anachronisms--Jim Crow leftovers that needed to be done away with. Now they have spread to areas that hardly had Jim Crow laws at any point in history. We elected a president many believe is ""better"" because he is a billionaire. When else in history did Americans so passionately want to be ruled by the wealthy? Lastly, millions of Americans regularly and consistently vote against their own self-interests, supporting tariffs that reduce jobs and voting against healthcare and education. These sacrifices are deemed necessary to ""protect"" America against invading foreigners (immigrants) and rising social liberalism (expanded civil liberties, access to abortion, government involvement in healthcare, etc.). 

&#x200B;

I can't speak for other countries, but I believe this rise in fascism is present in the UK, Brazil, Philippines, etc. In the past we associated fascism with dictatorships but in modern times these are populist movements--nothing about fascism precludes populism. I think the best way to read *Starship Troopers* today is firstly to consider how fascism is alive and well in the 21st century, how this differs from the fascism of the World War II era that was more familiar to Heinlein, and then to draw connections between the text and supporting views of both eras. 

&#x200B;

Also: check out the etymology of the word fascism and read that diatribe about corporal punishment again. ",AuthorMattRussell,2018-11-20T15:19:59Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,1
9yrbkj_2,9yrbkj,"I think Heinlein was very interested in 'how things work' or 'how things might work' and much less interested in 'how things ought to work'. Remember that **Starship Troopers** was published in 1959 (Sputnik 1 was 1957). Wikipedia shows *troopers* as the last of his 'Early Novels'.

**Stranger in a Strange Land** (in no way, shape or form Fascist) was his next novel.

I'd be incline to describe Heinlein as an agnostic to political ideology. ",Seismech,2018-11-20T15:21:25Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,2
9yrbkj_3,9yrbkj,"You're flat out wrong at point 2. It's made clear that CIVIL SERVICE is required for the right to vote, that civil service can be anything from teaching, janitorial work, or road construction. Civil service is also available to everyone as a right, including handicapped and disabled; there is at least some small something that can be done for the good of society, and society will find that work so you may earn your right to vote. The objections of the parents you cite in your first point boil down to the parents saying ""Hey, you don't have to join the military. You can earn the right to vote by picking fruit or building a dam instead.""

&#x200B;

Not only that, but the military service is also the smallest, least utilized sector of Civil Service, and is actively discouraged, so much so that the military recruiters are all chewed up, war-scarred amputees who tell you you're too soft to join up and that you will die if you try. 

&#x200B;

On point 3: Heinlein has a strong theme of meritocracy in pretty much all of his books. The modern military is a meritocracy, and so is the military in Starship Troopers. Of course those with superior talents, either inborn or developed, will rise to higher status in this system. So in a strict sense, yes, there is a rule by the elite, however they became elite by exploiting their natural talents to climb the ladder; they also STARTED at the bottom of the ladder.",Spiffy87,2018-11-21T22:20:08Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,3
9yrbkj_4,9yrbkj,"> 1) Extreme militaristic nationalism. We definitely see this in the book, especially with the enthusiasm of the young people to serve even in defiance of their parents.

The protagonist joined because of a girl. His best friend joined because of him. The girl joined because she wanted the educational opportunities. I'm not sure what 'enthusiasm' for militarism you're imagining, but it's not in the book.

Certainly, once they're fighting, they're highly motivated. Because that's because their home town - and virtually every one they knew - got annihilated by a sneak attack from the enemy. I'd be pretty torqued off if that happened to me.

> 2) Contempt for electoral democracy et al. Would you agree a society that extends voting rights only unto those who have survived military service has a ""contempt"" for electoral democracy? Those who chose to work in service-level jobs, to start families, to pursue academia, or who suffered disabilities were all unable to vote. Certainly you cannot be in favor of democracy while extending it so narrowly.

Switzerland, South Korea and Israel are amongst the democratic nations that effectively operate this way. However, they're even *more* stringent. Instead of getting the choice to join or not vote, you get the choice to join or go to jail.

Indeed, the book hints at the fundamental philosophical principle that virtually all democratic societies have adopted: if you're not willing to defend your society, you're not worthy of being part of it.

This principle is actually the *foundation* of democracy and the reason the Founding Fathers were so wary of professional armies. Unless you draw those who hold military power from the common citizenry, there's a tendency for them to become a separate faction that oppresses the rest of society. When you look at authoritarian regimes, the military is almost always an entirely separate class of citizen. In contrast, the militaries of democratic nations are rarely of this sort - they're just normal people who happen to work as military personnel.

So unless you want to claim that Jefferson and Madison were 'fascists', I think you're off base here.

It has been too long since I read this but if I recall, people with certain preternatural skills rise up to high positions and poor people are VERY looked down on socially, romantically, and in terms of opportunities presented except in rare cases.

The only 'natural elite' that exists in Starship Troopers is potentially the fact that some people have psi powers. But those people aren't an 'elite' in the sense they rule society any more than NBA players are an 'elite' in ours because they can jump really high.

> 4) Subversion of individual interests for the good of the nation. I bet you can think of some examples where this is happening in the book. There are social expectations of sacrifice, literal sacrifices being made, and people's expectations of themselves.

I'd hardly call the notion of sacrificing for the good of all a 'fascist' principle in that it's common to virtually all large-scale organizational principles.

ta32z1_1,ta32z1,"The notion of ""service guarantees citizenship"" is actually *less* militaristic than the rules in many societies. Places like South Korea, Israel and Switzerland all have mandatory service requirements, rather than the optional one in Starship Troopers. For that matter, in the U.S., all adult men are required by law to present themselves for military service - the reason you're not sent off to boot camp isn't because you can opt out but because the military doesn't need you.

Also, in the U.S., the military and its veterans are better educated, healthier and more financially secure than the society at large even though very few of them would be considered part of the 'elite' skewing the numbers upwards. They're far more likely to be well-traveled and have experience with people from diverse backgrounds than the average citizen. If you wanted to pick a category of citizens to intelligently exercise the franchise, former military service would be a fairly decent one. That being said, much of this is due to selection bias - those recruited into the military are already smarter, more mentally/emotional stable than those not.

Heinlein was also writing in a different era. He had served himself in the inter-war period and World War II meant that you didn't have the distinction between military and civilian you have today. There are large numbers of people for whom the military is a completely alien experience because they either don't know anyone who has ever served or they haven't spent much time with them. On the other hand, there are families with multiple service members and a family tradition of service. This creates a disconnect where 'military' and 'non-military' often take on the characteristics of different societies.

We also have to face the reality that international conflict is a form of 'reset' on a society that counteracts the tendency of institutions to wither.  The disease of prosperity that you're attributing to democracies is a byproduct of using inappropriate metrics for the leadership of a society. In a prosperous society, those who rise to the top tend not to be those who are best at delivering real value to those below but rather those who are best at pretending to do so - marketing, rather than expertise, becomes the currency of the realm.

However, this requires we accept a state of intermittent conflict - and not the relatively low level post-war conflict we've experienced for the past 70 years but rather major power conflict akin to what we experienced the hundreds of years before in Europe. This sort of abstract current tragedy for future growth is both a hard sell and not a reliable strategy.

However, it's that strategy that really underpins the value of a service-guarantees-citizenship approach. If there's nothing disruptive or challenging about the service, there isn't any broader social virtue you can derive from it.",ViskerRatio,2022-03-09T12:59:43Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,1
2ojvmd_1,2ojvmd,"Came across a discussion about the book a while ago, and people seemed to like my response, so here it is.

Question was along the lines of: ""Isn't Starship Troopers just Fascism?""

>>The society certainly had fascistic attributes from an academic sense.  But very little of the contextual.  The idea of 20th century fascism was a state that existed for its own purpose, in which its citizens were generally a faceless mass, welded tight by nationalism into an unbreakable bundle of sticks.  It tends to appropriate traditional institutions to accrue dictatorial power.  Left-wing operation with a right-wing paint and battlecry, so to speak.  (This is why people of both sides often accuse the other of fascism so much; it's a bastard child of both ideologies). 

>>A key part of this included that the state's need were superior to the individual's freedom.  A political analogue of communism, where the individual is secondary to the 'need' of the group.  And this was generally run by a dictatorial oligarchy, and/or a cult of personality based around a figurehead.

>>The society in Star Ship Troopers differs in many of these regards.  Individual rights of civilians are *strongly* protected.  As the biggest example; despite being faced with a physically superior and implacable enemy, there is no draft, nor an utter mobilization of the economy to direct everything towards the war effort.

>>Political power, similarly, is not held by a selective oligarchy, but rather an utterly self-selecting subset of the entire population, whose ability to gain citizenship is facilitated in every way.  This subset is those who choose military service, or barring military service - engage in work with a similar degree of risk to life and limb.  Citizenship and political franchise are not easily gotten just by signing up, but the only thing that keeps people out is their own valuation of their life vs their desire for political franchise.  Nothing else prevents them from citizenship.

>>Additionally, while the movie portrayed the military as suckering people to be cannon fodder, the Mobile Infantry is *very* different in the books.  You've got billions of bugs to every human.  They can't *afford* to be cannon fodder.  The troops are in gear closer to a hybrid between a Star Craft Marine and Iron Man.  Point is that a lot of money and effort is spent keeping soldiers alive and effective.  The choice of individuals are valued, as are their lives if they decide to risk it for the good of society.

>>This system *does* create a state that perpetuates itself, as both violent and civil revolution are severely reduced in possibility.  But the mechanism that suppresses insurrection, paradoxically, is rigorously making freedom an attainable state for every single member of the populace.

>>Patriotism stemming from a positive evaluation of an objectively high-functioning, stable, prosperous society can be held without it being 'fascism'.  For the world Heinlein constructed in its entirety, it is too simplistic to dismiss it as fascism.

>>Also, this was simply one exploration of one possible society by Heinlein.  Not an endorsement for it specifically.  He did a lot of these thought experiments with different political systems.  The basis behind Star Ship Troopers was the idea of *balancing authority with responsibility* as a necessity for a stable and enduring government/nation.  With that in mind, how might one create a fair, representative society that still balances the two effectively?

I enjoyed Starship Troopers and could appreciate the idea of ""having some skin in the game"" to earn a vote, especially coming from a veteran.  Also, an all volunteer military force, with people always given an opportunity to back out would appeal to someone like Heinlein who had watched the draft/WW2 unfold.  

I thought the major flaw of the book was that his society was completely unsustainable.  Military retention was achieved only through being the most loyal, thoughtful and capable, some with special intellect or skills.  The rate at which the best and brightest were liquidated in his war, realistically would result in there being hardly anyone qualified to govern.  The tyranny of such a small minority over a much larger population wouldn't stand, as the governed would demand a say, and rightfully so.

2ojvmd_4,2ojvmd,"I love Starship Troopers. The book and the movie are both excellent explorations of philosophy. Many, many things in the society in the book are good ideas and very defendable. Let me address the one that isn't.

The Terran Federation DOES hold the belief ""that all life is a communal Darwinian struggle for primacy between district cultural or racial groups"", it merely exchanges human ""races"" for the species of the galaxy, and the TF is more than willing to exterminate the bugs of Kledathu under the justification that if both races seek to expand, one must win out over the other. This is the same ideology as Nazism. People can't pretend the book doesn't defend the metaphor of fascism. It does. Claiming the humans are not the aggressor is also bunk, as the conflict with the other alien race the ""Skinnies"" shows that humans are oppressive and brutal to a race they have already essentially beaten, and it is heavily implied in the book that the asteroid that hit Buenos Aires could not possibly have been launched by Klendathu, as it would have taken millennia to travel the required distance. It was a false flag by the government to justify the war.The difference in moral philosophy can be highlighted by comparing it to Orson Scott Card's book Ender's Game. Where the entire plot is essentially the same, except that the author and main character decry the outcome as evil and unwarranted because of the misunderstanding between a race of individuals and a hive-mind. They regret their actions because communication of racial differences would have resolved things non-violently, while in starship troopers, the war continues and the main character sees nothing wrong with exterminating alien races.There are things to defend about Starship Troopers, the Terran Federations attitude toward the rights of alien races is NOT one of them. The true moral high ground is that ALL sentient races (remember, stupid races don't make starships) deserve the same moral rights. In this manner, the TF is definitely fascist.The Nazi's referred to the Jewish people as ""bugs"", why don't we perform the reverse of that dehumanization for a moment, and refer to the bugs of Klendathu as Jewish people.

One of Heinlein's greatest strengths is tying an intriguing story to a unique vision of society. In The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a political revolution, the emergence of a sentient AI, and strong personal relationships drive the story forward. Heinlein then fleshes out the world with an amazing take on how law and society could/should be structured. In Starship Troops, the plot is very linear. All of the interesting political conflict is in the background, while the story focuses on the main character's personal development. To top it off, Starship Troopers was a painfully didactic story, with chapters devoted to teachers explaining the philosophy in a classroom setting.

The novel would have been much better if Heinlein trusted his readers to understand a message that was interwoven into a complex story. Supposedly, Starship Troopers was originally written for a youth audience, but then adapted for a general audience before it was published.

His societies are generally some form capitalist democracy, and usually in the process of breaking down or revolution.

Starship Troopers is a rare and interesting example of a stable democracy. I don't support military expansion into space, but huge alien insects make a pretty good rebuttal.

2ojvmd_10,2ojvmd,"My point is that the TF's view of alien races is akin to Nazi Germany's view on other nations. They are a foreign biological entity that is ""non family"". They must therefore be either; Enslaved, Enthralled, or Exterminated. Because this is the nature of biological beings in an evolutionary arms race. It disregards the possibility of sentient choice, of Free-will. The humans don't have established communication with the Arachnids, they function like hive mind insects, but 'stupid races don't build starships'.  Confusion, Miscommunication and Misunderstanding are common reasons for war, especially when fueled by an ethic that places the ""lives of Kin"" over the lives of other sentient beings.

Obviously in the case of this fictional novel the metaphor is projected out onto the galaxy, so the issue becomes more clearly one of Sanctity of Kin vs Sanctity of Sentience. Your claim that the bugs can't be dehumanized because they aren't technically human dodges the point of the phrase dehumanized. The point of the phrase is that the worth of them as individuals or as a species (race) is trivialized as less valuable than ""the true people"" (humans) for a reason that is arbitrary (they are not genetically kin with us) as opposed to a valid reason such as the notion that they lack sentience \[remember, stupid races don't build starships\])

The book itself discounts the possibility of finding harmony. As a matter of presented reality. It may be the case that the bugs of Klendathu really can't be reasoned with, but that's a fictional reality and metaphor designed by the author. He wants the reader to come away thinking that even the possibility of such an overt enemy to ""mankind/kin"" validates the principles behind the kin-preservation philosophy. He gets ""credit"" for extending the notion of kin to all of mankind, and not reserving it for a particular nation or family, but it's just a different degree of genetic difference. That's why the metaphor/philosophy that the book presents fuels fascism. Not because he promoted a military society or whatever. But because the narrative of the book sets up the perfect scenario to justify an otherwise unjustifiable philosophy, that when applied to real world human beings (who have an unfortunate tendency to see themselves as extended families competing for finite resources), tends to result in war, slavery, and often genocide.

Starship Troopers Chapter 12 Page 106""Major Reid gave us a busy time. But it was interesting. I caught one of those master’s thesis assignments he chucked around so casually; I had suggested that the Crusades were different from most wars. I got sawed off and handed this: Required: to prove that war and moral perfection derive from the same genetic inheritance. Briefly, thus: All wars arise from population pressure. (Yes, even the Crusades, though you have to dig into trade routes and birth rate and several other things to prove it.) Morals —all correct moral rules derive from the instinct to survive; moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level — as in a father who dies to save his children. But since population pressure results from the process of surviving through others, then war, because it results from population pressure, derives from the same inherited instinct which produces all moral rules suitable for human beings. Check of proof: Is it possible to abolish war by relieving population pressure (and thus do away with the all-too evident evils of war) through constructing a moral code under which population is limited to resources? Without debating the usefulness or morality of planned parenthood, it may be verified by observation that any breed which stops its own increase gets crowded out by breeds which expand. Some human populations did so, in Terran history, and other breeds moved in and engulfed them. Nevertheless, let’s assume that the human race manages to balance birth and death, just right to fit its own planets, and thereby becomes peaceful. What happens? Soon (about next Wednesday) the Bugs move in, kill off this breed which ""ain’t a gonna study war nomore"" and the universe forgets us. Which still may happen. Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us out — because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate. Do you know how fast population pressure could cause us to fill the entire universe shoulder to shoulder? The answer will astound you, just the flicker of an eye in terms of the age of our race. But does Man have any ""right"" to spread through the universe? Man is what he is, a wild animal with the will to survive, and (so far) the ability, against all competition. Unless one accepts that, anything one says about morals, war, politics — you name it — is nonsense. Correct morals arise from knowing what Man is — not what do gooders and well-meaning old Aunt Nellies would like him to be. The universe will let us know — later — whether or not Man has any ""right"" to expand through it. In the meantime the M. I. will be in there, on the bounce and swinging, on the side of our own race""

Should there be any limits or conditions on said franchise, and the way Heinlein couched the question in the book ""Starship Troopers"".  In the terms of that conversation Heinlein spoke of pure democracy being voting rights granted by a 98.2 body temperature.

If you arbitrarily redefine democracy to include monarchies (which seems tortured semantics to me, but hey, enjoy yourself) then your quite right.  There are a couple in addition to the US that have survived.  If you define democracy within the context of this conversation, all adults vote, they tend to fall by the grandchildren of the founders.  That is just historic fact.

For myself, I think Heinlein's approach would be an improvement.  That the franchise is reserved to those who have served for twenty years, and even then, only those who are not receiving any government payments.  You virtually lock out people voting themselves other peoples money if those receiving the money can't vote.  Also, reserving the vote to people who have served twenty years will pretty much lock out the super rich and the plutocrats, who serve no one but themselves.",corathus59,2014-12-08T16:04:41Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,13

7ojpm7_2,7ojpm7,"It might help to start by understanding Paul Verhoeven (the director of the film adaptation).

Verhoeven was a toddler when the Nazis invaded and occupied his nation. After World War II, he grew up in a place where military protection was provided (at a great distance) by the United States. As a result, his only familiarity with the military came from his brief childhood under the Nazis. Like many Europeans, this meant he developed an attitude that national security was just something that magically happened. He didn't know anyone from the military forces of a democratic nation and the only conflicts he knew were far-distant affairs that didn't have any immediate impact on his life.

To Verhoeven, this meant 'military' and 'Nazi' were pretty much the same thing. So when he goes to make a movie about the military, he ends up making a movie about fascists.

However, this attitude - which is fairly common amongst people who have no real connection to military service in the West - flies in the face of millennia of thought about democracy.

In reality, the *cornerstone* of democracy is the citizenship-for-service notion Heinlein tossed into his coming-of-age story. Modern mass democracy would not exist without the English yeomanry tradition - it's encoded into the Second Amendment (which was not actually about using handguns to stave off burglars but rather an expression of the Founder's belief that military obligations and democracy were inextricably linked). The notion of military service as a founding principle of democracy stretches back to ancient Greece and Rome - indeed, one of the primary characteristics of the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire was the shift from a citizen army to a professional one.

In the modern day, several democratic nations (Switzerland and Israel are the classic examples) have compulsory service obligations. All modern democratic nations of any significance have service obligations encoded into law that can be activated against existential threats. Heinlein's service-guarantees-citizenship is actually a libertarian take on mandatory service - rather than take away people's rights (in the form of imprisoning them) for failing to serve, Heinlein gives them the option not to serve.

For people of Heinlein's generation, this concept wouldn't have been remotely odd and would have been indeed viewed as *anti-Fascist*. Bear in mind that their experience was that of a worldwide existential war that was both immediately visceral and was viewed as having a decent chance of extinguishing democratic institutions globally. If you're going to read Starship Troopers, you need to first understand that context rather than imposing your context onto it.

In terms of your other objections:

1. Physical punishment as law. The Nazis didn't actually use corporal punishment - none of the major powers did at that point in history. Indeed, the powers that hung onto corporal punishment the longest were the steadfastly democratic ones - the U.S. and Great Britain. Certainly, the Nazis engaged in a great deal of extrajudicial physical punishment - but the key word here is 'extrajudicial'. The Nazis did not have a very strong notion of the rule of law and abuses of power are common under such regimes. The sort of corporal punishment meted out in Starship Troopers - meticulously following due process - would have been alien to the Nazis because of the due process elements.

2. No universal vote. No nation has ever had 'universal vote'. At the very least, there is always a minimum age to vote. Indeed, the populist notion of 'one man, one vote' is a recent concept in democracy that would have been looked upon with a great deal of skepticism by most historical thinkers. In any case, the Nazis didn't believe in voting *at all* - they viewed the state as a unitary concept, concentrated in the singular leader (who got the only vote).

3. Citizenship granted by challenges. This is about as un-Nazi a concept as you can imagine. The Nazis were eugenicists who believed that a person's worth to the state was based on biology. The notion of 'earning' citizenship just wouldn't track. A Slav could no more become a 'citizen' in Nazi Germany than a horse could learn to fly.

All of the above is philosophy and history as it would have been understood by Heinlein - or, at least, the closest approximation I can make based on knowing his background and reading his work.

That leaves the very speculative notion of ""democracies don't work in our modern society"". I don't really know what Heinlein's view on this point would be and it would be hard to guess.

Characters like Rico's parents in the book make me believe that he was probably getting at a ""you can't handle the truth"" idea. There's a famous quote from RAH:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

In this sort of worldview, an opinion on foreign policy without the experience of war was likely to be foolish. An opinion without even the secondhand experience of military service was almost certain to be theoretical-to-the-point-of-stupidity. Given Heinlein's political leanings - which viewed foreign policy as the primary function of a national government - he was probably trying to evangelize that when people don't know anything, they should shut up and listen to those that do.

Bear in mind that this is a novel about a young man growing up and assuming adult responsibilities. Along the way, he encounters people who attempt to guide him by confronting him with ideas he finds objectionable - but ultimately his lived experience leads him to understand why he should accept them.

Whenever you read a book from a different time/place, you need to make an effort to understand not only the context of the author but your own context as well. You see fascism in a book where the author - and most of his contemporaries - would have found that view not only wrong but insulting. I've tried to explain Heinlein's context, so you need to ask what makes your own context so different from his.",ViskerRatio,2018-01-07T00:07:41Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,2

7ojpm7_5,7ojpm7,"My view is that the book is an attempt to square authoritarianism with the post-WWII ideal of democracy. So we get military rule but there's still voting, so it isn't actually fascism (wink, wink). And at one point they're fighting aliens that are described as ""naked"" (as in naked savages). Plus it got the dumbest attempt at refuting the labor theory of value ever made. He also pretty clearly equates the bugs with the Chinese in the 20th century. Another thing that struck me was the irrationality regarding the necessity of ground combat when the humans have bombs big enough to destroy entire planets and no reason to hold them back due to concerns about respecting the right of life of the bugs. 

The principle of ""everybody fights"" is a dumb military concept (imagine the chaos that would ensue if commanding officers were getting wounded and killed left and right). 

Another thing that jumped out at me was the bit about the necessity of retrieving secret POW. When I read the book I thought for sure that it was written during or after the Vietnam War, when the conspiracy theory that MIA were in fact secret POW took root, but Starship Troopers was written in 1959 (the POW/MIA myth is a right-wing favorite).",bangdazap,2018-01-06T15:29:42Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,5

3ss91y_2,3ss91y,"Starship Troopers is one of my all-time favorite books. I first read it when I was in 7th grade (about age 12 or so). It's made me think about how we should structure of government, the idea of citizen service, and what we owe to our fellow citizens. The ""History & Moral Philosophy"" content of the book is probably the most important part of the book; if the book had been composed of only battle scenes and military life, it would be entirely forgettable. 

Here are some other thoughts, partly responding to what I've heard others say throughout the years:

1) People in the book do ""federal service"", which is not necessarily ""military service"" or ""combat service"". 

I've seen a lot of people misunderstand this, probably because the book is all about someone who serves in the Mobile Infantry. Perhaps some people are too ready to believe what recruiting sergeants say? Remember, a volunteer for federal service can be refused only if they're unable to understand the oath of service. The medical exam is only to see what jobs you can't do; it can't be used to disqualify you from service entirely. So if you're blind and in a wheelchair, you can still volunteer for a two-year term of federal service--and the government MUST take you. 

The military isn't just composed of the Mobile Infantry. The Army certainly has other units (e.g. logistics, intelligence, engineers), and there's also a Navy. In the book, one of the older men who flunks out of Mobile Infantry boot camp refuses to accept a medical discharge and winds up as a cook on a Navy transport. Also, Johnny enlists with his friend Carl, who wants to do electronics R&D. Although Carl dies when Pluto is attacked by the Bugs, the book states that Carl was on Pluto working in a research lab--he certainly wasn't in a combat unit.

2) The Terran Government is a civilian government, not a military dictatorship.

The structure of the government is unclear, but there is a right to vote. Voting is restricted to those who have successfully performed federal service, but people have a right to volunteer for federal service and cannot be refused (except if they can't understand the oath). Consequently, people (albeit veterans) elect politicians who run the government. So it's not a military dictatorship. It's just that since the elected government is composed of veterans, the laws are protective of the military and federal service. 

Also, the civilian economy is based on capitalism, just look at Johnny's father. 

3) Prisons don't seem to exist.

Corporal punishment is pervasive throughout the book. If I recall correctly, flogging and execution are the only two judicial punishments mentioned in the book. Execution (hanging) is also used for crimes besides murder (kidnapping, hostage-taking, asking for ransom); prisons as a place of years-long imprisonment don't seem to exist.

lit7hf_1,lit7hf,"TL;DR: Dubois is the author saying that kids won't learn that the stove is hot because they were told it was hot, they only learn when they burn themselves.


My interpretation is that Dubois was basically the author making the assertion that humanity requires war as a means to sustain itself, not in terms of material resources but as an upkeep of moral comprehension and duty to the collective society.

 It is kind of reminiscent of how nations thought about war before WW1 when war was more viewed as a gentleman's endeavor to separate the men from the boys, for men to find their courage, develop character, prove their merit, and conquer their fears and by extension themselves. Filtering out the self serving cowards in society so they never are in a position of influence.

 These notions of course largely fell out of favor once we got so efficient at killing each other and the potential fallout of large-scale war between nations grew too terrible to risk. Not likely to benefit from having a gauntlet test of courages if that test comes in the form of a hail of machine gun fire and atomic blasts from which nobody survives. Not to mention the high body count made a flaw in the system difficult to overlook. That flaw being that you were more likely to survive and rise in the military by nepotism rather than merit. 

The only real satire I find about starship troopers is that the book is basically a pro war book whereas the film adaptation adopted a very antiwar narrative.

I may be misremembering that part. I think I last read the book in like 2016 or something.

I do agree that the book isn't fascist leaning in and of itself, but that rather it portrays a fascistic society.

Merriam-Webster's definition of fascism is:

>a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.

I'd say the society in Starship Troopers fits the bill there.

>the Federation's system in the book does suck if all the people who just so happen to have a right to vote have also been brainwashed by the military.

That's the thing, it's not just those who have the right to vote. Those who haven't served technically aren't even citizens, and have barely any rights. Ties into the ""nation above the individual"" and the forcible suppression of opposition noted above. Essentially, anyone who opts out of military service is a societal outcast, as serving your country is exalted above all else.",tomkatt,2021-02-13T07:59:16Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Starship Troopers,2
