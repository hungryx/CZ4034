198bntm_1,198bntm,If you liked Candide I would recommend checking out Jacques le Fataliste by Diderot. It has a similar sense of humor.,FakeFeathers,2024-01-16T20:26:57Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
198bntm_2,198bntm,"I had actually just finished this myself 2 days ago. It wad a great read and I finished it in roughly a couple of days, I couldn't put it down. I loved the dark humor; his love he had pursued and lost all of his fortunes for turned ugly. The brutality which all characters seemed to endure, be it war, rape, servitude. The exchange of stories, and the complete unliklihood of people running into each other, as if the globe was just a ""big town, small town"" setting. 

And the ending was beautiful. When Pangloss wants to philosophically muse, Candide just simply responds with ""we have work to do."" It was a character arc of maturity and understanding pragmatism.

I wasn't expecting to love it but I did.",hopepridestrength,2024-01-16T23:18:52Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,2
198bntm_3,198bntm,"I've just re-read this because I found a 1950s Penguin Classic edition in a second hand bookshop.

Definitely not the funniest book I've ever read - it's one long riff on the same thing really. I imagine it was pretty witty for its day - the cheek to write and publish a totally daft book just to take the piss out of someone's philosophy is a baller move.

The funniest book I've ever read is Catch-22, and it even has a discussion of the problem of pain and the religious responses to it:

&#x200B;

>“And don’t tell me God works in mysterious ways,” Yossarian continued, hurtling on over her objection. “There’s nothing so mysterious about it. He’s not working at all. He’s playing. Or else He’s forgotten all about us. That’s the kind of God you people talk about–a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?”  
>  
>“Pain?” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. “Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.”_x000D_  
_x000D_  
“And who created the dangers?” Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. “Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! Why couldn’t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person’s forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn’t He?”_x000D_  
_x000D_  
“People would certainly look silly walking around with red neon tubes in the middle of their foreheads.”_x000D_  
_x000D_  
“They certainly look beautiful now writhing in agony or stupefied with morphine, don’t they? What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It’s obvious He never met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shipping clerk!” 

Maybe a bit tangential, but if you liked the surreal/dark humour in Candide, then you should read Catch-22.",InherentWidth,2024-01-16T22:19:08Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,3

198bntm_10,198bntm,"My thing with philosophers is that some people just manage to say things better than others, and I personally don't like the way Leibniz structured his ideas for the same reason Voltaire doesn't.

There's a graphic novel called ""Heretics"" that does a wonderful job of collecting the main ideas of the philosophers of this time into a coherent and accessible book. There are guys like Hobbes who don't have enough faith in the social contract, and thought we needed Kings and Queens to rule us in order to enforce it. Got to admit, I really hate that idea.

With Leibniz, he had a very flowery way of presenting the world and his ideas. Monads is a pretty fun way to express Spinoza's god, for example. Personally, I find Leibniz passive optimism as an obstacle in terms of influencing real change in the world, and that's why Candide is such a fun read.

Cathcart’s letter to Missus Daneeka right after that is also wonderful.

jsga41_1,jsga41,"I loved Candide, though I do agree it was a terribly bleak piece on the state of humanity and on our general mindset on a whole. Reading it, one of the first things that comes to mind is that *this* is how Voltaire saw the world.

But then you stop and realize how hard he fought and how much he wrote in his life, and you realize that even he saw something worth hanging onto, though what it was I'm not sure. Maybe, knowing him, he took pleasure in fighting and arguing sheerly for the sake of doing so. And maybe that is the ultimate lesson of Candide, and Voltaire message as a whole-- true happiness and absolute meaning don't exist, but we can find our own little corners of the world to settle in and create our own meaning, such as the characters of Candide when they settle down on their farm.",,2020-11-11T22:05:46Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1

6vlo8d_1,6vlo8d,"I think a lot has been made of the significance of ""cultivate one's own garden"" as the 'moral' of Candide. I think that goes to what you're saying. That life gains meaning when everyone looks out for themselves and their family, and that if you do that the world will be good. But the whole book is satirical, particularly when is comes to optimistic philosophies (e.g. best of all possible worlds). So I think your interpretation of what the ending means is correct.... it's just a matter of whether or not it's supposed to be taken seriously. I could also be totally wrong, it's been a while since I've read Candide. ",mcahoon718,2017-08-23T20:38:05Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
6vlo8d_2,6vlo8d,"My interpretation of the ending is that Candide and the rest of the gang are a lot happier when they stop worrying about the rest of the world and start minding their own damn business. You can also throw in something about being happiest when performing honest labour rather than yearning for riches.

Whether I agree with that moral or even think Voltaire was presenting it to us seriously is another matter. The rest of the story is heavily satirical, so what makes you think the ending isn't?

Cunégonde's ugliness serves to illustrate another point. Through much of the book, Cunégonde's beauty is the thing that propels Candide forward, but when he finally has her, she is not what he dreamt of. You might think of this as a variation of the proverb 'the grass is always greener on the other side'.

Cunégonde nonetheless becomes 'am excellent pastry chef'. Might we also take something from the now ugly woman creating something beautiful and delicious? 

Whatever your interpretation, it is always a bad idea to take *Candide* at face value.",satanspanties,2017-08-23T22:44:17Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,2
6vlo8d_3,6vlo8d,"The optimistic philosophy of Pangloss is essentially fatalistic. By viewing every situation as the best possible one, one is forced to be passive and accepting of events as they happen since there is no other rational alternative - whatever happens is the *ideal* result. For the majority of the book, the characters were subject to the whims of fate and chance and were just forced to accept it. However, the idea that ""we must cultivate our garden"" implies action and the ability to shape one's future. Active rather than reactive. I don't think the ending is good or bad, but simply introduces a shift in the way Candide views life. Feel free to correct me if I seemed to have misremembered anything - it's been a while!

6vlo8d_4,6vlo8d,"I for one think it's the best of all possible endings ;) but really to expand on r/mcahoon718 's point and you're view on the peice as a whole the work is most definitely a satire as Voltaire found such optimisic philosophy ridiculous. So at the end we get a tired ragged, used up group of travelers who despite their lowly end state seem to be relatively happy with it (i mean at least they were out of the path of storm and siege). I've always viewed the ending moral as an appropriation/expansion of Leibniz's philosophy. It was no easy task to argue against his position so Candide(not the sharpest tack to begin with) ends up concurring with such a strong logical point but on his own imposes that moral ( probably the smartest thing he's shown to do). Further I can't speak for Voltaire but I find a kind of consolition in the tension between this world being as perfect as can be but still needing active participants to engage it as they will. We can make the world better or worse and that seems to me like the best of all possibilities.",Pro_metheus,2017-08-23T22:13:10Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,4
6vlo8d_5,6vlo8d,"I think throughout the work, Voltaire looks positively on the men who actually take action in the world (Cacambo and Jacques), while making the flaws of overly optimistic or pessimistic philosophies apparent.(pangloss and Martin). Neither world view can present an accurate picture of the world. He also exposes the flaws of the philosophical man who is so consumed by his own thoughts/ limited world view, which leads him to taking no action other than talking.  

I think this all comes together at the end of candide, where the ""cultivate ones own garden"" aspect comes in. one must accept the nature of reality around him, which includes both good and bad aspects. For the most part, man is better off focusing on his limited surroundings, staying busy, avoiding fervor/ greed/ or even becoming too consumed with philosophical conjecture. 

At the same time Voltaire does not seem to advocate this as a universal solution, instead it is the best option for most men, most of the time. Admiring the men of action to an extent; it seems Voltaire acknowledges the necessity of action at times, BUT it might get you killed/ruin your life. 

Kinda relating to this, I really like the candide's thought process
following the question asking,' would it have been worse to endure all the miseries through which we passed, or to remain here doing nothing? '( the last couple pages)

AND Jacques philosophy ""Men must have corrupted nature a little, for they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves...""( a corrupting influence of society?)

Hopefully that was coherent, I'm tired",notsureifcelticfan,2017-08-24T04:07:14Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,5
6vlo8d_6,6vlo8d,"The tales seems to be a struggle between Panglosses ideologies and Martin's. Candide strikes a balance between complete Nihilism and Optimism. Essentially it's portrayed that Fatalism in all forms is dumb af and that all people can do is trying to take their own lives by the reins and make the most of their time.

So yeah, a good ending, in that Candide comes to terms with what's happened and will happen to him.

My project is on Voltaire's historical significance. I've started writing it about how his ideas changed opinions on religion in France thus leading to internal conflict. I understand that Candide represents many of his ideas but some of them are presented in a historical light (which would be hard for me to understand) and some are barely ever mentioned (like the fact that the book is a response to Leibniz’s ""La Monadologie""). I wanted to know a basic idea of symbolism in the book such as ""El Dorado was Voltaire's idea of the perfect religion"". 

In all fairness, if I had not said it was for a project, would that somehow have been better? I was really only trying to be honest by saying that. And you could have told me to clarify instead of just vaguely throwing it out there that this isn't the place to ask questions if they're pertaining to schoolwork.

tgz9z_6,tgz9z,"First, I apologize to *you* if I came off as a douchebag.  My initial answer was curt but I had thought it carried enough of an explanation, but it's clear now that this is not the case.  It certainly would not have been better if you lied.  My point is not about how to go about getting other people to do research for you, it's that *you* should really be the one doing the research or (I believe) you won't get any actual benefit out of it.  If that means going to an actual reference library, well, then, that's what it means.  If it means embarking on a Da Vinci Code-esque adventure seeking one of the world's foremost Candide scholars, that'd be cool too and you would probably learn a lot along the way.  I think that the general Internet, though, is not (yet!  I hope it is some day!) a great place to do research unless it's an actual school library online.  Some schools do have those.

Asking in r/books is not exactly a great idea, either.  Yes, someone may respond - but how do you know whoever is responding is right?  Maybe they got it wrong in school or when they read Candide but insist their perception is right.  Maybe they didn't read it at all and they're just mean redditors who want to screw with you by feeding you misinformation (redditors being mean???  preposterous, I know).  The Internet by and large cannot be trusted, really.

In my ""conversation"" with the kid who called me a douchebag and a dick, there was what I think is a key tip when asking for help in just about any situation, and in this reply you have at least partly used it: when you're asking a group of people who actually have no moral or legal obligation to help you, at *least* give them a solid indication that you tried on your own, but you're stuck on this key point, and maybe getting past that key point would get you on your way, something to that effect (does that make sense?).

As I mentioned to the Distinguished College Student from Canada, I actually can't materially help you on this particular question anyway, because I never had to read Candide, or read it on my own.  I have read a ton of books...way more outside of any school than in...but not that one.

31msqm_1,31msqm,"As I recall, the point of Candide was tempered optimism, or at least the rejection of unfettered optimism in the face of tragedy. I found that Voltaire was specifically satirizing Dr. Pangloss and his philosophy. I think the reader is supposed to see the absurdity of Dr. Pangloss' position when he is faced with reconciling his idealism (which is supposed to represent Leibnizian idealism) with the horrors of war and disaster and upheaval. To me it was an important book because it is my personal preference to think optimistically about the world, but this book helped keep me grounded and to not trivialize tragedy and those it affects with overzealous optimism. I have found that it helped to mature my feelings of seeing the glass half-full. Perhaps others have had a similar experience after reading. 

I think any book that criticizes a preference for seeing the world only with rose-colored glasses will be similar to Candide. Unfortunately none are coming to mind at the moment. 

And as far as I know Voltaire was an eclectic writer, but maintained similar themes throughout his works (advocating for free thinking and free expression). I'm sure if you read some of his other stuff you would enjoy it (I have not), but Candide is considered by many to be his magnum opus. Hope this was a little helpful.

You might want to seriously check out Jonathan Swift's work, especially *Gulliver's Travels* and *Tale of a Tub.* A lot of people don't know this, but Voltaire intentionally modeled himself after Swift. The others in the French tradition are La Fontane's *Fables*, which is a verse translation of fables from Aesop, Italian and Arabic sources, and Rabelais' *Gargantua and Pantangruel*, which is a satirical comedy about sixteenth century France with two giants as main characters. I think the very best example of the tradition would be *Don Quixote* itself.

Another, if you enjoyed the philosophical speeches, would be Samuel Johnson's *Rasselas.*

While one can read it without prior knowledge of the *Monadology*, it certainly does help knowing a little bit - at least in terms of background. I don't know what I would have thought of *Candide* if I hadn't read the *Monadology* first, but it's still hilarious. Plenty of bursting-out-in-laughter.",vanishingstar,2012-03-19T02:59:31Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,2
r2dzm_3,r2dzm,I read *Candide* without previously reading Leibniz's *Monadology*. I enjoyed it but I read it a few months ago and I feel like it is just sinking in. Now that I know about *Monadology* I will read it and give *Candide* another try. Thanks for the information! ,natiice,2012-03-19T20:42:28Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,3
r2dzm_4,r2dzm,"The *Monadology* is a philosophy text, and while it is strange and unusual, it's not a particularly difficult work to grasp. Hopefully it'll make your reading experience of *Candide* more fleshed-out and interesting!",vanishingstar,2012-03-19T22:58:24Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,4
b1081_1,b1081,"You know, as much as I support it being shown in areas where the public can hear about it, I am not really sure why people care so much about anniversaries of things.  It seems like a very superficial way to add meaning.  Having more people studying and appreciating Candide on a regular basis seems more appropriate.",flaran,2010-02-12T03:48:32Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
6d4l4y_1,6d4l4y,"Looking at my copy (the 2007 GF Flammarion édition avec dossier), there doesn't appear to be any rhyme scheme. It's just presented as a regular novella. Goldzink's introduction also doesn't appear to make any reference to *Candide* rhyming, but I only leafed through it.",JadedEconomist,2017-05-24T21:04:01Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
6d4l4y_2,6d4l4y,">I have a copy of Candide in French back in the States that has a rhyme scheme throughout, which AFAIK (not much) wouldn't be too far off from the nature of the novella.

You might be looking at a dramatic adaptation. The original doesn't have rhymes, and the pronunciation hasn't shifted *too* significantly to allow it. Plus, the book was notorious on its first release for being a model of prose and a break from Voltaire's poetic works.",LiterallyAnscombe,2017-05-25T05:40:16Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,2
1rol8a_1,1rol8a,"I have read the original French and a few English translations of Candide. I've always taken the end as Pangloss refusing to let go of the idea that ""this is best of all possible worlds"" and therefore ""everything is for the best."" Candide then tells him they must cultivate their garden. Their garden, while literal, could also mean their lives and so they are the ones who must care for it since they do not live in the best of all possible worlds.",DorothyofKansas,2013-12-01T02:16:03Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
1rol8a_2,1rol8a,"To the best of my knowledge, Candide is the response to the Leibniz's Optimism which, as you have, probably, guessed says that of all the possible worlds, we live in the best one. I have always understood this to be the abandoning of that idea and concentrating on more practical issues which are at hand- like the Turkish man did. May be wrong, though.

1e4vg5_1,1e4vg5,"It's been a while since I read it, and I won't have the best insights, but I'll try to say what I can. First, it's fairly faced paced, short and easy to read. Second it riffs on a philosophy that, if I'm not mistaken, Leibniz proposed or popularized, which is that because God is omnipotent and benevolent this world must be the best out of all the possible worlds that He could create. Pangloss, whose name translates to ""all talk"" from Greek, I think, signifies the insubstantiality of the philosophy that Candide unquestioningly adopts. Throughout the novel varying catastrophes occur, which are far from the best of all possibilities. That's part of the satirical aspect, I think. (Candide thinks he lives in the best kingdom parallels the best world.) The humor is the naivete of Candide and also puns and just humorous scenarios. As to puns, at the book's beginning, there's a quip about an overweight queen, I think, who weighs in considerably in all discussions. I'd like to say more about the book, but I've forgotten a lot of it. I even forget the significance of tending to the garden. I'm pretty sure that other things are satirized, but the best of all possible worlds thing is the running theme. I don't think it's extraordinarily deep by today's standards, though it would've been somewhat shocking in its day. It's entertaining, concerns philosophical issues, and addresses those issues with irony.

2qit91_1,2qit91,"One of my favourites!! A short, hilarious read. Keep it mind it is a criticism of Leibniz's philosophy that God created this world as the best of all possible worlds. And then enjoy the stupid, but strikingly poignant, adventure of Candide and Martin (who if I'm not mistaken represents Voltaire, I may be wrong I'm very drunk right now). I recommend this book to practically everyone! Happy readings!! ",Napoleon_icecream,2014-12-27T11:43:08Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
2qit91_2,2qit91,"Well, it's entirely too late for this now, but I think this question is flawed.

Now that people have described the book to you, you no longer have the clean-slate, objective perspective you once did. Now the experience of reading the book will be entirely different and quite possibly less impactful.

Once you have finished reading *Candide*, go read Zelazny's *Lord of Light* without getting advance knowledge of the book, and compare the two reading experiences.",,2014-12-27T17:23:06Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,2

3sppdd_2,3sppdd,"*Candide* is a must read. It's one of those books from which so many ideas have passed into the language. Candide himself is an archetypal ingenu character.

mx30b_1,mx30b,"I agree, way too many people on the internet are cynical and blasé pricks who dont like or enjoy anything.

And, by the way Candide is amazing, it's the original South Park. It is ridiculously modern, and even trough some of the political themes in the story have.... changed in the last few hundreds of years, it's still hillarious.

It's really a trip trough a satirical 18th century; where the church, nobles, leaders are ridiculously corrupt. And the ""You Know, I Learned Something Today"" in the end is still true; Work is what makes someone live a good, happy life in the end.",,2011-12-02T16:30:37Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Candide,1
