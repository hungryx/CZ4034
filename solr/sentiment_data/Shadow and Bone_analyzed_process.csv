p9nc76_1,p9nc76,"I absolutely loved the books.

And I absolutely ADORE the changes that have been made for the series. 

Shadow and Bone suffers mainly from being entirely in Alina's head. It is too big and vast of a world to be seen only from one perspective. The show does this, and as the books move away from single-person perspective, they get MUCH better.",Micchi,2021-08-22T23:57:39Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,1
p9nc76_2,p9nc76,"I agree with everything you said. I actually hated shadow and bone and never continued the series. I felt like the characters were bad and paper thin. Mal was the most boring character I’ve ever read. But I loved his relationship with Alina in the show.

However!! six of crows and its sequel are AMAZING. I cannot begin to explain how much I enjoyed these books and the characters’ depth. Its fascinating that both series were written by the same author and put together in one tv show lol.
If you havent already please give six of crows a chance.",,2021-08-23T02:37:17Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,2
p9nc76_3,p9nc76,"The show has a great setting. High fantasy steampunk? I'm so there.  

And it's literally two stories. Shadow and Bone is a YA love-triangle power-tripping fantasy that falls into so many horrible YA tropes trying to be the next Twilight. Six of Crows is a D&D-esque crew performing escapades. Reminds me a lot of Firefly, which was 100% the producer's Traveler campaign come to life. It falls HARD into some bad D&D pitfalls like power balance, selectively caring about the law and reputation, and obvious perk balance, but it's a fun romp.  The two stories do NOT interact.  The set, costumes, and camerawork are seriously on-point. I'm not surprised at all that the story with Mal and Alina isn't great. The plot and characters on that side are ridiculous.

Why the hell are they using skiffs? Those only work in salt-flats. In the show, we can clearly see hills and mountains prior to the wall coming up. But the plot reveals it's location is just happenstance so it really doesn't make any sense.

Mal gets shot/stabbed/injured so many times and seemingly walks it off it gets ridiculous. Plot-armor to an extreme.",noonemustknowmysecre,2021-08-23T07:23:29Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,3
p9nc76_4,p9nc76,Strongly disagree. Mainly because they combined shadow and bone with six of crows. I loved six of crows so much and I wasn’t happy with the portrayal of Kaz in the show.,OrangePekoe28,2021-08-23T05:26:16Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,4
p9nc76_5,p9nc76,"So, people have already discussed in here how the subsequent book series are a vast improvement on shadow and bone. I thought we could discuss how the writers choice to blend shadow and bone and 6 of crows is going to lead to an unbelievably strong trilogy for the show. 

Essentially, they built a little backstory for kaz, inej, and jesper while letting nina and matthias play through their drama, all with the anticipation it would tee up 6 of crows in the show, which is a GREAT counterpart to a rather boring second offering from alina and mal. Ultimately what we get from netflix will be a crazy intense third season where they are simultaneously fending off the darkling and civil war for ravka while relying on the proceeds of kaz's upheaval in kerch. It plays so much better mixed in this way instead of the original chronological order.",nbd9000,2021-08-23T16:08:05Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,5
p9nc76_6,p9nc76,"So glad to hear. I loved Six of Crows obviously but nothing about Shadow and Bone sounded interesting to me at all, I almost didn't even watch the Netflix show. I found it enjoyable enough that I considered reading the books, just to get extra lore tidbits, so I'm glad I ultimately decided not to.",pagesofKenna,2021-08-23T17:04:28Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,6
p9nc76_7,p9nc76,"Honestly, skip the Shadow and Bone series and go straight to Six of Crows. 

Shadow and Bone was very bland to me and I didn’t personally like any of the characters quite as much as I did in the show. It’s also kind of unfortunate that you only view things from Alina’s perspective. Also, I’m very glad that I wasn’t the only one who found Alina and Mal to be a lot like Katniss and Gale, lol. 

Six of Crows has multiple narrators and the characters are much more developed and morally grey in many areas which make them more interesting. The fact that it outlines multiple perspectives is also very cool because you hear the characters inner thoughts directly contradicting what the character will say in some scenes which is amazing. I highly recommend.",gwilymystery,2021-08-23T05:21:23Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,7

p9nc76_9,p9nc76,"I didn't love the Shadow and Bone trilogy, but absolutely adore the other books in the universe. Bardugo noticably matures as a writer.

p9nc76_10,p9nc76,"I hated the show, but I was comparing it to Six of Crows. I hadn't read Shadow and Bone at the time and I regret picking it up after.

p9nc76_11,p9nc76,"This is fair criticism, but like others have said, Leigh Bardugo's growth as a writer is evident in the 2 series after this. Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom are both fantastic. I also really enjoyed King of Scars and Rule of Wolves. Both of those are easily far above Shadow and Bone for me. 

Ninth House is very different (technically a horror book) but it is also really good.",AllDayGinger,2021-08-23T13:40:58Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,11
p9nc76_12,p9nc76,"To be honest, I haven't yet seen the show. I did really enjoy the original trilogy when I read it - good worldbuilding just kills me in the best way. Bardugo's writing gets better with each subsequent novel - she's a powerhouse! I loved Shadow and Bone but her newer stuff is more nuanced overall.",Phaethuuusa,2021-08-23T15:54:28Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,12
p9nc76_13,p9nc76,"I have to admit, six of crows HAS to be one of the best duologies ever made and out on paper (my opinion) and it speaks for itself when many people didn't continue reading shadow and bone after book one. I like the idea of shadow and bone series being with both storylines and characters, since I did enjoy the gang a lot more than Alina's plot, it was just simply *less* entertaining. Also I didn't tho imagine characters in my head like they were in the show and I definitely sensed some changes since they differ from the official art very much, but that's my personal disliking and isn't even that bad tbh.",Few_Image913,2023-03-14T09:40:12Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,13

p9nc76_15,p9nc76,I've just finished listening to Shadow and Bone and started the next one.  The show is definitely better as it weaves in so much more of what is happening in the story.

p9nc76_20,p9nc76,"I read Six of Crows and sequel and liked them well enough. I tried Shadow and Bone and really didn't like it. Six is a little YA, but not nearly as much as SAB. So, maybe give Six a try. If you don't like it part way through, put it down and don't look back.

Also, if you read Six, I would age up the characters like five years in your head or its less believable.

Edit: misread your comment. Thought you meant put Crows on hold as in skip them. Not that you meant put it on hold at the library. Oops.",Tortuga917,2021-08-23T01:35:52Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,20

p9nc76_24,p9nc76,"I feel like it's because she had different priorities. I really didn't care for any of the Shadow and Bone series I tried, and I didn't love the writing in KOS, but I found the character writing to be leagues over SaB even if it was still immature. The characters weren't that deep but there were some fun moments that I still remember, so I feel like she sacrificed developing as a writer to make these memorable moments.",LevarBurgers,2021-08-23T21:07:38Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,24

18oqlo5_2,18oqlo5,yeah the plot for the Shadow and Bone trilogy was kind of basic YA but i still enjoyed it. but agree with the other commenters that the Six of Crows duology and King of Scars were really good. the TV adaptation of Shadow and Bone was quite fun too but i wouldn’t jump into that if you haven’t yet because it might contain spoilers for the other books,kaydaaawg,2023-12-23T01:44:35Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,2
18oqlo5_3,18oqlo5,SHADOW AND BONE ARE MY FAVORITE BOOKS EVER. Leigh Bardugo hooks you in with an amazing story and I think the books got better and better with the 3rd one being the best.

n0e5vn_1,n0e5vn,"I found Shadow and Bone similarly addictive, although I think her writing was a bit juvenile. That said, I recently read Six of Crows (which is another Grishaverse book that takes place chronologically after the S&B trilogy) and it was fantastic! Her growth as a writer was very clear, and the character feel far more realistic. If this is the style of book that you're into, I would recommend Strange the Dreamer by Laini Taylor.",,2021-04-29T17:09:16Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,1

n0e5vn_3,n0e5vn,"I really enjoyed Grishaverse even though I find the Shadow and Bone trilogy is the weakest installment. 

I feel the first POV limited character growth and world-building, but I still found the story engaging. It was a little onto the YA side, but since I usually enjoy YA tropes, I wasn't overly bothered by it. 

The two subsequent duologies are both really great and better-written showing how the author has grown. They introduce the third POV and they allow the expansion for some characters which I appreciated.",IceXence,2021-04-29T02:59:47Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,3

n0e5vn_7,n0e5vn,"I binged the show then read the first book all in the last couple of days so I’m with you on the addicted train! The show combines the stories in  the shadow and bone trilogy with the six of crows books, so if you want to know everything with the side characters before you watch you’ll probably want to read six of crows first.

n0e5vn_8,n0e5vn,If you care about spoilers for six of crows then I would recommend reading it before watching the show - as far as I’m aware it combines shadow and bone with the first six of crows book (or prequel to?) as congruent story lines.

11ve8cy_1,11ve8cy,"Absolutely with you there. 
My intro to the Grishaverse was through Six of Crows which was incredible. Her world building and character work truly started shining after the Shadow and Bone trilogy IMO but the show basically takes on all these story lines together to make something unique and loyal to the overall story.
The show keeps the books' very strong YA elements but for folks who wanted to see their fave characters brought to the screen it's definitely worth a watch.",lawlesslead,2023-03-19T08:55:17Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,1
11ve8cy_2,11ve8cy,"Shadow and Bone is definitely the weakest series of the ones in the Grishaverse but I feel like a lot of the following series need the world-building in S & B to understand what’s going on. However, I read the series like 8 years ago so I don’t remember it that well and I refuse to reread it with how much it’s been criticized in the last few years so I don’t tarnish my impression of it",ShakespearesSister12,2023-03-19T09:23:53Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,2
11ve8cy_3,11ve8cy,"The shadow and bone trilogy is kinda boring. I enjoyed it, because I found it mindless and easy to get into during the pandemic, but Alina can definitely get annoying. Mal is one of my favorite characters, but I see where you’re coming from.

I despise that there was a love triangle (or would it be a square?), and find the Mal vs Darkling vs Nikolai discussion amongst the fandom exhausting. 

I feel like it’s worth finishing if you feel like it. Six of Crows is amazing, so you have that to look forward to. Also, there’s a duology that I’m spacing on the name of right now, that’s pretty good too.

Alina and Mal can get annoying, but David, Genya, Zoya, and Nikolai makes it easier to get through. Also, if you keep reading, you can look forward to one of the most romantic monologues in book history by one >!very socially awkward Durast!<.

dd6tjh_1,dd6tjh,"Just to toss my two cents in here on Bardugo. I'm really not a big YA fan, but I do dip into it from time to time. And, while I found that her Shadow and Bone books were totally forgettable generic YA, I also found that I really liked her Six of Crows duology. It has some YA tropes, but it mixes it more into a fun ""team heist"" setting. More like YA fantasy mashed into Oceans 11. Where the focus is less on a love triangle and more on a team of wildly different personalities, pulling together, busting each others' chops, and getting the job done. So I'm cautiously optimistic to try this.",TheFightingFishy,2019-10-04T13:40:21Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Shadow and Bone,1
