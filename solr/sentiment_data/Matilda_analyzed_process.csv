52a8qo_6,52a8qo,"She seems extremely well adjusted for what she went through. It's heartwarming that a child actor in such an endearing role could go through so much in her personal and professional life, as well as aging out, and come to grips with it.

Instead of turning to self-destructive cycles directly (drugs, crime) she turned to minor self-sabotage while still pursuing education.

Gotta say, lotta props to her. 

Also on Danny Devito, thinking back, he did an amazing job of coming off like a douche, but if you look for it, you can see with his interactions with Matilda that none of it is actually directed at her.

I suppose to put it another way, he managed to play an asshat role, without actually coming off that way to the child actress he was working with. That's kind of impressive, and there is that bit of air about him even when he's ranting in the movie.",Xenjael,2016-09-12T04:33:40Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,6

I read it around the same time my parents split and I lived with my dad. I had a good childhood, but I really identified with Matilda for some reason and even though I'd read other Dahl books and knew they were fiction, I just *believed* that a power akin to The Force was real and that I was special enough to have control over it.

They like Matilda, a sweet, innocent little girl (and unless your a pedo, that shouldn't be very ""beautiful"" in your sense.) Nor is this a problem only for whites. Actors of all races can be less liked than what they play. Not nessecarily a problem you'd want to have if you don't want to be seen as a fictional character rather than an actual person.

kae8u8_1,kae8u8,"Absolutely! The entire Matilda movie (and book) is so wholesome and comforting, especially during times I may have felt left out, it helps to see characters fall in love with books like that and to know that there will always be people who care and friends to make. I think Hermoine's studious and ambitious nature in Harry Potter is a lovely characteristic to add into a children's book, especially as you see it all pay off during moments of crisis when she uses her knowledge to help. I love the library scenes in the Harry Potter books and movies. Also I haven't read it yet but I hear *The Shadow of The Wind* is a lovely book about books so I can't wait to experience that :)",bookishjasminee,2020-12-10T12:18:58Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,1

kae8u8_4,kae8u8,"There’s debate about the quality of this movie but I don’t care, The Pagemaster falls into this same category for me. 

As an early age bookworm Matilda was a big one for me too. Also Beauty and the Beast which was already mentioned. Those library moments are intense frisson for me. 

But The Pagemaster is literally an entire movie about a kid being saved by books. It slides from live action into animated and the books help lead cartoon Macaulay Culkin through the adventures and horrors within the library. It feels like an adult's love letter to a library that was there for them in childhood. It still makes me happy at 29.",happy_dance,2020-12-10T14:21:27Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,4

The librarian is ancient and looks very scary, I'm sure to a young child especially, and then she quickly appraises the situation and kindly introduces Matilda to literature.  It's tender, heartbreaking, and hopeful all at the same time.  As a little gay boy in a rural town I could totally relate, tho the movie didn't come out until I was a teenager, I instantly loved it.  My 5yo neighbor, who's been trapped all year because of covid, asked for movie recommendations and this was my pick for her.",pseudocultist,2020-12-10T13:58:13Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,6

I wanted to be like her, in a way. I would go to the library and borrow a mountain of books to go home with. As I grew up, I realized I would never be able to fully be like Matilda but nonetheless found her and Ms. Honey to be absolutely courageous and brilliant. 

Another movie that sort of fed into my bibliophilic young life was The Pagemaster. The different genres coming to life the way they did and the adventures they had were mesmerizing. I was also quite the fantasy lover at this point so this movie really added on to that. 

Another movie that fed into my fantasy side was The Neverending Story. This one made me look around my library for old books that may send me a dragon like Falkor.",infernoVI_42,2020-12-11T02:51:59Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,24

Perhaps because I read it as a teenager, when its positive lessons seemed childishly obvious (""books are good!""), so I can't relate to the feeling of finding some hidden recognition in it, I only see the flaws.

The story's characters are a textbook case of unimaginative contrasts, the absolutes of good and evil. The heroine and her teacher are purely good, kind, and smart, but are treated horribly anyway. The parents and the principal are violently cruel, corrupt, stupid, and criminal. There's just no nuance whatsoever. How do heartless idiot parents raise an angelic genius child??

What's worse, is that whenever the evil characters get their comeuppance, the reader is supposed to enjoy their pain. 'Torture is bad - unless the torturers get tortured, in which case it's great!' It's a bizarre and unpleasant world where everyone practices some form of violence and dishonesty, but because the protagonists are smart and good, by divine fiat, their victory is celebrated.",eisagi,2020-12-10T18:35:24Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,27

v9nxdx_3,v9nxdx,"Matilda was my favourite Roald Dahl work as a kid and even now, it's still my favourite of his. Through it all, I think Dahl was trying to express the value of children and the sanctity of childhood. He has a gift for writing stories that side with the way children see the world. That's why a common Dahl troupe is of the parental/adult figures being nutcases and lunatics whilst the children are portrayed as clever and wise. Furthermore, he really gets across the importance of retaining your child-like sensibilities in adulthood. A reminder that it's okay to imagine and dream and to be scared of the things that terrify you. 

Matilda is very British in the anti-authoritarian sentimentalities of the characters and plot. To me, it sort of encapsulates the 70s punk flavour and message of ""Another Brick in the Wall"" by Pink Floyd. The criticism of schools being oppressive places that stifle creativity and corrupt bright, innocent children is probably why I gravitated to this story as a rebellious kid myself 😆 

Matilda the Musical is absolutely brilliant as a musical adaptation. I actually think it's a better adaptation than the 90s film because it nailed the ""Britishness"" of the novel. As much as I loved the film as a child, it's too ""American"" and didn't have that anti-authoritarian rebellion associated with British school kids. On the other hand, the musical nailed that unique, cultural identity. I recommend listening to ""revolting children"", ""the smell of rebellion"" and ""school song"" to get a taste.",i_bardly_knew_ye,2022-06-11T08:21:07Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,3

v9nxdx_10,v9nxdx,"I think one of the most powerful translations from the book to the musical is that the song “Quiet” really makes it plain that her power comes from her *anger.* Just before she makes something move for the first time, she sings:

“But this noise becomes anger and the anger is light 

And its burning inside me would usually fade

But it isn't today

And the heat and the shouting

And my heart is pounding

And my eyes are burning

And suddenly everything, everything is
Quiet”

I love that. I love that she’s got this righteous anger at her mistreatment, because kids don’t get a say in how they’re treated by adults. Matilda is the ultimate reclamation of power.",ScathachRises,2022-06-11T13:12:08Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,Matilda,10
