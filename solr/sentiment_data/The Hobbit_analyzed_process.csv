ghbu2d_36,ghbu2d,"I see three titles coming uo in this thread constantly. I just finished reading the Hobbit to my daughter, and we watched TLOTR later. The Hobbit is a great book. The LOTR is one of the best I've ever read. It is interesting, page-turner, but also deep and multilayered. It is also a case study in the nature of human evil (Smeagol/Gollum). 

I loved the Dark Tower, up until half of the last book. Then I hated it, not because the ending disappointed me, buz because it was, in my view, bad, rushed writting. The ending is no better than how I finished short stories I was trying to write when I was 12. 

The Dune is good, when I was younger I considered it amazing, but as I tried to reread it a year ago, I realized that it wasn't hald as good as I remembered.

I read them as an old teen and it took me ages to get past the Hobbit. The ideal audiance for these books was obsviously meant to be children. Tolkien describes the surrounding area and the nature soo damn much it makes you feel like you are reading the script to a nature documentary. 

After I read it I tried to read the first book from the box set and gave up. I was disappointed because I bought the box set and the hobbit and expected to read them all. I ended up giving them to a couple of friends who also came to the same conclusion. The last two books of the trilogy are still prestine because nobody opened them.

I felt like the attempts to raise the stakes up to LotR’s level (something about Smaug maybe joining the forces of darkness in the war he sees coming?  I don’t quite remember now) actually had the opposite effect.  The reason that The Hobbit always works for me is because it is *not* an overtly heroic story.  These are people off on an adventure that is not lofty or tied to the fate of the world.  There’s a sense that Bilbo could go off and get himself killed in a place that his neighbors have never heard of, and that it would matter very little to the world, and that sense of *being* small, not only physically but influentially, is such a big part of why that story reaches me in a way that LotR never did.

You'll be amazed at how much comprehension 6-8 year olds can handle.


I wouldn't trade doing that for anything. What a great experience for them, as well as my wife and I. If you read to children they will learn to not see it as a chore. When they are old enough, it is almost just as essential that you listen raptly as they start reading back to you. We started reading the Potter series to them, and by Order of the Phoenix they began reading them back to us. I've actually never read HBP and TDH...but I have had them read to me.

I know now that it was some kind of classics series that my grandmother picked up somewhere as it had books from people like Mark Twain in it.

But one book had a name that made me want to see what it was about. In little gold letters were the words ""The Hobbit"". Out of boredom I began to read. I started mid morning and only stopped due to having to re-read some portions or words because I had a limited vocabulary or because I had to come eat dinner. I finished the book that night somewhere well after midnight and before dawn.

ais5iq_6,ais5iq,"This has been the first r/books thread I could actually give my two cents in as I’m currently reading Return of the King, and am loving every second of it. 

A huge thing I noticed is that it’s about 90% easier to read The Hobbit than it is to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and for good reason. The Hobbit is the *perfect* introduction to Middle-Earth: you get to see all the races of the world and learn their special talents, you get the classic quest of venturing to slay a dragon (not to imagine the excitement of learning the thing talks), and its language is generally simple enough for even a child to be able to immerse themselves in it. 

Then comes the Lord of the Rings. As you read it you can tell this has been Tolkien’s magnum opus. An artfully worded and masterfully detailed telling of the most crucial times to happen in Middle-Earth. It’s honestly incredible how seriously you take the events that are happening and how easily you can imagine them. This series is one of my biggest recommendations.  

Like a few said this series is a great way to learn and really feel like you know English. It’s written in a way that feels like centuries ago. I actually have a a page in the notes app of my phone for every new word Tolkien teaches me. 

Tolkien’s method of story telling is literally genre-founding material. Of course the fantasy genre has been around for centuries but Tolkien’s world of Middle-Earth set the bar. Hell, it created the bar. 

I’m sorry, I just got excited when I saw I book that I love finally get a thread. My favorite part of The Hobbit has to be “Riddles in the Dark” when we first meet Gollum, and first encounter the One True Ring, with absolutely no idea what is to come.",MrCool87867,2019-01-23T05:52:34Z,1,1.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,6

The Hobbit or LOTR movies spent a lot of time building up and having massive battles, when the battles in the book were merely mentioned in a single paragraph.

Some could argue for each, but both are good in their own way, the movies made the storyline more consistent throughout with less downtime between drama or important events, and cutting out and changing useless plot lines added (specifically in the end of the LOTR books).

I wouldent suggest being a movie hater or a book hater like most on these subjects, each are good in their own way, the movies are more action packed, drama filled, and straightforward, the books spent a lot more time on smaller plot lines and events and explained them much more deeply.

I speculate this is because The Hobbit is more linear and, comparitively, faster paced than The Lord of the Rings - as the vocabulary is not that much different between the two.

I'm fairly certain it was his first foray into middle-earth, so hand holding is also expected to a degree, but Tolkien was a stickler for details.

It's also easy to go go in deep when explaining things, he did go on to create a fictional universe, complete with languages and a litany of backstories explaining the origin of that world with stories that predate the events of the hobbit by several thousand years.

He borrowed a few things from the larger mythology (Elrond, name-dropping Gondolin, etc.) when writing The Hobbit, but didn't consciously merge them until he started writing LotR.

One of my goals for the year is to read The History of Middle Earth, which is a twelve volume series following the evolution of Tolkien’s mythology, so I’ve just learned a lot about this specific topic.

What we see when we read The Silmarillion has its beginnings in writings Tolkien began writing almost 20 years before The Hobbit. He was a solider during WWI and still in his 20s when he started working on what we know as Middle Earth. The first two volumes of the series are known as The Book of Lost Tales (Tolkien’s original name for what he would eventually title The Silmarillion). Interestingly enough, Christopher Tolkien claims in the commentary that he began work on the HoME series to combat the widespread belief that The Silmarillion was a late work or the product of Christopher taking too many liberties with leftover material.

In reality, Tolkien had a well-developed world before he ever began writing the LOTR! It’s vey interesting, but definitely not going to be everyone’s cup of tea.",retrogamer_wv,2019-01-23T03:50:25Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,98

* Men (of the lake) are primarily concerned with politics and how to stay rich and in power
* Hobbits are a bunch of bumbling and narrow-minded country bumpkins

The whole story is essentially about how a couple of exceptional (and very untypical) individuals (Brand, Bilbo, Barin, Elrond, Gandalf) are stepping past their shadow to make things happen, once they are forced to do so. And even then, they have plenty of warts and issues.

The only thing I could think of was this tone was struck in contrast to Bilbo's ability to adapt, so it is a plot device needed for the protagonist. The hobbit has a home he thinks he is tied to, but really he's bored and finds out more about himself on an adventure. The dwarves are on an adventure and desperate for a home to plunk down in, hating every minute of the journey.

ho1gj8_14,ho1gj8,"huh. on the one hand you're right, on the other: it's a children's book that has been written to entertain Tolkien's children. If the dwarves would have been able to slay the dragon themselves there would have been not storyline in the beginning. and yes, Thorin and all the other dwarves had to make their living not as warriors but rather as some kind of salesmen. and everyone had to be a bit clumsy and incompetent to make the story line work. In my opinion you can feel that when the adult parts get into the story - the one ring and Gollum's fate, Beorn and his powers and of course, Bilbo's act of betraying Thorin for his own good, Gandalf who had to disappear sometime soon so that noone could think of him slaying the dragon and solving the problem. also: I guess Lake-town had to burn down because Bard should not be the glorious hero, but also a broken man who lost all. it was never the intention of Tolkien to contribute to the big heroic stuff but to the ""even the smallest people can make the difference"" storyline.

the fun thing is that it turns around in the Lord of the Rings: everyone does his best and the hobbits are now the clumsy people. the rest: warriors, sometimes professional trained killing machines (you remember one of the first scenes of the movie? those long lines of Elvish soldiers with precise movements, killing a second before they themselves are getting killed)",ssaminds,2020-07-09T14:58:41Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,14

ho1gj8_16,ho1gj8,"Well, Tolkien understood that not everyone in your story can be wise and good, because among other reasons, it makes the people who you really want to highlight as being wise and good appear ordinary by comparison. In The Hobbit, Gandalf and Elrond are the unambiguously virtuous heroes (and you can add in Aragorn and Faramir in LoTR), to which the rather selfish and dimwitted dwarves serve as a contrast.

Finally, and most importantly, Bilbo can't be portrayed as a reluctant Hero if the dwarves are competent, bold, and decisive. Then he really would have been just a tag-along burglar, with no real importance to the story, and no means by which to rise in the dwarves' esteem. It's the same reason that the government is either incompetent or corrupt in action movies. If the FBI in Die Hard had been competent, there's no need for John McClane to go on a rampage to save everyone. If Lestrade is a good detective, Sherlock Holmes is just a snarky drug addict.

Also, I'm not sure if I'd describe the dwarves as bellends, they're just... normal. People acting in self-interest, and avoiding risks is completely rational, and mostly how people behave in the real world. Thorin's particular case of gold-madness is arguably the worst of their deeds, and that's a device used to dramatize the approach of the final battle, as well as to hammer home one of the Hobbit's moral themes.",DeadFyre,2020-07-09T16:17:15Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,16

Creatures like Dwarves and Hobbits are long-lived and intensely creative and crafty, but ultimately greedy, self-interested and unwilling to sacrifice anything for the benefit of anyone in the world outside their immediate environment. Elves are essentially immortal, physically powerful and agile, and control sophisticated magical and psychic powers, and much more in tune with nature, but they ultimately have the same failing, they are self-interested and unwilling to fight for an ultimate morality  on behalf of what they see as inferior beings. The message I got from the Hobbit/LOTR is that these peoples can't succeed against an evil force like Sauron without the leadership, self-sacrifice, and moral compass of humans, flawed though they may be.

In many respects, the Christian bias of the authors of works like these shows through, given the historical contexts of European colonization of the world, where the ""noble savage"" is respected for his strength, craft, and bond with nature, while being in need of the ""civilized"" man's moral code, or in the context of these stories, the underdog humans, who are inherently noble and imbued with a manifest destiny they have yet to achieve.

ho1gj8_41,ho1gj8,"It's fascinating. 
[Here's a good link to conclusive research on this.](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/513824?casa_token=4NOu51ZU8kcAAAAA:UkfwO56U73gcKkdpOWw2rs5l2PsjBdc6yBIJHpymBrQxv_PSppZdH4M7TK8ndXy07sZCaMAUhA)

Tolkien consciously modeled dwarves after Jews, especially in the Hobbit. He wasn't the first to do this (e.g. Wagner in Ring of the Nibelung) and his use of negative stereotypes in doing so was far from the most problematic (again, see Wagner).

Some of the positive or neutral aspects of Tolkien using Jews as a model for dwarves:

- The dwarves' displacement from Misty Mountain was modeled after the Jewish displacement into diaspora.

- The Dwarven language was modeled after Hebrew, especially its blocky alphabet, ever-present use of three-consonant roots, and use of guttural sounds. The dwarven word ""Khazad"" is an excellent example of this.

Some of the negative aspects:

- A stereotype for avarice and obsession with wealth.

- Stereotypes for cowardice and whining.

As /u/mahoganyecho points out, the Dwarves in Tolkien's writing evolved as he learned more about Jews and the way that Nazi and racist ideologies of his time misrepresented them. That's part of why Gimli in LOTR is depicted as a noble, brave character who explicitly turns away from the material greed of the dwarves Tolkien had created earlier in his career.",hurhurdedur,2020-07-09T17:29:16Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,41

I took a class on Tolkien and this was one of our points of discussion. Our professor made it clear that the characterization of the dwarves in *The Hobbit* is anti-semitic, but he also pointed out that Tolkien realized the issue and attempted to address it via Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings*.

Gimli’s characterized as a much different sort than Thorin and the other dwarves. His moment with Galadriel (where he asks for a lock of her hair) shows that he’s not at all greedy and instead appreciative of beauty. His relationship with Legolas also showcases him as unbiased or at least shows willingness on his part to check his prejudices.

It was just nice to learn that though Tolkien’s prejudices were clear in *The Hobbit* he at least attempted to work against them through Gimli in the main series.",cae37,2020-07-09T17:53:20Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,42

It was when Tolkien went to write *The Lord of the Rings* that Sauron took form as the principal antagonist of that work and more firmly as a secondary to Melkor in the entire legendarium.

The jokes about Gimli, as far as I can remember, are largely light-hearted and have nothing to do with anything that could be construed as a Jewish stereotype, though. And it isn’t Gimli working out his prejudice for elves, it’s Gimli and Legolas working out their respective prejudices against each other’s people - a long-standing prejudice based on ancient grievances. Moreover, we find out that the Dwarves are difficult to corrupt and proved resistant to the effects of the seven rings, very much unlike humans. Tolkien depicts dwarves as noble, kind, and creative as often as greedy and prideful (traits which are neither restricted only to the dwarves).

>	Its not outright negative, but there is a kind of paternalism to the idea that, if they just stayed in diaspora and learned to get along with elves and humans, they'd be better off.

This bit reminds me of high school English classes where I learned that you can make almost any text “mean” almost anything by creatively interpreting carefully selected minor details. And that message is completely at odds with the reclamation of the Lonely Mountain, and the fact that the Dwarves ultimately did reclaim Moria after Sauron’s defeat.

I would argue that you’re nibbling at, and misrepresenting, a small portion of a much larger theme of LoTR: that overcoming the differences between people is key to peace and prosperity. There are elements of this all throughout the Hobbit, LoTR, and Tolkien’s other works, both between different races and between different factions within a given race. 

Tolkien didn’t write races without flaws. Even the elves and the gods of his world were flawed, and Iluvatar prompted Melkor to sing discordantly in the song of creation.

The concept of “sharing a book” isn’t foreign; in fact I think many would reason just the opposite: there’s so many thousands of wonderful books out there (no doubt there are other books OP adores too), so why pick one that you have such a history with, with an ex? Find another book to read to him, have him read the hobbit on his own. There’s literally endless options.

What OP and her partner are doing is reasonable, but it’s equally very reasonable for people to not want to do sentimental things with their current partner that they used to do with an ex.

The LOTR is a mess by comparison, and not nearly as well written either.

vhkqw7_52,vhkqw7,"I'm not surprised Tolkien wasn't the first, I didn't think it would go back as far as the Romans though.

After looking up Miles Gloriosus, I think I'd categorize that a little differently. If I'm reading this correctly, a character appears on stage and becomes the narrator of the story. The audience knows it's a character telling them a story.

In most stories, it's not a character telling you the story and you have every reason to assume everything you're reading is exactly what happened to the characters. In LOTR it's a surprise to find out  that the story you're reading is an in-universe book written by Bilbo and Frodo. It's a pretty different effect when you have no clue it was possible that you were being misled by someone.

BTW I'm also curious if Tolkien planned for that to be the case the entire time, or if it was a late addition. Knowing this and re-reading it, it seems to be planned the whole time. Most of the story is told from the POV of the hobbits, which is naturally who Bilbo and Frodo would be able to get the most information from.

The parts where hobbits aren't present (like Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's journey together) seem to include fewer details about what the characters are feeling. Aragorn and Legolas are portrayed as nearly perfect people while Gimli seems more relatable... it feels like Frodo and the hobbits must have spent a lot more time getting to hear the parts of the story they missed from Gimli, than from Aragorn or Legolas.",chocoboat,2022-06-22T10:00:17Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,52

Yes and no. In this case Wikipedia is correct in their claim, but using a rather weak quote to prove it. In other places, Tolkien is far less ambiguous; Hobbits are a branch of Men.

> *The Hobbits are, of course, really meant to be a branch of the specifically human race (not Elves or Dwarves) – hence the two kinds can dwell together (as at Bree), and are called just the Big Folk and Little Folk. They are entirely without non-human powers, but are represented as being more in touch with 'nature' (the soil and other living things, plants and animals), and abnormally, for humans, free from ambition or greed of wealth. They are made small (little more than half human stature, but dwindling as the years pass) partly to exhibit the pettiness of man, plain unimaginative parochial man – though not with either the smallness or the savageness of Swift, and mostly to show up, in creatures of very small physical power, the amazing and unexpected heroism of ordinary men 'at a pinch'.*

That was the only translation before the publication of *The Lord of the Rings* in 1955-56.  *The Hobbit* was then translated into German in 1957, Dutch and Polish in 1960,  Portuguese and Swedish (again) in 1962, Spanish in 1964, and Japanese in 1965.  

In 1965 Ace published an unauthorized paperback edition of *The Lord of the Rings* and Tolkien countered by revising the work and authorizing the first paperback edition the same year.  This is when *The Lord of the Rings* became a phenomenon, and suddenly *The Hobbit* was a phenomenon, as well, read by adults as much or more than by children.  *The Hobbit* was turned into a radio play in 1968 and a film in 1977, and it has now been translated into over 40 languages.

The primary effect of WWI on Tolkien's stories were certain memories and images, and the loss of most of his closest friends. You can feel an echo of WWI's devastation in the following quote from The Hobbit: 

""The pines were roaring on the height,
The wind was moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.""

The effort to make them so they fit with the LOTR movies was a decent enough one, at least as far as the concept is concerned. Even Tolkien himself started rewriting The Hobbit in the '60s with the goal of doing exactly that. He even had Bilbo and the dwarves pass through Bree in his new version. He got sidetracked with The Silmarillion, though, and never finished the project.

But stuff was just way too padded in order to fill out a trilogy. The endless chase through the goblin tunnels, the pointless chase in the fields prior to Rivendell, the silly sequence with the giants ... all indicative of a filmmaker just filling out the running time.

71jf0s_46,71jf0s,"Respectfully disagree. I think that's a pretty common opinion though that comes from a familiarity of primarily mainstream fantasy and sci-fi, but it's not entirely true. LOTR made modern fantasy mainstream and influenced one popular subgenre, but it by no means defines the entire genre. 

The thing is that there are a LOT of different subgenres of both sci-fi and fantasy. War of the Worlds is one type of sci-fi in the same way that LOTR is only one type of fantasy. You also have to think about the other stuff Wells wrote, like The Time Machine, which has also been massively influential. Plus he wasn't the only author that wrote highly influential sci-fi. Frankenstein has already been pointed out, but there was also Jules Verne, and other authors like Rudyard Kipling or Edgar Allen Poe wrote sci-fi as well. And if you look at other types of modern sci-fi, like say, cyberpunk, you don't find Wells in there at all. 

Looking at LOTR, Tolkien was influential on the high or epic fantasy genre, but fantasy was thriving as a genre via the pulps. If I had to recommend old fantasy to a reader who liked modern stuff, I would go with the pulps because the level of action, moral ambiguity and even writing style is closer to that than Tolkien these days. Plus, fantasy has always been more than just wizards and elves. Tolkien wrote alongside CS Lewis, and his fantasy is very different from Tolkien's, yet still massively influential. HP Lovecraft wrote horror stories, but they were also technically fantasy or sci-fi stories at times as well.

The largest take away should be that we can rarely ever attribute something to only one person. Typically it's because of multiple influences that came across similar ideas around the same time. Obviously there will only ever be one or a few that get remembered by the mainstream, but you gotta think about the stages of influence. The writers in the 70s and 80s that were inspired by Tolkien also read the other authors writing at that time too. What is obscure to a modern reader may not have been as obscure back then. I mentioned to another poster that Poul Anderson's The Broken Sword is similar to LOTR and was released the same year, and Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland's Daughter predates both LOTR AND The Hobbit.

It makes the Hobbit flicks true prequels to the LOTR movies and ties all six together nicely. They actually watch back-to-back pretty well in that regard.

Besides, as I [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/71jf0s/the_hobbit_was_published_80_years_ago_today_in/dnbns4u/?context=3), Tolkien himself once undertook an unfinished effort to bring The Hobbit more tonally in line with Lord of the Rings, even inserting Bree into it to better match up, so what Jackson and co. wanted to do in that regard wasn't out of line, at least as far as their goals were concerned.

I'm with you on Radagast as well. I was always intrigued by that character. The one we got on film was just awful. I think Tolkien would have been appalled at the idea of having him walk around with bird poop in his hair.

Oh, and re: Dol Guldur, seeing Galadriel fully unleashed was fantastic. Gives her subsequent appearance in Fellowship greater potency, when you watch it as one long series.

The Hobbit is one book that could have never been confused for being more than one book.  I agree that there are theoretical ways you could remain true to the book and have more than one movie, but it would be extremely hard to do right because you risk doing things like interpreting scenes fully which were only lightly treated in the book, and thus readers might have had a completely different view of.

The usual baseline reason that movies are shorter to show than books are to read is because a picture is worth a thousand words.  You can just show an environment that might have taken pages to set up in a book and also do the dialogue while the viewer is basically taking in both environment and dialogue at the same time.

Too bad it went down this way.  I'd have preferred that Jackson make one really good Hobbit movie and then perhaps take his interpretations to something like the *Simarillion* stories.  ",OhNoTokyo,2017-09-21T20:46:23Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,73

For example, Google image the dwarves and try to name them.

71jf0s_77,71jf0s,"I think the reason is best explained by the stylistic approach.

Because LOTR and The Hobbit are such classic, foundational books, fans expect a degree of reverence. 

It doesn't have to be exact. No one wants a narrator to spend 40 minutes describing the architecture of Helm's Deep. LOTR did an excellent job of creating the atmosphere of the book in movie form. Down to the musical work even.

The Hobbit was a hard project to take on, because it (the book) has a very different feel compared to LOTR.  It just isn't a cinematically friendly story.

I figured it wouldn't be too well received due to the extreme ""fairy tale"" vibe of the book. If Jackson was true to the book, the movie would seem goofy, and if it took more liberties it would make the purist camp angry. It was a lose lose situation

Unfortunately Jackson did both. On one hand it was a very *Hollywood* movie, what with a lot absurdities in the action scenes and rather than a dramatic score it featured pop artists.  This felt like a n Adam Sandler rom-com.  Which would have been ok if he had just decided to embrace the fairy tale and be true to the book despite the silliness. Instead he also took some difficult liberties. The ""extra stuff"" meant to tie into LOTR felt unnecessary to many.  And while I admire the female character addition (which Tolkien unfortunately overlooked), Jackson shot himself in the foot by making...nay...forcing her into a ham-fisted love interest side story.

TL;DR

A true-to-the-book approach would have felt silly in film but made purists and children happy. Artistic liberties would have made a better film but made purists check out. Jackson took the worst from both options.",Laser_Dogg,2017-09-21T20:37:07Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,77

It's no ""The Hobbit"" in that the good guys wear white hats, the bad guys wear black hats (a slight over-simplification, I know, don't downvote me!). It's humans (and some non-humans) being human to each other. Some are just and good, some are debased assholes, but most are a bit of both.


The first book in the series, ""The Gardens of the Moon"" is a bit of a trial for some to get through, especially considering Steve Erikson has build a playland that spans a solid history of some 100,000 years, and a not-so-solid history that reaches as far back as maybe another 500,000.


If you're a fan of fantasy, of humans being humans, of struggle, triumph, defeat and despair, and just sheer, utter humanity, you *must* read this series. 


If you make it through the first book I promise you'll be justly rewarded - the second book is far and away one the most masterfully crafted and amazing stories I've read in 35 years.

It's my understanding that at least some of the extra padding came from supplementary materials. However, Legolas was shoehorned in by the studio simply because people liked him from the LotR and Tauriel was completely made up just so they could have some half-assed love story in there as well.

I'm honestly not even a huge fan of the Hobbit. It's a great introductory book to the world of Middle-Earth for younger readers but it pales in comparison to the LotR. That being said, the book is infinitely better than the movies.

I was honestly surprised by the first movie, I enjoyed it. Yes there is a lot more filler and movie action but it was true enough to the book. Then I enjoyed the first half of the second movie before it jumped off the deep end and became completely fucking ridiculous. Haven't finished the third movie.

Some changes I like, like why they brought a burglar, why the Arkenstone is so important, and how they plan to kill the dragon. In the book it makes the dwarves seem like they have absolutely NO PLAN for when they get inside the mountain. They literally spend THREE DAYS cowering in pitch black darkness because it turns out there is indeed a dragon.

Changes I really don't like: Bard being a seer who can predict the exact future, Bard already knows about the dragon's weakness so now Bilbo's riddling & discovery is meaningless, multiple changes to the story that make Thorin even more of an insane evil bastard. The dragon chasing dwarves sequence in a movie that already had that overindulgent barrel scene. I was super excited to see the events at Dol Guldur until that GOOFY ass fight sequence with those GOOFY ass wraiths.

Peter Jackson has never seen a chase or fight sequence that dragged on too long, he probably wanted to add even more to each of them.

The Hobbit is a much simpler story.  A much narrower one than any one of the LOTR books.  The fact that it has about as much screen time as the entire LOTR trilogy just boggles my mind.  Adding literally everything you can justify from the appendices to the LOTR (and quite a few things you can't justify) does not enhance the story.  It takes away from it.  

I enjoy Tolkien's wider lore, without even approaching being an expert in it.  But I LOVE the Hobbit.  It was literally my first experience in the genre (as it was for *countless* others) and has a special place in my heart.  

I watched the Hobbit movies in theatres.  But I will NEVER buy them.  And I will likely never watch them again.  Unless they were to someday come to their senses and release a revised re-edited version that actually told the story of the Hobbit in preferably a single movie, or at most two.

For me, the books are massively better, but the film interpretation strike me as such:

LOTR were passion pieces done as true to the books as possible, given the restraints of the times. Jackson never would’ve gotten approval for an epic 9 film high fantasy film franchise when LOTR came out. Simply not the times we see today where just about everything is approved and made.

The Hobbit films strike me very much as a well done money grab. Many folks may disagree about them being “well done”, but it’s important to also include the “money grab”. For a money grab trilogy, these were pretty good.

Mostly, I refer to the Necromancer = Sauron reveal. When Tolkein wrote the Hobbit, he had not made that connection. He did that retroactively when fleshing out the mythology of middle-earth. I don't mind them mixing in elements from Tolkein's creations. All the unnecessary, forced, CGI action scenes are what ruined it. So bad.

t5o4v2_30,t5o4v2,"Late to the party but I wrote a semi-deep review post on the Hobbit trilogy in partial comparison to the book on /r/lotr a little while ago so, in answer to a question about whether the poor reception of newer hollywood flubs would leave the Hobbit films viewed differently:  
  
> I really loved some changes that were made (e.g. Bilbo actively deciding to go on the adventure rather than being pushed out the door by Gandalf) and some of the more fleshed out story lines (Rhadagast discovering the evil in Mirkwood and a look at Gandalf dealing with ""the Necromancer""). Then there were some added pieces that I didn't particularly love but realized they helped maintain or add tension that is more necessary for a movie format than a book (Saruman in Rivendell trying to shut down the dwarves, Thorin's ongoing disdain for Bilbo, extra focus on the Arkenstone). Martin Freeman was fantastic as Bilbo. The Unexpected Party, Riddles in the Dark and Bilbo's encounter with Smaug are exceptionally well done in ways that bring the scenes to life.  
  
> And that's about as far as I can go with love for the Hobbit movies. At the end of the day they were heavily over-produced, written with absurd internal inconsistencies, suffer from terrible pacing problems and feel almost slavish to a standard ""hollywood focus group"" checklist. The use of CGI is overbearing, and much of it looks far worse than actors in costume did 10-15 years prior when the LotR trilogy was filmed. That in itself probably wouldn't be such a major issue if it wasn't constantly used to create ridiculous scenes that break immersion. Barrel fighting, dwarf-head dancing, wooden goblin bridge falling-then-sticking, stone giant knee-not-crushing, Legolas falling-stone-running, Thorin *molten gold wheelbarrow riding* scenes just constantly remind me that I'm watching a movie that is actively defying basic physics to the point where it's hard to stay invested. The decision to make two movies into a trilogy (fueled primarily by studios) and the addition of too many non-book, non-canon scenes wrecks the pacing in a major way. This is why we need an extended Thorin-Azog showdown before the eagle rescue. This is why we need the dwarves to... somehow explode a molten gold statue(? ugh...) to fight Smaug. Those movies each need a major climax because they need to be their own movies because three movies make more money than two. Then, because hollywood needs a love interest, the character of Tauriel is invented and needs to fall in love with a dwarf. So she falls in love with one of the three most-human-looking dwarves instantly over a penis joke. The story has to revolve around the most-human-looking dwarves because some people might care less if it was about more goofy-looking dwarves. Stephen Fry has to create drama as the master of lake town and they have to invent a character named (big big sigh) *Alfrid Lickspittle* to take up a completely unwarranted amount of screen time just being antagonistic during the extra time with the company in Lake Town they already had to invent because they needed 3 movies instead of 2. There were just way too many hands in the pot here. Too many studios trying to squeeze a profit out of the Hobbit movies. Too many producers who got too much input into what the product had to look like to maximize profits. While there were some decisions clearly made out of love and understanding of the source material, the ultimate product was a confused hollywood mess.  
  
  
> With that all said, I don't think the poor quality of the Star Wars sequel trilogy etc. would *improve* the reception of the Hobbit movies. The Star Wars sequels had much more glaring issues of writing (haven't seen the most recent Matrix to judge) where the characters just do dumb things or rules change within the universe because if those things didn't happen the plot wouldn't exist. Ultimately, bad movies are bad and poorly written movies are poorly written regardless of whatever else is common in cinema at the time. Despite all my criticisms, the Hobbit movies aren't nearly as bad as The Last Jedi or The Rise of Skywalker on those fronts. They were disappointing compared to the love and care we got to see put into the LotR trilogy (and a reminder that we are all beyond blessed to have gotten the exceptional quality we did get out of that trilogy) and they were bloated with a lot of superfluous junk and they frequently asked viewers to suspend their understanding of the laws of physics for the sake of an action set piece, but they weren't complete travesties of writing or in-world consistency like the latter Star Wars movies, and the existence of those far-worse movies doesn't justify the problems of the Hobbit trilogy.",O_the_Scientist,2022-03-03T17:38:09Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,30

t5o4v2_44,t5o4v2,"Behind the scenes of LOTR, there was a lot of love and passion and exhaustion. Behind the scenes of the Hobbit was a cluster kerfuffle of rewrites, works that was just discarded and studio interference and broken contracts. There's stories if not videos of Ian McKellen breaking down sobbing because he was forced to do much of his work in green screen without interaction with other actors. The Elf-Dwarf romance thing was added in post production reshoots, over the objections of the actress. 

The book is ultimately a children's book. Hobbits, despite their age, are rather more child sized and approachable, and Bilbo is a hero not because of his profiency as a warrior but with his guile and creative thinking. The elements I think worked best in the movies are the things from the books. Martin Freeman is a delight and was perfectly cast. I even enjoy the fun of the barrel riding scene as stupid as it is. There's is a childlike way of thinking that goes into it.  (Although since the river was a source of trade and travel, it doesn't make sense to be rapids). There's enough good stuff in the trilogy to be edited down to be a more book fidelity single movie that would be much better received by the fans of the book.

Despit not liking the trilogy, the fact is I don't have any grudges or anything bad to say for any of the performers or crew, who clearly went into the production with the hope of contributing to film legacy with fervent desire to bring a class book to life. Faults lie mostly with the director, Peter Jackson, but even he didn't want to make this trilogy but was forced to due to studio contracts after the Studio butted heads with the original director, so in this case I will say the issue ultimately lies with the studio. 

I would also give credit to Orlando Bloom: I feel like he actually performed better as an actor this time around, or was given more of a chance to. When he did LOTR, he was a new actor fresh out of acting school, and I presume was told to play Legolas as stoic. In this the direction was different so I feel like he got to express and act more. While I don't like the Legolas storyline, I don't have a problem with his performance in it.

With LOTR movies there's tons things that were removed or changed and added in order to make the story work as a movie Trilogy, and they did a decent job of making those changes work. And from a movie making perspective, it's understandable. For the Hobbit, the changes added unneeded complexity and seemed to make less sense from a movie making perspective. The Studio wanted the Hobbit to be a prequel for the LOTR movies instead of it standing as the book does, as a fully independent story. Much like the Star Wars Prequels, however, it can't compete with the charm of the originals.",Upper-Lawfulness1899,2022-03-03T22:28:04Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,44

The Hobbit movies are overall slightly better adaptations, but worse movies.

t5o4v2_72,t5o4v2,"I think the Hobbit movies really improved two items about the book:

1) The dwarves in the movies were highly capable. In the book, none of the dwarves did anything of note. They got lost, didn't ration their food, got captured, wasted arrows, and were generally incompetent. I think making them capable warriors and adventurers was a good chance (really highlighted by the Battle against Smaug at the end of the second movie, which I think was well done). 

2) And specifically, making Thorin Oakenshield a capable and charismatic leader until he got dragon sickness. Book Thorin is basically a peevish British aristocrat who only gets people to follow him by promising riches. Movie Thorin is a force, who is then struck low, and rises again. I think it makes for a much better arc.

I don't blame Peter Jackson for how the movies turned out as he was essentially forced to make them as the studio wanted once Guillermo del Toro quit because of studio interference.

The Hobbit: The Tolkien Edit is 3-4 hours long and is pretty decent, but the characterizations of the characters that weren't shoehorned into the movie is still difficult to stomach. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is easily the best part of the movie.

and yeah, LotR, especially the increasingly extended cuts are surprisingly true to the books with small changes that make sense for the transition from page to screen without being super obvious.  I think the difference in fidelity of LotR compared to The Hobbit was what surprised and shocked a lot of people about it.

The conspiracy theorist in my says that GdT left The Hobbit because the studio wanted him to make the changes we saw in the final product and he refused, then they forced PJ to finish the film with their changes with some sort of dire threats in hand.

Movies can pick up main characters and plot points from a book but a book relies on the readers imagination to interpret the words on a page to provide images for the story, where for a movie compelling images are the only way it can try to tell the story.

Secondly, in too many cases the only thing a movie and a book may have in common is the title and maybe the main characters names and backgrounds, but in the Hobbit even that doesn't hold true. If I could compel answers from Peter Jackson about why a lot of the story was done so very, very poorly and not at all the way the story went in the book I would, but I probably wouldn't like the answers I got.",Juviltoidfu,2022-03-03T22:43:33Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,76

t5o4v2_79,t5o4v2,"I, for one, enjoyed the trilogy.  They say that world was going to end on December 21, 2012.  What happened instead was that I and my family got to see the first Hobbit movie.  I have read the original story in preparation for it, and the book had so many problems, problems that the movie fixed by expanding upon it.  Azog the Defiler was mentioned only fleetingly.  So what?  The threat of the Necromancer existed in only one sentence.  So what?  Radagast the Brown was mentioned only once.  ***So.  WHAT?!***  These, among other things, are what made the movie better because those irrelevancies have become relevant.  Also, it is nice to go back to Middle-earth and see what has been accomplished since not only *The Lord of the Rings*, but also *King Kong*.  In fact, it was this movie that I got to hear my favorite movie quote, one that resonates more strongly with each passing year since and one that I'd see again with the character of Ezran in Netflix's fantasy series *The Dragon Prince*:

&#x200B;

>Saruman believes that it is only great power that can keep evil in check.  But that is not what I have found.  I've found that it is the small things--everyday deeds of ordinary folk--that keeps the darkness at bay.  Simple acts of kindness and love.  Why Bilbo Baggins?  Perhaps it is because I am afraid...and he gives me courage.

&#x200B;

The reason I originally had The Desolation of Smaug at number two had nothing to do with the added character of Tauriel and mostly to do with the actress playing her, Evangeline Lilly.  (***Long story.***)  However, as with *An Unexpected Journey*, what were once mere skims in the book have expanded into vital moments.  The payoff, without doubt, was Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Smaug.  Since Andy Serkis as Gollum and Kong, this was a big deal that has, as of 2020, not cooled down yet.  There was an air of power and confidence in that character, one that has instantly drawn me to him.  Indeed, his conversation with Bilbo was the most powerful of any version of *The Hobbit*, and here's why:  In the book, Smaug derailed Bilbo's confidence on what he was planning to do with his share of the treasure (""Not much use on the mountainside, I imagine?  Not much use in the forest?  Have you never thought of that catch?  A fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it.  Those were the terms, weren't they?  But what about delivery?  What about cartage?  What about armed guards and tolls?"")  That is an issue, but one that can easily be mended.  In the Rankin/Bass film, Smaug never bothered to play with Bilbo--he didn't even suspect the dwarves waiting outside!  (""Then I have guessed your riddle.  You are one of those miserable, tub-thumping Lake-men!  You are your kind will pay dearly for this intrusion.  So the Lake-men will seize my treasure!"")  In this film, Smaug pushed the right buttons by bringing up the Arkenstone, a big deal for Bilbo's friends and one of the many problems in the book that the films fixed by expanding upon it.  He knew how important that gem was to the dwarves, and so he nailed the long-underused ""weaponizing language"" trope.  (""I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer.  Watch it destroy him.  Watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad."")",JohnWarrenDailey,2022-03-03T22:00:24Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,79

IMHO, the movie would have been (one movie because the book doesn't support more than one) would have been incredibly boring without the add libbing that went on.

t5o4v2_120,t5o4v2,"The Hobbit movies reveal the major problem with the idea of the ""prequel:"" If the movie is made after another movie in the series, even if it takes place earlier in the chronology, it must follow the rules of the previous movie, even if following said rules doesn't make sense to the chronology. This becomes a bigger problem when you have something like The Hobbit which was actually written prior to The Lord of the Rings and has a slightly different set of rules, because the other rules hadn't been written yet.

In The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson set the rules for what happens when Frodo puts on the ring, and how horrible and frightening it is to even use it. This is consistent with the way it's portrayed in the books. It's a malevolent force that must never be used, but destroyed. In The Hobbit book, however, it was just a magical ring that made Bilbo invisible. In the movie, however, since it was made after the Lord of the Rings movies, Jackson must portray the ring in the same way, because the expectation for what the ring is and what it does has already been set. Had The Hobbit movies been made first, I'm sure it would have been very different, but by making the movies in the order he did, Jackson kind of painted himself into a corner.

Further, The Lord of the Rings books, in several places, tie everything to the wider Middle Earth lore, which Jackson also did in his movies. There was clearly an expectation that The Hobbit movies would do the same, which they did; while they were unable to use any of the lore directly from The Silmarillion or Unfinished Tales, they took everything they could from the appendices from the end of Return of the King. Again, it's likely that a straight adaptation of The Hobbit would have been done had it been made first, but since it wasn't, they had to basically adapt The Quest of Erebor.",Arkholt,2022-03-03T17:13:49Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,120

More than enough material to justify the trilogy. Could have justified 5 or 6 movies. LoTR doesn't have to diverge much from the source material since they have simply neglected to include half the material. The movie hits the highlights of the book that advance the plot, but it's about an epic journey across middle earth and it's not as much about the destination, but the journey and all the minor happenings along the way.

While Jackson didn't do a great job with the movies, this statement is a massive disservice to the position Jackson was put into. LoTR was given 2 years for pre-production, 14 months for shooting, and a year for each film for post-production. Jackson has to more or less start filming immediately after del Toro's departure. Jackson has said in an interview that he had no time for pre-production and rewriting the script on the fly. He redid shots and worked only for the day because he was so behind. Iirc he even essentially didn't sleep throughout the whole process.

The trilogy wasn't planned by him from the start and he did what he could given the time and circumstances. If he had years to plan I assume he would have done a much better job with less LoTR tie-ins. Peter Jackson also initially planned for LoTR to be 2 movies, so I doubt he would have pushed for a trilogy for the Hobbit if he was in charge from the start.",sfasian_throwaway,2022-03-03T20:40:22Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,165

I didn’t have the best recollection of the movies but I always thought the subplot with Kili (Aidan Turner) was bizarre. And god I was so relieved it wasn’t in the books.

t5o4v2_179,t5o4v2,"I said this in another thread and used the 3.....THREE hobbit movies as an example, that writers, directors, and editors, all need reigning in from time to time. Otherwise they just circle jerk themselves with bloated directors cuts full of fluff that absolutely KILLS the momentum of the story. 

The Hobbit was a childrens book FFS, and they turned it into a 6 hour epic that makes Lawrence of Arabia look like a short story. 


One of the reasons why books will always be superior to films is that there are things you can read in books that are IMPOSSIBLE to show in film. It's not a matter of special effects either, it's just that some ideas don't map to an image, and can't be expressed accurately, or with the same directness, as a 'scene'. The best that a movie can do is to take an amazing, unfilmable, idea, and try to find an analog for it, like the infinite bookshelves in Interstellar being a place holder/analog to multi dimensionality. 

Other examples are comparing the monolith flight sequence between 2001 the book and 2001 the movie. The movie could pretty much only show psychadelic moving images and colors, to try to represent what the book describes. 

It gets even weirder when you get into completely psychological or impossible ideas. A writer could write about a universe that both fits in your hand, but is at the exact same time, the world around you, and that universe is also your cat, all at the same time. A movie would have to try to show a cat, or show a mini universe, or show a world around you, but in your mind, with good writing, they can become one thing with different aspects. 

Like describing a light too bright to ever see. The mind can imagine it, a camera could never film it. 

Trying to translate the written words amazing images, into actual images, would be like trying to take an MC Escher sketch of stairways that go every which way, and building it in the physical world. IE you can't, because that part of the original medium (images) can't translate to the real world in the same way an idea in a book doesn't directly translate to an image on a screen.",kodack10,2022-03-03T22:26:05Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,179

Honestly, as good as the jackson lotr movies are, I think it'd be good for film and TV to not use the same look as he did such as what happened in the hobbit movies and what the amazon series seems to be doing. When I think of the illustrations of Gollum in the book, I imagine that a pared back, highly stylized look would be a great way to visually represent the hobbit.

What bothered me more about this scene was that in the book, this is where Bilbo revealed his ownership and use of the ring. Bilbo trusted the dwarves with a secret that he wouldn't share with anybody else for the next 60 years. When Gandalf finally figures it out, he *guesses* that Bilbo is using a magic ring rather than actually being told. This was a huge sign of the trust and friendship that had formed between Bilbo and the dwarves.

Edit; Also while I think Martin Freeman played a fantastic hobbit... technically Bilbo was 51 years old when the events of The Hobbit took place. While he moved very well and was quite spry for a 51 year old hobbit, Freeman came across as 20 years younger than what I expected Bilbo to be. When Gandalf says to Bilbo at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring movie that he, ""Hasn't aged a day"", he was quite frankly telling the truth.

The men of Numeanor were taller, stronger, and lived for a long time, in part because they descend from Elros, who is Elrond's brother. Elros and Elrond are both ""half-elven"", meaning that they had one elven parent, Elwing, and one human parent, Eärendil. As a thank you from the gods/valar for badass deeds (long story) both Elros and Elrond got to choose whether they wanted to be human or elven. Elrond chose the elf life, became one of the elven lords in Middle Earth, eventually wielder of the elf ring Vilya, which came to him after Sauron killed Gil-galad.

now you could pull a sneaky and say that movie-lotr is actually set in 3002 ta (because frodo left the second he turned 33), and since movie aragorn is still 87, he's now be 26 years old in the hobbit",carnsolus,2022-03-04T03:08:00Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,282

I get frustrated when fans of a book series complain about a successful adaptation wherein many of the changes are out of necessity and aid in the creation of a successful movie/show i.e. LotR or the early seasons of Game of Thrones. The Hobbit on the other hand was neither a successful adaptation of the initial story nor a successful film trilogy. Many of the changes actually detracted from the story which is a shame since Freeman was great as Bilbo and had they been more faithful to what Bilbo actually did in the book they could have made one very good movie.",,2022-03-03T18:33:30Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,286

I watched The Hobbit on Amazon one time and I noticed something was off. Like some scenes were strangely quiet like when the dwarves get taken into Goblin Town and you see this stone doorway close in complete silence and I thought ""surely there'd be a sound for that door, right?"" 


So I googled ""Rankin Bass Hobbit missing sounds"" and found that version and these are indeed missing sounds in the Amazon release. There were clinking dishes when the dwarves visit Bilbo's home, that stone door makes a grating sound and closes with a big THUD and many more...

t5o4v2_304,t5o4v2,"It's certainly darker and more tragic, but it's stylistically not that different. Tolkien focuses on the shining beauty of Gondolin and its seven gates, juxtaposing it with the dark and evil forces attacking it. What are these armies composed of? You don't really know. The rank and file aren't important. They are just faceless masses being led by charismatic and unique champions. Gothmog  (the balrog, not the lieutenant of the Witch King who besieges Minas Tirith) fights Ecthelion and both perish. The high king Turgon dies in battle to a nameless enemy, Glorfindel (who returns in the LoTR) dies and takes out a balrog attacking the refugees. Tuor (ancestor of Elrond) defeats Maeglin the ""dark"" elf betrayer. The swords Orcrist and Glamdring (which would go to Thorin and Gandalf in the Hobbit) gain their fame.

Compare this to contemporaries writing about the Great War, such as Wilfrid Owens or Siegfried Sassoon, or even the modern writers such as Sebastian Faulks with *Birdsong -* there is a much greater emphasis on the rank and file. Indeed the upper officer class is often ignored or vilified as uncaring and ignorant. There is often no visible enemy, but the rain of artillery, chemical weapons and snipers keeps everyone in a state of terror and shock. The soldiers simply march to their doom, and great detail is spent on describing the wounds and psychological impact of being surrounded by death. It is not an epic with heroes gloriously sacrificing themselves. There are no famous individual named weapons, only the names of mass produced and trademarked instruments of carnage.

There is only one battle that I remember being so horrific - the Dagor Bragollach where the first dragon and the first orcs appear, where Fingolfin challenges Morgoth to a duel and dies valiantly, and the tides of the war begin to shift.",PliffPlaff,2022-03-08T21:35:44Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,304

The LotR movies however skipped the 17 year gap between Bilbo leaving after his 111th birthday and Frodo leaving to destroy the ring so theres only 60 years between The Hobbit movies and LotR movies, approximately.

Tolkien wrote *The Hobbit* for his children when they were young, it was intended as a bedtime story (hence the episodic chapters) inspired by old English fairy stories. 

The LOTR he wrote many years later based on the ancient hero ballads like *Beowulf*. It was also written without the clearest plan because he was sending the chapters as letters to his then adult son, Christopher, who was overseas fighting in World War II. And those current events influenced much of Tolkien's writing. (The relationship between Frodo and Sam was deeply influenced by Tolkien's experience fighting in World War I.)

ryy5fj_28,ryy5fj,"I have two memories of this book to share.

In third grade, my teacher had a reading competition.  The goal was to read the most total pages of books.  My classmates really got into it, reading lots of books, competing to outdo one another.  The entire time, I was in dead last with zero books finished.

Why?  Because I was fixated on just one weird, cool book I found in the school library: The Hobbit.  I was totally out of my depth reading it at that age.  It was a struggle to finish every page, but I couldn’t stop.  So many fascinating characters and images and ideas.  I just had to find out how it ended, even if it meant losing that contest.

As if happened, I finished the book just in time for the competition deadline.  I remember telling my teacher, and letting her know I had just finished a 385-page book, which would take me from dead last in the competition to first place in one fell swoop.

She was skeptical, so she asked me questions about the book, and I just lit up.  I told her all about Hobbits and Dwarves and Dragons and Wargs and all the adventure.  I can still remember the rush of excitement trying to explain it all, and the big grin on her face as I did.  So that’s how I won the third-grade reading competition after being dead last the entire time.

But my best memory of The Hobbit came much later, when my son was the same age I was when I first read the book.  I picked it back up again, this time to read a chapter each night to him at bedtime.

He got into it, and I fed off of his fascination and wonder.   I made up voices for all the characters.  I improvised tunes for the songs.  Once again, I got absorbed in this wonderful, heartwarming adventure, but this time with by son’s big eyes widening at each peril or plot twist and rekindling my enthusiasm for this story.

Such a good book.  It warms my heart again thinking about this.",Bewilderling,2022-01-08T23:15:40Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,28

I did the same back in December with the LOTR films and yes, that trilogy deserves every kudo we give it, but many of those artisans went on to the Hobbit films and they still put forth their very best to make the best out of a situation they got thrust into.

This never happens once in LOTR, nor does anything like it ever happen. You won't find a single place where LOTR describes scenery for more than a paragraph (at most). Tolkien's descriptions are always in the history and atmosphere of a place and NOT in its physicality. That's a huge misconception. Furthermore, Tolkien's incredible attention to history and depth, and how these things relate to some of the main themes of the work (i.e. how the world is slowly decaying and its magic disappearing forever) are what make it such a revered piece of literature and also what makes it far more substantive than *The Hobbit.*

*The Hobbit* also did not initially take place within the fictional universe described in *The Silmarillion.

ryy5fj_79,ryy5fj,"LOL well yeah, it’s a tale of high adventure… where Bilbo’s character development hinges on being pried unwillingly from a comfortable life he’s very fond of & discovering a knack for adventuring.

Passages about Shire life aren’t the bulk of the writing, but they serve a purpose. In the Hobbit it highlights that Bilbo is a reluctant hero & in LOTR it draws parallels to how Tolkien endured WWI trench warfare/what he knows is helping soldiers survive the misery of WWII. It’s not the thrill of adventure that sustains a soldier when suffering, it’s thoughts of home; Tolkien specifically references this in War of the Ring. I conflate this with my view of The Hobbit.

Epic stories are literally bookended with cozy daily life: The Hobbit opens with it (Bilbo with his meals) & LOTR ends with it (Mild spoiler alert: Sam happily home with family). The narrative arc chosen by the writer begins and ends with the draw of a comforting home & its beloved routines; some readers pick up on this and find that it resonates. Tolkien writes about it in a really appealing way… *makes sense when you think about the context*.

TL;DR: the serenity of the Shire and coziness of hobbit life is a literary device and an important aspect of Tolkien’s writing… but please, by all means… go off on a 3 month old thread with your hot take on this.

Bilbo’s introduction and the warm, friendly tone Tolkien takes, and then the humourous dialogue between Bilbo and Gandalf, immediately followed by the arrival of the dwarves… I think it’s probably one of the most enjoyable first chapters of any book I’ve ever read.

ryy5fj_89,ryy5fj,Yes. But the hobbit was always designed to be accessible to young readers. The series only became bloated with lore with the later entries. Its very realistic to be turned off by Tolkien's writings in his other works; he was a good world builder but a middling writer.

That being said, those movies ruined my own imaginations of the characters. None of them really looked like my mental images of them, but now they're all I can see.

Hand to hand is hard to say, but Hobbits are very fond of throwing and shooting games and many are skilled archers. Bilbo seemed to do allright with a sword as well.

12x9l37_2,12x9l37,"The Hobbit is hands down my favorite book of all time. I used to pick it up and read it once or twice a year when I was younger. 

I'm sure others will echo this, but....LOTR is a WILDLY different experience. It's hard to read sometimes, oversaturated with descriptors and lore, and can feel like a chore sometimes. Having said that, from a literature standpoint, it's undeniably one of, if not THE best, single trilogy of fiction ever created. 

The Hobbit was meant to be a children's book. LOTR is anything but. Both have their place in the universe and both are amazing pieces of fiction. But do not, under any circumstances, think that the two are even remotely related, outside of subject matter.

Edit: after re-reading my comment, it comes off a little strong. Just follow everyone else's advice. I think there is a pretty good consensus in the thread.",thedrizztman,2023-04-24T11:44:59Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,2

I only call it filler because it's not directly related to the story, it's still really good writing. If it's not your thing though, you'll be more bored than lost. The first half of the fellowship of the Ring is particularly slow going, so if you're really struggling to get through that you can skip ahead to when they get to Bree, or even Rivendell.

12x9l37_4,12x9l37,"The Hobbit was originally written as a children's story for Tolkien's son.   As such, it's full of little songs and riddles and such that give it a sense of fairy tale whimsy.  The innocence of Bilbo makes for a stark contrast against the dark situations and creatures he encounters, giving them even more weight and letting you feel his terror.

LOTR has a more sombre tone and the storytelling is more drawn out - in fact it drags pretty badly in some places.  It features many of the same themes and characters, but there's a certain heaviness and darkness hanging over Frodo's journey that Bilbo's didn't seem to have.

The Hobbit is still my favorite book in the 'series' - and it was more fun and engaging to read than the trilogy to me.

It’s a fantastic story, and lays the groundwork for LOTR, but it’s still a book aimed at children. Think of it like a story that a parent would read to their child at night, a chapter at a time. LOTR is an adult fantasy book, patterned after the great western sagas (Beowulf and the like). If you’re not familiar with the story at all, I definitely won’t spoil it, but I will say that I’d be surprised if you didn’t have a feeling of recognition while reading it regarding its themes and tropes. It feels like a timeless story that gets passed down from generation to generation. Similar to how the original Star Wars is essentially the age old hero’s quest, adapted to a galaxy far, far away. That said, I don’t think it’s a difficult read.. It can be a little laborious at times, just given the style of prose that Tolkien used (he was a professor at Oxford, after all), but it’s not difficult in the way that like Eternal Jest or Ulysses would be.

But take that with a grain of salt, as I personally really, really dislike the movies. 

In my opinion the hobbit book is barely enough for two movies let alone three. Popular fan edits I've seen are between 3,5 to 4,5 hours instead of 8. That being said I think people who are able to watch the movies while completely ignoring the source material might find the movies decent on their own despite all the filler material. But I believe as soon as you start comparing the book to the movies there is not much room to justify their creative decisions. Characters, whether completely made up or just taken from the LOTR series for no reason, that definitely shouldn't be there, new stories that just don't fit, and lots and lots of filler material that wasn't necessary to tell the story of Bilbo Baggins. All just so the big companies behind it can try to get as much money out of three instead of the originally planned two movies.

So basically: If you value the source material and hope to see movies that try to bring that to the screen you're better off not watching them, but if you just want something to watch mindlessly without caring about the original story you can watch it I suppose.

Obviously this is just my own opinion and a quite harsh one at that, so you might want to hear more opinions from others.",LordHelmchen98,2023-04-24T19:16:50Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,31

We get Hobbits being very Hobbit-y, singing as they walk, getting swept up by silly but wonderful Elves who give them a feast in the woods and vanish by morning with little trace.

These are relics, some deliberate, of when Tolkien originally set out to write LotR as prompted by his publisher and as a sequel to The Hobbit. *The Next Adventure of Bilbo Baggins*, or *What Happened After*, as it were.

The man was a legend and he loved his fathers work more than anyone. The Hobbit was written by JRR for Christopher as a bedtime story. You can only imagine how much these stories meant to him. 

He was avidly against movies and adaptations. The only reason these LOTR and Hobbit movies were made was because JRR sold the rights for the cartoon version before he died. He even called out the movies on how poorly executed he thought they were.

Not even three months after Christopher stepped down as head of the Tolkien estate, the new head sold the rights of LOTR to Amazon to make a TV show, and made a lot of money doing it.

I agree books and movies should be two different things, but it doesn't feel like we're seeing the world through Bilbo's eyes for a lot of the Hobbit films. I guess that's also a symptom of it being made after the Lord of the Rings too, so it's not our entry point, it had to also function as a worthy follow-up to LOTR, which was going to be near-impossible anyways.

But the studio decided it wanted box office revenue for 3 movies, so they thinned out these plot points into 3 movies and filled in the gaps with nonsensical romance subplots and extended gaudy CGI scenes.

One piece of advice though... I'm a hardcore Tolkien fan and have read the trilogy and The Hobbit upwards of a dozen times. I have only read The Silmarillion twice... And only understood the book as a whole after I read a guide to the book. That's how crazy it is. But it's still totally worth reading. It answers so many questions and hints from the other books and just fleshes out the LotR universe so much more completely than if you just stick to the trilogy and The Hobbit. It's a rewarding and challenging read so prepare yourself. 

When I was a teenager I read a guide book after I read it the first time (this was pre-internet as we know it) and I can't remember what it was called, but a quick Google search makes me think it was probably ""A Reader's Guide to The Silmarillion.""

dio9z2_41,dio9z2,"I'm guessing they wanted to streamline the story a little bit and keep focus on the Black Riders as the primary threat at that stage of the story.

Having Tom Bombadil would have also required that whole thing with Old Man Willow, and afterwards the Barrow-wights. At that point a viewer who isn't familiar with the source material might experience a sort of ""inflation of threats"" and not be sure which ones are supposed to be the ""main enemies"".

And honestly, as intriguing a character as Tom Bombadil is in the books, I kind of doubt they could've done it justice - and, for the average viewer who hasn't read the books, it would be a baffling, pointless interlude.

In other words, I do understand why the film adaptation chose to skip that part and expedite the hobbits' arrival to Bree.

I think they had similar reasons for skipping the Scouring of the Shire. The argument, I believe, is that after the big bad has been vanquished, further conflict is difficult to take seriously. Building up tension becomes kind of hard with that kind of ""enemy downgrade"".

That said, even though it's a bit of a foregone conclusion what's going to happen, that was kind of the point in the book. Saruman and Wormtongue had the hobbits of Shire basically paralyzed under their foot, because the hobbits there didn't really have experience dealing with that type of unscrupulous, deceitful, cruel, and self-serving characters. Then these four Companions of the Ring turn back and immediately assume position of leadership, and put a stop to it all in a short order.

The Scouring of the Shire is there to underline how the hobbits have changed since they left the Shire - the hobbits there are basically how they used to be, but Sam and Frodo have been through a literal hell and Merry and Pippin are basically veteran warriors (and have grown to be abnormally large for hobbits, which wasn't really shown in the film either).

That said, the films do justice to the hobbits' character development in their own way, so I do kind of understand why the scriptwriters thought it better to adapt the story so that the tension and conflict is resolved when the Ring is destroyed and Sauron with it.",HerraTohtori,2019-10-16T16:56:49Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,41

In what the Lord of the Rings universe has presented on the films, it has been a pretty diverse universe. The Hobbit, being made after the trilogy, is now automatically set in the same established universe. The Hobbit, being a war story disguised by an adventure told in a more young age manner, is then required to maintain the same universe, or it removes the films too much from what people really enjoyed.

This presents the issue, though. The Hobbit FILM, not the book where mintealixious very eloquently described the content, isn't told exclusively as Bilbo's story. Bilbo is presented as the main character, and while we're on the adventure of witnessing his story, the FILM contains a much larger story being told. It is also serving as an origin of sorts to the world we saw in LOTR (Now, whether that should have been done is another question). The issue that is now required to be handled is how do you maintain the very diverse universe that was presented in LOTR with a book that was very uniquely as I said above, a story presented from a singular character that is exactly as mintealixious described.",mrshock13,2013-12-01T16:45:50Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,6

It was more than five years after he wrote it that a friend got ahold of it and he was induced to publish it.

* It definitely leads the reader to ask questions about their absence and their description.  Does it have to do with the author or the character or the situation? 

* It's not like Tolkien, writing a fantasy and a mythology, hasn't looked at his own history and seen great women like Elizabeth I or Mary Queen of Scots or Boudica and her daughters (heck there's even a statue dedicated to her in London) So why not create a female character?

* Well maybe we have that ""Boudica""-esque character in LoTR who takes down the Lich King, but then what are her defining traits? She basically wants to be ""one of the guys"" and she may have a thing for one of the main characters. It's hardly deep, it's more like she's a gear in the plot mechanism.

* I guess you can't really know authorial intent, and when analysing a book you have to ignore it, but what if there were no women because Tolkien preferred men and male relationships? It's just as easy to think that as it is to say that he didn't think much of women or their abilities.

I am NOT calling out Tolkein or saying that *The Hobbit* sucks or needs women or any of that. Tolkein's writing has almost no women. That's something that's *interesting* to discuss. The argument OP provided is fascinating and is asking us to compare Tolkein's treatment of women in *The Hobbit* and well, everything else and see if there is a difference. I'm not sure that there is, but I haven't reread *The Hobbit* or *The Lord of the Rings* in years and I'd love to see discussion on that. Analysing gender in Tolkein's work is especially interesting given how many races there are and that we have so much detailed information on them. For example, we know that Tolkein provided an in-universe justification for the Ents being only male. I am not trying to start some sort of gender war. I'd like to discuss Tolkein's treatment of women in his books...because it's *interesting*. It's okay to discuss gender. We dicuss lots of aspects of literature and there's no reason that we shouldn't discuss this one.

Your arguments would kinda sorta make sense if women were a small minority of the human population, like maybe Siamese twins -  then we could say odds are low that any characters would be Siamese twins.

Show me where in the Hobbit the Necromancer is. That is a list of names from the Hobbit. Not necessarily characters. If being referenced and identified is enough to make you a character then Bilbo's mother counts as a character and the entire argument is moot. And yes obviously the sacksville-bagginses is what I meant with that last sentence why make a note of it if you clearly understood the implication?

>Your arguments would kinda sorta make sense if women were a small minority of the human population,

For dwarves that is actually true. 

Let me ask you a question. What use would adding a female character be to the book if she serves no purpose other than being female? Say you take one of the dwarves and just make them a girl. No extra lines, no extra character traits, no purpose, just a name with nothing behind it. Does that change anything? Does that prove anything? Wouldn't that be worse than having no female characters. She would be there as an object. That defeats the entire purpose doesn't it? It would just be bad writing. It would be shoehorning something into a book for no purpose whatsoever.

I realise this got started a bit upthread with /u/punkpixzsticks/ initial comment, so this is really to both of you.

Look, Tolkein wanted to write about men. It's what he knew, what he felt comfortable with, whatever. But he wanted to write about men. To the extent that he actually creates in-universe explanations for a lack of female dwarves, and female ENTs and so on. He literally writes the female species out of at least two races. (Can someone remember what explanation (or lack thereof) is given for the Orcs? I don't remember.) Is the book still good? Yes, it's a great book. There are plenty of great works of art that don't have female characters in them. And a lack of women in a work of art can be justified, in fact, Tolkein goes to fairly great lengths to justify the lack of women.

No one is here saying that *The Hobbit* sucks because there are no female characters. But the lack of female characters and the various in-universe justifications are an interesting thing to discuss. As are author experiences and motives. I'm not upset or pissed off by the lack of women in *The Hobbit*. But what drives me crazy is this assumption that women could only be romantic or sexual partners and that *The Hobbit* is a better piece of writing for not including them because you think romance would drag it down.

Say I created the ACME test, which is a test to see whether media shows accurate consequences for violence.  If a coyote plummets 50 feet and still lives, or a duck gets a shotgun to a face and has not a scratch in the next scene, it fails the ACME test.  This test isn't a check to tell animators ""Hey, you can't create cartoons that don't show proper consequences for violence.""  It would be to highlight to kids and parents ""Hey, this stuff your kids are watching fails this test.  Some supplemental conversations regarding this material would not go amiss.""

Creators can and should create whatever they want, but a healthy society should be able to examine what's going on in those creations and talk about it.

My point, I guess, is that I have never heard this argument from the other side. It bugs me that when I say ""hero"" or ""main character"" the default in everyone's mind (including my own, sometimes) is a man-character. And that the top comment in ""Female Characters Don't Exist in The Hobbit"" boils down to ""I didn't even notice!""

And Tolkein is his own special brand of exclusionary. He's a genius who thought up whole languages, and built a world of epic proportions, but couldn't fit more than a handful of women characters of any race in any book. 

Not that I don't like Tolkein: I like his works a lot. My dad read The Hobbit to me when I was a kid and it was awesome. I just think it would be cool if little-girl me had an easier time putting herself in someone's shoes from the story. And I'm not talking just about Tolkein-- there aren't that many books with women as main characters in the fantasy/scifi genre in general, and more broadly, in a lot of pop culture.

However the difficulty level is a little higher (with a lexile score of 1000 where Harry potter is at 880) and the interest level is rated older at 6-12th grade so you may not hold there interest just yet.. but I say give it a go. 
However if it doesn't hold their attention I have a few recommendations that are still out of their reading range but comparable to harry potter in difficulty and keeping the fantasy adventure theme and would be good alternatives for you to read to them. The Wings of Fire series by Tui T. Sutherland is a series about dragons, The Warriors series by Erin Hunter (more appealing to girls) is an adventure series where all the characters are cats or the Rangers Apprentice series by John Flanagan (more appealing to boys) a swords and sorcery battle oriented, Also you may find interest in the fantasy series that starts with Fablehaven by Brandon Mull it's probably the easiest on the list with a lexile score in the 700's and The Lightening Thief by Rick Riordain which is fantasy/aventure + Greek Mythology. A good standalone would be The Graveyard book by Neil Gaiman about a boy who grows up in the graveyard and is raised by ghosts. Those are all really popular right now.. A series that I personally like but is a little less popular would be a peter pan origin story series by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson called Peter and the Starcatchers. These are all roughly comparable to the reading level of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and meant to be self read at the 7-12 age range.

3bbqpn_15,3bbqpn,"Hell yes!  I don't believe a child is ever too young for The Hobbit.  Anything that ignites their imagination is awesome.

My grandmother, convinced I was a child genius, always bought me books that I was way too young to read.  We're talking National Geographic, Nat Geo World (great for first graders!), and all sorts of literature that were either just a bit ahead of me or way ahead of me.

The National Geographics were the ones that made me want to read -- I saw these things that NGWorld hinted at, and I could understand that, but I couldn't understand the words in National Geographic.  

I could however see the pictures, so I learned about context.  I knew from a very young age that the article was about the Amazon Rainforest.  It didn't turn me off reading.  On the almost extreme contrary, it lit an insatiable fire in me to read.  

I had a pretty bad childhood and a vivid imagination, and so books were my way of escaping.  It would have been early to mid 1970s, before Star Wars is all I remember, when I first read The Hobbit and then LOTR.  It was a HUGE deal for me, it was a huge project that I took upon myself.  I felt both an enormous sense of accomplishment at taking on such a big book by myself, and also an indescribable thrill from discovering this enormous, vivid world.

I don't remember it but I know my grandparents read to me a lot as a young child.  

The only downside I could possibly think of is your boy not getting to read it himself in another year or two.  That's how old I was.  It had some big words, but I picked up enough to be completely swept away.  ",,2015-06-28T02:59:51Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,15

Even the two year old usually sits fairly still (this rarely happens at other times) and listens, although I'm sure he misses a lot.  We've read books that push our boys' comprehension since they were little, and the boys love it.  Don't be afraid to start a book, get a few chapters in, and give it up if you can't catch at least one of your children's interest, but it's a balance.  If your kids are anything like mine, when you first start reading to them, they'd be much more content with a children's book with pictures, but as they get used to imagining the story as it is read to them, they grow to prefer ""older"" books.  I don't think I'd be able to get away with reading *The Hobbit* to them if I hadn't already gotten them into the habit of listening for context clues and consuming books that stretch them.

The two year old got sent to bed the other day while we were still reading the first chapter because he couldn't quit bugging his brothers while I tried to read.  He normally goes to bed easily, but that night he cried and cried until my wife went and lay down next to him with the door open so that he could hear the story.

My oldest daughter never had any interest in Fantasy/Sci Fi type books, but devoured books like Little Women, Pride and Prejudice and Emma. The exception, of course, being the Harry Potter series as you were a nobody in her age group if you weren't reading that in the early 2000s!  

My middle daughter was already attempting to read The Hobbit by herself at approximately age 6 and is mowing through the Diskworld series, along with loving the entire Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  She just loves to read, and many genres catch her interest.

So, to sum, it just depends on your child!  Give it a go, and see what happens.  If there's no interest, or you find they're really just struggling to understand, put it aside and try another time or just let them discover it for themselves when they're ready.

For example, when they get caught by the trolls instead of skipping them getting caught and escaping, G-rate the capture then ask your son/daughter how they would escape and make up a short story utilising their escape method.",throwaway98915030,2015-06-28T08:39:40Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,141

Update: I guess I was thinking of the fact that he's mentioned as being bigger than Sam in Fellowship, which doesn't really mean much. Wikipedia says that early illustrations of Gollum sometimes showed him as very large because his size is not mentioned in the first edition.

Six would probably be quite an ideal age. 

It was written very quickly in the 1930s by a super young Gombrich, but is an absolute classic. A marvel to think about how he even accomplished the feat. A little Germanic world centric (which is a novelty in my largely Anglo world), and definitely Euro centric. He went on to write other classics such as The History of Art after fleeing the Nazi's. 

I read Magician by Feist and then the Hobbit when I was 12 to my little brother who was about 6-7 then. Still a fantastic memory.

Then just as the book was reaching a climax he put it down and stopped. Instead of reading the last chapter he put the book in the class library and encouraged us to read it for ourselves. 

It was a brilliant and inspirational move a but the thing is there were 30 of us in the class and only one copy of the book. I wasn't one of those lucky enough to get the book early on and with the many distractions of an eight years old's life I some how never got around to it.


Even though I didn't finish the Hobbit in school I never forgot the incident and I never forgot how much I enjoyed the story. I didn't finish the book for about thirty years more. Of course by that stage I had forgotten so much I had to start again but I did and enjoyed the entire thing once again. That lead to binge reading of the Lord of the Rings trilogy which I was fortunate enough to do just in time to really appreciate Peter Jackson's wonderful movies.

He died shortly after The Fellowship came out, but the way we bonded over those stories each night for months will always be one of my favourite memories of him.

Keep up the good work OP, and thanks for the warm fuzzies!",longjontassie,2015-10-09T09:43:17Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,69

3o2a4p_92,3o2a4p,"When my daughter was four and started to read her first book, I placed my hardcover copy of The Hobbit in her room and told her this was for when she was a little older.  Now of course, I piqued her interest.  Next to all these little Dr Seuss books was this large, green hardcover book in its own box with all this fancy lettering.  So she immediately began asking me to read it to her.  

When she turned 5 she asked me several times to read it to her.  

I've been reading The Hobbit to my 5 year old daughter and my 3 year old son now for a few months.  I read it to them before bed, and only a few nights a week so that they don't get overwhelmed with the story.  (In between sessions we read other things, or my daughter picks one of her reading books and reads to us - it's awesome).  

They absolutely love The Hobbit, and I never thought I'd enjoy the experience as much as I do.  In fact, my son remembers more of the story than my daughter does.  Every time I ask them if they remember where we last left off (as a training exercise for reading retention), and my son usually provides the best answers, which is surprising.  Last session his answer was, ""The wood elves just captured Thorin!"", in a most excited tone.  

I try to make the session a bit of a ritual, so I tell them that it's ""circle time"", which is teacher-talk for ""sit and be quiet"".  I start and finish every reading session by playing, ""Far Over the Misty Mountains"", from The Hobbit movie.  It's my version of invoking the muses.  :-)  This immediately grabs their attention, and they settle down.  

Then I try to read off a reasonable chunk of the story, finding appropriate places to stop the story, such as the completion of an adventure (entering Gollum's cave, defeating the trolls, etc.), or in suspense (suspended in the trees fighting off the goblins and wargs, wood-elf lights going out in the forest, etc).  They seem to find it very exciting.  

I'd like to give a bit of advice to parents who want to read this to their littler ones:  
 - 30 minutes of reading before bedtime seems to be ideal: right time of day, right length of time  
 - you need to use voices for all the characters.  It helps bring them to life and really pulls the children in.  I left my kids pick the voice to use for Bilbo.  So, when I read, Bilbo sounds like an effeminate homosexual on helium.  It makes them laugh.  
 - allow for questions during the reading.  I let them raise hands and ask as many questions as they want.  You'll be surprised at how good their imagination is.  It's forced me to put myself into world of Middle Earth more than I ever did when I first read it.  ",thedenofsin,2015-10-09T11:22:07Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,92

I read small books to my 5 yo, he has a bunch of diferent books like Where the wild things are, a bunch of Dr Seuss books, and other small stories and I read about 3 or 4 of then each night. He gets to choose and sometimes hell go all the way back to The wheels on the bus books. 

Ever since he started enjoying story time, I've wanted to jump to a much longer story that he can look forward to reading every night. 

My questions is this, did you try reading it before he was 6 and did you find you'd lost his attention? 

Also, I always try to read books in their original language, if I can, a little difficult since I only know English and Spanish, but English is not my sons first language, and although he says he understands most of what I read to him or what he watches on Netflix, I'm worried that this and his age will make it boring or make it slow reading since he'll be inturrempting the story every 2 seconds to ask what something means.

One thing I would recommend, especially if your kid has ADHD or simply has difficult paying attention, is promoting reading comprehension early. When we do story time I read a few pages, then I ask him a question about what we just read. If he gets the question right (I usually give him two questions minimum) he gets a few more pages. It's usually something simple like ""What did Bilbo find in the cave?"" or the like, but it shows he was paying attention, and he gets rewarded (and feels good about himself). I also usually give him a quarter for his piggy bank if he gets ALL the questions right.

In fact, the only thing it changes is pronouns. If Tolkien wanted Bilbo to be female, it would be a big deal. As we've seen in the rest of his universe, having an adventuring female character is a big deal. Eowyn (who slew the witch king) did have to deal with disapproval, did have to disguise herself, and DID overcome everybody's prejudice. By changing Bilbo into a female character, and thus, making her gender a non-issue is not consistent with the values of both Middle-Earth, and 1930's England (when The Hobbit was published).

1u3lq8_3,1u3lq8,"I hope this doesn't get buried because I don't see any comments on this topic: The Hobbit (and the Lord of the Rings world as a whole) provides a great story and role model for young boys to express themselves and their feelings.

Is the book good gender-switched? Probably. It's a good book! Tolkien wrote it really well. I have no comment on that.

However, I'd like to point out that so few books/stories/media of any sort encourage young boys to explore and express their feelings. Young boys don't have many great role models for expressing emotions. There are definitely books and stories out there, but they are in the minority. So often, men are portrayed as fearless, emotionless stumps. Never crying, never singing, never laughing, never afraid. The ""hero"" is so often the worst role model a young boy can have.

Having a character such as Bilbo, who expresses the full range of emotions, can be extremely beneficial for young boys. It teaches them that it's okay to be expressive and rounded. Is this same role model also beneficial to women? Absolutely! But women don't typically suffer *as often* from the emotional stunting that men do.

This is not a comment to post on women vs men or whatever. I do think however that while the link makes a good point that Bilbo is a good role model for girls when gender-switched, he's an ever better role model for boys.

1u3lq8_5,1u3lq8,"I think the phrasing is weird, because I don't think the story is objectively better in the way most people would define ""better"". I think it would be more appropriate to say the story is surprisingly unaffected.

I think a lot of people do wish Tolkein's world (along with many other classic fantasy works) wasn't inherently sexist, and wish modern adventure stories featuring female protagonists didn't usually end up being sexist in a different, pandering, ""GIRL POWER"" way. So, if you were to take that value of ""better"", a hypothetical story written with a female Bilbo would be a pretty great thing, had someone actually ever written it.

I think a lot of people also get up in arms when the flaws of the work of a beloved author are pointed out. This was a guy who was a bit of a fuddy-duddy about women even for 1930s England. Social shortcomings in his stories are a product of the time and his upbringing, not something I would consider his ""fault"". 

But, it's ignorant to say you can't see the problems with the treatment of women in Tolkien's work if you are reading it in the modern day.

I'm not a fan of re-writing classic works to correct social flaws. But it's also problematic in that a lot of older stories meant for children (Which the Hobbit is) become something a lot of people find they have a problem giving to children in good conscience anymore. In post WWI England it would have been normal to read children stories with the undercurrent that a woman's obvious place was always as mother and homemaker, and the only good German was a dead German.

As an adult you can take that in it's historical context and still enjoy older stories. But in the modern day, the idea of... where *are* all the girls? And why are entire races of sentient beings getting dismissed as filthy, sub-human, and intrinsically evil monsters? That is something that might come up, and are something some people don't want to read to small kids until they are old enough to understand things were different when these were written.

1u3lq8_9,1u3lq8,"Wow. So much rage in this thread. So many people missing the point. I'd find it interesting to know the gender ratios of the posters in here. Okay, better read, maybe not, but when you really consider the context of what the story would be like if the character was female and the real chances that NOTHING else would be different if it were the case, when you *really* try to consider that, this is a fairly interesting exercise. You would only be able to do it in a fantasy. Any book grounded in reality with a female lead character would have a different treatment if it were the only difference, unless they change reality. Consider the film Wild Wild West. Will Smith plays a black sheriff, and the movie goes straight into fantasy because he is a treated in an unrealistic way, people behave completely anachronistically. They don't react to his race. It would be completely impossible to make that character a female. It would change the entire script. There's no possible way the film would get made without changes specifically to make people treat the female sheriff differently because she exists.

The reason why it's particularly easy to do that with the Hobbit is because hobbits in general are fairly unsexualised. They're portrayed as wholesome creatures and they don't really have very overt sexuality. So, take one out of their little village and set him loose, and Bilbo proceeds through the story without doing anything that is distinctly masculine. He's not stereotypically strong or storybook heroic, he has universal characteristics of cleverness, courage, and endurance. Female characters are rarely given the treatment where their gender is not worth mentioning, and their qualities are given priority. That's the point. It works very rarely.

Certainly I can agree that women/girls are not well represented in children's lit, but changing Bilbo's gender and calling it an improvement is almost as bad. You're just projecting the original problem into a work that wasn't written with it, since if no one is making an issue of gender in the book, and the story isn't changed in any significant way, then the ""improvement"" is coming from your own baggage (""isn’t it amazing that a girl did these things"").

1u3lq8_13,1u3lq8,"The title doesn't do the idea justice, but the idea itself makes a lot of sense. 

What would happen if Bilbo were African or Asian? Would it change anything? Probably not. Race is never an issue (at least in the real-world sense. him being a hobbit is an issue, but not the one I'm getting at). It doesn't matter what race he is; it doesn't affect him as a character in the slightest. A white child can relate to him no more or less than any other. 

But what would happen if Bilbo were explicitly labeled as White? It would still be a great story, and Bilbo would still be a great character, but you would alienate everyone who wasn't white. Perhaps not in any great way; but it would still create a disconnect between the reader and the character. After all, if it weren't important to who Bilbo was as a character, why would the author have mentioned it?

Unlike race, however, gender differences are embedded in the english language. You can't help but know that bilbo is male, it's reinforced every few sentences. It creates a subtle, yet potentially powerful, disconnect between the reader and the character. 

When male characters are off doing cool things like adventuring and saving the world, while even the strongest of their female counterparts are forced to endure countless pages of gender-focused content, even children will see the pattern. It's hard not to notice that the primary female character in the latest hobbit movie was added as a love interest. Worse, her primary motivation for most of her actions were as someone in love with one of the male characters, not just someone interested in doing the right thing. 

By recasting Bilbo as a female, this mother takes a good story and removes the disconnect between the main character and her daughter. I believe that's as close to an improvement to The Hobbit as anyone could make.  ",lacronicus,2013-12-31T21:51:31Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,13

Perhaps, just maybe, that was the point. Even though the characters in The Hobbit are all male they could just as well be androgynous. Tolkien is the last author to meddle with a modern ethical concern, seeing as he  very much disliked allegory and wanted to write for the sake of story-telling.

Even if she were the perfect woman hero... there is still the awkward fact I could probably name a greater number of significant *horses* from LOTR than significant women characters.

And I think that folds into what the article was saying about how in fiction not enough heroic characters simply happen to be female. (And why they were so charmed with the result they got by making the Hobbit's Bilbo a she instead of a he). 

With a large variety of heroic male characters, they can all have different good traits countered with flaws. When there's only one or two significant women characters, and the author is emphasizing the ""wow, a *woman* is doing this?!"" factor, it kind of falls on that character to be the book's representation of all womankind. (And when you have the one woman warrior finding happiness by giving up shieldmaidenry to settle down and have kids, it has a different significance to people than if she was one of several women in battle following different paths).

Conversely, (it's a little sad that) that even to this day, one of the best teenaged girl/women characters out there is Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, because she's resourceful, clever, not throwing temper tantrums, or not having to find her prince charming to win the day. She can work and succeed as a girl, but not have to deal with being ""The Chosen One"" or ""I thought you were a boy!"" super specialness as to why she above all other girls is able to do what she can do.



It's not that gender flipping The Hobbit is wrong or great, it's that it can work either way without it having to be ""gender explained"" in the story why a girl could even go on such a quest. 

It's not a great fix (writing a character as a male then finding/replace gender is still an issue), but that doesn't discount that there does need to be better stories for girls that doesn't revolve around being princesses/finding prince charming/only special girls get to have adventures/desexing gender as a cheat code to write stories.

Even if Bilbo were a girl I think it would take away from their adventure, distracting them from their true goal.

It ain't easy to go out and risk your life and limb for something.  If you don't have a culture telling you you're not a man if you don't, that everyone's equal, then a lot of dudes wouldn't do it.  Gender roles and sexism are a necessity to convince human beings to go do violent, dangerous shit.

A lot of women don't understand or appreciate the drive to be respected by men, for doing that which men are thought to have to do.

But if a man chickens out, he's a pussy.  Fair or not, that social pressure has its advantages when you live in a world of physical power and physical danger.

Bilbo isn't Bilbo outside of the context of this warrior society.

The 5 year old not understanding historical context, that was my point as well. You can't really give a story like the Hobbit to a five year old because you *can't* explain to them that the time it was written the world used to be a different place and don't take it personally. We as adults can. (Frankly though, all gender aside I can't imagine someone reading the Hobbit to a five year old without gutting the story of a lot of plot points like giant spiders and threat of being eaten by trolls as well. I think it would probably have been better just to leave it til they were older).

From your post, I do think you also missed the fact that in the article, it was the kid that actually made the change to the story, the mother was only going along with her. The fact the story still worked well was what brought up the bigger discussion.

Of course, had the original terms of copyright had not been changed, the Hobbit would have already been in the public domain. Imagine if Wishbone had been the one telling it. I'm sure there would be just as many people flipping their shit over Bilbo as a Jack Russell Terrier.",Quarantini,2014-01-01T06:49:20Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,59
1u3lq8_60,1u3lq8,"> The fact that you're so upset that one mother read the Hobbit to her daughter with a heroine instead of a hero gave me that idea. 

I'm not upset at the idea of one mother reading the Hobbit to her daughter with Bilbo as a woman. I'm upset with the idea of retroactively changing characters to insert modern values. You're projecting your own issues with gender dynamics and general influence of patriarchal power dynamics onto the issue to the point where anyone that disagrees with you is upset that a female character can be a woman without conforming to every stereotype in the book, instead of the larger issue of retconning when other (and in my opinion more valid) options are available. You're like a bull rampaging through a china store that only sees red. It weakens your argument when you refuse to defend yourself on a level playing field and would rather stand on a hill with a megaphone yelling, ""The Patriarchy!"", instead of actually doing something about it. *That* is what I'm troubled by.",neekneek,2013-12-31T18:40:19Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,60

The daughter enjoyed having a female protagonist - evidenced by her insistence that Bilbo *is* a girl - and the mom changing the pronouns to female ones didn't hurt the story in any way, and her daughter seemed to enjoy it.

The author of the article was making an observation that while many books have a female protagonist, many of them make serious efforts to change the story to fit a stereotypically female protagonist.

The author of the article wasn't speaking to how ""progressive and inspiring"" The Hobbit became when she changed Bilbo into a female.

It was a simple thought experiment and certainly not one to evoke such hostility as you are bringing forth.

I'm not arguing for ""my story"".  I haven't written a story.  I was offering an example of how a *typical* story about a female protagonist progresses, and simplifying the situation for /u/othniel01, as they asked for some clarification.

The day after we finished reading it, he asked if he could have his own copy. The one I'd read to him was an extra, anyway, so I gave that to him, and he's been reading through it since.

The problem with the Hobbit trilogy is it is based off a short book. When I read it was being made into a trilogy I knew it would never work. The LOTR was huge. And Peter Jackson had the Silmarillion and Lost Tales for further references on the world. As those who have read the books as well well know Jackson's movies are really only a snippet of everything in the books. As long as they are he cuts a lot out because it just doesn't all fit.

I tried reading Fellowship immediately after The Hobbit as a little kid and it was an agonizing slog - couldn't get a genuine read-through until several years later.  There's also a plot doldrum in the middle of The Two Towers that can be tedious at any age, so newcomers to LOTR should plan for that and not be deterred when they run into it.

Definitely read The Silmarillion at some point after the novels.  It's epic mythology that is most rewarding after you've already built up a personalized familiarity with Middle Earth.  Written pretty smoothly and easy to read, for the most part, but it resonates most deeply when you already feel connected to the material.  Otherwise it can seem a bit thin and random because it's so far removed from the time period and societies of the novels, occurring in the ancient history before them.

A writers first book(s) is often not the masterpiece. The long descriptives in LOTR are beautiful, but I personally couldn’t appreciate them until I was an adult in my 30’s.

9bprt0_53,9bprt0,"Correct, LoTR was begun only after the publisher wanted another book after *The Hobbit* took off. Originally Tolkien tried to submit what he had done of *The Silmarillion*, but his publisher refused saying that people wanted more hobbits. Tolkien also suggested that LoTR and *The Silmarillion* be published together as one massive book titled something like, The Book of the Ring and the Jewels. His publisher (needless to say) refused. Also, LoTR was written as one work made up of six individual ""books"" that was broken into a trilogy to make it cheaper for his publisher -- sales were not expected to be high.

The Silmarillion was never actually completed during Tolkien's lifetime. His son, Christopher, compiled what he thought was the best version of the major stories together into what became The Silmarillion. Eventually his son decided to just publish his father's unfinished manuscripts, a process that is still ongoing though the Middle-Earth centric publications were primarily done with the Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-Earth.",kazingaAML,2018-08-31T19:35:38Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,53

ucog44_2,ucog44,"*The Hobbit* was written for two audiences, children and the adults who read to children. Tolkien's voice is heard throughout, unlike in *The Lord of the Rings* where it's really only heard in the Prologue. Other than Thorin, the dwarves do not have very distinct personalities because the story is very much about Bilbo, not about the dwarves. 

Gandalf is a master trickster as much as he is a wizard, and Bilbo is his protege. Bilbo's ring merely gives him invisibility, and that doesn't do him much good against a dragon who can smell his presence. Gollum is Bilbo as he could have been if he had not found the courage to escape the goblins. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is a crucial turning point in his adventure and his life for reasons having little to do with the ring.

Bilbo is 50, not 20, so in a sense he is undergoing a mid-life crisis. During much of the adventure he has to remember how to be a boy on a boy's adventure. But curiously he also ends up as a trusted advisor and even savior of the dwarves when Gandalf is unavailable. And he is the one member of the party who dares to defy Thorin when greed threatens to cause a needless a war over Smaug's spoils.

*The Hobbit* was very well received by critics in 1937. C.S. Lewis compared it to *Alice in Wonderland*, *Flatland*, *Phantastes*, and *The Wind in the Willows*, not because the plots had anything in common, but because they take place in their own delightful little worlds. And he compared them as well because although classified as children's books, they could be read and enjoyed again and again at any age.

ucog44_4,ucog44,"The Hobbit was his first foray into that world. He gave a draft to his son Christopher to see what he though, he liked it and Tolkien said well that's good enough for me and got it published. People wanted to know more about that world, the people, the ring of power. So he set off to make the Trilogy. Which in his foreword that Serkis reads he says he wanted to make a very long book, and also indulge his love of languages. They read very differently than the hobbit. His friends were quoted saying they didn't like to go on walks with Tolkien because he would just stop to look at a tree for 20 minutes. It really shows in the Trilogy in the best way in my opinion.

The thing about the Trilogy is, it is a beautiful heart breaking story. It's an end to things mystical and mysterious as the world of ancient things slowly leave and die out. 

I love fantasy, its pretty much all I read. My DnD group is coming on 8 years. Magical escapism into heroic adventure just clicks with me. And I go through a TON of audio books as I work alone and drive a ton through my day.

ucog44_5,ucog44,"The Hobbit is frequently under-rated IMO. It's always viewed as LOTR's kid brother, and there's some truth to that, but I think it does a lot of things very well. I think of it less as a kid's book and more of a book for adults to read to kids. That ""conversational"" prose in the Hobbit makes it really fun to read out loud. I really enjoy how it mixes episodic chapters that have their own contained adventures, with an overarching quest and character growth. Its moral about getting out of your comfort zone and trusting yourself is especially applicable for kids but is a good reminder for all of us.

You're probably remembering the 1970s animated Hobbit made by Rankin-Bass (the company that made Rudolph and all those other clay-mation Christmas films we grew up with). It had some *unique* takes on how fantasy creatures should look. Cat dragon, frog goblins, bearded spiders, testicle-headed dwarves, and some truly horrifying wood elves.

LOTR is a bit of a different animal. I had read The Hobbit at a really early age, but couldn't handle LOTR for several years after, even though I was very interested in the world. The Hobbit is basically Tolkien's take on ""fairy tales"", like those by the Grimm brothers. LOTR is more like his take on epic fantasy like Beowulf. Though if you've read any of those originals you can tell as much as we think of Tolkien as classic fantasy he was really modernizing those inspirations.

Usual advice for LOTR is to push to Rivendell, where the story really opens up. But I think for people familiar with the films, there is so much in that first part that was cut for the films, that it should be interesting.

He was religious and traditional in many aspects of his life, and his work is largely a product of his time and his character.  On his omission of female characters in The Hobbit—it was 1937 and the active roles of women were not as prominent in the public sphere as men.  It’s almost as though a lack of sex, intrigue, or romance in a story results in a lack of female characters.  In LoTR, Arwen and Eowyn’s stories were largely that of a love triangle, tied to Aragorn.

It’s oversimplified, tunnel-vision, where the stories of men overshadow the stories of women because the actions and importance of women remain in the peripheral in male authors’ own real worlds, and therefore in their own made up worlds.  It is a reflection of one’s narrow perspective and ones narrow perception.  

Awareness, perspective, and perceptions are expanding (I found myself intentionally avoiding the term *diversifying*, because it’s apparently a dirty word these days), and with it world building is more complex. 

In 1954, when LoTR was first published, women were entering the public sphere more.

Because he felt that male was the most appropriate gender to convey the ideas he had for those characters within the context of the world he built.

Why?

Because most of them were fighters, or monarchs, or leaders, or otherwise roles that would be filled by men in the world he built.

Why?

Because it's his fictional world and that's what he decided was true for the fictional peoples in his fictional universe.  Which is honestly all it boils down to.  It's his world and he can write it however he damn well pleases, can't he?  **Within the context of the Middle Earth he created**, none of the rulers, fighters, and people of other import to the story of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield, and the dragon of the Misty Mountains would have been women.

So if the oral Bards who recited The Odyssey before Homer's time had any anxieties about foreign, Middle Eastern powers, it wasn't about the Persians. Before The Achaemenid Empire, the Persian people were nomadic, not united, and certainly no threat to the power of Greece. 

The Assyrians and Anatolians are mentioned in Homer's writing, and the Phoneticians and Egyptians are written of extensively in The Odyssey and Iliad. Maybe there was some anxiety about foreign Middle Eastern powers (and you could probably make a fantastic argument of that), but it certainly wasn't of the Egyptians and Phoneticians. Homer writes of their trading habits, their exports and imports, their gods and religious pantheon. Zeus tells Odysseus to see the King of the Phoneticians - that they will treat him well in his travels home. Now the Greeks held many prejudices but I think we can assume they held favorable views of at least the Phoneticians and Egyptians. Their wares and religious culture and military strategy and their vessels are spoken of very highly. I feel like, for an oral poem, praising the skills of a shared enemy wouldn't impress the audience too much.

""The East"" certainly has a foreign, other-ness quality that's been used throughout Western Civilization, but in this example, I think Tolkien is utilizing the specific language of Homer and other Epic writers in the interest of tradition. I think for Tolkien, it was a way of describing a group of people - any people, by their location. The Huns are 'of The East' in the Nibelungenlied, the Hyperboreans dwelt ""on the Northern Wind"" in The Odyssey, Egil's Saga and Volsung's Saga both refer to groups of people by their directionality. It was a theme, and Tolkien was just utilizing that in his narrative - in my opinion. You could possibly convince me otherwise of that.

Onto Tolkien's inclusion of women in LotR and his lack of women in The Hobbit - He certainly did chose his source material - but women are not a major aspect of traditional epic literature. Sure, in the Odyssey, women are clever and intelligent, and often the equal of their husbands (Penelope or Calypso or Charbydis are reckoning forces, some literally) but even then, in The Odyssey there's 1 female for every 10 males (for Penelope and her Suitors, that's an understatement) and there are hardly any women in The Iliad at all. Helen is described as a bewitched whore - and that's about it. And she's nice to look at. She's given significantly more depth during her appearance in The Odyssey, but otherwise, she and other women in traditional Greek literature are just plot mechanisms and foils. So some of Tolkien's source material had a diverse coalition of female characters, but some works had almost none. Beowulf, Nibelungenlied, Hildebranslied, and other Germanic/Icelandic epics are sorely lacking in female characters. But the Shanemah has a diverse coalition of warrior women - an that is a text which I think inspired a number of female characters in LotR.

Excluding The Hobbit, which as OP pointed out, has no women, LotR and the Silmarilian do in fact have a diverse cast of strong female characters. There's Sam's wife, the Valar are almost equally divided between men and women, Lady Haleth, Galadrial, Shelob is a female, Arwen is no slouch and there are others. There may not be very many women in Tolkien's stories, but all the women he includes are strong, formidable, wise, and often times dangerous. I can't think of a single feeble, weak willed woman in the entire trilogy and I can name probably half a dozen sniveling, unmanly, subjugated men. 

I do agree with you about your final point - artists are separate from their art. John Lennon was a terrible father, Albert Einstein was a womanizing shithead, Cobain was a debilitated dope addict. I just don't think it's fair to label Tolkien's writing as 'racist' or 'misogynistic'. There's not enough evidence in his writing to suggest that to be true, and there's no evidence to support that from his personal life. I can't tell you too much about his personal life, but even if he himself had racial prejudices, I don't think LotR can be interpreted in the way you've described. The women he does include are inspiring, the racial themes are more aligned with traditional epic narrative and language than they are 20th century prejudice and racism. But, ya know. It's worth considering. I enjoyed your argument very much.",silverbean,2018-06-28T01:33:21Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,28

u3jebo_5,u3jebo,"The r/lotr subreddit did a slow read-through of the series in 2021. There's a whole document breaking the trilogy down into a chapter or two every week over the course of a year. I've read LotR several times but really enjoyed the slow read. (Don't spend too much time on that subreddit though - spoilers and very academic lore discussions abound and you WILL get overwhelmed)

Also, I don't usually recommend this but... watch the LotR movies first (NOT THE HOBBIT MOVIES!!! AVOID THOSE UNTIL YOU""VE FINISHED THE BOOK) They are not 100% accurate to the books but they do a good job of catching the feel of the books. Also, they leave a lot out, so the books still feel fresh in some ways. It can help to know there's exciting stuff coming when you get bogged down by the rather slow beginning of the Fellowship of the Rings. 

 I personally think it's totally fine to skip over some of the prose and descriptions (and poetry) on your first read through. I love Tolkien's world building, I have read the books more times than I can count and appreciate the beautiful writing, but I know the drive to just get to the action. If that's what you have to do to keep going - do it! You can always come back to read and enjoy later.

**TL;DR** If you like the prose but don't have a lot of time r/lotr slow read through is your jam. If you get bored by prose watch the movies and skim through the slow bits, you can always re-read

Sometimes this means the story slows to a crawl but think of it like a stroll through a forest and enjoy the scenery as Tolkien describes it. If you try to fight his pacing you'll probably end up hating the books. They are not action stories. Also, be aware LOTR is written quite differently from The Hobbit.

There are some stories from the Silmarillion that have their own books. “The Children of Hurin” and “Beren and Lúthien” in particular are good reads.

oz8v95_3,oz8v95,"I would recommend reading Tolkien's Essay Titled - On Fairy Stories. He refers to all Dues Ex Machina-like things as a eucatastrophe and that it is a core part of any fantasy story. Tolkien uses the eucatastrophe in all his stories like the eagles in the return of the king, the killing of Smaug, and Gandalf arriving at the battle of helms deep to name a few. If we look at other stories we see eucatastrophe happen all the time the Woodsman saves little red and grandma, jack cutting down the beanstalk just in time to kill the giant, or the big bad wolf falling down the fireplace and burning to death. So this was an intentional choice        

Lore wise it is said that Eru or God has a chosen path for everyone throughout Arda. Luck, Fate, and chance is a huge theme in the hobbit. The Dwarves and Gandalf ""randomly"" choose bilbo Bilbo found the ring by ""accident"". Bilbo also found the Arkenstone in a mountain of gold by ""chance"". Now things didn't happen by accident they were laid out by Eru so the ring would be found and later destroyed by Frodo. If we look at the early pages of the Silmarillion when Morgoth when against Eru's song by creating his own melody ( were getting into some deep lore here folks). Eru told Morgoth that no matter what he did will always contribute to Eru's ultimate plan.

Because it sounds like you have either only watched the movie (cartoon or live action) or read the comic book.  The Hobbit is NOT a children’s book nor is it a simple fairy tale. You’re missing the point here.
Bilbo was a vital part of the story because of his size.  Hobbits in general are known to have large gardens, find peace in the small and simple things, also they speak to small animals and birds. The thrush did NOT tell Bard about the missing scale. No one knew Smaug even had a missing scale until Bilbo snuck into the cavern. The thrush was the one who shared that tidbit with Bilbo, who in turn shared it with Bard.  The humans of Laketown had a long history with Smaug.  There was no magic arrow.  Bard’s father, Girion was the Lord of Dale and initially fought Smaug and broke the scale off.  
Bilbo was the whole reason Smaug was killed!  
Also if you remember correctly, Gandalf was always a part of the story. HE is the one who called The Eagles to help.  The dwarves were never motivated by greed. Thorin was blinded for a time, but the initial motivation was to get the dwarven king back. The elves simply didn’t trust the dwarves with all that wealth because it had driven Thorin’s father mad. The Orcs and Goblins were just plain evil.  The humans had just seen their friends and family die, their town leveled and had nothing to rebuild with.  The only ones truly entitled to the treasure were the dwarves, who it belonged to initially.  
Bilbo the Hobbit was no easy out in this story.  In everything he did throughout his adventure, his actions were pivotal all the way up to and including the desolation of Smaug.",,2021-08-07T01:27:56Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,4

That said, in the case of The Hobbit I sympathize with your perspective, because I don't find the two incidents you mentioned to be all that dramatically satisfying. There is a futility and lack of agency to it, but it seems almost not to realize its futility and lack of agency, because it is written as ""eucatastrophe"" rather than satire.

750i5b_3,750i5b,"The LotR trilogy is easily my favorite series of all time, rivaled only by Harry Potter for me. I've made a point to reread at least the main trilogy every year since my sophomore year of high school, about 6 years ago. 


What I love so much about Tolkien's universe, is the attention to detail that he put into his work. I mean, the man actually created his own language, several in fact! The way he describes Hobbits and Hobbit culture at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring rarely comes into much importance later on in the saga, but it paints such a vivid picture of what life is like for the Hobbits that I can easily visualize it in my head. Tolkien had the family tree of every main character drawn out to, at least, a few generations. A lot of characters and names we'll never read or see mention of in the books, but just the fact that they exist adds so much to the world building.


Now I consider myself to be a diehard Tolkien fan, so I feel compelled to recommend you the other novels in that universe:


I'd start with the Appendices actually, at the end of Return of the King. This gives more of the lore that takes place after the trilogy, along with things like pronouciations and family trees. It is absolutely essential to read this along with the LotR trilogy, in my opinion.


The only other book that is a must read for me is the Silmarillion, Tolkien's bible. Though it reads like the actual Bible at times, it is a ""brief"" overview of everything that happens in the LotR world; from creation to the end of the Third age, and even hints at events beyond then. I find myself skipping certain chapters here and there, so don't feel bad if you find it to be a difficult read.


The Letters of JRR Tolkien are a nice read, and indeed a glimpse, into the mind of the author. Not an essential read, but it does add more lore and provides corrections or explanations on things that were not adequately done so in the books.


The Children of Húrin is a much smaller story in both length and scale compared to the LotR books, but it is measurably darker and much more sinister. I have only read it two times, as it is a bit of a downer for my tastes, but I would recommend it nonetheless.


There are other books that I am forgetting to mention, it's early I haven't had my coffee yet, but if you really want to learn more about this wonderful universe, there are endless resources online that will explain everything to you. r/lotr would be a fantastic place to start.

750i5b_29,750i5b,"I think Tom Bombadil serves several purposes. He is a helper on the quest (quest heroes in traditional epics and fairy tales generally run into helpers who have the exact qualities that they need), so he rescues the hobbits from their first serious challenge, Old Man Willow, which they cannot overcome by themselves. (Traditional quest heroes also usually fail their first challenge, as Bilbo does in burgling the trolls in *The Hobbit*.) 

Tom also demonstrates the nature of the Ring. It feeds the desire for power. Hobbits, who by their nature generally don't desire power, turn out to be better guardians of the Ring than other creatures. Thus Gandalf, by nature a powerful being, fears the corruption of the Ring because he knows how it would corrupt his desire to use his power for good. (Gandalf seldom exercises the power within him; he uses advice and persuasion, believing in free will, not domination.) Tom Bombadil is similar in this respect: he has a great deal of power, but chooses not to use it. He freely sets boundaries on his desires: he is the master of his land, but does not claim ownership of the beings within it, who all belong to themselves. Thus he does not desire the Ring--and the Ring has no hold on him. Frodo feels no threat from Tom to his possession of the Ring, so he freely hands the Ring to him when Tom asks. Tom remains visible while wearing it because the Ring has no hold on him. Frodo does feel threatened when Tom plays the trick, making the Ring disappear (in a neat inversion of its usual power over others), resulting in Frodo playing his own trick: putting on the Ring and becoming invisible to his fellow hobbits. But Tom (literally) sees through him, tells him to take off the Ring (""your hand is more fair without it""), which Frodo does and the moment passes. Tom is the only being in the narrative who lacks desire for greater power than he possesses; he is thus a foil for those who have great power but remain unsatisfied (principally Saruman and Sauron).

Of course, Tom is also an isolationist, withdrawing from engaging with the world. That is ultimately an indefensible position, figuratively as well as literally, as Gandalf makes clear in Elrond's council: if Sauron wins, ""Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First, and then Night will come."" In other words, isolating yourself does not solve the problems of the world; you simply avoid the responsibility of solving them but will likely get trampled by them in the end.

Tl;dr: Tom Bombadil's purpose in the novel is to show how desire for power needs to be limited, but also the pitfalls of isolationism.",Midwestern_Childhood,2017-10-08T17:12:34Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,29
750i5b_30,750i5b,"A lot of these are explained in the book and appendices.

> Why is the world seemingly depopulated? Why is civilization dying out? 

The story in LoTR takes place at the end of the age of mythology and the beginning of the age of Man. For most of the history of the world, there was a titanic struggle between the first more magical races, like the elves and the first men the Numenoreans, and the forces of literal evil - first against the god Morgoth, then against his lieutenant Sauron. One of the things that is repeatedly mentioned in the books is that part of the power of the elves is to preserve things as they are - and since they are immortal this greatly slows progress. Over time though more and more elves have been leaving to go to the undying lands, but the magic they bring to the world still slows development.

The world of men seems to be dying out because the real magical evil that existed in the world was constantly sapping the energy of the human realms with wars and twisting men to fight other men in an attempt to gain the upper hand and finally get rid of the elves and claim the world for the side of darkness. There were absolutely titanic struggles in the past that wiped out whole kingdoms and sank continents...that has left the remaining humans as kind of survivors of a number of apocalypses who are limited in the niches that they can fill in the world because of the still present influence and power of the more magical / evil world.

> What the hell were those things in the mounds? What happened to those Kingdoms the Wraiths ruled? Why is he called the Witch-King - because he is immortal or because he was a mage? What happened to Angmar? 

They were old kings who were seduced to the evil side of things. That whole depopulated side of Middle Earth used to be full of human kingdoms, but the forces of evil captured many of them, like Angmar, using things like the rings of power. Sauron gave those rings of power to human kings in that region to control them and their people, and when those kings died the rings allowed their wraiths to continue existing in bondage to Sauron. Wars were fought to destroy these evil northern kingdoms, and the area was never repopulated because true evil still lurked in the land and was active in picking off and corrupting humans.

So the books are really about the changing of ages, the fading away of a more magical and heroic past into the inevitable, and necessary even if sadly not magical, human future. They are about the way that the balance of power works, and how if things are controlled by beings who aren't interested in change and are undying then things become static and withered as attrition takes over and fatigue sets in. 

The universe that Tolkein created is really intricate, and one of my favorite things that isn't in the Hobbit or LoTR is the explanation he gives for the beginning of the universe and why there is evil in it.",Anjin,2017-10-08T18:55:11Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,30

750i5b_37,750i5b,"Thanks. I'm glad if it helped. I don't think there's a lot to say about what Tom is capable of besides what Tolkien shows us in the two chapters Tom appears and what Gandalf says in the Council of Elrond (which isn't much). His origins are equally murky, and Tolkien didn't seem interested in pinning them down. So anything I say/think is speculative, rather than interpretive. (The earlier explanation is interpretive: arguing what specific textual elements mean, whereas speculative means that the textual elements just don't exist and I'm having to guess based on general comments Tolkien makes elsewhere. Do be aware that what I was saying is my interpretation; others may argue differently.) 

I speculate that within Tolkien's cosmology, as set out in *The Silmarillion*, Tom Bombadil is probably a Maia, like Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and the balrogs. He came into the world with the Valar and other Maiar when Iluvatar offered them the chance to make the song of creation real, but for reasons unspecified didn't stick with them. By his own account to the hobbits, he has been in Middle-earth before the rivers and trees, before ""the first raindrop and the first acorn"": that sounds to me like before Yavanna created the plants in *The Silmarillion*. He has seen everything since: in fact, I think the tale he tells the hobbits, taking them through history back and back to the very beginning, when he falls asleep, mirrors his own personal history. He ""nods"" as if falling asleep because he gets to the point before his own awake and aware existence. The one contradictory element for all this is that he tells them he was there ""before the Dark Lord came from outside""; however, Melkor/Morgoth entered Arda with the other Valar, so it's unclear how Tom Bombadil could have come in before him. 

I doubt Tolkien wanted to pin it down so exactly anyway: as a Catholic, he was fine with a sense of mystery cloaking some things.",Midwestern_Childhood,2017-10-08T19:25:18Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,37

750i5b_39,750i5b,"Essentially, since the amount of time that elapsed since the ring was lost, everyone was more or less starting to think of all the old stories as “legends”. He only had an inkling of what it COULD be (I stress that because he had many pressing matters that he constantly dealt with and following up on veeeeery rare research materials wasn’t exactly priority, especially all for an inkling) but enchanted items weren’t exactly that unheard of, at least on Gandalf’s part. Sauron was also obviously growing in power but no one had any fucking clue where the ring was (except Gollum, more or less). I only say more or less for Gollum because he didn’t really know what it was and he only really knew who had it. When Gandalf was more certain, enough to really look into the matter, the Shire was the perfect hiding place in the mean time. No one there had any clue what it was, Bilbo (and Frodo) was apparently very resilient and Gandalf and the Rangers worked very hard to ensure that the hobbits/the Shire remain fairly unheard of on top of it all. It wasn’t until Gandalf learned about the dealings of Bilbo’s adventure with Gollum and getting the ring, seeing the effects in Bilbo, finishing his research on it (and verifying with the inscriptions), finding out Gollum was looking for him and then that Gollum was captured and spilled all his knowledge, that he really freaked the fuck out and made that his priority above all else.

So it definitely wasn’t a loophole, more so that shit was getting serious real quick once Sauron started coming back into power and being. During this, Gandalf was constantly trying to fix/help out all of his allies, considering how powerful and knowledgeable he was.

750i5b_42,750i5b,"Here's the thing though: many things that work in books do not necessarily work in movies and vice versa. They're two entirely different mediums. So while the movies don't give you all the nuances of the books, it's pretty hard to deny that the movies succeed at showing the grand, epic scale of the war. It's like comparing apples to oranges. I understand why avid book readers get upset, but honestly the movies, if anything, have most likely expanded readership rather than caused people to substitute the movies for the books (i.e. people who want to read the books will most likely not be dissuaded by watching the movie). I think of them as compliments to one another, with each showing a different aspect of the same story. For instance, in the books Tolkien focuses mostly on the hobbits and their perspective while embarking on this huge journey. And that narrative strategy is successful, in my opinion, at taking the reader along the journey. But if the movies focused on the hobbits as much as the books do, it would have been seemed strange; the movies tell a visual story, and as such we expect to see more of the bigger picture (e.g. Saruman's ""a new power is rising"" speech in two towers; the movie does a better job at capturing that epic scale) ",Brucewayne39,2017-10-08T14:51:16Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,42

That would’ve been much harder to convey in the film, where everything is compressed, and would’ve confused the fuck out of audiences who weren’t already familiar with the book. I always think it’s enourmously naive to wonder why Tom was cut from the movie. The whole point of Tom is that he doesn’t really make sense, and doesn’t have an explanation, that just wouldn’t have worked at all. The only inclusion of Tom I could see working is a small dialogue nod at either the council of Elrond, or in the hobbit when they’re talking with Elrond, I can’t think of any other way to actually include him in the movie.

m6lzvr_3,m6lzvr,"Don't forget there are other books in the series, like The Children of Hurin, which is an easy read (just power through the family tree sections), is very good and takes place in the first age, thousands of years before The Hobbit and LOTR. It fills in some of the deeper lore without more serious reading.

There are also very serious books like The Silmarillion, which is basically a gigantic, steaming lore dump that puts all of LOTR in perspective. It's, unfortunately, very hard to read with hundreds of unpronounceable Elvish names of characters, groups and places. 

And there's a 12 volume set of The History of Middle Earth which contains (to my understanding, I've barely read a few pages from it) many story fragments that Tolkien wrote.

I mention these because they ground LOTR, which never explains who or what Sauron is or why the ending was so significant. Instead of reading them there are also some really great lore videos on youtube that will help put LOTR in perspective.

And there's one thing you need to remember going forward: The Hobbit is a book for children. Each chapter is its own little story because they're meant to be told as bedtime stories.

It reads like a mythological account you might read about any other creation myth here on Earth, so it's not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. If The Silmarillion is not to your taste skip ahead to The Children of Hurin. It's an expansion of a story in The Silmarillion, but more complete and presented as a stand alone story. Great read, I thought. If you do enjoy The Silmarillion, the next step is Unfinished Tales, and then ultimately, Chris Tolkien's 12 volume series The History of Middle-Earth, which is more of a literary and historical read of the making of the Tolkien Works.

As I recall, the silmarils had their origins in Tolkien's Silmarillion myth cycle, that he had been working on in one form or another since 1914.

As I understand it, when Tolkien began working on The Hobbit in the 1930s, he did not originally intend for it to be part of the same world as the Silmarillion.  They were two completely separate literary universes.

He did, however, borrow many ideas from from his as yet unpublished Silmarillion cycle to help flesh out the story and world of The Hobbit.

There are numerous similar-but-not-exact parallels between the two works, and the arkenstone was probably a case of Tolkien recycling his idea for the Silmarils and reworking it slightly to fit into his new story.

So according to the in-universe history that was later established in both The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion, the arkenstone and silmarils are two distinct entities.

Symbolically, there are quite a few similarities from the Silmarillion in his other writings.  It was not accepted by publishers ""as is"" and he continued work on other stories.  Posthumous, his son ""cleaned up"" the Silmarillion to fill in gaps.  This material was mostly a mix of the hobbit stories and Silmarillion + Lost Tales. (No direct source, pure speculation because... Well.. Only Christopher knows for sure where each gap was and which writings he used to fill them).  

I do believe, however, that JRR was not exclusive in his writings.  Once he began the hobbit series, he began to weave The Silmarillion to blend the two.  In my opinion, this occurs mid/late in Quenta and follows into Akallabeth (where the cross-name sharing really begins).  The final story (Rings of Power & the 3rd age) felt a bit rushed and piecemeal recounts of historical references from LOTR.  Quenta was also the point at which he was working on LOTR and revised some of the original Silmarillion text..

So that's kinda my take on it.  I'd really like the capacity to take the three major works (Lost Tales, Silmarillion, and hobbits) and compare them in simultaneous times, as they begin cross references.  The closest thing is really The History of Middle-Earth.

3gs2ol_7,3gs2ol,">By your own logic if it is impossible for one of the gems to have been recovered and unrecognized you have to then ask why the elves didn't RUSH into the sea and the fiery pit where Maedros and Maglor threw their Silmarils and quickly recover them

One, none of the elves knew where this occurred, as it happened after they escaped an encampment of elves and Eonwe prevented anyone from pursuing them. The elves who might've been able to recover them, somehow, were also united to return the Silmarils to Valinor, as that was what was intended until Maedhros and Maglor stole them. Thus making it unlikely for anyone to attempt to do it, even if they were one of the few who might have some vague idea of where it landed.

>No. If you've read the Silmarils you have to remember that the wars weren't fought because the Elves really needed those gems or anything. It was fought more as a pride in the Elven race. To take what had been taken by Melkor and to defeat him. You also know that the War of Wrath was largely a failure and it ended as was prophesied in utter sadness and tragedy for everyone involved.

I think it was more tragic that the pursuit of these gems ultimately render the only two remaining heirs so evil and impure that they could not bear to touch the Silmarils themselves. They had shed so much blood, uselessly, as they could not even claim what they had sworn to retrieve. Secondly, the Silmarils were NOT simply a point of pride. They held the remaining light of the Two Trees, which were destroyed. They are unable to be altered or unmade by the Valar themselves, which is another reason the Arkenstone cannot be a Silmaril as the dwarves cut the arkenstone. Melkor didn't steal the Silmaril because it was a particularly nice gem. While never explicitly outlined, it is entirely possible that the initial hope of the rebelling elves was that by retrieving the Silmarils, they might somehow be able to renew the Trees...ya know, the main fucking light source for where they lived. 

Finally, I just have to point out, as someone who has issues with the Valar, half the fucking tragedy of the war was directly caused by the Valar themselves refusing to act. Like, seriously. It's like saying ""Hey, don't wear that blue dress, bad stuff will happen to you"" and then the only bad stuff that happens is that you beat me when I wear the blue dress.

None of the elves knew where Melkor fled after stealing the Silmarils either. But you can't tell me if the Elves are hell bendt on destroying themselves for generations to pursue a gem with no logical way of getting it back from the grasp of a Valar they all wouldn't have sent out search parties to recover them once Maedros and Maglor tossed them away and keep the logic of your argumen.

>Thus making it unlikely for anyone to attempt to do it, even if they were one of the few who might have some vague idea of where it landed.

Then by your own logic this would apply to the Arkenstone were it the silmaril as well. You're contradicting yourself.

>I think it was more tragic that the pursuit of these gems ultimately render the only two remaining heirs so evil and impure that they could not bear to touch the Silmarils themselves.

It was tragic that generations of a noble race destroy themselves through greed and corruption and war and death in the pursuit of objects and pride. The story is about the gradual downfall of a great race through the corruption of material objects and desire and being unwilling to accept the things that happen.

>They are unable to be altered or unmade by the Valar themselves, which is another reason the Arkenstone cannot be a Silmaril as the dwarves cut the arkenstone

How does anyone know the dwarves cut the arkenstone? Isn't it just as likely that the Arkenstone had been around for so long that everyone assumed the dwarves had carved it since no one thought it could have been the Silmaril? Since Bilbo wrote the Hobbit couldn't he have just mistakenly assumed it dwarven?

And the fact that they cannot be destroyed in no way makes them necessary objects. And it also contradicts your next point. No one would have thought they could remake the trees with them if in the very definition of the Silmarils they cannot be altered or destroyed. Condradicting yourself again.

>Finally, I just have to point out, as someone who has issues with the Valar, half the fucking tragedy of the war was directly caused by the Valar themselves refusing to act. Like, seriously.

Umm what? No. Just because the Valar don't take part in helping the Elves with every problem doesn't mean it's their fault. Melkor is the one responsible for everything bad that happened to the Elves not the Valar. It is discussed in the Silmarillion that the Valar don't interefere in every problem of the lives of the Elves out of respect for the music of Eru and in letting it play itself out. It is in the playing of the music that it's true beauty can be revealed. If they interfered all the time it would disrupt the vision of Eru. Basically if everything was chocolate cake an booze and titties and happiness all the time those things wouldn't be valued or special anymore is I think the vision Tokien was putting forth.

EDIT:

>Besides the Silmarils being unable to be cut, they also burned the hands/skin of those unworthy to touch it, not ever noted in the Hobbit.

And who's to say that Hobbits and Dwarves are unworthy? It only burned Maedros and Malgor because of the evil dishonest murderous deeds they had done to obtain them.",lejefferson,2015-08-13T22:28:49Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,9

I took a long time to learn to read. In grade 3 I went from Mr. Muggs (picture books), to Jurassic Park, The Hobbit, The Belgariad, etc. My mom didn’t care what I read, so long as I was reading. My mom took reading very seriously, and was very happy to spend hours in the library with my brother and I. We went to the public library weekly, at times.

I basically skipped an entire genre of books for intermediate ages, going from young kids books to adult.

My teacher thought it was her right to monitor what we were reading. She would walk us weekly to the public library, and then try to corral us into the kids area. I would always sneak off to the adult section, when her back was turned. 

Every time my class went to the library, my mom was either taking us or we had already gone. So, I never took out books. This lead the teacher into trying to demand that she keep my library card. My mom gave her a firm no, and assured her that she was fully capable of keeping track of our reading and she was fully aware of what I was reading and my comprehension on it.

Back to Jurassic Park. My teacher took it away from me, saying it was too scary and too advanced. I went crying to my mom to get the book back. My mom happily complied and told this teacher to never take anything away from me again, especially a book. 

My mom hated this teacher. There were battles over me almost weekly. The teacher thought I should be special ed. My mom knew I was delayed, but very capable of catching up. I proved this is grades 4 onwards, when my grades went from D’s and C’s and into high B’s to A’s. Some kids just take longer. I, in the end, mostly taught myself.

You don't have to do this throughout the whole book, but it helps a lot in the beginning, until you get sucked into the plot. You can find the audiobook on youtube and give it a try to see if it helps. 


If you don't want to try the audiobook, just read aloud. It's a bit of silly advice, but even I was surprised to see how well this book goes along with spoken word. Imagine that you have a kid and you read him a bedtime story. You'll be surprised.

Some tips on reading Tolkien:
I think it is really important to think about what Tolkien was doing/trying to do with these books. I know that sounds dumb, but hear me out. Tolkien was incredibly well educated and these books were meant to be a sort of folktale for the UK because the UK doesn't really have one. The Silmarillion is the actual folklore ethos he created for the UK, but the Hobbit + LOTR are sub-stories. Like Cain and Abel or the story of Noah in the Bible, or Amaterasu in Shintoism, or any of the stories of the Buddha leading up to his enlightenment. So outside of the truly theological this begat this and begat that, Tolkien presents and adventure that was important to the period. A true good versus evil to be passed down in Middle Earth. He was also a linguist,l so instead of just putting gobbledy gook down in his stories, he created Elvish, the first language, and then created the other languages to follow. 

Later he even wrote the Lhammas which explains Elvish, it's other sub-dialects, and everything spoken during the first age leading in to the mannish languages (english) by discussing a fictional piece in the penned by a fictional person named Pengolodh, so now he is creating things like The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Iliad to give a folk history for a place that doesn't have one. It's really an epic undertaking and it all came from him telling stories to a young boy and then writing with other greats like C.S. Lewis.

3phds2_9,3phds2,"I had to read The Hobbit in High school, and the rest in college.   
Having an interesting teacher got me over the initial bumps, and I really enjoyed the books once I got going.   

My suggestions: 
Download one or more of the many 'cheat sheets' or 'cliff notes / spark notes' around.   These helped me keep track of the new words, place names, and people's names that can make it very hard to follow.   
If it isn't unpleasant to you, keep notes as you read... A notebook, note cards, post-it's or pencil notes in the margins.   I tend to retain things better when I write them down, so I do this often.  
I'm reminded by my librarian friends that many times the famous, valuable books were annotated by their famous owners.  Today's books may not survive centuries, but I'd like to think that my notes would jog my own memory on re-reading later, and perhaps give some character or inspiration to an otherwise boring collection of papers that someone else might acquire. 

Watch (or rewatch) one or more of the BBC or PBS documentaries that discuss the books.  Stick to the pre-2000 searches on You Tube.  [one example](https://youtu.be/HkmNHP58OhU).  
They can be a little slow, but listen in the background perhaps.   They discuss the major story lines, making you more familiar with the characters and places.   
   They also offer some insight to the myth origins and how the book reflected the world when it was written.  These themes aren't developed until much later, but I found it interesting to look for items that helped (or hurt) these ideas as I read. 

Finally,  see if you can raise a few other readers to go with you.  A local library, friends, or even here on Reddit.

  - now I looked for a sub, of course there is. /r/TheHobbit,  /r/tolkienfans  possibly more.    Likely to have helpful notes or annotations, and offer interesting discussion.   I wouldn't be surprised if they read the book(s) on a periodic cycle, or answer your question in their FAQ.

The books start slow, explain lots of background that a new reader wouldn't be interested in, and generally aren't jam packed with action or interesting material (SO MUCH WALKING).

I know its not ideal to hear ""just keep reading for a few hundred pages and eventually you'll like it,"" but I think that if you make it through the slow setup chapters you might end up enjoying it more than you expected.  

I like to think of the LOTR trilogy as a single 1000+ page story, with a VERY LONG beginning, middle and end, rather than 3 shorter stories, each with its own beginning, middle, and end.  That helps put the rather boring first 200+ pages into perspective for me.

I also think reading the Hobbit after LOTR makes the former more interesting - Bilbo isn't a huge character in LOTR, so knowing about his story is kinda irrelevant.  Sure the background on the ring is helpful, but it doesn't really impact the story very much.

The Hobbit is by far the hardest to get into, but once it gets going it really doesn't stop. My recommendation to you is this, if you can't get into the actual book try listening to an audio version of it, look around and find a quality version though, I recommend either NPR's or BBC's version of the Hobbit from back in the 70's or 80's. 

When it comes to the movies, I can almost agree that the LoTR movies are worth watching, the same however cannot be said about the Hobbit movies. Peter Jackson and whoever threw that crap together should be ashamed of what they did to the Hobbit. Just because you did a great job with the LoTR movies doesn't make you innocent from raping a great book with those horrible movies you just put out. Skip the Hobbit movies, even after reading or listening to the book. ",OriginalSmelly,2015-10-20T18:23:25Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,19

3phds2_26,3phds2,"When I was a kid, I remember how off-putting I found the cutesy beginning of the Hobbit. Ugh. 

Because of that, I never read the books. Once I realized the movies were coming out, I decided to wait til after I've seen them before attempting to read the books. 

I think one of the things that makes Tolkien problematic as an author is that he was a linguist and scholar first, storyteller second. This mostly means that the formal structure of the work he creates is as important to the story as the story itself. 

The cutesy tone of The Hobbit really turns me off, but if I can ever once get into it, I do enjoy the story, despite all those dwarf names repeated in sequence far too often. It's a series of fairy tales strung together, which makes the various bits of it a bit more approachable than LOTR, but again, the cutesy tone (and a writing style that seems out dated to me) really interfere with the work, if you ask me. 

LOTR? Stylistically, it's written in the form of an epic. Yeah, ancient Greek poetical styling and heroic/epic story styles applied to a modern English novel. I can appreciate what he's created even as I think the formal structural elements get in the way. I understand what he was trying to create, even as it annoys me. 

Neither one is anything I reach for casually, and no, I won't ever be reading the Simarillion or anything else Tolkien wrote without a really good reason. 

For what it's worth, I have all the movies on extended version dvd and really enjoy them (even if the same stylistic elements that annoyed me in The Hobbit still annoy me in the films.)

Find something else to enjoy and try to let go of the idea that you 'must' work your way through this stuff. 

As much as I might admire, say, Don Quixote, The Count of Monte Cristo, or Moby Dick, they aren't books I've reached for to re-read, and 
that's fine with me. Studying them taught me some useful stuff about literary whatevers, and I'm probably more articulate because of it, but that doesn't mean I need to struggle through hefty novels in my free time. 

So long as your reading comprehension levels are where you want them to be, don't sweat it. There are tons of good stories out there just waiting to be read.

6l42q0_1,6l42q0,"Short answer: No.

*The Lord of the Rings* was intended to be a sequel to *The Hobbit*, but as Tolkien was writing the story it sort of took on a life of it's own and became it's own thing. /u/CrispedMarshyMeldoze compared it to Star Wars, but I don't think that's right because Star Wars is a series and each of the films tie into the film preceding and suceeding it. *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* take place in the same universe and share many of the same characters, but they aren't a directly connected story. Furthermore, *The Hobbit* is a children's book and while it's very well written and fun to read, it's not on the same level as LOTR.


If you want any sort of literary companion to *The Lord of the Rings*, I recommend *The Silmarillion*. It was published 40 years after LOTR in 1977 by Christopher Tolkien (JRR Tolkien died in 1973) but it was written sporadically between 1916 and the 1950s and is an collection of short stories that describe the universe that JRR Tolkien created for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* in detail.

Before chapter 1 in LOTR the essential parts of the hobbit are covered -- if you don't read the Hobbit you HAVE to read that - but that alone is fine. Now, like I said reading the Hobbit may help your enjoyment of LOTR to a degree, especially where one particular 'baddie' character is concerned, BUT the books are on two completely different levels. LOTR is a godlike masterpiece, one of the greatest things ever written. The Hobbit is a pretty good kid's book -- I wouldn't be shocked it it could possibly even dampen your ardour for LOTR as you could start think 'huh what is all the fuss about?'

This is from a LOTR fanatic who has read the book maybe half a dozen times.

- Gandalf fights ALL NINE of the ringwraiths on Weathertop *at the same time* a few days before Frodo Aragorn and co get there. They see lightning/lights from afar and wonder what it is, and Tolkein doesn't explicitly tell us what it is, but then Gandalf says later on during the council of Elrond that he encountered them. Fucking badass!

- Glorfindel is a stupendous badass himself, and while I understand why he was swapped for Arwen to make the movie less of a sausagefest, they really did him dirty writing him out of the movies. This guy is such a badass mofo that he was camped out on the bridge to Rivendell a few days before meeting up with Frodo and carrying him to safety in the flight to the ford. While he was there, three ringwraiths came up to the bridge as advance scouts, saw him there, and they just noped the fuck out. Let that sink in.

- Frodo and the hobbits get magic knives made by Numenor I think? in the Barrow Downs in that weird chapter when Tom Bombadil saves them from the barrow wights. They were specifically made to fight the undead I think, and the armies of the Witch King of Angmar when he waged war on them a thousand years before the events of LOTR. In the battle of pellenor fields, Merry stabs the Witch King in the knee with that magic knife, which is what allows Eowyn to deal the killing blow. Full circle, knives introduced early in FOTR and then used at the end of ROTK. 

- Bonus fact about the Witch King: that prophecy about how no man can kill him was spoken (and slightly misquoted) by Glorfindel, badass as he is, after that war a thousand years ago. When his armies were defeated the Witch King fled and Glorfindel say nah, let him go, he's done here, and not by the hand of man will he be defeated. The witch king heard about this and interprets it to mean he's invincible. Eowyn hears this and thinks it means she can kill him because she's a woman. Turns out it was the tag teaming woman and hobbit with an ancient magic knife that takes him out.

I tried reading The Left Hand of Darkness when I was 13, and with her writing style being quite intricate and the novel being complex it was too much for me to really understand at that age. I thought I didn’t like her as an author and didn’t even try the Earthsea series, even though that would’ve been a more age appropriate read for me at the time. I tried her again in my 20s and have loved her ever since (mid-30s now). 

I still can’t get into Tolkien though because I find those long descriptive scenes very boring still. I read them all of his books as a teen and loved the world building and the story, and yeah, I definitely found LOTR and The Hobbit pretty funny, but everything I disliked about LOTR I still do now as an adult.

The army logistics, sizes, equipment, and travel times are realistic. The tactics are realistic. Sauron isn't just an evil wizard unleashing countless hordes of orcs; he executes an actual coordinated military campaign, carefully probes his enemies' defenses, and reasonably adjusts his strategies in response to new information. 

Hell, even the soldiers' psychology is realistic and ahead of its time, with Tolkein using each of the Hobbits to explore a different way war can affect someone. Some people are broken by it through no fault of their own (Frodo). Some are scarred and forever changed by the experience, but manage to go on and live a happy, fulfilling life--though you're unlikely to hear them telling fun war stories (Sam). And some people manage to come out the other side better and stronger than ever, with no deep scars (physical or psychological) to speak of (Merry and Pippin).

Lots of people get bogged down in Bombadil: the hobbits fall asleep a lot and so do some of the readers. I love that section, but I understand why it's hard for first-time readers. It's very important thematically, but not for the plot, which means you can still understand what's going on in the story if you miss it. So rather than skip the whole book, skip Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, and start with when the hobbits arrive at Bree.

11rze37_29,11rze37,"Read the Hobbit, then Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not super deep, but it's a relatively easy read, it's fun, and you will want it for backstory reasons. The Kindle eBook that has all three of the LotR books is okay, but has weird confusing formatting shit going on with the footnotes. I recommend skipping all footnotes if you're using that particular version for a first read - mostly they aren't vital enough to be worth the headache. If you want the footnotes to actually be usable (or if you want to constantly refer to the maps or the pronunciation guide at the end of the book), I suggest getting some cheap paperbacks and reading those instead. It's easier to flit back and forth between the story and the maps and whatnot.

You can skip all the prologues and appendices on your first read, unless you decide you want more at the end - they are mostly there for turbonerds who want bonus lore delivered directly into their bloodstream, or who want to take a calligraphy pen and put elf-runes all over everything they own (read: teenage me).",bigmcstrongmuscle,2023-03-16T19:12:13Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,29

epxaj_19,epxaj,"All that you really need to know about the Hobbit can be summed up in a couple of brief sentences:   
Bilbo Baggins left his comfortable home in the company of 13 dwarfs to go off on an adventure. He was not exactly a willing participant, but along the way he decided to make the best of it. He picked up a magic sword that glows blue when Orcs are around, and a magic ring that made him invisible. Eventually they reached their target, a dragon's den, the dragon was killed, and a big battle was fought. Bilbo went home very, very rich.   
   
There, now you can start in on the really good stuff. Be aware that the tone of the Lord of the Rings trilogy changes a lot from one book to the next, because Tolkein wrote them over quite an extended period of time and his style often reflected what was happening in his life at the time. Fellowship is long, sprawling, almost lazy storytelling. There is a lot of content you can skim through if you start getting bored with the poetry and songs, although you may enjoy that aspect. The action starts picking up about halfway through, then there's a bit of a lull again before the end.   
   
The Two Towers is almost entirely action, all the way through. I find it some of the most compelling reading of the series, especially the introduction of the Riders of Rohan and the development of Gollum as a character.   
The Return of the King is, in my opinion, the masterpiece of the set. There are sequences that make the hairs on my arms stand up when I read them. The mustering of the Rohirrim, the battle of Gondor, Sam & Frodo's trudge through the wastelands of Mordor, the Scouring of the Shire... I fucking love these books.

However, Tolkien did not do this in the case of the Hobbit, or LOTR:

I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.”**

5dpzfx_4,5dpzfx,"Yeah, this is a key differentiator between his fiction and that of his close friend C. S. Lewis.  Both were religious individuals and their Christianity doubtlessly influenced their work, but you could go so far as to say that Middle Earth in its various incarnations was a reaction to the fact that Tolkien felt that there was no body of Anglo-Saxon lore which had persisted through to the modern day, as it had been overwhelmed by centuries of Christian European culture.

He was consciously trying to create an ethno-national story where yeoman farmers, the salt of the earth, were the heroes of a post-heroic age.  The era of direct intervention by the divine is already lost in the mists of time by the Third Age, so any direct parallel to the Old Testament misses the fact that the Third Age is analogous to a much more modern period in time, if there was a ""Hobbit Moses"" he lived in the First Age.

The Hobbits aren't Jewish, they're English common people and the lore of Middle Earth has a lot of parallels to other aspects of North and West Germanic poems and sagas (hint: There are a lot more elves and dwarves -- and all knowing father figures with beards, strange relationships with birds, and funny hats -- in Northwestern European mythology than there are in the Bible).  But even to draw a direct parallel to Germanic myth is to find patterns which Tolkien certainly didn't intend.

Bilbo (and Frodo) are supposed to represent the humbleness and basic goodness of a mythical English yeoman farmer not biblical prophets.  They're notable because they're so normal, not because they're in any way ""chosen"" people.  The Hobbits are distinctly simple people with simple desires and simple pleasures of family, friends, food, drink, and music.  All very wholesome and mundane things that the average reader can relate to.  Gandalf remarks on this on many occasions, especially in Fellowship, and he is constantly pleased and even surprised at their persistence and good nature in the face of peril.  What's notable about the Fellowship itself is that Frodo is in some ways the least remarkable member of the group and the Hobbits as a race are so diminutive and unimpressive that they can pass without notice into the heart of the enemy's camp.  Only the goodness of their hearts and love of each other protects them from the dangers that they face.

Bilbo is less fully developed in this regard, but it's clear that in Tolkien's final conception of the Hobbits bears little resemblance to the Hebrews and certainly not prophets endowed with a special relationship with the Almighty.",Garfield_M_Obama,2016-11-19T04:34:14Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,4

5dpzfx_6,5dpzfx,"You're right that Tolkien wasn't trying to tell Bible stories allegorically in LOTR, and that he drew more upon Germanic and Anglo-Saxon culture than Jewish culture. However, Tolkien certainly was influenced by his Christian faith, though more on the level of his thematic and moral vision than in specific references or allegories. I think if you asked Tolkien whether his valorization of the humble, simple hobbits was related to the Christian virtue of humility, he'd respond in the affirmative. The hobbits' simplicity, at least in Tolkien's mind, didn't necessarily contrast with Biblical ideas of prophets or chosen people; in fact, the Bible tied humility and God's special election together (cf. Deuteronomy 7:6-7 “For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

Certain characters were left out while others were given a more prominent role and some significant events were cut or re-ordered to fit the movie format batter but overall Jackson did a great job with them. The Hobbit movies, on the other hand, are a complete mess compared to the book. They stretched and played with the source material too much for them to be anything more than average.

It took me ages the first time, sometimes tried to put me to sleep and I had to read it with a thesaurus and dictionary on hand.

It was fantastic. It expanded my vocabulary quite a bit and by extension got me an A in AP English. It was actually a challenge to read that rewarded me with incredible amounts of detail the movies still miss even being 3+ hours long each. The books are always better.

Other writers would insert tedious backstories explaining these details as the story unfolds.  Tolkien doesn't.

6s5lmf_18,6s5lmf,"I disagree with the two movies part - there's no way The Hobbit could have been told adequately with just one movie. The Hobbit is a short book because it races from one adventure to the next, without developing any of the locations or characters (save Bilbo); half of the Dwarves don't even speak! Bard shows up like two pages before he kills Smaug and has little description other than ""grim."" Gandalf rides off in the middle of the book and returns  only at the end, his disappearance handwaved away; the final battle is told rather than shown because Bilbo gets knocked out at the beginning.

All of the above is acceptable for a children's book, but it doesn't work when you're asking a movie audience to care about thirteen Dwarves. Especially an audience coming straight from a hugely successful trilogy about the ""Necromancer"" Gandalf dealt with during his disappearance, in which there were numerous fan-favorite characters who are expected to be included in The Hobbit, and in which there's tons of information about Middle-earth/its inhabitants that didn't even exist when The Hobbit was written. There's no chance Peter Jackson could have done justice to the book/universe with a single movie rushing through the Shire, Rivendell, Beorn's cabin, Mirkwood, Laketown, and Erebor, all while trying to make the characters (i.e. thirteen Dwarves) stand out enough for audiences to care if they succeeded or failed in their mission.

7r783m_5,7r783m,"I read The Hobbit when I was 7 and the Lord of the Rings when I was 9 or so: that was my starting point.

They were a fantastic gateway for reading and the fantasy genre, but I think that if Harry Potter had been around at the time, it would have been a better starting point: 

It's more accessible for kids, has a more modern voice/context, and they're more likely to encounter friends at their age who have also read the books, due to the popularization of the series. It's also probably more of a reading-in-general gateway instead of a fantasy-specific one.

The gradual increase in length and complexity of storylines is also fantastic for a child whose reading level will increase over time.

I'd also say that reading Lord of the Rings that early might be a bit of a mistake: I think I'd have enjoyed it more (and been more willing to revisit the series later) if I'd waited until a later age. My reaction to some of the more long-winded, verbose descriptions etc was that they were quite tiring to slog through for me at that point of my life.

So: go with Harry Potter. But if they're ravenous to expand their reading, the hobbit would be a great second step.

As for who is better:

Tolkien is far more original, but Rowling's basically top of the game for the specific thing she did: accessible fantasy that reaches the broadest audience possible while still retaining a level of flavour.

It's like comparing the invention of the lightbulb to a cheap energy efficient light bulb today: one is a more astounding accomplishment, but the other lets you appreciate how far we've come etc. I'd definitely use the latter, but comparing it to the originality of the literal orginal is a bit meaningless :)

The Lord of the Rings is a book of heroics.  There’s a threat to the world, and we need to stand up to it, and these little folks who seem so harmless are going to be the key to making it work.

There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but compare that to the Hobbit.  There is this almost constant sense that our heroes could die forgotten and alone in a cave or a forest.  No one would praise their glory; very few would recognize the loss of the protagonist.  He isn’t given some intrinsic value because he’s a key player in saving the world; he’s not rising to an occasion that demands success or catastrophic failure for the whole of creation.  He is discovering his value, and discovering what he’s capable of purely out of a sense of adventure and comraderie.

j46e4t_6,j46e4t,"I don't think it's as unpopular as you might think. At the moment, I favour The Hobbit above TLOTR, but that's based on one read through each. I'm prepared for my opinions to change when I do a re-read because I've heard that TLOTR is the type of book that readers typically  appreciate and love much more upon the second read. 

My reasons for loving The Hobbit more than TLOTR are similar to yours. I found it to be more consistently adventure-packed and fun, in comparison to TLOTR which is very slow in places (particularly the beginning of TFOTR, it took me about 5-10 attempts to read that book before I finally finished it). The Hobbit also has more charm, whimsy and laughter in comparison to TLOTR which is much darker in tone. Like you, I also adore Bilbo as a protagonist. He's relatable, funny, brave, endearing and his character arc is brilliant. Ironically, despite being a children's book, I think The Hobbit appeals much more to adults because of Bilbo. He's the type of character that a lot of adults can relate to. His life is built on routine, stability and comfort but underneath it all some small part of him craves adventure, despite being afraid to actually pursue it. It's a feeling that a lot of adults who are trapped in mundane daily lives can relate to. I related to Bilbo a lot because of this and consequently, I was more invested in him. Although a lot of the heroic acts he accomplished, happened by chance, luck or with the help of others, he felt like a proactive rather than passive protagonist. In TLOTR, I felt like most of the main characters were passive. They just went along with what was happening because that's what ""good guys"" do. 

It'll be interesting to see if my perception changes when I read TLOTR again, but at the moment, I'm firmly with you in the ""I prefer The Hobbit to TLOTR"" crew.",its_the_stars,2020-10-03T09:35:15Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,6

>  If you look at Lord of the Rings, there’s constant allegory (even if Tolkien denied it): Sauron is Hitler; Saruman is Mussolini; the Dead Marshes are symbolic of Tolkien’s time in the trenches of The Somme, etc. etc.

Just because readers imagine that something is supposed to be inspired by something else doesn't mean that the author was so inspired.  There are innumerable reviews of LoTR which say the Ring is an allegory for nuclear weapons, which is flatly impossible because Tolkien had the backstory and lore for that written before nukes were invented.

CS Lewis wrote an essay once about how so many reviews of his books weren't just critiques of the writing and dialogue and plot but instead included lots of guesses by the reviewer about what Lewis was really thinking when he was writing it.  He was inspired by this, or he was thinking of that, or this is an allegory for the other thing.  As of the time of writing of the essay, Lewis could not remember a single time any of those guesses had ever been correct.

That someone reads LoTR and says ""This evil character reminds me of that real-life evil guy"" is all well and good, but that doesn't mean it was intentional allegory, and people should really stop writing such stuff.",CaveatAuditor,2020-10-03T02:11:27Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,13

j46e4t_20,j46e4t,"Completely agree; I've seen so many people saying Tolkien lied, was hypocritical or inconsistent about his relation to allegories, and they're quick to refer to the ""death of the author"" idea; meanwhile, they actually completely misunderstood what he meant and they are the ones doing what they criticise him for.

Let's read between the line in the article (specifically in and around that quote you posted):

the author basically said: ""Tolkien said there wasn't any direct, intentional allegory, but for some reason I'll say he is a liar because i don't have enough imagination to think of something else than pure allegories. And thinking of allegories doesn't make me enjoy the story, therefore it doesn't give me any joy and it's bad.""

The key is here. If you stop trying, by any mean, to see allegories everywhere, you'll start enjoying things more. You'll find joy in LOTR as much as in the Hobbit, as intended.

7l1j1e_7,7l1j1e,"I'd like to offer a bit of an alternate comparison.

The Hobbit is a book that Tolkien sincerely wanted to write. He was always one for fairy-tales and folk-stories, and The Hobbit is exactly that. In it, he managed to mix many ideas from many mythologies, taking stories from across Europe and putting them in one relaxing read.

The Lord of the Rings, in contrast, is a book he never wanted to write. 

It is not a folk-tale, and it is not a romance. It is grounded in European literary history, of course, but in a much smaller way than Tolkien wanted. Even in language, it seems to be half-way between the dialogue-esque tone of the Hobbit and the King James poetry of Silmarillion, the book Tolkien had wholeheartedly wanted.

The Lord of the Rings is an excellent book I recommend to anyone, and is one of my favourites. But, in all honesty, it is a compromise work, and Tolkien has always treated it as such.

I read LoTR for the 3rd time this past summer, the first being about 12 years ago and the 2nd probably 7 years ago or so.

With every re-read, I find myself enjoying it even more. Though I used to find The Fellowship a bit dull, and pained through the travel portions the first time I read it, I found myself enjoying these so much more now.

5s9wgk_1,5s9wgk,"Eh.  I'm glad you liked it, but there are plenty of stories that have valuable lessons and themes that are also engaging.  I'm not against any teacher teaching this book, and I'm sure plenty have.  But I don't see any overwhelming reasons to make it a standard part of the curriculum.  

One thing The Hobbit lacks is a definite historical context.  Take To Kill A Mockingbird as an example.  It has many of the themes you mention in The Hobbit, and it also has valuable historical lessons.  The social and cultural context of To Kill a Mockingbird is just as important as its values of kindness and acceptance.  Not all books taught in schools have the historical context, and i won't pretend that even the ones that do pull it off well.  But I think it's an important factor when choosing books for a curriculum.  

And while the deeper themes of The Hobbit are universal, I question how relatable the characters and plot would be to a wider, mainstream audience.  It's a largely male-driven and fantasy-based story that many kids won't have an interest in.  Obviously you can say a lot of books currently taught aren't interesting to kids.  I still think it makes The Hobbit a not great pick for curriculum. 

I think your analysis of The Hobbit is good and accurate, and again, it's nice that it had a positive effect on you.  And again, I'm not even against some teachers using this-- especially if they themselves are passionate about it.

5s9wgk_7,5s9wgk,"I agree with you, there is terrific literary value in this novel.  It isn't a hugely difficult read, and it is a nice springboard into many other rich literary traditions.  

Many students do end up reading the hobbit.  Alas, I fear its widespread adoption is unlikely.  One reason is the wide-spread adoption of YA ""literature.""  Hobbit, and other ""old"" novels, do not fit well into the marketing and/or social goals of the companies that have created the ""YA"" genre.  Quality and educational value are irrelevant -marketability is key.

Another reason is that school teachers are shockingly resistant to science fiction and fantasy literature.  As a teacher myself, this was one of the most surprising aspects of the jobs.  Teachers consider themselves independent thinkers and like to talk about outside the box ideas.  In reality, they are very cliquish and like to be validated.  Science Fiction and Fantasy have traditionally been dismissed by ""real"" intellectuals as vernacular, pulp stories.               ",FarmerGiles_,2017-02-05T21:23:21Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,7

5s9wgk_9,5s9wgk,"> It's a largely male-driven and fantasy-based story that many kids won't have an interest in.

I agreed with your post, but not this part. What makes you think kids don't have an interest in fantasy?! They are the largest target audience. I would imagine far more kids would rather read fantasy like the Hobbit than To Kill A Mockingbird or The Great Gatsby. But that's also part of the reason I agree with you - I don't think the Hobbit is challenging enough like those two texts are; it asks less of the pupils I think.

1vfs2y_3,1vfs2y,"Made an account just to respond, so factor that in to my opinion. 

I would very much recommend the books if you at all like fantasy or Tolkien. Martin and Tolkien's styles are quite different. 

I've read The Hobbit and LOTR trilogy, as well as all the ASOIAF books. I consider Martin's writing to be far superior (though obviously owing Tolkien a great deal in heritage of ideas). 

Generally I find Martin to be faster-paced, more interesting. 

I strongly disagree with some comments saying that if you don't like Tolkien you won't like Martin. I got through LOTR trilogy out of a sense of obligation to read a seminal work of fantasy. I got through ASOIAF so far because I literally couldn't put it down. 

Would also like to chime in on the ""slowness"" comments. Don't want to spoil but quite often when I discuss with friends who've read all 5 of the available ASOIAF books, moments that I dismissed as ""slow"" or ""filler"" contain very subtle hints and background information that you NEED to fully appreciate the political machinations and history of the characters involved.

He's just a damn good writer, with an enormous vocabulary, the ability to create a gigantic cast of believable characters, a great knack for storytelling (not even plot as much as narration). The book switches perspective in each chapter which really helps it from getting too dull. 

Yes, the language can get a bit overly epic, and if I never see the phrase ""boiled leather"" or ""a man grown"" again for as long as I live, I'll die a happy man.

I read The Hobbit through Return of the King, and about a 3/4 of the way through return of the king, i hit an elf song, or a three page musing on how a tree looked and hung it up for good.

For ASOIAF I watched all three seasons first, then read the books. They are amazing, however like the cliche, there are no happy endings.   Then you'll be mad at the show for what they skip or gloss over.

Structurally, they jump from one character to the next, generally with events happening in relation to each other. Except for book four and five.

I swore off all Dickens, for example, after reading the first two pages of Great Expectations and paragraphs of description of a hill, and a valley and a cemetery, but oh wait, the actions actually happening over here, many miles away.

It took me two goes to finish reading the Hobbit (although I was 12 the first time, then loved it at 14), and I've read almost all of the LOTR (got busy and stopped reading the 3rd quarter-way through, and then started reading another book, and another... one day though...). 

I devoured the ASOIAF series, and since finishing the fifth shortly after it came out I've been anxiously awaiting the sixth. I think it strikes a great balance between action, dialogue and description—except when it comes to feasts, GRRM seems to love describing food. To me, GRRM does a really good job of weaving a complex story line in an understandable way. One of my friends said she had trouble keeping track of the characters, there are a lot of people that come and go (often violently). I personally didn't have a problem with that. I did sometimes get depressed reading the books though, like, the Red Wedding made me stop reading the third book for a few weeks I was so upset. I see that a lot of people think they're drawn out.

e2owgp_1,e2owgp,"Sam's name literally means ""halfwit"" but he turns out to be one of the wisest and bravest characters in the LOTR universe.  He doesn't lack courage or intelligence or charisma, but he severely lacks self confidence.

When one of the hobbits had to invoke a half forgotten bit of lore, especially Elvenlore, it was Sam.  He had drunk deep from the fountain of Bilbo's wisdom and remembered more than he let on.  He also had a better memory than his master and quickly became the moral center of the group as Frodo's will begam to fade under the pressure of the Ring.

As for his feats, besides the obvious fight against Shelob, he has quite a few.

Two hobbits in history successfully used Elven magic.  Frodo is one, Sam is the other.  They did it together, invoking Elbereth to break the will of the Watchers and escape Cirith Ungol.  Sam also used Galadriel's gift to heal the Shire

3 characters are known to have successfully used the singing magic.  Tom Bombadil, his wife Goldberry -- and Sam, searching for Frodo in Cirith Ungol

Sam is the only creature in the entire history of the Ring to possess it, use it, then give it up willingly and without assistance.  Even Galdalf feared that trial.  That and his use of Galadriel's light proves that Sam's willpower is absolutely enormous.

Sam was also the leader of the team from the moment he rescued Frodo from the tower until the moment the Ring was destroyed.  He planned the moves, he prepared the strategies that would allow them to evade the Eye

Sam was also the physically strongest of the 4 Hobbits, had the greatest endurance, and had far more cunning and guile than he gave himself credit for.  Frodo gets nowhere near the Mountain unspotted without specifically Sam with him.  Neither Merry nor Pippin could have, at the end of their own strength, picked up Frodo and carried him the last few hundred yards to the goal.  

Merry was the bravest of the 4 and probably the smartest, Pippin was young but did great things through his compassion and charisma, but Sam was the superstar of the whole tale in my mind.

My favorite Sam scene happened (in the book) at the beginning of Two Towers, when he managed to correctly guess Frodo's intentions and throw himself into the river to force Frodo to rescue him and take him along.

To me the key mood of the saga is that the shire is his idea of heaven, and what ordinary men gave their lives for. 
Whenever he describes the shire i have a ear image of the pretty, idyllic, but dull villages in Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire. Also the cut and thrust of academic life in those universities. Also uber dull unless you are arguing over some recondite academic point, brewing your own beer and trudging the many public footpaths in the area.

e2owgp_6,e2owgp,"The first time I tried to read Fellowship I also found it pretty dull. First time, I didn't even get through the Party. Now, having read the entire saga multiple times, I find it charming, but at the time I found it boring and pointless.

I'm going to give my second suggestion first, because that's the one I hope you'll follow.

Read only a small amount in one setting. Make sure you're somewhere free from distractions, in your 'ideal' reading space (whether that's a dark bedroom, a cozy living room with a roaring fire, or a park next to a lake), clear your mind, focus on what you know about the setting and the characters, and read just one chapter. Really try to imagine it. Even if it's a bit dull (as the Party absolutely is--it deals with *Hobbits*, the only creatures in Middle-Earth more boring that humans), you can get through one chapter. And maybe you'll gain a little appreciation for what their lives are like.

My Other Suggestion:

A lot of people would probably want me tarred and feathered for recommending this, but one thing that might be helpful *solely to get you engaged with the story and past the parts that currently bore you* would be to actually skip a bit. Look up some chapter synopses or something, and skip to the next good part.

**DON'T** make a habit of this, or do it through the entire series, because you'll miss tons of things by reading that way on a regular basis. Novels should, in general, be enjoyed beginning to end. But just to help you get through the first section (""Book I"") of *Fellowship*, it might not be a bad idea. Some of it is painfully slow for someone who isn't terribly invested in the world and Tolkien's writing style.

If you find yourself still skipping things in Book II (that's the second half of *Fellowship*; each volume is split into two 'books'), it's time to stop skipping. In fact, at that point, it might be time to take a break, then go back and read what you skipped. If you can't do this, well... not everyone enjoys the same things. You might simply be someone who doesn't enjoy Tolkien's writing style. I always find that sad, but it's true. Like I said, not everyone likes the same things. But I'd still recommend that you make an effort to read the entire thing. View the non-action-scenes as the tendons holding the body together.

The bones are the lore and world-building; things that aren't explicitly stated, but that exist in the background. (There's some detail about stuff like that in the Appendix, and far more in Tolkien's posthumously-published works.) The action scenes, and major dialogue, like the meeting with Strider and the Council? Those are the muscle; they move things; they cause things to happen. The rest of the book, the getting-from-here-to-there, is the connecting tissue. The muscles fall right off the bones without it. And considering that the subtitle to *The Hobbit* is ""There and Back Again"", Tolkien was quite aware of how important getting from here to there is to this type of epic tale.",morostheSophist,2019-11-28T07:19:51Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,6

e2owgp_8,e2owgp,"The overarching point that Tolkien was making in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* is that we lionize a lot of stuff that we shouldn't, and the world's a horrible place as a result. The thesis is stated pretty baldly by Thorim in *The Hobbit* -- ""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world"" -- and then Tolkien drives it home relentlessly in LOTR. 

LOTR sets up a whole bunch of characters who are recognizable archetypes in classic literature. You've got Aragorn (the mysterious figure of great destiny), Gandalf (basically a demigod), Theoden (a good and honorable king), Boromir/Faramir/Eomer (great warriors and trained from birth to be leaders), Eowyn (the unconventional fighter who will take great risks to prove herself), and the elves (figures of tremendous power and insight). In the end, Sauron doesn't go down because of any of these people: He dies because of two little hobbits he never thought had the capacity to be a threat. The greatest evil in Middle Earth was defeated because Frodo wanted to do the right thing and Sam wanted to be a good friend. In that vein, you can argue that LOTR is actually a *deconstruction* of the ancient epics that Tolkien spent so much of his academic life studying.

So his fiction is basically a WWI vet shaking the reader by the shoulders and screaming that there is nothing about war or wealth or power that is glorious.

And yet, in the real world, it takes power to defeat evil, and it takes good people to take up power, and use it, to defeat evil.  Unfortunately, the primary means of defeating evil in LOTR was to destroy the means of power, but this is not such a good message.  It is an avoidance of the real struggle between good and evil in all of us, and in our world, which is that doing great good requires the same power that is required to do great evil, and doing one and not the other is incredibly difficult.

Do you remember when Treebeard found Isengard, got sad about all the trees being cut, and called all the Ents out to wreck stuff?
From the film's internal logic and storytelling, this is fine.  It gets a dramatic moment in and is all very well done.

From my perspective as a book reader, I'm primarily seeing the entire Ent race being dumbed down to make it as obvious as possible that Merry and Pippin are the reason Saruman’s main base was taken out.
For anyone who didn’t read the book, the Ents were well aware of what Saruman was up to.  Not all the details, but they certainly knew about the tree cutting.  They were already considering that something needed to be done, but these are incredibly patient creatures which are used to seeing their precious trees assaulted by the uncaring lesser races.  Merry and Pippin were the pebbles that started the avalanche (Gandalf’s words, I think) by providing just enough new information at the right time for Treebeard to call an Entmoot and formally get a declaration of war from all the Ents against Saruman.

Did the filmmakers think this was too complicated for their audience to understand?  Did they think Pippin and Merry were being too passive?  Whatever their reasoning, they chose to have the Ents completely unaware of things going on in their own forest.  Treebeard had to be ‘tricked’ into going near enough to see what was happening there.  The filmmakers then discard the alien patience that practically defines the Ent outlook on the world in favor of an immediate attack because spending time on a second Entmoot to discuss this new turn of events just wouldn’t be good moviemaking.

Aaand just to get extremely petty about it, the filmmakers also completely failed to deliver on the absolute whirlwind of destruction that the angry Ents were when properly roused.  I was really looking forward to seeing that scene brought to life but got the standard, lumbering stereotype that is typically given to larger creatures.  I just dug up both versions to see if my memory was out of line.  Book rampage has the Ents making so much noise they are shattering stone, the hobbits had to cower on the ground stuffing their cloaks in their ears.  Movie rampage has fun scenes of the hobbits throwing rocks at orcs because of course the main characters must be in every scene.  Bah.

So that’s just one scene.  Now multiply that across all three films (third being the worst, first being mostly forgivable) and you should get an idea why I deeply dislike them.   I keep seeing changes that make the story and characters worse instead of better.  I understand that changes are necessary when adapting books to film, but there should be an effort to keep the spirit of a character or an event intact.

64khzr_2,64khzr,"This article seems to me to be a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's true that there are serious flaws with the Hobbit movies and they stem from the need to divert the story just about every time the original plot starts moving (although I do think it's unfair to criticize the 'clomping foot of nerdism' with no mention of anything like a corporate desire to stretch one fairly short novel into three long movies to sell more tickets).  On the other hand I think it's pretty clear that the author doesn't understand what makes Tolkien different from a number of his imitators.  For example:

>The Silmarillion[] takes nerdism to its logical conclusion: a gigantic collection of myths and legends, with no central ‘plot’ as such, which comprehensively explains the history of Middle Earth.

While it's true that the Silmarillion is a collection of myths and legends without a strong central plot the point really isn't about explaining the history of Middle Earth.  The Silmarillion is really about explaining the logic of Middle Earth and the ways in which it functions, because it doesn't function like our universe does now.  That's part of why the Silmarillion is very different from something like the Star Wars expanded universe guides or the recent Game of Thrones Westeros encyclopedia.

I do think there's a tendency in modern pop culture to overexplain things and modern audiences are treated as though they won't accept a story that is thoroughly contextualized and made plausible (either by framing it in the real world or by laying out in-house rules), but I really wouldn't say it's the Lord of the Rings' fault just because it's a successful example of the thing the author doesn't like.",Jazz_Fart,2017-04-10T23:44:20Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,4

50bhq0_1,50bhq0,"The Silmarillion wasn't something Tolkien ever really ""finished"" as a coherent work. His son Christopher went through all the various things JRR had written about Middle-Earth (some as far back as 1917), tied it all together as best he could, and published it. So some of it reads like very dry history, some like mythical allegory, and some of it approaches the storytelling you're familiar with. So it isn't an easy read, at all. But if you want to understand how Middle-Earth got to where we find it in The Hobbit, then the information is there. 
 
Christopher Tolkien went on to publish ten volumes of his father's papers, showing the path that JRR took to reach the final version of his stories, and how Christopher pulled all of this together to construct The Silmarillion. The interesting thing is that he was under a considerable amount of pressure from the publisher and public to put the book out in the mid-70s, and believes he would have done it differently given more time. (I read them. A lot of interesting information, but as a reading experience, The Silmarillion is a walk in the park, comparatively speaking.)
 
If you just want more Middle-Earth storytelling from JRR Tolkien, read ""Unfinished Tales"" and ""The Children of Hurin"". ",,2016-08-30T15:42:28Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

50bhq0_25,50bhq0,"I had this problem with A Feast For Crows, in fact, I think everyone does.  The issue with AFFC is that when GRRM wrote it, it was technically just half of one big book, and his editors made him split it in two.  Rather than splitting it right down the middle, he decided it would be best to divide the two books by North and South.

AFFC focuses on the South, where very little is happening and we're seeing this boring time through the eyes of most of the people we hate.   Cersei and the like.  There are few interesting chapters, it is overall a slog.

This incredibly dullness is compounded by the fact that the previous book, A Storm of Swords, was one of the most exciting books I've ever read, where almost every chapter had me audibly saying ""oh, shit.  Oh, shit!""

But, I had to get through it, because it's a massive chunk of a story that isn't over yet.  In the end, as boring as it may be, I have to know what happens in it to avoid getting lost later on.


So...I overcame it by waiting for the show to catch up because fuck you I'm not reading that.  I dropped it about halfway through.

If the book feels like work to get through, don't read it.  The Silmarillion adds flavor to the setting, but it is not necessary to understand the Hobbit or LotR.  If you don't like it, don't force yourself.  It's just not your kind of book, and that's okay.

Feanor, the silmarils, Ungoliant, knowing that Elbereth Gilthoniel refers to Varda and who she is, plus Beren and Luthien's tale was particularly beautiful. Learning about the fall of Númenor and basically all of Aragorn's ancestors gives more weight to his journey in LotR.

But it is absolutely not for everyone. The writing is dense, and saying it can be difficult to get through is a massive understatement.

Reading the whole book gives a lot of background info for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, so I consider it still worth the effort. I've read it twice since (couple of years in between ;-)) and discovered new details every time I read it anew.

Since it already has taken so long, I would recommend starting from the beginning again. There are so many names or places to remember that makes a slow reading pace that more difficult to keep up.

Dragons, elves, trolls, orcs and plenty of other less known side things were often amalgamations of various stories told about similar creatures. Dragons for example are known throughout the world, but different cultures have wildly different versions of how Dragons look or act.

The biggest influences you can see come from Nordic and Germanic cultures.

He was heavily influenced by the english country side (which he modelled the peaceful shire after) and he was very influenced by his experience in WWI fighting in trenches.

The hobbit started off as just a fun story for his kids that slowly developed into more. A lot of the silmarillion was just back-story for Tolkien's own notes when writing the original LOTR. He used a very Christian themed mythos with much of the concept about Good, Evil, Messiahs, the eternal struggle against Satan (Morgoth/Sauron) and much of the world building in regards to the planes, gods, higher beings, are all very easily attributed to Christian ideas.

The Silmarillion (or parts of it) was by no means just backstory for LotR, it was Tolkien's life's work.

He was a linguist first and foremost, and therein lies his whole motivation for creating Middle Earth; he wanted a setting and context in which his languages could develop. He started writing it in WWI and didn't stop until he died. His goal was to create folklore for England on the scale of Beowulf or the Finnish Kalevala (can't believe no one has mentioned that here so far). As far as I know, he didn't even intend to write LotR until publishers wanted a sequel to the hobbit.

I feel like I need to mention Kalevala again. Tolkien borrowed some of its plot lines almost directly. The story of Turin Turambar, for example, is very similar to that of Joukahainen in Kalevala, and the Silmarillion (3 gems beyond measurable value) are basically the Sampo (a device that creates wealth). Also, elvish languages were somewhat influenced by Finnish, which Tolkien also studied. I believe he liked the language for its complexity, and while there are only a handful of words that are similar, elvish grammar is derived from Finnish to some extent.

So, there are books in this fantasy world, but my question remains, even if they are rare and hard to find, or expensive, as you say, why is there such little mention of them? In other civilisations, manuscripts are the conceits that allow political changes, legal secrets, religious schisms, etc. They are perfect vessels for this type of tale. yet, Tolkien focuses on runes that are found on swords!",FellatioFellas,2020-10-22T12:45:50Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,2

my theory is that indeed there used to be books but they were all, or nearly all, destroyed. Which seems more likely.  It’s also not my understanding that books were so expensive to make that they couldn’t be made. after all, in christian civilisation, popes assigned their making and their delivery to specific areas precisely because their illuminated drawings could be used to educate the poor. 

It doesn’t make sense that there would be no books in The Hobbit. It begs the question if there is a further back story that was never told.",FellatioFellas,2020-10-22T12:39:13Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,3

jfvgbi_5,jfvgbi,"> Books were designed for illiterate people.

Let's just pause to reflect on that statement for a moment.

Ok, 

1) *The Hobbit* takes place in a trolls' hideout, a goblin cave, an evil haunted forest, and a mountain kingdom that was completely torched by a dragon; none of these are going to have a library handy.

2) If this is a larger Middle Earth question, then there are actually quite a lot of books: Gandalf rummages through the archives of Minas Tirith; Rivendell is called a center of lore, and it can't be just because Elrond has a good memory; and the hobbits have several of their own histories, like the yellow book of the Tooks (or some similar name which I can't be bothered to look up right now).  However, *again*, the majority of the story takes place in the wilderness, or in ruins that are thousands of years old, so I'm not sure when our friends would encounter a lot of written matter during the course of the plot.

3) Books are not designed for illiterate people; the examples you cited involved a literate person reading them out loud to a bunch of other, illiterate people.  If the entire society was illiterate (like Rohan in *The Lord of the Rings*), they wouldn't make a book, they would just have pictures by themselves (carvings and tapestries, like Rohan is stated as having in *The Lord of the Rings*) and oral histories (again, like Rohan is stated as having in *The Lord of the Rings*).

(It was the second book with actual chapters I ever read.) I still re-read it every now and then (LOTR also) and still enjoy it. It's a rich and wonderful story, with compelling characters, vivid descriptions, and set in a complex and enchanting world, all told  by a master story teller. (Although, Tolkien wasn't very good at writing female characters. He wrote *about* some amazing female characters, but just didn't do well about actually writing them, instead of writing about them.)

Don't feel bad or worry about not having read  the book yet, just enjoy reading it now. :)

And LOTR is connected to The Hobbit, set in the same world, has some of the same characters, and the events in The Hobbit set things up for some of the events in LOTR. But they are different stories, with different plots. The Hobbit is a personal journey, about, and from the point of view of a main character. LOTR has multiple main characters, changes viewpoints between them at times, and it's scope is an entire world. It also has a slower start, and takes much longer to  have any big action scenes. Still, an extremely well written book, a well told story. But they will feel very different at times when you read them.

And when you do watch the movies, a LOT was left out of the LOTR movies, though I think it was done quite well for the most part. I didn't bother to go see the third Hobbit movie, just too much was changed too drastically. It felt more like an alternate universe fanfiction of the Hobbit, than an actual movie version of the book.

After the hobbits leave the shire and are drawn into the events of the larger world, the tone becomes more serious. 

Even though, I don't think Tolkien is an especially sophisticated writer. It is his storytelling that is so uniquely masterful and captivating, more so than the language and style. The writing differs between the chapters. There are ""empty"" chapters full of descriptions of nature or architecture. There are chapters of slowly unfolding dialogue, revealing some piece of history or illuminating a new character, like Aragorn, Faramir, Saruman, Treebeard - those are my favorite chapters. There are still those less satisfactory chapters that seem rushed to wrap up a storyline (esp in RotK). There are chapters with far too much poetry.

To me it's easier to think of as Tolkien being a linguistics and English literature professor, focused in classical English lit myths like King Arthur and Erik the Red and Beowulf. He based a large portion of The Lord of the Rings from these tales, some character names being the same (Wormtongue is from Erik the Red iirc), the overall worldbuilding and dialogue, but most of all the writing itself is replicating this old style that Bards would sing and tell around a campfire. Lord of the Rings is written to be in the pantheon of stuff like The Illiad and Arthurian Legends, Tolkien intentionally wrote the books in that style to ensure it would be read that way.

I hope no one feels bad if they can't get into the Lord of the Rings books where they love the movies. The writing is emulating a style from about the 15th century. While he did write in a modern English vernacular, the thing is incredibly dense.",,2020-08-17T16:26:18Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,8
ibe0r8_9,ibe0r8,"Had you not read the Hobbit?  Why was the beginning so hard?  


I loved that JRRT took us through some familiar territory as he introduces this great work.  We are immediately reintroduced to Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Ring, while getting to know his nephew Frodo and his friends.  It's a terrific transition for Hobbit fans to new characters by revisiting and expanding on the old, familiar ones.

I loved going back to Rivendale, and learning more about the mysterious Elrond.  On the way, we meet Strider, the Ringwraiths, and are well introduced to half the party before the Fellowship is formed.

I think Tolkien did a great job moving his old fans onto this new work.",LeoMarius,2020-08-17T14:31:58Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,9

ibe0r8_14,ibe0r8,"My story:  Due to dyslexia, I worked hard at reading until it became a passion.  I was always looking for books and my aunt, Rosie, gave me a crate of used ones from her attic.  Most of them were ""junk"" (if any book can be described as such) that I took to the book exchange for credit.  Among the books I kept were the 2nd and 3rd volumns of 'The Lord of the Rings'--volumn one was missing.  I only kept those two books because of the Barbara Remington covers.  

Also kept was a detective novel with a scantily clad woman on the cover.  My 13-year-old self kept it hidden and read it at night; it was surprisingly free of sex and violence.  Years later, I would find out that many of the Harlequin novels that I traded in had much more sex and violence--a pity.

I came upon the first volumn of the LOTR, at the used book store on a Saturday afternoon.  I was pleased to complete the set of books and the cover that formed a strange picture of Middle-Earth. Book in hand, I went to the early showing of a sword and sorcery film at the local theater, The Coronado.

The Coronado was built in the '20s and could hold large crowds.  There was the large main floor with long rows of seats, each with a thick velvet seat covering.  The upper balconies were  roped off, except for special performances.  The ceiling was a navy-blue velvet with tiny lights embedded so as to look like the night sky.  On each side of the screen were pillars with carving of angels and gargoyles and other mythical creatures.  Years later, Steven Wright would call it, ""The Devil's Attic.""  This is where I began reading 'The Lord of the Rings.'

 I was early for the first show.  With my drink and my popcorn in a huge, empty theater, I started reading.  Over the summer vacation, I would spend the hot afternoons reading while listening to LPs and drinking coke from heavy glass bottles of ice-cold Coke.  Even now, when I hear Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's, 'Wooden Ships,' I can feel that summer.  

When finished, I took a perverse pleasure in counting how many pages I had read that summer.  It all came in handy, my sophomore year of High School, when I needed book reports and theme papers; impressing teachers with what and how much you've read never hurts.  

Well, almost never hurts--while discussing LOTR with a teacher who loved the books, he informed me that there was a fourth novel, 'The Hobbit.'  

I finished, 'The Hobbit,' by the following Monday, because--embarrassing. 

Moral of the story:  Always read the ""Also by"" page.

I read The Hobbit a few times as a child, but had difficulty with LOTR.  Gave up for 5-10 years, then tried again in my late teens.  Was capitvated.  Couldn't believe the additional depth.

I recall the following:

* Loved the development of friendship between Gimli and Legolas.  This was powerful to me.
* Thought that Tolkein's finish (The Scourge of the Shire) was masterful.   The folk of the Shire could have never appreciated the task the foursome completed abroad, but they became local heroes for these accomplishments.  This demonstrated something to me about locality, presence and meaning.
* Loved the timeline in the appendix that gave brief glimpses of the future for each of these characters.",veidtre,2020-08-18T04:00:50Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,38

I was so anxious to read it, and it took him so long, fast reading notwithstanding, that I started reading the second volume completely cold, without even having read the Hobbit or anything.

I'll never forget the sensation of being thrown into a different world, similar to ours but different in magic way. The fact of now knowing who was who, but reading about them behaving in internally coherent ways, raised in me powerful emotions. I stopped very soon, after >!Boromir's death!<, fearing more spoiling knowledge.

Some of that was possibly because I'd seen the first movie so the scene setting side of it didn't drag on as much and I could get on with enjoying the story. Return first time I read it I found mind numbing, I really struggled, I'd read a dozen pages and have to put it down, I'd go weeks or months without reading it. It took me so long that by the time I could finish reading it the I'd already watched both the Towers and Return movies. I think it was around five years before I finally got towards the end and got hooked enough to finish it.

I've read them since and don't find them as difficult to get into but that first time was a chore, a chore that was worth it in the end, but a chore nonetheless. I've never been one to watch a movie before reading a book, if I have any intention of reading the book at all I will do it before watching the movie (or series with the way things are being adapted now) but LotR is one that I'm glad I saw Fellowship and Return before finishing the books because I don't think I would have got through the books without them.

It's easy to skim through those (generally pretty short) descriptions if you don't want to imagine them. I suspect that the impatience with the visual descriptions is greater in people who have seen the films first: they already have a clear idea of what Middle-earth looks like that was formed by the movies, so they don't want/need the visuals Tolkien was creating in his imagination--details that were really important for readers who came to the books first (and/or see how the landscapes fit thematically into the story).",Midwestern_Childhood,2020-08-17T15:19:14Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,76

The idea that J. R. R. Tolkien is *trolling you*, that he sat around and thought, ""you know what would be great? I will deliberately bore and annoy my readers, that's a top idea"". I mean it's laughable. Maybe try to entertain the notion that the issue might be with your perception, not with the book. You are not ""supposed to feel that way"", you are supposed to enjoy it.

>The hobbits are described in **extreme detail** and all of it is a life of simple and unexciting days

It's not extreme detail though, is it? It's a few pages. Frodo has left the Shire by, what, chapter 3? Most of Ch. 2 is dedeicated to exposition from Gandalf, so really we're talking a few pages. I mean, in Proust there is *literally* a couple of hundred pages dedicated to a single dinner party. *That's* extreme detail - a chapter or two of scene-setting is not. And besides:

In the first few chapters:

* Bilbo has a birthday party and dramatically vanishes
* The Shire is described to us
* Frodo is entrusted with the Ring
* The Ring's true nature is (half) revealed through Gandalf
* Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin set out on a quest
* They meet elves in the forest
* They become aware of Black Riders and have a near-encounter with one
* They meet Tom Bombadil

How all of that translates to ""nothing happens"", I don't know. Loads happens! It's not at all a ""drab and dull sense of repetition"", and i would suggest that if you feel that way about *Lord of the Rings*, then the issue is with *you* and not with the book.

You could have said, ""I found the opening chapters a bit slow paced for my taste, I prefer a fast moving plot"" - but you didn't, you have to think that there is something wrong with the *book.*",blueslander,2020-08-18T14:37:36Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,102

In fact, the framing devices of the prologue and appendices actually present LotR as a translation of an ancient history.  Tolkien also wove moral and spiritual themes into his story, aiming for something more than a mere thriller.

I'm not saying that I disliked the Hobbit but I saw all the movies and still sometimes struggled to imagine the things he describes (e.g when he spends two pages describing a certain trail. English is not my native tongue but I haven't struggled as much with the language in any other book I've read before. 

I have read quite a few Terry Pratchett books before reading the hobbit and have gotten used to his pace and humour. To me Tolkiens writing style felt sort of dull. His attempts at humour didn't to it for me at all.  It's only then I realised that the hobbit was written over 80 years ago but I do think you can feel that.

Again, I'm not saying Tolkien books are bad at all. But I really do think it's the wrong book for more casual readers (like me) and there are many authors out there whose writing style is more engaging and fitting for our time.

I encourage you to read some of hispanic literature to get more used to the way we talk or write in spanish. Reading translations is not that good, that's why I bought The Hobbit.

I would recommend, if you haven't read them yet, some books by Gabriel García Márquez. Maybe read the smaller and easier ones first. Like *No one writes to the colonel* or *Chronicle of a death foretold. Twelve pilgrim stories* is also a very good one. 

I recommend you Gabo because I'm from Colombia and he's my favorite writer, so I feel like I have to. Nevertheless, I would say that the best you can do is to pick a specific ""dialect"" of spanish to read from and to learn. Any country you pick would open a whole world of things to enjoy.

For example, No one writes to the colonel is a good title but the original in spanish, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba, is waaay better and is different from the version in english.

32pxex_4,32pxex,"> Lastly, why is the book and movie drastically different in some dialogue scenes?

Because they figured it would be more popular as an action movie, I guess.

I remember giving up on The Hobbit movies early in the second one. (I've told this story before and people ask, ""why did you take so long?"") In the book, the scene where they meet Beorn is a witty comedic scene showing off Gandalf's and the dwarves' characters, and that of Beorn himself. In the movie, that scene turns into the party on the run from a werebear before we see Beorn as a person, and they manage to get by him just by slamming the door, because... no apparent reason. More exciting that way, I guess. As if the previous three hours of them outrunning one CGI monster after another across one hi-def landscape after another, or the five and a half hours yet to come, wouldn't be exciting enough. No, apparently there was absolutely no time for witty comedy with character development. 

I don't mean to sound critical of you about it. Taste is subjective, and the works of Tolkien are definitely written in a more old-fashioned style than more modern fantasy, so that could be off-putting if you aren't expecting it. And I thought more highly of Jackon's version of LOTR than The Hobbit, so you may like the book more.

Why are the movies so different? I have no clue... but then again I never do. Perhaps vanity? Money? All I know is that, for me personally, very, very few book-to-movie adaptations are tolerable. In fact A Clockwork Orange is the only one I like but there are oodles I haven't seen (like To Kill A Mockingbird). 

You are clearly not enjoying them as they are, so don't force it. If you are really committed to teaching these books, you might want to look at the Tolkien translation of  Beowulf, translations of French language Arthurian legends, The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer, and other older works. (You might want to check out some of Tolkien's essays and as many fairy tales as you can. There is a [new, exciting translation of the Grimm fairy tales](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/12/grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation) that I can't wait to get my hands on! )


Tolkien was a great scholar, and if you can get into and appreciated the literature that inspired him perhaps you can ""reset"" where you are coming from... Perhaps if you are acquainted with the ideas that Tolkien was trying to express it will help you to see his works in a new light. 

For what it's worth, I really love The Hobbit. I think it's an amazing tale that incorporates the philosophical ideas of the middle ages as understand by Tolkien. The LOTR was work for me.

32pxex_9,32pxex,"As I remember the books, they were about war (and other stuff too, few good books are ""about"" any one thing), but from a very different, more mature and responsible perspective from the movies. 

In The Hobbit, the journey was miserable nine-tenths of the way. Then they get there and they're huddled on the mountain with no real plan. Then even after Smaug is killed through dumb luck (or fate, or other peoples' work and sacrifice, but not the dwarves'), they still have to fight other people for the prize. Bilbo gets knocked out early on and is completely unimportant to how the actual battle goes. Was it all worth it? Sure, maybe Bilbo got home safe and rich, but it wasn't worth it for Thorin. War is hell. In the movie, they're all clean and shiny, and even when they're soaking or covered in soot they're still incredibly good-looking. Swap the armor for modern clothing and they could be in a fireman's pinup calendar. (In fairness, I wouldn't be surprised if Jackson felt obligated to slip some ""war is hell"" parts into the third movie of The Hobbit, but I think the overall point still stands.) See also Lord of the Rings: it's also about war partially, and the journey sucks even more. And again, it's not glamorous. I remember one scene from the book where Sam sees Sauron's human armies passing by, or maybe the aftermath of a battle, and he thinks about the motivation of the foot soldiers of the enemy and wonders why they fight and if they knew what they were getting into. 

In the movie? I'm not sure if we even see any human servants of Sauron at all. Orcs and trolls all over the place. ",cybishop3,2015-04-16T16:02:45Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,9
32pxex_10,32pxex,"The book is most definitely not about war. War is a subtext in the greater story line. The book is about Bilbo, not the dwarves. That is why it is called *The Hobbit*. War is a much more prevalent theme in the LOTR (one book). But to keep this in context of your statement - ""The Hobbit: watching....."" *The Hobbit* is nothing to do about war. I gave you several themes concerning *The Hobbit*. Tolkien wrote these books in the middle of a real, world war. The last thing he wanted was another story concerning itself with every day life. He wanted an escape for himself and his readers. An adventure that separates itself from what we are used to in our own lives. It was meant to emphasize the things worth cherishing, even through the trials and tribulations of every day life, i.e. camaraderie, food, adventures, etc. 

Jackson just wanted to focus on the war. That is why he brought in a character whose only mention in *The Hobbit* is in the appendix - Azog. The only reason he is mentioned in the book is to point out who was Bolg's father. Jackson didnt concern himself much with what Tolkien envisioned in his own words. I have no doubt Jackson loves Tolkien and his works, but he had dollar bill signs in his eyes when he wrote, directed, and produced this terrible trilogy. That helps explain why the fudge Legolas and Ariel are in the films. They added NOTHING to these films. If anything, they detracted from the little worth the films had to begin.

I agree with you that the movies are worse than the books, that many of the differences were motivated by money, that none of the books are mainly about war, and to the extent they are about war they have a mature viewpoint on it informed by Tolkien's life experience. It looks to me like I said all of that in the comment you replied to. (I didn't mention awareness of Tolkien's military career, but I knew of it, I promise.)

He shows up very briefly in Fellowship of the Ring and is a normal guy, albeit one who loves animals. 

Also, why did we need another 15 minutes of the ""council"" at Rivendell? Again, not necessary to the plot, but the makers wanted to tie this into LOTR more. 

Furthermore, the whole subplot of the white orc was completely unnecessary to the overall plot of the Hobbit. While I enjoyed the scenes with him, especially Thorin's final scene with him, he was still simply shoved in there so the producers could turn this into a three-part movie. 

I will say I liked Gollum's scene a lot, and that a large number of the dwarves' scenes were extremely awesome / fun. That being said, there didn't need to be some battle/running from enemies every two seconds.

This book did not need to be in 3 parts. They easily could have finished it in two, which I would have accepted so they could put in all the important details. But bringing in details that are mentioned briefly as small sentences, such as ""Oh you don't want to go towards the Necromancer, its dangerous there"", is completely unnecessary.

In the movie, Smaug immediately gets Bilbo to reveal himself, and then the dwarves need to run in and rescue Bilbo. In the process, they make Smaug look like a buffoon, far from the fearsome dragon he was made out to be.

If you want a more true version of the Hobbit, you should google ""Maple Films Hobbit"". Some guy took the extended Hobbit trilogy and shaved it down to 4 hours and 30 minutes, removing a ton of stuff that wasn't true from the story or took away from the main plot line.

40smfl_4,40smfl,"I was very disappointed in the tone of the movies.  They seemed to lack the warmth that was present in the books.  For instance, to the Hobbits at least, Gandalf was supposed to a kind, funny old man who could break out some awesome fireworks and that the older people looked at as a bad influence on the young.  They had no idea how powerful he was because he never felt the need to flaunt his power.  It was supposed to be a shock to the hobbits when he threw down some serious magical fire and wrath.  I think the films missed this aspect of his character.  Same thing with the elves.  The books portrayed them as powerful people who were silly, warm, and kind because they preferred to be that way.  Elrond was supposed to be wise, thoughtful, and benevolent; not a scary reboot of Agent Smith who I would be afraid to be in the same room with.  Galadrial in the books was beautiful, warm, and loving, not an ice goddess.  Tolkein seemed to employ a theme of the forces of good hiding their power because they were more concerned with happiness on a day to day basis than they were with fighting and war.

Jackson had to take over as director and asked the studio for a year to go back and do his own version of the movie. Remember that he was the Executive Producer. The studio declined so he had to start shooting what was essentially del Toro's movie. I'm quite sure that if del Toro had made the movie, it would have been different.

3fy482_1,3fy482,"Basically, because he knew Biblo from when he was younger, and Bilbo had shown some interest in adventuring and related tales.

From *Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth*, there is a draft of a conversation in which Frodo recounts to Pippin, Merry, and Gimli a prior conversation with Gandalf. In that prior conversation, Gandalf said

>'Somehow, I had been attracted by Bilbo long before, as a child, and a young hobbit: he had not quite come of age when I had last seen him. He had stayed in my mind ever since, with his eagerness and his bright eyes, and his love of tales, and his questions about the wide world outside the Shire. As soon as I entered the Shire I heard news of him. He was getting talked about, it seemed. Both his parents had died early for Shire-folk, at about eighty; and he had never married. He was already growing a bit queer, they said, and went off for days by himself. He could be seen talking to strangers, even Dwarves.

> ""'Even Dwarves!' Suddenly, in my mind these three things came together: the great Dragon with his lust, and his keen hearing and scent; the sturdy heavy-booted Dwarves with their old burning grudge; and the quick, soft-footed Hobbit, sick at heart (I guessed) for a sight of the wide world.

In a different draft, we get, from Gandalf,

>'And then there was the Shire-folk. I began to have a warm place in my heart for them in the Long Winter, which none of you can remember. ... I wanted them still to survive. But I saw that the Westlands were in for another very bad time again, sooner or later, though of quite a different sort: pitiless war. To come through that I thought they would need something more than they now had. It is not easy to say what. Well, they would want to know a bit more, understand a bit clearer, and where they stood.

> 'They had begun to forget: forget their own beginnings and legends, forget what little they had known about the greatness of the world. It was not yet gone, but it was getting buried: the memory of the high and the perilous. But you cannot teach that sort of thing to a whole people quickly. There was not time. And anyway you must begin at some point, with some one person. I dare say he was ""chosen"" and I was only chosen to choose him; but I picked out Bilbo.

> 'How would you select any one Hobbit for such a purpose?...I had not time to sort them all out; but I knew the Shire very well by that time, although when I met Thorin I had been away for more than twenty years on less pleasant business. So naturally thinking over Hobbits that I knew, I said to myself: ""I want a dash of the Took"" (but not too much, Master Peregrin) ""and I want a good foundation of the solider sort, a Baggins perhaps."" That pointed at once to Bilbo. And I had known him once very well, almost up to his coming of age, better than he knew me. I liked him then. And now I found that he was ""unattached"" - to jump on again, for of course I did not know all this until I went back to the Shire. I learned that he had never married. I thought that odd, though I guessed why it was; and the reason that I guessed was *not* the one that most the Hobbits gave me: that he had early been left very well off and his own master. No, I guessed that he wanted to remain ""unattached"" for some reason deep down which he did not understand himself - or would not acknowledge, for it alarmed him. He wanted, all the same, to be free to go when the chance came, or he had made up his courage. I remembered how he used to pester me with questions when he was a youngster about the Hobbits that had occasionally ""gone off"", as they said in the Shire.",RCHO,2015-08-06T01:28:05Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

3w56v4_3,3w56v4,"It is little known that the Hobbit was a lot more sadistic when first published than the post 1954 versions. In 1954 the Hobbit was revised to appeal to a younger audience and left put many parts of the original manuscript dealing with murder, rape, suicide, racism etc. 

Bilbo was originally abducted by the dwarves against his will and was sexually abused by the dwarves before managing to escape in the goblin cave. However upon meeting Gollum and being subjected to torture he developed essentially Stockholm syndrome and returned to the dwarves. Upon rendevous with the dwarves one of them admits his wrongdoings and pleads to be killed as recompence for his sins. Thorin prevented the killing and the dwarf was made to suffer physically. For whatever reason Gandalf pretty much has nothing to sat about it

In the elves dubgeons half the dwarves are killed by the elves and while some dwarves are pissed others are pretty much happy about it as it means more gold for them - the dragon sickness is already corrupting their hearts. Bilbo believes he can save them and so stays with them

The confrontation with smaug is much more extreme in the original version with several dwarves being roasted into burning piles of flesh. By the end there are only a couple of dwarves left and Bilbo who basically went around with his invisibility ring killing the laketowners encamped outside erebor. 

When Bilbo returned to bag end he pretty much kicked out the black servants who had taken over his home - but Tolkien later changed them to the Sackville bagginses and removed references to race.

Its just the original version was written in a war and racism period and things changes.. hence the heavy decisions.

The killer for the former was probably all of the expository dialogue and slow pace, and the relatively dry style of writing.

But recently, on a classic fantasy kick, I reread Hobbit and LotR, and had the complete opposite experience. The Hobbit seemed a little formulaic, with each ""adventure"" starting and stopping in an increasingly predictable sequence. While the book ended juuuust before completely overstaying its welcome, I was still pretty eager to get off the ride by the end of it.

LotR was a total revelation. Things which I'd previously remembered as boring were utterly engrossing, and there were many details revealed in adulthood which I'd never appreciated as a teenager. What especially stood out was the relationship between Frodo and Sam. The films of course try their best to do justice to this, but even in the 30 hours of extended material there's simply not enough space or time to capture all of the nuances of what they go through.

cedlbb_14,cedlbb,"I was in an advanced reading class in sixth grade, and one of the books we were assigned to read and discuss was *The Hobbit*. 

I was (and am) a procrastinator. So I fell behind in the nightly assigned chapter reading, and eventually gave up on reading the book. (Fudged and sloughed my way through the discussions.)

Eventually, years later, I read the book on my own and really loved it. (I think that it was during either high school or college, but I don’t remember which.)

Then in my twenties, I gave an attempt at reading *The Fellowship of the Ring*, but I soon lost interest and gave it up.

Here’s the problem, *for me*:
**I don’t know what to think of the book’s setting, and that bothers me too much to enjoy the book**.

Here’s what I mean by that:
They call it “Middle Earth.” I *used to* think that meant some early time period of the very planet that we inhabit. But then I thought of the fact that the map of the world of LOTR is utterly not the map of our world, unless we are to believe that in the time between then and now, there was such tremendous geographic/tectonic change that it somehow because the world of today. Even if I accept that, it’s not possible for me to accept the idea that *so long ago*, presumably *before* the age of dinosaurs (because it would have to be) civilization rose to the point described in the books, only to disappear utterly for many millions of years.

So that left me stuck having to think of “Middle Earth” as being “another planet,” or “earth in an utterly different timeline, and forget what you know about the world we live in.” And I couldn’t do that. I found it impossible to reconcile. 

This world Tolkien describes—it has horses, and eagles, and presumably rabbits and mice and such, but it also has giant spiders, and trolls, and orcs ... . I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t accept it. It didn’t have a place in my understanding where it fit and lay neatly. To this day—I’m forty-seven—I don’t know *where* or *when* “Middle Earth” exists, and it prevents me from being comfortable enough with the books to read them. 

By the way, this also goes for just about any other fantasy books. I did somehow make an exception for the “Earthsea” series by Ursula K. LeGuin, despite my problems with accepting that “humans” unexplainably inhabit some utterly alien “earth” in every normal way except for it *being* earth.

No one has ever explained to me the settings of these kinds of books, and where/when I’m supposed to categorize them as existing. If anyone would like to try, I’ll welcome it.",ClearBluePeace,2019-07-17T16:44:19Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,14

I liked the LOTR movies, because they did a genuinely good job at working out the art style, makeup and music and made it all fit, but I'm very displeased with changes they made to the story and characters. Eowyn was a loveable, strong headed, feminine character in the book, but they made her into a brat in the films. Not sure why they did that, but it sucked. The chase to Rivendell and the rescue of Frodo also was quite boring in the film, compared to the book, they just simplified it too much. Never seen it in the cinema, but apparently the death of Saruman was only in the extended version, which is a very bad mistake in my opinion. 

I kind of understand why they left the bit with Tom Bombadil out, it's simple to skip and feel as if nothing has been lost, but it's a very memorable part of the first book and gives it more depth.

However with the Hobbit movies, they aren't just telling the story of the Hobbit, they are telling a larger story about things that were probably happening in Middle Earth at the time and setting the scene for the LOTR. 

So did they portray the story of the Hobbit well in the movies? pretty much but at times it got a little lost as a setup to the War of the Ring.

I tore through the books. Only put them down when I had to --- like in class. My oldest brother (6 years older than I was) got the box set. When he finished one book, then I read it. Except when I finished The Two Towers, he had taken The Return of the King on a weekend camping trip. So my middle brother took me to the store and I bought my own copy of RotK and had it read before my oldest brother returned from his camping trip. So, ironically, I started the books after he did and finished the set before he did.

I've read them many times since then. Both before and after the movies came out. My favorite way to read them is with The Atlas of Middle-earth beside me because it is the most incredible reading experience to have those maps open while reading what happens at those sites. It gives a whole new dimension to the books.

>Years later the movies came out, and as we all know they were incredible

Not to me they weren't. There were parts that were good, but when I think of LotR, the movies don't even cross my mind. It's the books. When I read the books, I visualize nothing from the movies.

As I said, I read the books many times. Last time I saw the movies was when The Return of the King was in the theaters. And I'll go the rest of my life without ever seeing the movies again.

Exactly because he's such an unlikely hero, there is never any insincerity to him, when he describes his fear, his discomfort, his pain. This both makes the character more relatable, and the story more exciting, imo.

That being said, Tolkien clearly is not afraid of using his various Dei ex Machina, which some may perceive as a weakness, but which I personally feel fit in with both the style and the fact that it is a bit of a tale for children.

For the first 10 or so chapters, Tolkien is writing the story as a sequel to the Hobbit, and it's kind of skirting around the edges of the rest of the stories that he had been writing in his spare time since his early 20s. 

But there's a clearly defined point when he finally decides that yes, this new story he is writing is actually going to be a part of the the wider world that he's created in the background, and it's when Aragorn says the line ""I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel"". It's both a great in universe introduction to the small story that Aragorn is going to tell as well as serving as an out of universe message from Tolkien, that he's finally going to let us in on one of the stories from the First Age, that will now serve as the backdrop for the rest of the story.

Also as a sidenote, once you finish the Lord of the Rings, the best of these backstories that serves as its own contained book is *The Children of Hurin* which is another of the great tales of the First Age, but never gets a summary treatment in LotR like Beren and Luthien does.",rcuosukgi42,2022-02-05T06:31:28Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

He drew heavily on existing Anglo-Saxon materials and made them his own -- all without planning to write Lord of the Rings. Then he wrote The Hobbit set in the world, and people demanded more, so when he eventually created the story for Lord of the Rings, he already had an incredible world of wonder ready in which to set this epic.

Also, I'm sure the thread is full of people saying this already, but: if what you like best about Lord of the Rings is the world-building and epic lore, you really ought to read Silmarillion, which covers the entire epic history of the world, from its creation through successive ages, and moves from pseudo-religious battles of gods to mythic history and on toward the time of LotR, which more closely resembles actual history.",theAlpacaLives,2022-02-05T06:11:46Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,2

Or maybe he just didn't give a damn. But many of his tangents have virtually nothing to do with the plot.

Tom Bombadil is the biggest example of this. He is 100% unnecessary to the plot, and his chapters could be excised entirely, with nothing more than stating the hobbits found their swords in an old burial mound, or even got them in Rivendell. Nothing that happened in those chapters touches anything else for the entire rest of the book.

Yet he adds so much to *the world* that Tolkien is building. Those chapters show ancient, mysterious beings of unknown powers, and the remains of kingdoms the hobbits never knew existed.

There are words in Tolkien that you can't help but read out with a certain tone that says 'there is much more to this', it's a kind of verbal hyperlink that children can't help but click on, so they'll pull you up and ask. And when they do you're getting no further with your bedtime story tonight, because you are deep in Tolkien lore and there's a whole lot to talk about.

On the way through _The Hobbit_ you may find yourself discussing who these Sea-elves and Deep-elves and Fair-elves were, and how they went into the West and why some later came back. You may find yourself discussing Gondolin. You might talk about what a Necromancer is, and who was at this mysterious council that Gandalf went away to consult with about _this_ Necromancer. You may offer more details about this Moria place that is mentioned, and why the Dwarves don't live there any more. You might hint at the sad history of this strange monster under the Misty Mountains, and suggest that he may indeed come out some day to seek the recovery of the precious thing that was stolen.

The phrase 'that comes into the next book' might be a common one. If demand arises to read the next book?

I took a Tolkien class in uni and we first read Beowulf (because Tolkien based his mythos on this old English epic), then Farmer Giles of Ham, the Green Knight, then dove into the Silmarillion, then The Hobbit, then the Trilogy. All while reading these we also read his letters to Christopher, C.S Lewis, and other literary figures of the time (many of whom were in the Inklings group with him).

&#x200B;

Wellll.. they are and they aren't.  One of the things that you have probably noticed is that the Nazgûl are a lot less hands-on in the books so far than they were in the movies.  It's not giving anything away to reveal that their power actually depends a great deal on how close they are to their Master, and if you look at the map, you'll realize that up in the Shire and near Bree and so on they are actually quite far from home.  At that distance, they really are wraiths, having to conserve their meager physical strength and obliged to depend on magic and terror to do their work.  (And gold...)

It's also not giving anything away to say that Sauron has been gone a *loooong* time now, and many things have changed in Middle Earth.  For example, the Shire and hobbits didn't used to be around.  Nor was Gandalf!  Sauron has no idea who or where they are, so getting up to speed quickly on that has been a pretty major effort on his part.

All in all they are actually working pretty hard against the hobbits and their friends, but at a big disadvantage (that they are rapidly closing, as you have seen).  Sauron and his minions are now growing pretty confident.  But... Sauron remembers that he did this once before and got killed by a mortal hero with a mighty sword, and he and the Nazgûl are still not sure which of their old enemies are still around, and what they are capable of these days.  A lot of the good guys have been keeping a low profile over the centuries, and stealth is going to be their friend more than in the movies.",amitym,2022-02-05T04:36:06Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,12

Still, Tolkien clearly states in ""Concerning Hobbits"" that hobbits are not technically a distinct race from Men, the way that Elves or Dwarves are, but branched off from other humans in the distant past of the Elder Days.""

I'm guessing Tolkien intentionally left their origin story without much detail - which is strange, given his first book in this world was called ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" was written in response to people wanting more books about Hobbits.

I was 15 and it was just before my sophomore year of high school. I'd been wanting to watch the LotR films and was finally able to watch FotR. I fell in absolute, complete love with it. That same night, I started reading the series again. Blew through them in a little over a week. I was even more madly in love with Lord of the Rings. 


Like you, I really learned a lot with those books. About friendship, bravery, courage, leadership and the burdens of such. I can't get over just how much influence those books had on my life and who I am.

3bqj80_15,3bqj80,"My problem is that I like to read a bit slower than others and fully absorb and appreciate everything as I go. For me, LotR's themes and details were quick to pick up. The problem was that the Fellowship was written like a cartographer being forced to write down everything rather than draw out a map. You hear about every bush, every literal turn in the road, every step. It's a crazy amount of detail but it makes the story feel like it's conflicting between describing an entire day's uneventful stroll and telling a story. I loved the entire Shire part, the 20+ page info dump on Hobbit culture and lifestyle, and Bree is still one of my favorite chapters in the book. I especially love the way Tolkien writes in the Bree chapters. But before you know it, it's back to pages of telling me where bushes are and how a river they'll never cross bend and how one part of the road has a lot of trees  and that the southend part of a hill slopes a different way than the other hill next to it. I get what the writing is trying to do but it honestly feels overwhelming and dull many times. It works when you know the hobbits are about to encounter Wights but it doesn't work when it just leads to nothing.

I know I'm probably the minority on this but I feel like this is why LotR is considered a hard read for a lot of people, and why people don't try to emulate that style. A lot of writers are taught no one would read through such stuff and today I think Fellowship would have had 100 pages of writing edited out. I'm not saying LotR is bad but that's why I've never gotten past Fellowship and I think that's why people have such problems with it. I love The Hobbit and Silmarillion though.

It shows the far reaching effects of evil, in that even the Shire did not escape untainted.  It also does such an excellent job of showing the growth of the four Hobbits.  I've read the Trilogy about 10 times now, and I always tell myself that I'm going to be more cognizant of the change that overtakes the Hobbits throughout the series.  I think I'll be able to note where they suddenly become leaders and warriors, that I'll be able to point to this point at which the transformation begins.

For Pippin, the journey was very different, even though he was with Merry for most of it. Pippin was never strong, but his value lay in his mental abilities. It was especially apparent when they talked to the ents that Pippin was intelligent, but he could never be as strong as the other hobbits. This didn't stop him, though, as he accepted that he wasn't the greatest and took pride in his achievements, because that was the best that he could do. Seeing him as a leader in the Scouring of the Shire was very emotionally satisfying, and he and Merry shall forever be remembered as the hobbits who became men on their journey.

ac9okd_10,ac9okd,"Just got done reading parts of The Unfinished Tales. There is so much heartbreak and woe in Middle Earth that doesn't come through in the Hobbit or LOTR. The story of Turin shook me, hard. 

While hope is a main theme, I think coping with madness, strife, and hardship is really what makes the stories. Another quick synopsis from The Unfinished Tales. Little hope did Aldarion have that his marriage would last, but he continued to sail to Middle-Earth from Numenor to council with King Gil-Galad in the face of the renewed darkness from Angmar. In the end his daughter would resent him, his father never really understood him, and on his last voyage home as the Kings Heir he left without anyone sending him off, few people cared, and no one was there to welcome him when he came back. He was one of the greatest ship builders second to Cirdan, and still his life was viewed as wasted by his own peoples. Yet, he was paramount in supporting the Eldar as this new threat emerged. His people barely knew and sorely mistrusted him to the extent that little is said of his life as King of Numenor. His Middle Earth Cliff city of Vinyalonde fell into despair and ruin. Yet, still he returned to converse and coordinate with the Eldar against the Great Evil that was growing in the North.

Stories such as this have reminded me that there must be dark before light, despair before hope, emptiness before fulfillment. The depth of the Universe Tolkien created is incredible. ",jmgreen4,2019-01-04T17:56:11Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,10

He makes this exceedingly clear in the ending with the Scouring of the Shire-- which involves no one but the Hobbits. He shows how the adventures of each Hobbit affected them and their ongoing lives once they had returned from 'the mythical journey'. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimili, Gandalf and Boromir are side characters who don't necessarily undergo relatable character development, they're mythical heros that we're not supposed to entirely relate to, though they embody qualities that we should aspire to have (great courage, nobility, etc). The movies shifted the focus onto the entire Fellowship and in doing so had to add definable arcs to particularly Aragorn-- but that missed the poignant mark Tolkien hit with the original timeless ending. It's not quite a 180 degree turn, but I always found it an subtle but very interesting (and criticizable) difference between the adaption and the original.",ruser8567,2022-08-08T23:45:23Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,5

I have felt the same way about other book-movie adaptations so I definitely get where you are coming from about the plot staying mostly the same but the underlying themes and character growth being removed. I get that films lend themselves much more to action & slapstick-comedy than to long dialogues and voice over internal thoughts that books can manage well, but it’s still a sad thing that Hollywood seems to feel that we want only action and special effects and shy away completely from personal growth and moral integrity. Some of my favourite books are really inspiring because the characters are brave enough to face up to their own flaws and do better.

2q528e_1,2q528e,"*The Silmarillion* was published after Tolkien's death by his son, Christopher, and I believe it is shorter than Tolkien wanted; when he attempted to publish it shortly after WWII, he was refused on the grounds that it was far too long, requiring too many resources to print in consideration of post-war scarcity.

*The Silmarillion* may give you the wrong idea about Tolkien's writing style as in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. *The Silmarillion* is structured like a series poetic retelling of historical events, in the sense that there is no dialogue, and no overarching story. *The Silmarillion* covers thousands of years of history with few recurring characters. Perhaps the only character who appears from his subsequent fantasy works is Galadriel, and her name is only mentioned once, in passing.

I recommend against reading *The Silmarillion* first; it is a poetic history book, while *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are novels. Reading *The Silmarillion* last, I found more satisfaction than if I had read it first; it was a great way to experience more of the world after the stories were done.

If you are concerned about missing historical references, Tolkien wrote his two novels (if you include the Trilogy as one novel) so that you don't need to know any more history than is told to the characters. If you want to know more of the history, there are several volumes dedicated to the subject that are more complete than *The Silmarillion*: *The History of Middle-Earth*.",kaqmere,2014-12-23T04:10:44Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

It was only expanded and given a greater meaning when he cooked up TLOTR. But this is an example of how he managed to tie the Hobbit to his other works in subtle ways one doesn't initially realize. Obviously though, *The Hobbit*, in terms of size, is a cookie cutter. Far too restrictive for the rest of the legendarium.

The ring takes the wearer into the sub-physical plane where Sauron has form. It's so that the two could come find eachother to bring Sauron back to the physical world. 

Sauron hasn't had ""form"" since the Valar zapped Númenor, and he with it. But before that, Sauron created the ring of power. Sauron instilled into that physical object all of his non-physical being, the very core of who he was. When his physical form was trashed, the ring still existed. It tied him to the physical realm.

Finish the books.  Savor every moment of the Trilogy and read them *slowly*.  Don't miss the passing references that seemingly have no context and most importantly don't skip the songs like so many do. Contemplate those poems as you read them... they're important.

Then read the *Silmarillion* and let your mind be blown as the nooks and crannies in the *Lord of the Rings* are filled in and made so much more... significant.

Once you've done that, watch the movies.  They're super fun, and visually a pretty good representation of Middle Earth.  I read the Hobbit and LoTR as a teen back in the 70s, and I am positive that I would've enjoyed them much less if my mind had been tainted by the fancy visuals of the movies beforehand.

Also, I recommend watching the Rankin Bass animated *Hobbit* which, while goofily representative of the time in which it was made, presents a much more accurate portrayal of the magic and childlike wonder of *The Hobbit* and Middle Earth in general than Jackson's quick-cut blockbuster Hollywood approach.

e2xwgk_2,e2xwgk,"I think the order you mentioned would be just fine, The Hobbit followed by The Trilogy, but you could also do The Trilogy followed by The Hobbit and still be just fine. 

I believe The Hobbit is a bit more approachable and a good way to get your feet wet with Tolkien’s style. Be ready to encounter pages worth of “songs” or poems as well as various languages of elves and dwarves. It can sometimes throw people off, but if you embrace it you’ll find it just makes the world feel that much more immense. 

As far as watching the movies first, that’s totally your preference. It might help, but you don’t have to. I was in middle school when the films came out so I watched those first and absolutely loved them (still love them). They are for the most part faithful adaptations of the novels, with a bit of added Hollywood flair. The films inspired me to read the books and it was helpful to put a face with the names since at times you can be bombarded with scores of names and family lineages and places.  

I’ll end with this, I’m envious of you right now. Reading those books for the first time was probably the most memorable reading experience I had in my entire life and I owe a lot to them. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

e2xwgk_5,e2xwgk,"It really depends on you. 

If you want to go in totally blind then I would read The Hobbit and then start The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is a bit different in terms of tone and, while you don't have to read it to enjoy The Lord of the Rings, it does set up a number of plot points that are important later on. I think The Hobbit also serves as a nice intro to the world of Middle-Earth, which can be quite daunting in terms of its massive history.

That being said, The Lord of the Rings books are somewhat denser than The Hobbit and I wouldn't blame anyone for watching the films before starting the books. While The Lord of the Rings films are a superb adaptation of the books, they do differ at certain points but they will allow you to have a good understanding of the characters and plot before you dive into the books.  I would recommend you check out the Extended Editions, as they go deeper into the world of Middle-Earth and include a lot of great scenes that had to be cut from the theatrical versions due to time constraints. That said, I don't think you need to watch The Hobbit films before watching The Lord of the Rings. Those films stray very far from the book and feel more like fan-fiction than true adaptations like The Lord of the Rings films. As I've said, The Hobbit is less dense than The Lord of the Rings so I don't think you'll have any trouble diving into that. If I were you, I would:

&#x200B;

* Watch The Lord of the Rings Extended Editions
* Read The Hobbit
* Read The Lord of the Rings
* Watch The Hobbit films if you're interested
* If you still want more after that then there are a number of books Tolkien was working on prior to his death that were published. Plenty of important events happened thousands of years before The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and books such as The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales that detail such events.

Christopher Tolkien arranged the stories chronologically, so it may feel like a history book of sorts, but it's actually a pseudo-mythological cycle starting with creation and going all the way through Second Age.

So, in order to understand if it's somehting you want to read, keep in mind that it is neither a novel nor an adventure epic, but a collection of stories mimicking Tolkien's favourite mythological works (e.g. Kalevala). Also, consider reading stories seperately and not as a book, because Silmarillion the way we know it isn't a JRRT's creation but his son Chrostopher's. Some of it is pretty dull, while other parts are pretty nice, like the ones about Turin Turambar. As a 15 year old (Silmarillion was actually the book I learnt English with), I loved how grandiose yet authentic some of the stories felt, and it certainly amplified my appreciation of LotR for a while: I'd go round explaining, like, ooh, Gandalf's a nickname, real name's Olorin and he's a maia, which is a type of god, did you know? etc.",jeikaraerobot,2016-10-30T10:09:49Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

If you happen to be enthralled by all that is Tolkien, you'll find it worthwhile. But, really, it's the ""historical"" back-story for the author's use. If you've ever, say, run an RPG campaign, it's quite possible that you've generated something similar - notes to yourself that you can call on when required, that make sense of what's going on, but are never intended to be seen by your players. Such story content as there is, is highly episodic; full of stories about characters mentioned in very brief passing in his other works, who meant something to Tolkien (and by implication his characters), but held very little interest for me.

The idea is that The Silmarillion is a religious text, a bit like the Old Testament or the elder eddas, etc - for the fictional world Arda, where Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are both set.

If I recall correctly, it begins with the creation myth, where Eru and his servants sing the world into existence, then it follows the creation of the major species - Elves, Dwarves, Humans and eventually Orcs - and then it talks about some of the heroes of what might be called the dawn age, and their exploits. There's the story of Beren and Luthien, there's the forging of the silmarils, and the children of Hurin, and several others, making up the mythos of the ancient world of Arda.

I think several of the individual stories in the Silmarillion are well worth reading, but that's me, and I can't speak for whether it's worth it for anyone else.

There was a time when I considered myself a huge Tolkien nerd. I even spoke a bit of Quenya, and even back then, I wouldn't have considered the Silmarillion to be one of the greatest books ever written - at least not for a broad audience, but it does what it sets out to do very well, and those who are interested in that sort of thing tend to treasure it highly.",Skrp,2016-10-30T15:13:34Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,6
5a53qj_7,5a53qj,"I read this about 25 yrs ago. It's good. It's a creation myth and explains the reason-to-be for the Hobbit, and others including rings. It was written last and assembled into its final form by his son as it not was finished when Tolkien died. Regarding difficulty and dryness: Tolkien thought a really good fantasy book should read like history, and that means giving attention to lineages, who migrated where, names and so on. A good bit of detail then is given here as the elves, once they are created, migrated into various parts of the world. Dwarves come next, and humans last. This contrasts to books from CS Lewis, and others where there's no pretense to being real. So whether or not this appeals to you I think depends on your maturity, and how many fantasy books you've read. As you get older my guess you'll value it more. For example, my older kid likes Marvel movies less and less with each passing year for much the same reason: he realizes they are grounded in less and less reality inasmuch anybody can do anything to move along a plot, there's little correspondence between action and consequence, the plots are too similar, the dialog is poor, the characters are thin.",,2016-10-30T15:46:58Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,7

5a53qj_11,5a53qj,"Little Column A, Little Column B. 

The Silmarillion is the sort of thing Tolkien fans decide to read to get more into the universe, even though it's often dryer than the main series, and also less linear.

At the same time, The Silmarillion is a very experimental book. It's an attempt to mimic a Bible for a fictional universe, and the end result is excellent. It's just hard to appreciate the first time through, and most people do it because ""Well I like to think I'm a Tolkien fan, and this is *the* defining backbone for works regarding Middle-Earth"". 

It will be dry. You won't understand half of it the first time you read it. You'll probably need to re-read The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings, and then return to read it again, if you truly want to discover its magic.

It's a good book, just one that takes work to appreciate. And I don't think there's anything *wrong* with that; you're not entitled to an immediate understanding and enjoyment of a work. But you deserve a fair warning that, despite its short length, it's a mountain to climb.

The reason you only hear Tolkien fanboys discussing it is because they've gotten the most enjoyment out of it. It's sort of like Chaucer, or Homer: their works are great, but people specialized in English or Greek literature are going to understand the significance more than others. The Silmarillion is a dense book, and unless you're willing to pick away at it, you often won't come away with very much.

At the very least, I suggest reading some select chapters. Some of the early ones, regarding the creation of the world, are pleasant. My favorite, by far, is the tale of Turin Turumbar, which despite being only a single chapter, is one of the most well-told stories I've ever read. There's some really great stuff sprinkled throughout, but some chapters are entirely world-building for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

I'd consider re-reading Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, either before or after you read The Silmarillion. I'm not sure what would help you get through it: doing it first, to appreciate it better, or after, to avoid an overdose. Your choice. But noticing that ""oh, that guy is mentioned in Lord of the Rings!"", or ""This place's name has the same root word as that one guy"" will help you get the most out of The Silmarillion.",TheCodexx,2016-10-31T09:04:02Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,11

2qakcw_4,2qakcw,"Is it absolutely critical that you read *The Hobbit* before *The Lord of the Rings*? No, my reasoning being that there's only a few references back to *The Hobbit* in LOTR, such as when Frodo is complaining to Gandalf in Moria concerning Gollum following them:

> Frodo: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
> 
> Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. 

I would start with *The Hobbit* first mostly because it's less daunting from a storytelling viewpoint. Tolkien tends to use very flowery descriptions and pages of songs referencing lore that's covered in more detail in the appendices, The Silmarillion, and other works outside the LOTR books. While beautifully done, given that *The Fellowship*, *Two Towers*, and *Return of the King* are technically two books each, it's a long haul. 

*The Hobbit*, in contrast, was designed to be a children's story, so it clips along at a quicker pace. You might find it easier to ease into Tolkien's writing style that way, or if you're feeling brave just dive headfirst into LOTR. 

It's worth pointing out though that not everything that happened in Peter Jackson's interpretation of *The Hobbit* actually happened in the book. He borrowed a lot material from the aforementioned appendices to flesh out the story. That isn't meant to deter you, just keep that in mind.

Sorry for the wall of text. Happy reading!

Because they were so successful, and because they spawned a heap of imitators, people forget what an enormous risk Peter Jackson was taking when he made the LOTR films- he was trying to adapt hugely unwieldy source material to the big screen in a way that had never really been done before, with a stupendous budget to try and recover- although I hate what he did to the hobbit, with LOTR I think you have to accept he was never going to be able to slavishly adapt it and he had to make a lot of judgment calls.",juddshanks,2018-08-15T11:55:44Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,3

Shouldn't the story be winding down? Now I realize how important that part of the story is in order to show how the hobbits have changed.

97f7ad_12,97f7ad,"The LotR films were hardly rubbish.  The changes you mentioned as being the cause don't really line up.  Even in the book, Tom Bombadil was a character out of place.  He's a hard stop to the story, and feels way more like he belongs in The Hobbit.  It's as if Tolkien said, ""Hey, let's see Beorn again, but for no real reason.  Oh and he might just be the most powerful thing in existence...but then let's never mention him again for any substantial reason."" And yes I'm including the council when I say that, because it's clear that Tolkien had an ""oh shit"" moment at that point, realizing he'd forgotten about Tom and just wrote him out of the story there.  Tom is a fun character, but didn't fit in the book and certainly not in the movie adaptation.

As for Merry and Pippin, yes, in the book their role was help represent the rest of the world coming to the shire, and how the child-like people could deal with these problems.  They were part of the fellowship because of a sense of friendship, but also because once they learned of the danger, they wanted to help stop it.  In the movies, however, they were comic relief.  They had no reason to join (in the movies' rationale) other than the fact that they did so in the books.  The child-like innocence of the hobbits was dumped fully into them, and while they did have character arcs, their purpose was changed from in the book, so the Scouring wasn't needed as payoff.  They matured and came to the ""end"" of their journeys in Merry's companionship with Eowyn and Pippin's service to Gondor.  

Again, while both of these elements were fun in the books and many fans, including me, would have liked to see them in the movies, it certainly doesn't mean they are rubbish.",scribbane,2018-08-15T11:32:34Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,12

Like I said, he feels like a misplaced chapter from The Hobbit, where these sorts of weird diversions did happen and then just went away.  

While reading the books, because there is so much world building sprinkled throughout, he seems to fit the tone initially.  Again, the movies are adaptations, and even altered the narrative slightly.  Because of Tom's ""flaws"" in the book, and the differing direction of the films, it makes perfect sense to me that old Tom got cut.

Because LotR has been out since the '50s while this book was published in 2007.

Reading it by itself misses a great deal of the focus, though. Besides the fact that it's not the first book (chronologically) dealing with the First Age (which means a great deal of context is missing in terms of why the fuck everyone is doing what they're doing), the major theme is to contrast what Túrin is doing in comparison with what Beren did in *Beren and Lúthien*. Túrin wants to be the next Beren, but everything is being twisted by Morgoth's curse and Túrin's own failings, and virtually everything he touches gets destroyed.

It's clearly more Christopher than J.R.R. in the prose (it's stilted as can be), though all the plot comes from J.R.R. It would never have become anything as big as LotR or Hobbit as written.",crazyike,2022-09-05T20:54:54Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,2

That being said, The Lord of the Rings is significantly more dense, a more ""adult"" take on Tolkien's world if you will.  

Btw, I've heard for newcomers, in LotR, Tom Bombadill is ""the wall"". He's a character left out of the movies, that can be fairly taxing to new readers to get through his part, but if you can, you'll do fine with the rest. Not sure I agree with that theory, but it may hold true for you. 

After LotR, try The Silmarillion (Tolkien Society suggests Tom Bombadill's poems, give em a go if you're so inclined).

Very often in the Hobbit I would be knocked out of the book by the narrative. Like you said the voice is too omniscient.

But to fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien revised later editions of The Hobbit: the version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf.""

It was clear from reading *The Hobbit* that much of D&D was based on Tolkien lore, so I went on to LOTR.

I really enjoyed *The Hobbit*, but to me LOTR rather drags and gets confusing by introducing too many characters with odd names that get hard to keep track of.

I absolutely detest songs in novels.

I love to write poetry, used to be a singer-songwriter, and I even put a Broadway song in the novel I'm writing. But because I hate reading or hearing poetry, I always skip that stuff when reading a novel. I really can't stand it.

Your post made me think about this more. I don't think it's just because I dislike poetry. I think it's because a lyric interlude feels very out of place in a novel (for me) because in the United States, culture as I know it in this country (where I grew up and live), people *don't* break into song in everyday life. For better or worse. It's just not a part of the culture; consequently, it feels and seems VERY ""off.""",suchathrill,2021-02-08T15:04:22Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,10

Like, the story of it is fantastic - it's that world's entire myth of creation, their bible if you will. The pacing, actual writing, organization, structure... absolutely abysmal. 

You have entire fucking \*pages\* of lineages, sometimes repeated shortly after, whereas some entire wars go by in a paragraph. Some really exciting plot points and events go by in a sentence, whereas several paragraphs are dedicated to fucking nothing... There is more nothing packed together than at times than I've ever remember reading in anything not named Moby Dick. It's not even a big book, but it feels fucking long.

daz9k3_4,daz9k3,"This is the best time to read it, as it puts you in the same life stage as Frodo was, when he set on the journey.

The biggest issue I have with the films is that they made the Lord of the Rings into Yet Another Coming-of-Age Story. There is a very limited time jump between Bilbo's disappearance and the main story. At the Birthday Party, Frodo comes of age (he's 33) and, in the movies, he sets of for his journey shortly after. He is approximately the same age as Merry, Pippin and Sam.

In the books, by contrast, 17 years passed between those events. Frodo is 50, wealthy and accustomed to comfortable, if not luxurious life - very much like Bilbo in The Hobbit. Sam is 12 years younger, Merry 14 year younger, so they are young adults during main events of the book. Pippin is 28 when he sets off for Rivendell, so he is not even adult yet. This puts his behaviour in perspective.

This changes the perspective from ""we're young, let's have a crazy adventure"" to ""would you sacrifice your comfort and established position in the society to go on a suicidal mission?"".

In the books, he did have a temper and he did dislike dwarves (and in all honestly the dwarves were actually pretty rude to him to begin with) but he still respected them. He was kind, generous and friendly, and while he still had his weaknesses he still overcame them. He valued gold and treasure, but apparently he valued lives over gold and treasure. ""Long will I tarry ere I begin this war for gold,"" still remains one of my favourite lines for me.

Movie!Thranduil just fucked over everything I love about Thranduil and turned him into a monster. And now almost all the Thranduil fan-art feature him looking like Lee Pace. Urgh.",HuorSpinks,2016-07-25T13:20:59Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Hobbit,1

4uhevi_8,4uhevi,"I think the hobbit is my favorite book so to see it butchered so badly was tough to watch. I was optimistic near the beginning. Seeing all the dwarves in bilbos house doing dwarf things. Gandalfs quiet observance. It wasn't true to the book completely but i can understand some creative liberties. For the most part at least the spirit of the book was all there for the first 30 minutes or so. I quickly lost hope after Bilbo wakes up late and catches up to the dwarves. 

The hobbit I think is one of the worst offenders of ""that didn't happen"", ""why are they doing that?"", ""what is that person doing here?""

And like others have said, not because they overly ambitiously tried to turn 600 dense pages into 2 hours. The hobbit was really digging in the bottom of the barrel for filler.

Not so much of the love affair with Kili (although, completely making it up and not having all of the dwarves in the mountain was f'd up), but I read somewhere that Peter Jackson was afraid Tolkein's world was lacking in strong female characters so he invented Tauriel. Tolkein's world was lacking in strong female characters? Has he read Tolkein? He had a slew of strong female characters. Galadriel crosses the Grinding Ice for revenge and sets up a powerful domain. Luthien defeats Sauron & Morgoth. Instead of developing the characters that already existed, he had to put his hand in it as if Tolkein needed his help. I lost all faith in his 3 part opus. I thought he did a commendable job of LOTR (despite it's numerous issues) but this aggression towards The Hobbit will not stand, man.
