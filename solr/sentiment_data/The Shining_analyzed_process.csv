qe33qi_1,qe33qi,"I was impressed with his sequel to The Shining (Doctor Sleep). Danny as a grown-up who manages to use his ability to help others, in spite of his own trauma. Then fighting the energy vampires. Plus some closure for him in there too. Well worth the read coming off the first book.

I'd watch the two movies only after reading both books first. They're good, too, but both do play out a little different from the books",myloginisacliche,2021-10-23T12:04:01Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1
qe33qi_2,qe33qi,"What I always liked about *The Shining* in contrast to many of his other novels is how controlled it is. It's very tightly focused and intense. He takes just a couple of characters--and really only one primary character--and isolates them far away from everybody and everything. It's an extremely introspective and ruminative novel which sets it apart from many of his others which suffer from what I always think of as the 'cast of thousands' issue. Some of his other novels seem to depend upon a big, big supporting cast of folks to prop up the main story and there's a certain sameness which obtains after a bit. *The Shining* is really just Jack and his demons and that makes it feel very tightly wound up, and I like that.

As far as the Kubrick adaptation is concerned it is common knowledge that King did not care for it very much and he made his displeasure very clear. But the thing about it is that it is not a Stephen King adaptation as much as it is a Stanley Kubrick film, and Kubrick gives his own interpretation of King's novel which is a re-imagining of King's novel and most certainly not any kind of a mirror image.",death_by_chocolate,2021-10-23T14:38:07Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,2
qe33qi_3,qe33qi,"My advice for watching Kubrick’s *The Shining* for the first time:

- Watch it on the biggest screen possible with a good sound system.

- Accept that it has almost nothing to do with King’s book.

Seriously, besides character names and some basic plot points, the two are completely separate products. King hated Kubrick’s adaptation, which is understandable because the film deviated in almost every way from the book, including character developments and major themes.

That said, the movie is an absolute masterpiece, visually groundbreaking and disturbing and layered. Kubrick was a literal genius (IQ of 200) and operating on a singular creative level. The most famous scenes of the movie are not even in the book. There is a whole subculture of people who do nothing but analyze the movie and come up with thematic conspiracies based on little hints and easter eggs. It’s a trip.

Both book and movie are great for different reasons. If you treat them like separate, unique experiences, you’ll appreciate both for their respective strengths.",ArtlessCalamity,2021-10-23T14:26:17Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,3
qe33qi_4,qe33qi,"The Shining was also my first Stephen King book about 30 years ago. About the same time, I was having an issue with a large cyst at the base of my spine and in the weeks leading up to my surgery I had to soak in a tub several times a week for an hour. I can say there were times while soaking and reading the book I was absolutely terrified. I had never had that feeling from a book before in my life. I have not read a ton of King since then, but his ability to do that with words alone has stayed with me all these years.",kirked_out,2021-10-23T13:22:50Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,4

Because the book is indeed phenomenal, and the movie is one of the most overrated movies ever made. The Shining itself is entirely irrelevant to the plot of the movie, Danny is mostly superfluous to his own story, the supernatural elements are scary for the sake of scary with no narrative explanation, and Halloran is a red herring used to deceive the audience into thinking he matters.

It made me pretty emotional, the way it depicts the unhealthy ways a family handles grief and trauma, while being manipulated by a great supernatural force. Green Mile is not horror (if you know about the movie you already know that) but also deals with supernatural phenomena, as well as racism and bias in a flawed justice system.

The song ""I'm Not In Love"" by 10cc was just becoming popular and I was reading the parts about snow covered topiary.  That ethereal start to ""I'm Not In Love"" will always remind of a cold as hell, snowy wind, blowing across supernatural malevolent hedges bent on Holloran's destruction.

qe33qi_47,qe33qi,"I recently saw the Doctor Sleep movie and they managed to remain pretty damn faithful to the book, with a few changes here and there to make it mesh with the film version. My biggest complaints are that they left out most of the Wendy flashbacks, and Abra's grandmother was omitted entirely, which fucking sucked. That said, they did so for a reason, because the climax had to be much different due to the change from the books of the hotel still existing rather than being blown up. What they do with that is actually narratively interesting, and circles back around to give us a meta callback to the ending of the original Shining book, which I found very satisfying. If you dislike the difference between the Shining book and movie, Doctor Sleep the movie actually goes a long way to correcting some of those wrongs and ""fixing"" it a little bit.

Other than the climax and the omission of the grandmother though? The film is almost scene for scene from the book. It's worth a watch, *especially* if you didn't care for the changes in the original film.",DomLite,2021-10-23T14:50:38Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,47

qe33qi_55,qe33qi,"Maybe so, but the movie features only four characters, and as a character study, it’s just awful.

Danny is a stereotypical young boy, with only stereotypical young boy interests, and no actual personality. The book had the sub plot of his imaginary friend that turned out to be named after Danny’s middle name and was an extension of his own psyche dealing with trauma, all of which is internal conflict, and all of which was absent from the movie.

Danny’s mother (whose name I can’t even recall without looking her up) is a shrill, annoying, horse faced woman that contributes literally nothing towards the movie other than victim hood, completely missing the effects that she had towards her husband and son in the book.

Halloran is a caricature of a black man, introducing concepts to the audience that are never expanded upon, and he dies the moment he tries to be anything more to the story than expository lore. In the book, Halloran took on the role of mentor and was extremely useful towards keeping Danny alive against the forces of evil. In the movie, he was entirely worthless towards any of the other characters or the overarching plot.

The worst, however, is Jack. Jack Torrence in the book is a tragic figure. A man torn between a temper he cannot control, an addiction he cannot overcome, and resentment he has yet to actually address. As a character in the book, Jack Torrence is a message to the reader, a sort of “there but for the grace of god go I”. At the end of the story, because of the temptations of the Overlook and it’s malevolent spirit entity, Jack succumbs to his own inner demons and is cast out of his own body, being used as a puppet to slay his own family. Jack in the book was dead long before the Overlook blew up, and throughout the story that ending was alluded to in references to the faulty boiler. In the movie, Jack goes insane for no real explored reason. He’s just an asshole and a psychopath that decides to torment and terrify because he’s **bored**! His death at the end of the story was pointless, as was his murder of Halloran. In the end, nothing was gained, just a spooky ghost story whose elements never add up to anything more than Cabin Fever hallucinations.

It’s not just that the themes are opposite. The movie is inconsistent in its plot, one dimensional with its characters, and shallow in its morals. It was visually striking, and the sound and set designs were excellent, and that’s about as much positive things I have to say about it.

Like I said before, Stanley Kubrick was a brilliant artist. Several of the scenes from The Shining, like several scenes from most of his movies, in particular 2001: A Space Odyssey, are art in motion. But the script is bad, the acting is sub par, and the story is disappointing. Kubrick may have been a great artist, but he was a shitty storyteller.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T15:50:09Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,55
qe33qi_56,qe33qi,"That’s just my point, though. If The Shining is one of the best examples of a horror movie that is good, that’s a scathing indictment of all the other horror movies, because it is not, objectively, a good movie. It is poorly constructed, poorly written, and poorly acted.

As far as I can tell, the sole reason why The Shining is hailed as a masterpiece of horror movies is because of the (admittedly) fantastic cinematography. That’s it.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T21:20:17Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,56

qe33qi_61,qe33qi,"I get that. I'd seen the movie many times and always enjoyed it, but when I picked up the book it was an entirely different experience and I understand exactly why it gets flack for the vast departure. That said, I've learned over the years to appreciate adaptations for what they are and enjoy them as different interpretations of source material, and judge them on their own merits. Game of Thrones departed greatly from source material and was still very good, until it went down the shitter, while The Mist took a King novella and turned it into something even better than the original. In the case of The Shining, yeah, the movie only resembles the book in the broadest of strokes, but I can still appreciate it as an alternate take on the story, albeit the inferior one.

Doctor Sleep feels like a double-duty continuation and band-aid for the original film. It sticks to it's own source material *very* closely, while also throwing in some callbacks to the film version that it's acting as a continuation to, and in adapting to accommodate the changes in the original film, it manages to repair some of the damage, so far as it can. What we missed out on in the climax of the original film we get a taste of in Doctor Sleep's, and those that were fans of the book will greatly appreciate how they cap things off, even if it changes the ending drastically. I still prefer the book, but Doctor Sleep the movie just comes across as a sort of apology to fans of the books for all that they got cheated out of, and for that I genuinely loved it.",DomLite,2021-10-23T16:28:40Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,61

I will say that of course a 2.5-hour movie is going to be shallower than a 700-page book. But, given that handicap, I think the movie is deeper than the book. I think the themes are more compelling.

But you're right that it's completely different. I just don't think those differences are worse. It's just that it uses the same basic plot to tell an entirely different story with a different point. And it uses things like Halloran's anticlimactic death to tell that story in the way it needs to be told. You don't like that point, or the way that it's told, and that's fine.

It introduces plot elements that are later forgotten or abandoned, it introduces characters that end up not mattering in the way they are set up, it brings up interesting concepts such as the existence of the supernatural and then fails to expound upon them or explore them, and it features characters without any discernible character arc or motivations beyond the surface level.

qe33qi_65,qe33qi,"You misunderstand the nature of my criticism of the Shining as a movie. I am not criticizing it because of its differences from the book. In fact, I saw the movie before I read the book, and hated it from the first viewing.

The movie is bad on its own merits, which is why it’s popularity has always been baffling to me. It’s poorly written, featuring red herrings, audience based misdirection, and useless additions. It adds elements it does not explain nor fit together, and has a payoff that is unsatisfying in its pointlessness. It follows four characters, three of whom are portrayed by untalented actors, and the fourth of whom is clearly having the time of his life playing an unrepentant, irredeemable jackass that acts like a cartoonish villain in the third act for reasons that are insufficiently explored.

From a narrative perspective, The Shining is simply a bad movie. It’s great from an atmospheric perspective, but a good atmosphere does not a good movie make.

That the book is so good makes me hate the movie more, but even just judged as a stand-alone movie it isn’t good.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T18:55:09Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,65
qe33qi_66,qe33qi,"I really don’t see how one could claim that the movie for The Shining is deeper than the book. I just flat out fail to see how the claim has any merit. The fact that the book, like most books, allows the reader an insight into the inner workings of the characters minds is just an immediate boost to the depth of said characters. It’s an intrinsic problem to the medium, it’s much more difficult for cinema to give the audience that perspective.

More so, the supernatural elements of the story are core to the book, whereas they are in the movie only for shock value and atmosphere. It’s not deep to have the encounter with the zombie in room 237 without any understanding of who that woman was, why she killed herself, and how the Overlook claimed her soul. It’s not deep to show a man stalk his own son with an axe because he’s gone mad, it is deep to show a demonic presence playing at the insecurities of a family to satisfy its malevolent desire to keep its occupants as permanent prisoners to torture.

I just don’t see the argument from your perspective. You’ve asserted depth without demonstrating any, whereas I think I’ve done a decent job of demonstrating the shallowness of the screenplay. I think the best example of that was the twins. “Come play with us, Danny.” Who were they? Where did they go after that scene? Where did they come from? Why did they want to entrap Danny? All they introduce are questions without answers. That’s not depth, that’s “you know what would be scary?” being pitched for a movie. It’s art, not story.

As for Minority Report, I’ve never read the book, so I don’t have much opinion. I liked the movie just fine, even though it was (intentionally, I presume) misnamed. After all, John Anderton didn’t actually have a minority report. But the story was cohesive, the script was fine. Later events were nicely foreshadowed, and everything that takes place fits within the narrative. You can’t honestly say that about the Shining, where Danny’s visions had no impact on the sequence of events, where Halloran’s supernatural expertise ended ten seconds after he entered the Overlook, and where the ghosts and apparitions appear and disappear as the script demands with nothing in the story actually connecting them together in any real way.

I get that you disagree with my position, but as far I can tell your disagreement is based on feelings, because you’ve raised no valid objections to any particular point, and your own points don’t seem (in my opinion) to hold up to scrutiny.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T18:47:43Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,66
qe33qi_67,qe33qi,"In fairness, The Shining is infamous for the fact that Stanley Kubrick outright tortured Shelley Duvall during it's production. He made her do dozens and dozens of takes back to back while screaming at her and not allowing her to rest or take a break. He had a vision of Wendy that was very different from the book version and pushed to ensure it got captured on film. Shelley Duvall herself was a very accomplished and capable actress, so any appearance of her being annoying isn't due to Duvall herself, but rather what Kubrick wanted to portray.

Regardless, even if she was retooled specifically to be annoying in the film version compared to her quiet yet determined nature in the book, that only reinforces the fact that Kubrick pushed for Jack to basically hate his family from the jump, rather than being a good guy with a dark past who is making a monumental effort to be better because he loves them so much. Movie Jack shows no such inclination, and one could easily imagine that in a different set of circumstances, he might have finished his book, got published and instantly dumped Wendy and Danny on a curb somewhere to go do a few lines off of hookers ass because he cared so little for them.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:06:53Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,67
qe33qi_68,qe33qi,"And that's fair game too. We all have personal tastes. I agree that the film feels a little bare bones, but Kubrick is kind of prone to those type of screenplays, where he leaves a lot to the imagination, leaving the impression of turning to the camera as the credits roll and asking ""So what do *you* think happened?"" I can enjoy films that leave some things unexplained and up to the audience to fill in the blanks, because it can lead to some phenomenal debate over the story, philosophy, logic and any number of other subjects brought up by the material. I think that's exactly what he was aiming for with The Shining. The book tells things in a rather concrete manner, while Kubrick took the concept and just decided to make all of the happenings supernatural and mysterious with no explanation, so as to make it more scary via the unknown nature of it. We know Freddy Kreuger gets you in your dreams, and Candyman can only get you if you say his name three times in the mirror, but The Shining basically throws in the idea of psychic people and the impressions left behind by evil then leads you to ask if that bartender Jack talks to is a psychic impression he can see because he shines and doesn't realize it, an actual ghost, or the devil himself taking Jacks soul in exchange for a drink, leading to his absolute loss of sanity and descent into murderous rage. Or maybe it's all just visual symbolism and none of it actually happened. If it's just psychic impressions and not actual ghosts then why does Wendy see the torrent of blood from the elevators, and the Dog Man? She's not implied to shine even in the slightest in the books. Maybe she's just hallucinating?

I know it all sounds a little pretentious and film snobby, but I kind of get the angle he was going for. He took a story outline and turned it into a film that was scary on the surface but prompted debate on the nature of evil itself, as well as the nature of the evil within the film. The spareness of it all is intentional so as to make the nebulous evil of the Overlook more menacing. Vampires are burned by the sun and holy water. Werewolves die to a silver bullet. A nameless, formless evil that seems to inhabit a place and corrupt those under its influence while trying to feed on those most sensitive to it is a much scarier thing to come up against. You can fight a monster. An evil place that has no heart to stake or head to cut off and constantly tries to get its proverbial claws into you and make you a part of it is a lot more unsettling, and by leaving so much up to debate, Kubrick portrayed it as something sort of unknowable and powerful, and the fact that the only thing Wendy and Danny could do to survive was to simply run and never look back without ever truly defeating it was an intentional choice I feel.

Of course, this is all just my personal take on things, and it's also perfectly valid to just... not like something. I've seen plenty of highly acclaimed films and thought they were hot garbage, and even I acknowledge that The Shining isn't a perfect film by any means. I just appreciate what the approach was and the way it tries to portray evil by... not really portraying it at all. It just *is* and the only thing you can do is run away and hope you live to see the dawn.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:32:45Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,68
qe33qi_69,qe33qi,"For what it's worth, I completely agree with every point you've made. I don't think Kubrick made a decent film post-*2001* except for *Eyes Wide Shut*, which is a masterpiece. He was a cold and controlling person and this overwhelms all of his work—his utter misreading of *The Shining* (if you don't subscribe to the opinion that he simply bought the rights to strip-mine the book for cool ideas and images to film) shows how completely he failed to understand and present actual human emotions.",HugoNebula,2021-10-24T10:55:08Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,69
qe33qi_70,qe33qi,"I also fully agree the movie was way deeper than the book. Stephen king wrote a story about a haunted hotel. Kubrick was not trying to directly adapt the Shining, but rather use it as a vehicle to explore themes of generational trauma, the atrocities committed by humanity over the decades, genocide and familial abuse. I'm not saying that the book didn't explore those things as well, but it was much less abstract and thought provoking than Kubrick's movie because it wasn't exploring the human condition the way Kubrick was. I feel like you're looking at the movie through the lens of the book and trying to make sense of the movie through that book which I believe is the wrong way of looking at it. Kubrick had no intention of directly adapting the novel and included several specific details to show the audience that that is what he was doing. I think you have to look at the movie and book as two completely different entities that can be valued separately for different reasons. Personally the movie is one of my favorites of all time because of how incredibly well Kubrick uses elements of the book stripped of their original intent to create not only a new story, but as well create allegories and explore themes of historical atrocities that continue over time, way beyond the surface level events of just what happened at the overlook. I think what you are mistaking as shallowness is just trying to view the movie through the lens of the book which is just never going to work. The movie is actually like, super notorious for the amount of deeper meaning that was layered into it and as far as what I understand the book does not inspire even close to the same kind of analysis that the movie does. The book attempted to be more of a character study, the movie never attempted to be that even for a second because that's not the story Kubrick was trying to tell.",TDS_patient_no7767,2021-10-23T20:20:54Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,70
qe33qi_71,qe33qi,"I don't really want to get into an argument about the Shining because while it's one of my favorite movies, I don't have it on top of my head and it has been a few years since I've seen it.

 Appeals to popularity don't invalidate the argument. You saying that the Shining is objectively bad is counteracted by people who study the movie and say it's objectively good. Perhaps different people look at different things and attribute different value to the same thing. Maybe what you think makes a movie bad is something I do not care about and what you think makes a book good is something that I don't care about. 

Despite not knowing the movie by heart, I'll try to address your points.

The Shining being irrelevant to the movie? Don't think this matters at all, it adds to the mysticism of the universe and lends strength to the supernatural elements of the movie.

 
Danny being superfluous to the story? Couldn't care less, he's a small child dealing with things he doesn't understand and has little control over.

The supernatural elements are scary for the sake of scary? Do not agree at all. When Wendy sees the dog giving a blowjob to the waiter, that is not being scary for the sake of being scary. Narrative explanation doesn't have to be explicit to exist and also does not need to exist at all.

Halloran being a red herring is another thing I don't think matters. It emphasizes the point that it's Wendy and Danny alone that must deal with the monster that is pursuing them.


Have you seen The Shining mini-series directed by Stephen King? Do you think it was better than the movie? The movie being much more open ended and leaving things to be explained make for much more memorable and valuable media, in my opinion.",,2021-10-23T21:46:32Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,71

qe33qi_74,qe33qi,"I’m really confused by this argument. You’re like the fifth person to argue that I’m looking at the movie from the perspective of the book. I can assure you, I am not.

Firstly, I saw the movie before reading the book, and I hated it from the first viewing because the cinematic narrative flaws were apparent to me even then.

The Shining itself is entirely irrelevant to the plot of the movie, nor are the ghosts and various supernatural apparitions ever tied to hallucinations or otherwise made to be an exploration of the human condition. That’s why this argument doesn’t hold up. The movie was loaded with scary things there for the sake of being scary, and that detracts from any potential message about the exploration of generational trauma.

This reeks of post hoc rationalization, where rather than judging the content by its own merits, you are judging the content based on the messages **you** have applied to it.

That’s about as far from objective as you can get. I am criticizing the movie for as close to objective reasons as I can manage.

For example, the character of Halloran is, cinematically, a red herring. He is introduced to the audience as another person with the special quality as Danny. Never in the movie is the nature of the Shining explored, it is intentionally kept vague. Through The Shining, Danny is able to receive visions, though these visions fail to change anything about the sequence of events, nor do they explore Danny or his father as individuals. Narratively, they are white noise. Danny is then able to use The Shining to call for help from Halloran in the third act. Halloran comes to the call, demonstrating that there is some truth to the usefulness of the phenomenon. Only this is untrue, as Halloran gets slaughtered ten seconds after entering the hotel. Had the scenes with Danny calling and Halloran answering been cut from the movie, the plot would have been unchanged. That Danny and his mother stole the dead man’s snow speeder to escape is almost irrelevant given that happened in the last seconds of the film and their escape was still ambiguous (prior to the release of Doctor Sleep, anyway).

Cinematically, the movie is poorly constructed. The ideas are muddled and the themes unclear. The idea you can honestly argue that the movie wasn’t about a haunted hotel given the presence of literal ghosts is a little silly. Kubrick just didn’t commit to the supernatural elements and used them purely for atmosphere. Which is bad filmmaking.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T21:34:19Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,74
qe33qi_75,qe33qi,"I mean, I loved the ending of the novel immensely with Danny unleashing the ghosts on everyone and siccing Abra's grandmother in particular on Rose. That was powerful. The Hotel needn't be involved for it to be impactful that Danny finds some measure of closure for his personal (and very real) demons while also paving a path forward to a better life for himself at the place where all of those demons were born.

That said, I give full marks to the film for taking the original ending of The Shining and recasting Danny as the tragic figure who is subsumed by the evil of the Overlook and forced to chase down someone he loves and wants desperately not to hurt before the place goes up in a boiler explosion, exactly like it did in the original. It's a much darker ending, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but both have some great merit on their own. The movie gives it a darker bent, as well as adapting one of the best parts of the original book that got gutted in terms of impact in the original film, while the book tells a tale of a man who's had a rough go of life from the very beginning returning to the place where all his troubles began and *literally* vanquishing his demons so he can move towards a brighter tomorrow. The film version rights a wrong from the original adaptation and delivers some feelings and concepts that should have been in the original, while the book provides a triumphant showdown against evil.

I enjoy both, though for different reasons, and I quite enjoy having two different takes on the same story. I still think one is better than the other, but that doesn't make either of them ""bad"", just different.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:17:07Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,75
qe33qi_76,qe33qi,"I’ve admitted on multiple occasions myself that the cinematography and set/sound design for the movie are incredible. I’m not denying that. The entire draw point of the movie over the book is the phenomenal atmosphere Kubrick managers to cultivate.

But it’s poorly written and constructed. That you appeal to how the movie made you feel rather than how it was put together, as well as the fact that you characterize the book’s ending as poor, honestly just tells me you don’t have any appreciation for narrative structure.

And that’s totally fine.

But the problem is when you’re arguing against objective evaluation with an attitude of not caring about objective evaluation. If you don’t care about the things a movie does right and wrong, and you only care about how it makes you feel, then such discussions are entirely pointless. We’re just speaking past each other.

So I’m glad you enjoy the movie, but I insist that there is a meaningful difference between something being enjoyable, and something being well made.

Kubrick was a wonderful artist, and The Shining has several moments that are art in motion. But the story is awful, and the script is poor, and I honestly don’t understand perspectives like yours that choose to dismiss all of that.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T22:12:28Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,76

They cannot be dismissed, they are present in the entire movie and take up center stage in many of the movie's points. You mention the phenomenal atmosphere, and the phenomenal atmosphere was precisely what Kubrick was trying to create and what the majority of people resonate with. In the same way that you say I'm dismissing your objective criticisms, I can also say that you're dismissing the things that make the movie great.

Other things that are good.

Jack Nicolson is incredible. The feeling of isolation is incredible. The portrayal of domestic abuse is incredible. And honestly, seeing the majority of the movie from Jack's perspective makes it much more powerful as well. I do not see Danny as being the main character in the Shining, it is all about Jack. 

I can't speak of the script because, again, I don't have the book on the top of my head, but I find the movie's story to be way more compelling than the book's, I couldn't take it seriously. The changes to the story are a big improvement, in my eyes.



The things you say are badly made, for me, were not badly made at all, but even if they were, they are completely irrelevant to the quality of the movie. King's writing is very simplistic.

I think King hates it so much because of that, and that book is also very very personal to him. To see the characters and story portrayed as they were made audiences think that that was the story he had written, and it wasn't. I don't think that adaptations need to be symmetric to their source texts, and The Shining is an excellent piece of art in its own right. 

The main problem I have with the movie is that Stanley Kubrick is a bad person on a human level. The psychological abuse of the cast and crew, particularly Shelley Duvall, is what makes it hard for me to love that movie. I don't care how good his film making was, Kubrick was a major prick and I think that's another reason that King hated it so much. It was a dishonest portrayal of the characters he wrote (regardless of how good their reinvention was) and the environment of the production itself was hostile as hell.

j1a18t_5,j1a18t,"I'm know that I'm biased; the movie is one of my favorites. And -is- my favorite horror movie, hands down. So, grain of salt.

But i do think it's unfair to call Kubrick's The Shining a generic haunted house movie. The slow burn of the tension, the amazing practical effects, the feeling of being off-kilter for the whole film. Even the subtext, which may or may not have been included,  and what Kubrick may or may not have meant by it, is interesting. 

I do agree that the movie does not reflect the book well. But then, it's hard to translate such a book into a visual medium and not lose something. And we know this, because we have proof. In 1997, Stephen King  wrote and produced a TV mini series based on his own novel. He was involved in pretty much every aspect of the series, and so gave us his version of The Shining as a visual media product.

And it's dull. 

It's not awful. The character development is much better. The woman that plays Wendy is ages better than Shelley Duvall (who, in my opinion,  is the weakest part of Kubrick's version). But it remains drawn out and slightly boring.

And look at Dr. Sleep. It was a decent enough novel, but the movie, i thought, was messy and saccharine. 

Kubrick was notorious for cutting up source material to fit his own ends. Just look at the controversy surrounding A Clockwork Orange. But I don't think that diminishes the merits of his version of the Shining. I like to think his movie is a distillation of King's novel, and goes a long way to doing what King himself recommends when storytelling: show me, don't tell me.",KinshuKiba,2020-09-28T12:20:54Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,5

I think it is a big stretch to say he has a ""long history of poor adaptations"". In fact, regarding film adaptations of famous books, I would say that King probably has the best record of any author whos books have adaptions at all.

That being said, yes, the Shining film does leave a lot of internal monologuing out of the narration. You don't quite get the same sympathy for Jack in the film as he appears in the book.

The film is full of mystery in a way the book is not.  

Perhaps the book resonates more with those who have struggled with addiction. But for me, it was a little too obvious and not my favorite of King's.

I was hoping Flanagan would retcon it a little at the end of Doctor Sleep, but I guess he was under too much pressure given how many people primarily knew (and again - liked!) the original story from Kubrick's film. I understand why King hates Kubrick's version - while there have definitely been other adaptations that have been bad or at least badly received, I can't imagine any of them have so completely and aggressively *missed the entire point of the story* the way the film version of The Shining does.",jcpianiste,2020-09-28T13:09:39Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,23
j1a18t_24,j1a18t,"Your opinion, while valid, represents a misunderstanding of the difference between artistic mediums and the purpose of adaptation, and I'd like to respectfully offer a counterpoint. 

First, your reading of King's *Shining* is sound. King's been on top of his genre for decades, and upon reading something as seminal as *The Shining*, there should be no question as to why. King is a masterful storyteller, when given the room to explore themes and craft characters, and with *The Shining* clocking in between 400 and 500 pages (depending on your edition), he undoubtedly had the time and space to craft an intricate and moving story. 

However, great books rarely make for great films when adapted at face value. Look at the works of Jules Verne, Mary Shelley, and J.R.R. Tolkien, or more recently, Madeleine L'Engle, Eoin Colfer, or Lois Lowry. While the relative greatness of these books can be debated, it is fairly universally accepted that adaptations thereof have ranged from disappointing to abhorrent. This is due to the inherent differences in the two media. Both are narrative, but literature has the benefit of much slower consumption and digestion, while film has to use an entire audiovisual arsenal to get its concepts across in realtime over the course of a few hours. 

That brings us to the matter of adaptation as a whole. While some near 1:1 adaptations have been attempted in the past, and to some success (the *Lord of the Rings* and a few of the *Harry Potter* films come to mind as immediate examples of close adherence to a text), these are typically exceptions to the rule, and films that get more liberal with their source material often have a better chance of survival. Point in case - and probably the most extreme example of rampant success beyond an original text - *Forrest Gump*. A fair amount of viewers have no idea it's an adaptation, and those that are familiar with the source text strongly abide by the creative decisions made by Roth and Zemeckis, citing its runaway success. 

And finally, to deem Kubrick's *Shining* a generic horror movie is outright false. Perhaps you're referring to the film's similarities to a number of contemporary (and shallower) imitators, to which I'd like to point out that, as far as ""generic"" horror movies go, Kubrick provided the prototype rather than following the design. Every one of Kubrick's films represent wild innovation. From the ambiguity of the film's conclusion, to the impeccable attention to mise en scene, to the brutal treatment of the cast during filming, he pushed the envelope to the point of bursting. The narrative spin towards cyclical violence and predestination allowed Kubrick to tell a largely similar story to King's novel without an overreliance on it. There are significant departures from King's writings, especially in regards to lost themes, but all of these are for the express purpose of delivering a Kubrick film over a King adaptation. 

In short, King was perfectly within his rights to dismiss Kubrick's film as a visualization of his novel - and a phenomenal novel it is - but as an adaptation, and as a prototype for modern horror, *The Shining* is nearly unparalleled. It sits atop dozens of ""greatest horror film"" lists, largely because of Kubrick's ruthless innovation.",darkbloo64,2020-09-28T14:35:42Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,24

j1a18t_36,j1a18t,"I prefer the movie to the book. Remember that these are two different mediums and The Shining is no short novel.

The very end of the film grabs us and up to the last screen we're filled with terror. It never ends, even the credits are creepy.

I can also see King being upset because Jack is obviously an avatar for himself. To see what Kubrick did with the character, to the point where it's Kubrick's version of Jack that is analyzed by pop culture influencers. I've seen different views of what Kubrick's Shining means, but it seems like the novel gave us a straight forward horror story.

Now again, that may be because of the medium, the end of a story on page pulls different emotions than the final screen in a movie. 

There was a video I watched where during Scatman's return to the hotel we see a red VW bug in a car accident on the side of the road, the car that Jack drove in the novel.

j1a18t_89,j1a18t,"I have not read a lot of King, *The Shining* is the only one I read in recent times, but I really didn't love what I saw there. I thought the book is overlong and meandering, each one of its points drags and drags and it's constantly repeated. There's almost nothing left there to be inferred from the text because everything is very clearly spelled out. 

Also the notion of the hotel having a ""small"" problem with a boiler that causes it to *literally go up in flames* was a bit much - and the ending, with the hero jumping into a burning building to save the victims felt very cliched.

I don't know, I didn't *love* the book, but maybe that's because I came from a preconveived notion of loving the movie and having watched it first. It's really hard to be objective with this things when you get to it already prejudiced.

I'm of the opinion that Kubrick really salvaged the story by making it into a fable about domestic abuse. It's quite unfair to call it a ""generic"" horror movie when it's hardly a horror movie at all. 

Not about a father that *deep down* is a good guy but gets turned evil by external forces (and so can be ultimately forgiven) but an irredemable prick. In the movie, the setting of the hotel only brings out Jack's limitations and frustrations, but they were all already there from the start - hence the fact that he never actually wrote a word of his play. 

Ultimately I prefer the movie because it really doesn't allow for any ""buts"". Jack wasn't a good guy *but* for his drinking and demonic possession, he was always an abuser and his wife was always an enabler, which is a lot closer to what happens in real life. And, of course, there's no magical hero who jumps in and save the day; instead, he gets the axe.",DoctorWhoSeason24,2020-09-28T17:06:34Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,89

King's books need a mini-series to even come close to doing them justice. We saw this with The Stand. Under the Dome had potential but it lost steam halfway through (in all fairness it was a weak story to begin with).

j1a18t_127,j1a18t,"I would hardly call it ""generic"". If The Shining was a generic horror movie then you would have some guy running around with a hockey mask and a machete killing teens that are having sex in abandoned campsites. Its fair to criticize it *as an adaptation,* sure, but a bad adaptation does not a bad movie make. The fact that you liked it the first time through and then only changed your mind after reading the book is evidence of that. 

Now I haven't read the book, but it does bother me a bit when people complain about movies not faithfully following the source material 100%. Books are almost always more dense content wise than movies are by the very nature of the medium itself. Few books are capable of fitting their entire plotline into the narrow space of a two-hour film. Movies have to cut things, its just the way it is. Now that doesn't mean its impossible to make bad decisions about what content to cut and how things are presented, but I do think we should strive to judge adaptations on their own merit as completely separate entities, because that's exactly what they are. You have to view them as a non-cannon or alternate universe version of the original. 

Personally, I think a perfect recreation of a book into a movie would be boring, anyway. What would be the point if they're identical? New interpretations of the same thing are fun.",BloomingBrains,2020-09-28T22:54:25Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,127

I’d say The Shining is so far my favourite movie adaptation of his books, because it tried to capture the feeling and atmosphere instead of blindly following the plots, which to me is never really the essence of King’s stories. 
I agree with you in that what I loved most about the book is missing in the movie, but the movie is great on its own in a very different way nonetheless.",A-cake-crusader,2020-09-28T22:58:07Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,128
j1a18t_129,j1a18t,"I think it’s a bit unfair to call ‘The Shining’ a generic horror movie. It shaped the genre as we know it today, and helped bring more respect to an often overlooked genre of movies. 

I do however agree with your sentiment on how Stephen King viewed the adaptation of his book. Too often, despite how good a genre-defining movie may be, we tend to dismiss the thoughts of the author of the source material. There parts of the novel that make it clear how personal this book is to King. He adapted his most raw and real experiences with drinking, into a character version of those worst moments, when he no longer felt like a person, but something else entirely. 

An author is not required to like to the film version of their work, especially when it means that much to them and strays so far from the original text. But to deny the beauty and atmosphere of Kubrick’s work, and baselessly insult his vision, is crude and off point. Kubrick adapted what he saw in the book. A man already broken in his own right, slowly teetering towards the brink of full blown destruction. There is a reason the movie is so beloved, you don’t have to insult the fans to make your point.",tiddymiddy,2020-09-28T22:59:57Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,129

a few times and have taken a different opinion on it ans forgive me but this is just my opinion of an adaptation Kubrick did on it.

I think starting with the point of when Jack first drinks and meets ""Lloyd"". I'm quite sure Lloyd existed back home wherever and was his bartender, as Jack has the conversation with himself and gets drunk I really think the story in it's entirety to begin with is Jack struggling with his own demons. He loses his sanity, alone (with his family there). He's told of the story of what happened in the hotel and it plants a sort of seed in his brain and festers and grows which explains the dream. Albeit the house is haunted and left dark energies behind all of Jacks demons get him throughout the movie and grow. Yes there's spirits there and the little boy senses them with his gift but I believe the party and caretaker is Jack in his own mind battling demons and they get the better of him.

The one who sees the truth but cannot comprehend. The one who comprehends the truth but refuses to see the significance. The one who tries to help and is killed for it. The one who has with full knowledge of the problem. The one who succumbs to the evil. From the very begining the signs are there that something is very wrong with that place (the impossible architecture, moving furniture, advertisements for activities not offered).  everyone chooses to ignore it.

j1a18t_137,j1a18t,"Well yeah, cause Kubrick was trying to use The Shining to describe his activity working on a fake moon landing video that was to be played if the Apollo 11 crew had died during mid way orbit or during decent. It didn't matter if the crew made it back, just that the US said they made it to the moon. It's probably Kubrick's best work that no one got to see, but yet, no moral person would want that footage to have to be used, right? The moral quandaries of watching and waiting as the A11 mission was occurring probably drove him insane - were they going to use his footage? He'd know instantly if they did. If they did use the footage, was the crew dead? But then it comes over the air waves - A11 works. A sigh of relief comes over Kubrick as they'll be no 'theatrical play'. That peak excitement now leads to Kubrick feeling dull. He's become nothing; a spook; some specter that can never talk about it. Kubrick had lived with keeping secrets before after filming nukes in Nevada(you know that really picturesque footage of troops rising out of the trenches) for the Army, but people still saw that footage. Every High School kid in America has seen that footage; it's what the US Army uses to drum up fascist support and get troops in boots. But how could he get people to remember his work that was never shown? By subverting the plot of one well known story in order to subconsciously overlap a hidden message through imagery and sounds. We know Kubrick knows about this kind of hypnosis and mental manipulation because Kubrick depicted its use in A Clockwork Orange, a film he followed nearly 100% to the book, much like almost ALL of Kubricks film's faithfully did. Such a hyper focused man as Kubrick, authenticity was key. That's what is so terrifying about the brainwashing scene in ACO - it's real. That's a real surgeon putting clamps in his eyes. He's actually strapped there, and the screen is showing actual imagery of Ultra Violence. Except here's the thing Kubrick realized - not only had he actually injured the actor while doing so, but that kind of method of mind control just wouldn't work. He needed something far more subtle. Remember, he's just trying to get people to remember something that was never seen, not slice off everyone retina. And this is when it hits him - people want to see a film that is almost word for word adaptation of a book/play/etc. When it is NOT, the human brain subconsciously picks out every single flaw and says ""this shouldn't be here"". To most humans, they write this off to 'artistic' interpretations, however, Kubrick is not the kind of person to just subvert the authenticity. That's cause he didn't give two licks about some coked out writer; he was going to tell his own story for once. Things like the twin sisters(reference to those lost during the Gemini), changing of the rooms from 217 to 237(rough distance to the moon in Km), ""A11 work(s) and no (theatrical) play makes Jack a dull boy"", and the continuous attack on the rocket ships that are disguised as Native America imagery(which was designed specifically for the movie with zero input from natives) never occurred in the book.

Nobody ever complains about any of those because they weren’t by a massively successful author.

The Shining as a film is a tense experience and completely different, but still a great watch for the disturbing imagery, music, atmosphere and the fantastic performances. I read the book a few years ago and it just evoked a while different set of feelings. Jack was a good man, all the way to the end, Wendy was a stronger character and Danny was a clever kid who was wise beyond his years. The hotel felt more evil and honestly the whole thing made me afraid to leave my room at night for a few days. It was powerful. Doctor Sleep evoked a different kind of dread, but also horrified me in other terrible ways, with the True Knot being some of the most evil monsters I had ever read about, and yet somehow making them into people too, which drew conflicting emotions. I think the film actually did a great job adapting the book more faithfully with the ending altered to pair with the film of The Shining while also paying homage to the original book. It was heart-breaking but I kind of enjoyed the tragic ending for the films versus the books. They’re two alternate takes on the story and I can appreciate them both, though the books will always win out in the end.

I’ve learned to be more open-minded about adaptations after the Silent Hill movie. I adore the video game series and know all the lore and creepy shit behind it, so when the movie went off-the-rails with characters, beings that didn’t belong and the general flow of the story, I was a little off-put, but in the end I just looked at it as an alternate take on the story and was happy to enjoy it for what it was. Yeah, there are bad adaptations and those deserve to be criticized, but there are also adaptations that simply draw inspiration from the source material and tell a different version of the story. Sometimes they’re great and can enrich the overall experience, and sometimes they flop hard.

With that being said, I can see why King was upset with how it was adapted. I almost don’t even think of them as the same story.

I think this is the key thing to appreciate about adaptations. Kubrick was a hell of a director, and he fundamentally understood how to create a powerful cinematic experience. He keenly understood the medium.

King is a master of his medium. The unfortunate part, is that the two mediums have entirely different pressures and methods of telling stories. They correlate to a degree, but they only seem to overlap in broad strokes.

You can get away with 800 pages of setup, only to resolve the whole novel in 200. In a film, you have three acts to work with, and your setup needs to be done after the first or you lose your audience.

It really is apples and oranges. When you compare character building, motivation, and story arcs though, you can really make clear comparisons. The real difficulty is when you rigidly cling to aspects that work in one medium and fully expect them to work in another without taking away from all of the other aspects that make the film work as is.

And let's not forget the trainwreck that was Maximum Overdrive. King couldn't even do a good film adaptation of his own work, so it really shows that it's a completely different skillset. No one ever let him direct again after 1986.",,2020-09-28T22:11:35Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,161

j1a18t_165,j1a18t,"Yeah personally I find ""The Shining"" to be a pretty unremarkable book (nothing wrong with it, but I don't see most people list it among King's best, and I'm not his biggest fan to begin with), whereas ""The Shining"" is among the great, enduring, horror classics.

It's just a different medium, trying for very different things. I totally understand why King dislikes it, it tramples all over his original vision, and throws it in the trash. But if the goal of an adaptation is to be faithful, what's the point? A direct translation to a new medium will always be worse than the medium it's intended for. 

If your summation of the film is strictly about plot beats (characterization, motivations, etc), well then, that's not really the heart of the movie? Film is a visual medium. If you evaluate any movie on the terms of a ""summary and bullet point presentation"", then that's entirely missing the point. 

Doesn't mean you have to like the movie. It's a pretty alienating watch, on many levels (pacing, acting, unresolved loose ends, intentional ambiguity, etc). But if your reaction is purely ""the book painted the family as loving, and the movie is dark and cold, so it sucks"", that's pretty shallow? It's perfectly fine to use that to articulate why you prefer one to the other (we all have our own tastes), but I'd at least keep an open mind as to why the film is still discussed decades later, and is very well regarded by many critics. My university recently did a fancy restored 35mm print showing of it, with a lecture before, and a packed house. I wouldn't just leap to the conclusion that those professors missed the part where Jack was supposed to be a loving father, and be dismissive of the reasons people might be packing the room decades later.

I'm sure that Kubrick intended to change Jack's characterization from the beginning or he would have cast someone else.

The Shining is the only Kubrick movie that I can enjoy watching, and that's only if I see it as a story that happens in an alternate world from the book - or a different level of the Dark Tower, since we're referring to King.  It's a great story about a man on the edge who succumbs to insanity in a creepy, isolated hotel and who's insanity infects his family in different ways - to the point where it could be argued that everything Danny sees was influenced by his father's madness.

The book is about a fractured family who still love each other, but who are isolated in an evil, haunted hotel that uses the fractures against them in order to steal the psychic abilities of the little boy by first terrorizing him and then manipulating his father into killing him.  

Of the two plots I prefer the haunted evil hotel over the human insanity.  I hear about so much human evil in the world that it is unsurprising to find it in movies too, even when paired with possible supernatural events - but the idea of a hunted hotel with an evil agenda to devour the soul of an innocent child is terrifying! 

I will admit to loving most of King's concepts because he takes the usual horror tropes and twists them into the realm of the unexplainable ""what if"" that has no logical explanation.  I see where it leads to unsatisfactory endings in some of his books - but then again, I can't see any real-world fight against the supernatural having a satisfying or even clear-cut ending.",kayjee17,2020-09-29T02:02:36Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,190

j1a18t_192,j1a18t,"I think you really hit the nail with this explanation. I feel many viewers don't recognize there's also a difference between a writer/director making a film ""adaptation"" and a film ""interpretation"" of a book (though, marketing any/every book-based film as an ""adaptation"" doesnt really help). LotR and Harry Potter films are good examples of adaptation since the goal was to visually project the author's ""mind's eye"". The Shining, on the other hand, is a good example of an interpretation because the goal wasnt to visualize Steven King's vision, but Kubric's re-imagining of the story. 

You can draw good parallels to things that happen in the music industry all the time, though I feel there's generally less of a negative visceral reaction in deviating from the source material. One example would be to compare Disturbed's cover (read: adaptation) of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" with Johnny Cash's interpretation of Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"". In both instances, the lyrics and the general music share significant commonality with their respective sources, but in terms of audience perception and artistic license, the gap is much wider between NIN's ""Hurt"" and Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"" than Disturbed and S&G's ""Sound of Silence"". 
(Disturbed did a version of Sound of Silence vs Cash making a song called Hurt with the same lyrics/base melody as a song called Hurt written by NIN)

Edit: now that I think about it, distinguishing between an adaptation and interpretation isnt really marketing's fault as much as it is us as viewers reading ""based on"", ""inspired by"", and ""re-imagining"" as different phrases saying the same thing.",McCuumhail,2020-09-28T16:33:10Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,192

One of the biggest draws of king is the slow burn of that uneasy feeling. It’s the slow incorporation of slight environment changes over time that build that suspense and anxiety of the unknown, to where it finally boils over.

This is easily the biggest drawback of king books vs films. The shining movie moves too fast compared to the book. Where the books feels minute to minute, the movie can feel hour to hour. How many times does Danny come around the hotel room? The eeriness of the scrapbook giving the history of the hotel, all the conversations Danny has with tony.

I also love the feeling that the evil that Jack becomes was inside him the entire time, and the hotel itself didn't drive him crazy, it just gave him an opportunity to let the evil out, and you see him grappling with ""do I do it or do I not do it, I really want to do it, but I shouldn't want to"" as he slowly descends into madness.

He was an amazing visual director, not cinematographer. While the cinematography has never failed to disappoint in a Kubrick film, he is not in charge of that. Cinematography, to put it simply, is the job/art of lighting the scene and dealing with the technical aspects of the photography of the shots. What Kubrick did, set up and align shots, tell actors how to perform, and even making sure certain visual elements were present within a scene are all part of the directorial aspect of filmmaking.

The person responsible for the cinematography of The Shining was John Alcott. He made sure scenes were lit properly as well as making sure the camera had the right settings for the shoot.",colorcorrection,2014-01-31T00:32:59Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,7

1wkoc0_19,1wkoc0,"I remember some of the ""Making Of"" for The Shining, shot by his daughter (and subsequently censored by the man himself). Kubrick would hang out with Jack Nicholson and egg him on, in order to give him the manic energy he needed for the part, and the two of them would play pranks on Shelley Duvall to keep her constantly agitated, again to make *her* part convincing. There's a scene where she comes to Kubrick and shows him her hair is falling out because of the stress (she actually takes a lump of hair off of her head) and he just laughs at her.

Another very telling story was by Malcolm McDowell, who said that Kubrick was his best friend during the shooting of A Clockwork Orange, they hung out, laughed together etc, but as soon as the shoot was finished, Kubrick broke all contact with him, and never spoke to him again.

Personally, none of this ruins the movies for me, which are arguably the best in cinematic history. The work and the man are simply not the same thing. Quite apart from that, you only need to watch his movies to realize that he was someone deeply in touch with the human condition.",zeptimius,2014-01-31T00:30:54Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,19

He said that years later, after he himself got sober, he realized that what he was describing in Jack’s situation was “white knuckle sobriety” - basically when people manage to stay sober, but failed to address the underlying problems, and hence have to “power through” their urges. The approach more often than not fails.

Whatever lived in the hotel was able to get to Jack, because he was emotionally vulnerable, and all the violence Jack displayed when drunk was still in him under a thin coating of “I do it for my family”.

Since your post is about The Shining, I’ll use that as an example. For me, the most “horrifying” element of this story was never the ghosts, it was Jack. As the child of an alcoholic, it was both incredibly relatable, and deeply unsettling to see how well King nailed that feeling of dread at seeing your parent change before your very eyes into something monstrous.

enqb6i_1,enqb6i,"The first paragraph in this review of doctor sleep sums up the difference between the book and the movie in the best way I’ve read.

“As Stephen King once (or maybe twice) said, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining is a good horror film but a horrible adaptation of King’s novel, one that arguably misses what makes the book so harrowing. And yet it’s nearly impossible to weigh one against the other; both are equally great for entirely different reasons: King’s novel is about alcoholism and the cycle of abuse, of battling ancient familial demons and the desperate struggle to assume control over something that seems uncontrollable. Kubrick’s film is a cinematic masterwork, but it’s more about the inherently evil nature of man and our precarious grip on sanity; it’s less concerned with exploring human themes and more preoccupied with treating the psyche like a poltergeist.”

The movie is called “The Shining”, which refers to the psychic gift Danny has. In the book, the Shining allows him to “communicate” with the hotel, and in the end - and this is important - it’s the Shining that allows Danny and his mother to survive his fathers madness.

In the movie, we get to understand the Shining, what Danny sees because of it, and his ability to communicate with Mr Hallorann. But then the last time the Shining is of any significance is when Danny calls on Hallorann to save them, only to be unceremoniously axed to death.

enqb6i_4,enqb6i,"This is one of those comparisons that’s almost impossible to make because the shining transcends the medium and is pretty much a completely different work than the book. It’s barely even an adaption. 

King hated it, but I think the author and it’s critics misses the point when they critique the shining from a character centric point of view. It’s just a different animal. King’s book makes the most out of it’s medium as a book and Kubrick wanted to make the most out of the medium as a pure standalone film without the restrictions and expectations of a book.

Kubrick doesn’t use dynamic characters. He’s not really even concerned with character growth in the traditional writing sense. His films are deliberate in canceling out empathy and Kubrick as a director is known for demanding takes from his actors that are more alien, void of emotional connection, or just straight out outlandish. His films forces you to be an objective observer instead of an emotionally invested member. This was a common criticism during his time, but it’s also a quality that made Kubrick timeless and often cited as the greatest American director next to Hitchcock. Taking out empathy from his films allowed him to highlight his concepts, themes, screenplay, and cinematography in a really powerful way. I think the approach worked well in the shining because it gives the film a really eerily uncanny and trancelike atmosphere that haunts you the whole time through. Couple that with the intimate tracking of the overlook and the play on the subtle impossible rooms/spaces and you have a really creepy viewing experience.


With that said, it’s completely understandable that King had no love for the film since Kubrick certainly had no respect for the integrity of the source material.",yuushamenma,2020-01-12T23:02:06Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,4

Yes? That's in the book too. It just takes a lot longer + actually makes sense.

> Second, Jack is not exactly the picture of calm stability at the beginning of the book. Within the first 15 pages, we learn that he has serious anger issues. Before we meet Jack, he's already broken his toddler son's arm in a fit of rage, and beaten the shit out of one of his students to the point that the boy required hospitalization. 

You're conflating ""anger issues"" with psychosis and hallucinatory delusion? Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo K. See, that's not even correct as the entire concept in the book revolved around the ""activation"" of the house and the shining, where in the movie it was just... cabin fever.


> If Jack seems a little crazy at the beginning of the movie, then that's just being true to the source material.

I actually really like how George Hatfield is introduced in such a way you think he's just an irredeemable little shit but eventually it's revealed he's more of a mirror to Jack himself. But most of this stuff could and should have been left for later in the book instead of all garbled up for us at the start.

While I do think the ""ghosts as capitalism"" is an interesting angle I don't really think it holds up; Al Shockley is genuinely Jack's friends and he effectively uses cronyism to get him the Overlook job. If the book is a critique of capitalism's mental health effects on its workers, then shouldn't that be the core of Jack's trauma rather than his abusive father? Jack's pressure from his job isn't long hours or bad conditions, it's from Hatfield, a character specifically written in such a way to mirror him. Most of his stresses are only tangentially work-related. 

That said, I do think you could tell the Shining as an anti-capitalist allegory without the ghosts. I said in my first comment that Jack destroying the snocat struck me as the best written scene in the book, and his primary motivation for staying is because he knows this is his last real chance to get meaningful employment. But I honestly don't think it needs to be more explicit than the family having obvious finanical struggles that force them to isolate themselves.

This doesn’t mean that the movie is above criticism, but criticism doesn’t have to be dismissal, as is the direction so many fans of King seem to take it.  

Years ago, I read a piece by John Le Carre, who was in a somewhat similar situation after his novel *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* was adapted to a BBC miniseries.  Not that it was unfaithful (it wasn’t at all), but the character of George Smiley was played so distinctly by Alec Guinness that Le Carre simply had to admit that the character no longer belonged to him.  That even he could never look at him as anyone other than Guinness, and couldn’t help writing him with that embodiment in mind.  It was such an interesting little piece of writing, both thrilled with how far this character had gone, and melancholy with his loosened grip on it.

It seems you really want me to say what my issues are, so here goes. Keep in mind, I said they are subjective(even for art), and nitpicky. 

First, I feel all of Kubrick's films are... cold; inhuman. A stupendous imitation of human emotion, but an imitation, nonetheless. I haven't seen all of his films, and I suspect that if true, possibly intentional. The Shining is probably the worst example of this, but I still feel it. 

As far as my ""problems,"" I stated that I don't see the point of Holleran in the film. I'm not talking about how cool he is in the book here... I'm talking about a character that seems to have no point other than subverting expectations. I'd be curious if I'm just missing something. 

The movie also seems to show Jack as an everyman who is driven insane, but as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Nicholson seems crazy from the word go.

Not all of his books share this problem - *Misery* is fantastic, as is *Deloris Claiborne,* and *Pet Sematary* is absolutely scary. But many (most?) of his books do.

Maybe it's an issue of length - his short stories are fantastic.

Anyway, I'll always have King to thank for my love of reading. During the summer between fourth and fifth grades, I read *The Shining.* It took me all summer, but I finished it - and since then, I haven't stopped reading.

But even way back then, I knew that Kubrick's version of *The Shining* was a better, scarier *story.*

There's a part in the film during which Dick Hallorann, on his way to rescue Wendy and Danny, drives past a red VW Beetle crushed under an overturned semi.

io5052_7,io5052,"I actually read and watched The Shining for the first time this summer in that order. I was very excited to watch the movie since I’ve heard so many great things about it over the years and like you I was extremely disappointed in the movie having just read the book. Kubrick is a fantastic director and some of the shots in the movie are incredible but overall the plot and character development that was in the book was butchered for the movie. Jack is supposed to be this flawed, yet overall good guy who slowly descends into insanity at the hands of the hotel. But in the movie he’s just outright loony from the beginning and seems to have no qualms about his new hatred for Wendy and Jack when in the book it is a really big struggle for him. Danny is in my eyes the most important character in the book as he is the one with the shining and the hotel is reacting the way it is because of him. He’s also very mature for his young age and you get to see and learn about his evolving thought process and all the hard decisions he has to make watching his beloved father go insane and become dangerous. In the movie Danny is kinda just this creepy little kid that does the weird finger thing and doesn’t really offer much else to the story. Finally, Wendy. In the book Wendy is a total badass. She doesn’t put up with Jacks shit as he gets crazier and is constantly battling with him making sure he knows that Danny is her number one priority and she will keep him safe no matter what. In the movie Wendy is just a big whiny cry baby who’s only purpose in the movie was to scream and cry. I really didn’t mean to rant this long but this post really struck a chord with me as I just read the book and watched the movie for the first time and was also very unimpressed with the movie when I thought it was gonna be great. My final complaint is a lot of the major plot points from the book (Dick sensing something was wrong and coming back from Florida to save Danny, Jacks intense regret for breaking Danny’s arm hindering his thoughts of harming him that the hotel was putting in his head, etc) seemed to happen in the movie with next to no explanation. Like I knew what was happening because I had just finished reading the book, but if I hadn’t I feel as if I would’ve been quite confused when a lot of that stuff just sort of happened. Anyways, rant over lol.",5225sheridan,2020-09-07T14:06:12Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,7
io5052_8,io5052,"I agree with Stephen King's criticisms, especially in regards to A. Jack Nicholson seeming insane from the first scene and B. Wendy's depiction/Kubrick's treatment of Shelly Duvall. That said, I think the Shining novel is pretty bad and disorganized relative to the books King was putting out at the time. If you look at Carrie or the Long Walk (which was published later but written before the Shining), you see SK telling a tightly-written, engaging story with evocative, subtly deployed themes. The Long Walk is an allegory for Vietnam that is both pointed and not obvious or even necessary to understanding the book. Carrie is a pretty brutal account of child abuse/bullying/conformity that uses its epistolary format to implicate the entire community for being complicit in the abuses Carrie suffers. SK wrote the Shining, which is around three times as long as these books, before he had a handle on how to tell a big, ambitious story, and the novel suffers from that. In the beginning we have obvious exposition/foreshadowing in the scene with Jack and the boiler guy, which goes on forever and basically spells out the entire ending of the book. We've got the ridiculous wasp scene where Jack is like, ""REALLY LIFE IS LIKE WASPS"" or whatever. Not very subtle or compelling. The whole novel feels really disorganized like this, with tons of great ideas peppered with some really weak writing and some structurally bizarre choices.

 I think that to call Kubrick's movie a ""bad adaptation"" because it doesn't literally adapt the action of the book is kind of dumb. Or at least a too literal understanding of what a good or bad adaptation is. As a filmmaker there's nothing saying you owe a direct fidelity to the source material; the version of the Shining that perfectly adheres to SK's vision already exists, and it's the novel. So I'm not really into nitpicking whether a movie captures this versus that, it's its own thing and should be judged on those merits. So I think a lot of the Shining book versus movie discussion is kind of pointless: who cares if Kubrick wasn't interested in the same things as King? To say the Shining film would be more interesting as a direct adaptation of the novel is totally disengenuous. If you want a direct adaptation, there's the Shining tv miniseries from the 90s, which closely adheres to the book (Stephen King wrote the screenplay) and is unwatchable. Just godawful.",911INISDEJOB,2020-09-07T21:42:33Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,8
io5052_9,io5052,"I felt the same after reading the book, but it isn't so much a matter of relative quality, it's that Kubrick took a deeply personal allegory about alcoholism and made it into a standard haunted house picture.  I do consider it a fairly overrated movie, though.

I listened to the audiobook of Doctor Sleep, it's about a grown up Danny Torrance, I think it was much more interesting than the Shining.",ChronoMonkeyX,2020-09-07T15:24:32Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,9
io5052_10,io5052,"There was a made for television adaptation of The Shining that was actually filmed at the hotel in Estes Park, The Stanley Hotel. that inspired King to write the book. I've stayed there. It's an extremely cool old hotel and I wouldn't doubt for a minute it's haunted.

Anyway, I thought the television adaptation was great but it  gets a lot of hate from movie fans of Kubrick's version. I guess those people never read the book and they're probably into that whole secret baking powder native American genocide imagery mania from the Room 237 documentary.... which I personally think is a ridiculous stretch and a bunch of horseshit. But whatever, to each his own.

I had read The Shining before I saw Kubrick's movie in the way back times and I thought the movie was pretty disappointing. The set was very cool, but the movie missed the mark for me. The movie came out when I was in high school, and,  no, it wasn't widely critically acclaimed when it came out. Many people thought it was a disappointment.

**The  movie reviews for the Shining when it was released were generally quite bad, that's a fact, and anyone who is telling you otherwise is just full of it. It was not a critical success when it came out.**

And hello, as you rightfully noted, the room in the book is 217 not 237 which is the thing I think that kicked off the whole baking powder nonsense. There was no real reason to change the room number except that the hotel they used for some of the exterior shots didn't want them use that number because they had a room 217 and thought people wouldn't want to stay there. It didn't have a room 237 so that's actually why the change. But of course, the hotel interior in Kubrick's version was a just a sound stage. Completely made-up.

217 was actually the room King stayed in at the Stanley Hotel and it's the room everyone wants when they check into the hotel obviously. The hotel has also got a hedge maze (no topiaries) but honestly you'd be a little disappointed in that because the hedges are waist high. I figure it's for safety reasons because the leading wall of the hedge maze is lined up to a pretty precipitous drop so if someone were to cut through the bushes not knowing that, they'd probably fall off the edge and die. But honestly being stuck in a maze of waist-high bushes ends up feeling more irritating than cool.

In the Cusak movie, at that hotel the room was 1408 (also the name of the movie) because, as King pointed out 1+4+8 = 13, obviously.

Oh, one more thing, the other movie that was filmed at the Stanley Hotel was Dumb and Dumber.",,2020-09-07T13:19:33Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,10

Well, you have me there. I think *The Shining* is a terrible adaptation, and a middling film.

Kubrick seems to me a masterful cinematographer (and photographer) who made a series of interesting films, peaked with *2001*, and then parlayed that into a career as a frustrated and largely incompetent writer - hampered by his remote and cold nature - and was pampered and indulged by Warners to an absurd degree, allowing him to be as uncaring and perfectionist as any human could be in making increasingly cold and heartless movies largely indistinguishable from product anyone else working at the time - given similar studio leeway - could have made as well or (possessing, presumably, a warmth and humanity Kubrick struggled with) even better, all of them middling adaptations of novels, until he made the masterpiece that is *Eyes Wide Shut*, which I think is probably his best achievement, and I can't imagine why most people hate it.",HugoNebula,2020-09-07T12:10:18Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,28

Reading the heartwrenching scenes of abuse make me feel that much more for the characters in the movie. I personally like the changes Kubrik made. 

My only - and to me minor - complaint is that Jack played Jack crazy all the way through. But it was effective as hell though. I have the same complaint re: the Exorcist, it gets too unambiguously supernatural too early on (would’ve been interesting to have the audience and Karras doubt a bit once he meets Regan, whether or not the possession is real). But it’s fucking startingly effective. For both films it’s only a complaint I’ve had after watching each many times and really letting them sink in and pondering their power and messages. 

There’s a reason they’re commonly the top two horror films on many lists, Exorcist edging out Shining in my opinion due to the sheer ferocity and startling visceralness of some of the images and the ever-so-slightly stronger sense that it could be a true story, unlike the Shining which is still a good old fashioned haunted house ghost story at its core, though terrifyingly believable, especially as mental illness and trauma are woven in and experienced vicariously by the audience.",HuttVader,2022-05-15T06:31:19Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,2

I just wish it wasnt tainted, knowing how Shelley Duvall was treated on set. She was a great actor and her performance in The Shining deserves a lot of credit, not just for how good it is, but also for the shit she had to put up with from Kubrick. I also always hear people saying the miniseries is better, its not. More faithful to the book, yes, but Kubrick's direction, editing, cinematography brought so much to the table, nobody made films quite like Kubrick did.

I really enjoyed how Doctor Sleep (the movie) tied both the original novel and the film together.

Its well worth a watch even if you disliked Kubrick's film. Hell, it might even change your mind about it.",,2022-12-16T05:00:49Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1
zn24oe_2,zn24oe,The Kubrick film is a GREAT movie -- but it's not Stephen King's The Shining.,Alternative_Effort,2022-12-16T07:16:35Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,2
zn24oe_3,zn24oe,"Stephen King was critical of Kubrick's interpretation of The Shining, as King's theme is that characters make their own decisions, rightly or wrongly, and that's what matters. Kubrick's film places forces outside the characters' control. In the novel, men are violent when they cannot abandon their entitlement, and it's a choice they consciously make. In Kubrick's movie, it is delusional destiny. King criticised this as his characters being reduced to ""like insects"", as they cannot shape their own fates. King claimed Kubrick ""thinks too much and feels too little"", though critics have reversed that onto King, claiming he ""feels too much and thinks too little"".

King later made a TV miniseries of his novel, also called The Shining. In it, the inhuman horror of The Overlook Hotel is much more greatly emphasised. It gives deceptive visions and focuses temptation on Jack Torrance's weaknesses, but ultimately the character of Torrance is the one who makes the decisions and, at the end, has his chance of redemption (another theme of King's). It was compared poorly to Kubrick's version, but runs much more like a horror story.",Hattix,2022-12-16T10:45:05Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,3

In Kubrick's defence he was upfront about not wanting to do a direct adaptation, and King was equally upfront about hating Kubrick's interpretation :P

zn24oe_8,zn24oe,"Stephen King hated the movie adapation of ""The Shining.""  I don't really know his reasons, but apparently he thought it strayed too far from the meaning of his book.

The movie (Kubrick's movie) is a conundrum that is both confounding and befuddling ( I mean when else am I gonna get to use those words together?).  The meaning of it all comes down to which character's point of view you identify with.

I think that was deliberate on Kubrick's part.  You know that scene where Wendy confronts Jack as he sits at the typewriter, close to the beginning of the film?  

When she talks to him, there's a table and chair behind him but when he answers her, there is no furniture behind him at all.  He's just torn the paper out of this typewriter and his hair is disheveled and he is angry at Wendy for interrupting him.

After she leaves the room, we see Jack at the typewriter, the paper still inserted in it, his hair is neatly combed, and the table and chair are behind him where they were before.

Is Wendy the one who's cracking up?  Is Jack being manipulated by the house somehow?  Is Danny really being possessed, did jack really molest him as the movie implies?

It's one of those point-of-view situations that can leave you more confused than anything else.  I can see why King thought it went a little too far astray from his vision.",tygerprints,2022-12-16T17:20:47Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,8

He doesn’t always follow through on that build and I think he really leaves a lot of it up to his readers. My favorite parts of the few King books I’ve read are when the main characters are scared because their own imaginations are running wild. They’re expecting a bloody dead corpse with cloudy eyes and rotten teeth reaching out for them, grabbing them, eating them. Their hair is standing on end and sweat is tickling their scalp and running down the back of their neck. Then they reach for the doorknob, turn it, open it wide and… sometimes nothing is there. But King just spent two pages making the reader feel what the character feels. THAT is what he’s good at. When I read King, I live in his stories. However, endings are not his strength and the books I’ve read tend to fall off towards the end. Regardless, I’ll probably keep picking up King books in the future.

In the miniseries which was written by Stephen King, King takes out one of my favorite images: Where the Overlook embodied in Jack spins the wheel of the boiler --- the hot metal sinking into the palms of his hands and setting them on fire --- and when the gauge goes down, it shuffles in a victory dance with its flaming hands waving above its head.

Instead King replaces that with a scene where Jack takes back control of himself one final time as he stands in front of the boiler and deliberately refuses to spin the wheel to release the pressure and so makes the decision to blow up the Overlook.",Dana07620,2022-10-26T06:17:19Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,4
ydcmxw_5,ydcmxw,"Also having recently finished reading The Shining, it very much is fantastic psychological horror. Absolutely loved the way Jack's lies that he had built up to protect himself slowly decayed as the hotel tightened it's grip on him. 

On a personal level, his struggle to maintain his sobriety really was relatable. So many times he struggles with the choice of doing what's right for his career versus his family and resists the urge to have a strong drink or two or ten to numb the pain by recalling the trauma of the problems his alcoholism caused in the past. Having worked in stressful environments, there have been plants of days where I would have loved to have just let the boiler blow up and end it all, but had to do what was required and then try to resist the urge to hit the bottle.

I also found Wendy's character really interesting, because you really get the sense of how much damage her mother caused her by how overly protective she is of Danny. On the one hand, she was totally in the right being cautious of Jack after what he did in the past, but any time something was off, it was automatically his fault.

In the end though, the most horrifying thing about the whole thing is the trauma of it all. I mean, Danny's just a kid and went through that whole ordeal. That's pretty messed up. Then trying to think of the mental and physical trauma Wendy suffered. And not to mention Dick Halloran as well. Yeah, sure the hotel was creepy,  but... oh man, that would be tough to recover from.

I loved the shining because of the mystery that it provoked: “was it really magic, or was it just cabin fever?” It made the book feel like it could exist in the real world, and slightly touched magic, but just enough to be enjoyable and to provoke questions. Doctor Sleep threw that all in the garbage, and just said “yeah it was all magic, here’s some vampires, that should satisfy the masses.” I wish he had never written the book, and I wish I’d never read it. It ruined the magic of the Shining by adding more than was needed. It felt sloppy and like King only wrote it to satisfy the masses, and it genuinely upset me.

It's been a long time since I looked into it, but in the Shining the room number references something specific about the Apollo mission. They did something for the specific number of minutes that the room number is assigned (or the first broadcast with the simulated Earth background that NASA admitted to appeared at that specific time in the mission. Can't remember which.) It's all in the book, and the theories people float about Kubrick's films, if true, put the man into the stratosphere as far as revelatory film making goes, which is pretty good considering how high he sets the bar in the first place on just the standard genius level. Real deep examination can put things like Tom Cruise's acceptance speech referencing Kubrick for his Oscar role in Eyes in perspective.

In a way, the film version of *The Shining* reminded me a little of the film *Picnic at Hanging Rock* by Peter Weir. *Picnic at Hanging Rock* is not an obvious horror film like *The Shining*, but both feature an edifice that seems to have a malign power or intelligence of its own, and it isn’t clear whether the edifice “corrupts” innocent people, or whether there is some innate malignity in those people who fall under the edifice’s spell.

fs6xjb_4,fs6xjb,"Firstly, I absolutely love your take on The Shining (both book and movie) and agree. Stephen King's writing of Jack's past and his slow descent into madness as the hotel's evil play on his weaknesses, was masterfully done. His moment of redemption as well was a necessary moment especially for Danny. This character devolution and redemption moment were things I think the movie sorely lacked. Wendy's character as well, was much stronger in the book than the movie.

IMO, definitely IT for the next read. Amazing book. For me it is always a toss up between The Shining and IT as my favourite SK books. You can also get the sequel to The Shining i.e. Doctor Sleep. Not as good, but a satisfying read with an adult Danny.

11/22/63 is also really good, as is Salem's Lot. For me, Cujo is just tragic and I never could reread it. Even now I get tears in my eyes when I think of the last lines in Cujo.

The best other SK recommendations IMO would include (amongst others): Duma Key, Bag of Bones, Misery, Needful Things and Different Seasons (the last being a collection of four novellas, all of them excellent).

You can try Dark Tower for a fantasy slant, though I never really got into it, and although The Stand is probably one of the most recommended, it is not a favourite of mine.

To be able to write an entire novel that essentially takes place in one room, and to make it interesting to the point of not wanting to put it down, in my mind, is an an act of sheer literary genius!

Kubrick's The Shining is a film I have watched at least a dozen times over the years. I finally got around to reading the novel and had to tell myself to totally forget the movie. Kubrick's film is another example of genius, I think. However, I have to say I loved Stephen King's novel as much as the film, for his talent at allowing us to see inside the characters, which of course is something you can never really do in a filmed version; I don't care how talented the film director may be, and let's face it Kubrick was about as talented as they come.

No one is debating King's book, it's very straightforward with very little subtly or depth. Moreover I'm sure most people don't even know about the 1997 version of the Shining King made.

fs6xjb_15,fs6xjb,"Right well I think that you may have missed a lot of the subtleties of Kubrick’s version. I’m not sure “flow” is the quality Kubrick desired and of course as a writer of pop thrillers, King's style is going to rely heavily on a sense of “flow” to keep you turning the pages. Kubrick was interested in crafting a world that expressed his artistic vision, and I’d say in this case that “flow” may have actually been antithetical to his vision in some sense. 

I wonder if when you watched Full Metal Jacket for example, if you really got the themes that Kubrick was exploring. Tbh I didn’t really get a lot of this stuff when I first watched his films, it was actually explained to me by one YouTube film critic in particular but he’s made most of his reviews private now sadly. Any way, Full Metal Jacket is apparently mainly an indictment of the mainstream media’s depiction of war. Similarly Kubrick’s take on The Shining has been said to be mainly a depiction of how our militarist-imperialist culture fosters a culture of toxic masculinity. So yeah I can see how to Reddit fanboys of Stephen King-style potboiler thrillers, tackling subjects such as imperialism and toxic masculinity might seem a bit icky.",viborg,2020-03-31T07:01:43Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,15

1qjgjw_6,1qjgjw,">But Dr. Sleep kinda bored me. 

I can see that, but I actually found Doctor Sleep to be more disturbing than The Shining was.  Partly because of issues like substance abuse, solitary people trying to form relationships, how to form relationships in a situation where they're not 'appropriate' (Danny has very real and understandable objections to getting involved with a young girl), and especially about how old people live (and die), once society is 'done' with them.  I think the fact that [Spoiler](/s ""the bathtub woman from room 217 is so easily overcome is a sign that 'horror' isn't what he's going for."") 

I don't really see it as a 'horror' novel- the villains are a bit silly (though the whole driving around in RVs is great), there is no real exterior conflict or tension, and it feels more to me like King really wanted to explore what happened to Danny, than that he had any real interest in scaring people.  I haven't read Joyland, but after reading Under the Dome, 11/22/63, and Doctor Sleep, it feels more like he's gravitating away from horror as the object, and more into exploring characters, which (at least to me) is always what he's done best.

You can read the sequel, *Doctor Sleep*, where Danny is grown up and still struggling with his demons. Not as good or scary as the first, but a very decent sequel (that SK wrote many years later).

Some of my SK favourites that I definitely recommend:

* IT
* Duma Key
* Pet Sematary
* Carrie
* Misery
* 11/22/63
* Bag of Bones
* Different Seasons (four novellas i.e. Shawshank Redemption, Apt Pupil, The Body, The Breathing Method - all 4 are excellent)",Lanfear_Eshonai,2021-02-22T06:15:39Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,2
lpfgtt_3,lpfgtt,"The Langoliers is a story in Four Past Midnight. Had a SciFi (pre-SyFy) TV movie that’s a pretty accurate adaptation. 

Pet Semetary has one of the bleakest endings of any book ever. Not sure either movie really captured it well. 

I like The Regulators. That’s one of the Bachman books. It’s companion novel Desperation has been made into a movie a couple times. But I prefer The Regulators and would love to see that as a movie. 

The Running Man. +10 for don’t let the book affect the movie in your mind. 

It. Holy crap. If you don’t know what happens in the end absolutely do not look it up. Both adaptations have their merits although It Chapter 2 was quite the mess. 

The Stand I think was considered King’s magnum opus pre-Dark Tower. The original mini series was okay. I hear the new one isn’t but I haven’t seen it yet. 

The Dark Tower series is a prime example of its a marathon and not a sprint. Although if you trucked through The Shining in two days I’m sure you’ll be fine. Don’t waste your time on the movie. 

Eyes of the Dragon aka King does fantasy. My first King book when I was 10. Has connective tissue to the Dark Tower universe but a good standalone story. 

Salem’s Lot. Movie and book. Huge fan!

Christine. Movie and book. Huge fan!

Carrie. Movie and book. Huge fan!

The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both depression-era prison stories that aren’t really horror but both have incredible movie adaptations (Shawshank arguably the best King adaptation ever). 

And lastly, if you ever wanted to know what doing cocaine in a heat wave would be like, go watch Maximum Overdrive.

I loved The Shining, the characters were interesting and well portrayed. Jack was likeable but flawed; reprehensible in some ways, sympathetic in others. His slow descent into madness was terrifyingly captivating.

King's portrayal of Danny is great as well, naive but also wise beyond his years as a result of his gift. He also nailed the feeling one gets as a child where a certain word or phrase uttered by a parent in passing, innocuously, becomes a memory that really sticks with you, and surfaces time and time again from your subconscious.

The length of the build up was one the best things about the book, in my opinion. You really get an opportunity to get to know the characters, as the tension continues to mount, making it that much more impactful when things really start to fall apart.

I really enjoyed the novel and getting to know the characters. One thing I have always enjoyed about Stephen King's writing is how idiomatic it is. I found it interesting how the story is told from several points of view and how each person's own personal way of speaking comes out through their interior dialogues.

One thing that took me by surprise was the final scene in the last chapter with Danny sitting on the dock talking with Mr Halloran. That scene was so incredibly touching and tender that I found myself tearing up from it. 

I'm presently reading **Doctor Sleep**, King's 2013 sequel where Danny is now an adult. I have to say it's kept me up on more than one night of reading. Don't want to give anything away other than to say if you enjoyed The Shining, I highly encourage you to read the sequel.  ",SalemMO65560,2017-06-24T00:23:40Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,4
6j3c09_5,6j3c09,"I really enjoyed The Shining, much more so than the movie. I made the mistake of reading it whilst on holiday in a hotel when I was about 13 so that did ramp up the suspense for me. Been a long time since ive read it but I dont really remember thinking it too long to get to the interesting stuff.

Not my favourite King novel, that would have to go to The Stand and then The Long Walk/Running Man. I always felt the ending to the movie really lacked compared to the ending of the book, as well as Jacks eventual descent into madness. Always thought the idea of the hotel trying to claim him as one of them, and that he may or may not be the bartender as very clever idea.",Wootster10,2017-06-23T19:29:25Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,5

For what it's worth, I am a big fan of the Stanley Kubrick movie as well. The book delves so much more into the history of the hotel, so many more ghosts appear than what is in the movie, the hotel itself is an entity, and there is a lot of background on Jack Torrence that would have been helpful to know in the movie as well.

The book and the movie are so different its almost hard to compare them. The movie hits some of King's scarier scenes but leaves out a lot of little scary and awesome details. If you ever saw the 90s remake of The Shining its more like that version but much better.

Calling him a piece of shit because he was an alcoholic with alcoholic tendencies is a misreading of the character. King criticized Kubrick's film adaption for this reason; the film establishes Jack as the antagonist in the first 10 minutes. Like I said before, Jack was depicted as a flawed alcoholic father and husband. This was done to mirror King's own personal struggles with alcoholism. Viewed in this light, Jack finding the strength to fight off the possession at the end to save Danny IS redemptive.

The institute takes place in same universe as Carrie and Firestarter, and likely The shining as well, since all the kids are using the Shine to do the Institutes dirty deeds.

Which makes me wonder if Revival is In the shining universe or the Dark Tower one.  Even though they're all connected in one way or another honestly.

Some stories like Black House and Talisman are likely in same universe as Fairy Tale it seems they have a world jumping story base where the other world is smaller than our own.  But if you're talking second worlds then might as well throw Roae Madder into that mix as well, since she enters a different world through a painting. 

Then you have the alien books like Dreamcatcher and Under the Dome, with also possibility of Revival being thrown in the mix as well. 

IT, NEEDFUL THINGS, AND THE OUTSIDER  are all similar creatures feeding off different things, just taking different forms.

I don't remember references to any other King novels in those books, although they do sort of hint at the same mental powers as in The Shining.

du2r65_1,du2r65,"King has said that Kubrick did not believe in the supernatural and did not understand King's concept of the hotel as a kind of storage battery for ""evil."" King also said that Kubrick never understood what King meant by ""evil"" as a sort of objective, external force absent human actions.  So Kubrick made the movie about alcoholism, isolation and insanity instead. I think Kubrick improved it and the movie is inarguably effective as a horror movie. It's probably one of the top ten horror movies ever made and one of the scariest. I kind of wish Kubrick had done more straight horror movies. I am old enough to have seen *The Shining* in its original theatrical run. I was probably 13 or 14. My parents took me. They were Stephen King fans from early on. I don't think I've ever been more scared in a movie theater. The naked old lady scene scared the living shit out of me. Imagine seeing the movie without knowing anything about it or what's going to happen. That's probably impossible now, but I didn't know that woman was going to turn into an old lady. The dude getting blown by a bear was extremely WTF to me, even though it wasn't all that scary exactly. The ""Here's Johnny"" line actually got a big laugh in my theater. It wasn't a cliche yet. It caught us by surprise.

I think the movie is better than the book in this case too. It happens. There are several other Stephen King books which I would like to see get better movie treatments than what they got, though, for example, *The Running Man*, which is  great, tense little thriller which is nothing like the cheesy, WWE style Arnold Schwarzeneggar spectacle the movie turned it into.

6d74p6_1,6d74p6,"I read this book while staying in old hotel in Italy that had been transformed into a rental house. I was there for a wedding so it was just me and a bunch of friends. I happened to bring The Shining to read and read it every night while we were there.

Over the week while I read the book I felt like I could really relate to Jack. I started getting withdrawn from the group and even started getting paranoid. I was scared to death of the building we were in, especially at night when I would have to walk down a dark hallway in an unoccupied part of the house. 

That was about two years ago. I still think about the book a lot and I've never come close to finding something that has a similar effect. I guess it was the perfect storm, being in an Overlook type place that was so unfamiliar and secluded. That book really fucked me up in a way I would love to experience again.

1axjwcg_2,1axjwcg,"1. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir 10/10 I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was super creative and it didn't have any parts where I felt like I was just chugging through. The ending was satisfying.


2. The Snakehead by Patrick Radden Keefe 6/10 The last third of the book really fell off for me. I liked it early on, reading about the gangs in Chinatown and the origin of the prominent figures. Towards the end though it really dragged on.


3. Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie 9/10 The only reason I can't give this a 10 is that I felt the writing was at times difficult for me to understand. I know it's hard to write what Leckie did in general but the hard scifi themes mixed with Breq's constantly shifting perspective was occasionally confusing. The story was phenomenal and the writing was very refreshing despite my nitpicking. Am having trouble with the sequel though, about half way through and it's hard for me to care about the conflict as much.


4. How to Know a Person by David Brookes 5/10 This was my first dip into a book like this and I liked it to a degree. Finishing it didn't make me feel like I just finished a great novel, but the psychology and statistics he discussed was very interesting. Some of the chapters were a tad boring.


5. The Shining by Stephen King 10/10 The book is excellent. The last third of it was 11/10, it was probably the best written suspense I have ever read. Really enjoyed it.

vtapzh_1,vtapzh,"I think your interpretation of the book is entirely valid. I'm hard pressed to see how anyone can read the end of *The Shining* and not know it's the hotel in charge of Jack—there are many instances when King makes it quite clear.

There are a few issues at play here: one is that many people conflate the book with Kubrick's film, where Jack is unhinged and stereotyped from the first scene; secondly, there are a swathe of readers who aren't experienced enough, or even inclined, to recognise subtext in a 'trashy horror novel', so they don't, or won't, see it. You seem to be more empathetic than your friends in this regard, and maybe shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

Jack's background in the novel is of classic abused-turned-abuser. None of that takes away that he is, and has been, a decent husband and father, if flawed. It's just that at the point at which he's most vulnerable, he rocks up at the Overlook Hotel, and it gets its claws into him. This is clearly King's view too, as he quite deliberately gives Jack a scene of redemption at the end when he >!comes to his senses for a moment and lets Danny escape!<.",HugoNebula,2022-07-07T10:03:53Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1

The best ones focus on character, not the threat/monster. That's where a lot of the live-action versions of his stories fall down. King makes you care about the cast so that *any* threat, no matter how far-fetched, is scary.

I'll probably be in the minority on this, but I'd also recommend hunting down the TV mini-series of The Shining. The cast isn't as good, of course, but it's competent. The FX are dated (CGI was still being polished), but the longer format gives you more of a sense of the story unfolding, more background, etc. It also features an injury with a polo mallet that's one of the more effective cringe-inducing blows I've seen as it falls into the ""less is more"" category. The blow is to the midsection, there's no blood, but the staging conveys the punch and the actors carry off the delivery of severe internal injuries quite well.

I haven't read many horror books lately. Mostly because I am bored of the genre, but I did read 'The Loveliest Dead' by Ray Garton- and that was scary. The thought of living in a house where murder took place, and especially that kind of murder was horrifying. I don't think it's like 'The Shining' or 'Hell House'... but still had very spooky moments.",TiffWaffles,2021-05-06T19:29:28Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,4

eoww08_1,eoww08,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I think Doctor Sleep is one of King’s best books.

It’s not supposed to be like The Shining. It’s the product of DECADES of King mulling over the question of: what happens to Danny when he grows up? He develops that nice little contained horror novel into a world where those horrors exist outside of the mental breakdown of an alcoholic father and a kid with vaguely alluded to supernatural abilities. What’s wrong with developing that into something a bit different?

If your thing is early King, with contained psychological plots like Misery and The Shining, then maybe it’s just not for you. But I personally love both books, while recognizing that they are not the same genre. One is psychological horror, the other is more supernatural adventure. And it’s fun! I liked the characters, I like their relationships, it was cheesy but i wanted them to win and that’s always a good feeling.",avanopoly,2020-01-15T04:32:11Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1

The smart thing he did was to find a very smart balance between things leftover from the Shining and new things. The ""old"" Shining things, apart from the shining capability, are kept to the minimum: the first chapter of Doctor Sleep is, by all means, a new chapter of The Shining: same characters, same bad guys, same setting.

Two things to answer your question:

* Scare-for-scare, there is more content in Doctor Sleep. Fans of the original book or the movie may think there's more in The Shining, but there's not. King brings out the first ""ghost"" in Doctor Sleep within five pages. He doesn't bring out the first ""ghost"" in The Shining until about page one-fifty.

* There are a lot of reference in Doctor Sleep that draw from the original book. You'll be fine if you skip directly to Doctor Sleep, but you may appreciate it more if you read The Shining first. Many of the famous movie scenes never show up in the book (the twins, the ax, the bloody elevator). 

And one final point: the King of today is much improved from the King of thirty years ago. I'm like you, I just started down the path of King and going back to his early material has been a hard trip to travel. His writing has vastly improved over the years. He may not be as intoxicating as his drunken writing days, but I'll take that trade-off for a cleaner writing style.

He's a weak, recovering alcoholic, and the evil spirits in the hotel take advantage of this and more or less take him over. He's not evil to start out.

To illustrate, there are some great books which could not be turned into great films or shows which are the ""same"" as the book: As I Lay Dying, Moby Dick, and The Brothers Karamozov present particular dilemmas to the filmwriter. 

In the same vein, there are many great films which would be difficult to rewrite as books. Great action/psychological films and  like Mad Max: Fury Road, 2001 A Space Odessy, and Blue Velvet would be almost impossible, with how they use visual movement and music/noise to affect the audience.

Also, there have been many great books which have become great shows/films. Look at the LOTR trilogy, Blade Runner, and The Shining. The filmmakers took artistic liberties, but the reason the films were good is because the effects they were attempting to make on the reader were similar to the effects elicited by the original novels, characters, settings, worlds, etc.

TLDR, oftentimes when filmwriters attempt to change a text to make it more ""cinematic"", they end up changing something fundamental to the works, resulting in completely different stories, characters, themes, etc, which makes the film succeed or fail on its own merit. See Gawain and the Green Knight, vs Mary Poppins. One fails in its undertaking because of its differences, the other succeeds for the same.",MeatballsAndMartinis,2022-08-24T02:34:30Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1
wvy7sv_2,wvy7sv,"Comparing books to their other representations or reimagining in other media to me is kind of like comparing apples to oranges.  They aren't the same thing and as such, they cannot be judged on the same criteria.  The subject matter may be identical but the media in which it is being presented is wholly unique unto itself and warrants a completely different approach to presenting the material than is required in black and white text with (occasional) 2D illustrations.  We should not be judging film or tv book adaptations based upon how perfectly they are able to mimic the writing, but rather by how the acting was done, how the characters were presented, whether or not we enjoyed the audio, the background of the world, the music, the cinematography, and the story-telling.  Some film and tv adaptations of literature is just not that good, but others are amazing!  (Like you said with The Shining, The Princess Bride, and Jurassic Park)  An example of this is that my favorite book of all time is the Odyssey.  It has been written and rewritten dozens if not hundreds of times and reimagined in film and tv also dozens if not hundreds of times.  Some of the book adaptations are hot garbage and so are the films, but some of the book rewrites are deep and emotional and engaging as are some of their film and tv counterparts.

wvy7sv_3,wvy7sv,"One problem about ""which is better"" is that too often we're talking about which we enjoyed more, or which was more entertaining.
No one can deny that the movie The Shining was extremely entertaining to the point that most of us can instantly identify even the teeniest portion of a scene as having come from that movie. But we have to admit that the movie was so entertaining because it was more sensationalistic. It that sense, it really delivered. But the movie dropped any bit of nuance relating to Jack & his inner demons, all of which was explored in the book. That brings us back full circle to which was better -- a movie that dazzled with good actors and effective scare effects, or a book which also delivered in the scare department, but spent a lot of time with back story & psychological detail on the main character.",BixaorellanaIsDot,2022-08-24T02:25:19Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,3

So I think he didn't intend it at the time he wrote *The Shining*, especially because I remember there being part of the book about how Wendy thought he was cheating on her, but finally realized it was all in her head and he was really just out getting drunk all the time.

5h1hik_4,5h1hik,"As a ""constant reader"" of King who is otherwise completely unqualified to assess the quality of literary works, I believe there are basically 3 eras of King literature. 

The Early Years (early and mid seventies) where King was a hungry young author trying to catch a break. This era is best represented by *The Shining*. His stories in this period were new, shocking, and visceral, but perhaps a bit unpolished. 

The Cocaine Years (late seventies to late eighties) where King was a serious alcoholic and drug addict at the height of his powers. Everything he wrote in this era is absolute dynamite IMHO, but if I had to pick one to be the defining work of this period, it would be *The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger* 

The Serious Years (early nineties to present) where King becomes conscious of his role in literature and begins to produce more sophisticated, cerebral, and subtle works. And while no less dark and horrifying, something is missing when I compare it to his work in the 80's. I can't put my finger on it, but I know it is there. None of his work in this period is bad, but nothing in this era has left me breathless like *The Stand* or *It*.

*The Stand* was what I would consider his first book from the cocaine years. He still had all the passion of the hungry young artist, but had really hit his stride. It was a story told many times, but he told it best. I read it 20 years ago, and I can still name virtually every character and recount the plot.

You are correct, in that it differs quite a bit from the book, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing; King tells his stories from a perspective really tied to a character and the way they think, their mood, and what is going through their heads, all of which can be REALLY difficult to portray in film, where it can be difficult to convey a narrative of the characters thoughts.

I think Kubrick knew this, and instead of trying to (potentially poorly) portray the book exactly as it was, he left out some of elements that are more suited for literature (much of the actual ""shining"" Danny has, a lot of the internal struggle Jack has etc.) and instead used techniques that build the same feel and atmosphere of the book through film; things like long slow shots, use of steady cam, and interesting angles (all things that don't apply to literature).

Personally, I *love* King, and the way he writes, but sometimes some of his best written material makes for REALLY poor movies (the ending of the It miniseries comes to mind).",NickGe,2012-04-19T14:17:45Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1

2tn7gv_1,2tn7gv,"In order to get the big picture, watch the documentary about The Shining, Room 237.  Kubrick only used the novel as a vehicle for his own artistic themes, as he did with all his movies. He bought the rights to all the books and then proceeded to gut them and maintain plot points only as a way of threading his own narrative.  If you watch The Shining with this in mind, you start to not only see differences, but you start to realize it's not even a horror story in the traditional sense.  It is a story about the past.  Not just any past.  The Past.  How the past impinges on the present.  How it is only those that ""shine""  who can navigate their way through history's labyrinth and release themselves from The Overlook.  There are many, many themes interwoven into the story:  native American genocide (those Calumet cans, Jack throwing the tennis ball ritualistically against the wall mimicking the call of Native spirits), the holocaust (that Nazi typewriter, black and white outdoor scenes with snow falling like ashes from the Nazi crematoriums), the moon landing question (room 237, have to watch the movie for this one), the manager's office where Jack is interviewed for the job showered with sunlight in a room completely enclosed by the hotel, the tv Wendy and Danny are watching doesn't have a power cord, dozens of things that are ""off"" when everyone knows Kubrick was an absolute perfectionist who never made accidental continuity errors. There are literally thousands of things you will notice.  And that is the point, he is creating art conveyed through countless subliminal devices.  Read Mastermind's critique of the movie on the net for the best source of interpretations.  It is exacting and exhausting.   One more thing:  Stephen King did hate the movie because it was his brainchild and he totally missed what Kubrick was doing.  He was essentially banned from any participation after he initially was consulted and objected vociferously to Kubrick having the audacity to change the VW going up the mountain (that's the Going to the Sun road in Montana) from red to yellow.  Kubrick delivered a not so subtle message to King later in the movie.  Remember when the cook is returning to the hotel in that snow blizzard and he passes an accident?  A semi has completely smashed a vehicle.  Guess what it is?  A red VW. That was Kubrick letting King directly know what he thought of his novel.

I felt nostalgia for the first novel and remember it being the superior of the two, but I enjoyed seeing what Danny was up to and (despite it being a bit goofy in parts) I liked the traveling group as the baddies (I can't recall their name at the second).

I should also mention that I listened to the audiobook, which was narrated by the amazing Will Patton. He does an excellent job with the Mr. Mercedes series also.

Maybe put it aside for now, and read it down the road? If you don't enjoy it, there's nothing forcing you to finish it. ",treblah3,2017-12-24T06:20:51Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,1

As a sequel, it comes very late and perhaps unnecessarily; while I enjoyed that he returned to the character of Danny (and didn't sugarcoat how his life had turned out) everything else seemed very uninspired and by-the-numbers.

But there are exceptions.  If you want to give him a try again, I’d say read something like Blaze (I believe he wrote that one as Richard Bachman). I’d also advise to read the sequel to The Shining, yet turn around and read his son’s book: NOS4A2.  I’d also give the detective trilogy a try.  Not a bad series.

26qqbz_2,26qqbz,"Just my opinion, but as far as I understand, both the novel and the film of 2001 were created and released at the same time, and designed to be enjoyed at the same time. So I think it doesn't really matter which order you consume those in, so long as they're both done reasonably close to each other. The book and the film are a package-deal, and they both offer different things to the same story. The book is a little more detailed, but the film has undeniably impressive visuals. I'd see the film first, then read the book immediately after.

However with The Shining, I'd personally recommend reading the book first. Even though the adaptation is okay, (like nearly all film adaptations) it's nowhere near as good as the book. It's not as chilling, as gripping, or as detailed. I also recommend reading the book first for a personal reason - the novel of The Shining contains the one and only scene in a book that scared the hell out of me so much that it made me go turn the lights on. I value the book immensely for being the only book I've ever read to invoke such a reaction in me. It was flawlessly written. I won't tell you what it is, but said scene is absent from the film. I kind of hope that when you read it you'll find the same scene and have the same reaction, and you'll get to realise what a fantastic horror the novel of The Shining is before your perception is ruined by the (in my opinion) inferior film version.

Bad idea, every noise creeped me out, be it squirrel or just nature doing it's thing. I was there in the summer so the sun never really set, and you'd think that would be a good thing.

16ygwf3_2,16ygwf3,"Yes, more technical people ended up in Las Vegas.  I think that was a part of the commentary on complexity of good and evil.  I think we were supposed to get the idea that Flagg was using technology to attract certain people.  Las Vegas was up and running quicker than Boulder.  I doubt all those were ""bad"" people, they just were attracted to the order and amenities offered by Flagg.

Flagg didn't want the Kid, because he offered nothing and the Trashcan Man was the important one.  So wolves got him.  Flagg didn't want Harold, because he had already gotten what he needed from him and Nadine was the important one.

Nick chose Tom when he left Julie in the town, he didn't like when she convinced Tom not to take the medicine, it was a part of him realizing her immaturity.  

I'm sure there are more examples of abusive, mean main characters that King wrote, but one I can think of is Jack Torrance from ""The Shining"".   There may be moments were I could sympathize with him, and it's obvious that the Hotel has an affect on his behavior, he does some horrible things.

I don't like that you're taking such a beating with the downvotes, I applaud you for trying to make sense of things like this.  Even though Harold is one of my least favorite characters, I think King does a good job of showing you the moments where he could have turned away from Flagg, and could have grown as a character.

on the flip side of the coin, the free zone had its share of malcontents and troublemakers. so it's not clear to me what determined which dream one got, vegas or boulder.

""I'm sure there are more examples of abusive, mean main characters that King wrote, but one I can think of is Jack Torrance from ""The Shining"".""

larry ranting and physically assaulting rita over an innocent mistake over shoes reminds me of scenes from the movie where jack is terrorizing/abusing the shelley duvall character. i didn't mention it though because i didn't actually read that book (too scary) so I didn't think it would be fair. 

and so here's the thing i'm having a mental block with if you will. in the shining, jack was no hero. he was a terrifying monster. a monster with a sad backstory, but as far as his wife and the viewer was concerned, a monster no less. 

and yet in the stand, larry has his crazy/abusive moment with rita, and then does a complete 180 to be the savior hero. It is hard to swallow. 

for the record, i actually went back to review the shoe episode because all the push back got me wondering if i had somehow misremembered or exaggerated larry's behavior. and it turned out to be actually worse than i thought because he not only cursed her out, he also physically assaulted her. 

i'm okay with down votes. i think there's a fundamental disagreement between myself and this sub over the severity of how larry treated rita, and the role he played in her death. rita died a miserable disrespectful death largely because of larry, and imo, she would have been better off without him.",quantcompandthings,2023-10-04T20:42:54Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,3

I know that at the time the miniseries broke records and was well received, but my point is, where is it now? The book is getting a new adaptation and hopefully that gets good buzz, but I don't think the original miniseries can really be dubbed as culturally lasting.   


You're also right that finding numbers are tricky, but I would guess that ""Pet Semetary"" and ""It"" are close. I could be wrong, but those are my guesses. I think it's possible those two books (and ""The Shining"") have also sold more copies but necessarily been read- owing largely to movie fans buying the books and then not always reading them. Those are kind of the metrics I was measuring against, as you said, since I hoped they would seem a bit more universal than just my observations.

joxygl_5,joxygl,"Hey, awesome, I'm glad you're liking it!  


""The Shining"" is good, ""Christine,"" ""Green Mile,"" ""Revival,"" ""Joyland,"" ""Gerald's Game,"" Dolores Claiborne,"" and ""Eyes of the Dragon"" are all good. I know that was a lot but just read a synopsis about each and pick one that sounds most interesting. They're all a lot different and show off the different good (and sometimes not as good) parts of King's writings.",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T18:08:15Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,5
joxygl_6,joxygl,"I’m sorry people got mad at you for your choice of words. I’ve been a king fan for years, and only read what I though were his most popular books (misery, pet semetary, it, the shining, etc). I’ve got Cujo and Salem’s lot on standby. I’d never heard of the stand. I’m in my late 20s so I missed the whole miniseries hype. It’s underrated at least in my generation. I just finished reading it a few minutes ago and came on to reddit to look for discussion about it. It’s a very relevant book with some really strong characters and there’s a whole chapter early on where king describes the virus transferring person to person, which tbh should be required reading right now. 
I don’t know where I’m going with this, but overall I’m just sorry about all the downvotes you seem to have gotten just for wanting to chat to like minded people about a book.",SlugKing003,2020-11-17T20:35:09Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,6
joxygl_7,joxygl,"Because people like you think hegemony is synonymous with ""hive mind"".

People know about the shining because Kubrick is one of the best auteurs to come out of the United States and Stephen King wrote pulp.",,2020-11-06T06:06:38Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,7
joxygl_8,joxygl,"Dude, i have never read a single Stephen King novel. And still i know of three books (and what happens in them)- The Shining, The Stand and It.

This book is not ""underrated"" AT ALL, as everyone is trying to tell you.",sekhmet0108,2020-11-06T17:20:43Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,8
joxygl_9,joxygl,"This. I've read The Stand. I'm not sure where it falls in my favorite books, I might reread it now, might not. King is extremely famous in the US too. I think you be hard pressed to find a bookstore that doesn't place a new release of his on a table in the front of the building. There is almost no reason to recommend it (unless you really want to read it in the midst of a pandemic). It's also a big book. I don't want to recommend such a large book to a friend most times.

That said, I'm not a horror fan. At all. I've watched the Shining. I think I've watched a few of his other movies, but never went searching. It's just not my cup of tea. I think there are plenty of people like me that have searched his name though, and The Stand is going to be near the top of the list 90% of the time. I enjoyed 11/23/63 and Under the Dome quite a lot, though my favorite book of his is The Gunslinger. I'm a sci fi and fantasy reader. 

A lot of the books I've read also seem to fall flat. I think OP wants book clubs, college professors, high school teachers to use King. The Stand is almost too long of a book to dissect and the other books I've read....well....they just end. His writing may be fantastic, but sometimes the full story leaves something to be desided. The Gunslinger is one of my favorite books, but I wish I hadn't touched the rest of the series. 

King is a fantastic author, but I don't think his books are great for literary analysis, atleast not in their full form.",,2020-11-06T06:16:55Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,9
joxygl_10,joxygl,"No, hegemony never even crossed my mind when writing this. I don't mean ""hive mind"" in a necessarily negative sense, either. Probably the wrong word to have used.   


I agree Kubrick added to the success of ""The Shining."" Disagree on King's novel being pulp.",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T22:02:02Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,10
joxygl_11,joxygl,"All right, I can buy all that. I especially agree with your point about it being detrimental if King is the ONLY thing people read, as in the McDonald's analogy. With that said, I'll also out myself and confess that King is probably my favorite author. However, that doesn't mean I don't know when he's writing hot garbage, which is a lot of the time. I will also say that I've read a LOT of non King books, so I do have a bit of reference.

 I appreciate you giving him credit, whereas a lot of people don't. And, honestly, if you wanted to have a long talk about King's literary shortcuts and failings, I'm totally game. In the Stephen King sub I'm in, criticizing him at all is met with either no feedback or people who disagree- it's hard to really dig in and get to why he fails. Your view on him is one of the more unique/interesting I've come across, as most who dislike him disparage him relentlessly. 

Do you think any of his other books like ""Gerald's Game"" or ""The Shining"" hold merit, or ""The Green Mile"" or ""Shawshank?"" Those last two in particular are a lot different than his usual fodder and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on them.",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T19:56:25Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,11
joxygl_12,joxygl,"Again, I agree that it's widely beloved among its readers. Everything you said supports my point without providing a real answer, though. I'm not trying to be argumentative or obstinate, but everything you said indicates that his following likes the book, not that the general public is aware of it or that it's critically regarded as generally good or a masterpiece. I think it has that standing in some respects but not universally. Again, comparing it to ""The Shining"" or something it isn't widely recognized, even considering the miniseries and its comic adaptations. 

If you disagree that's totally ok and I wouldn't say you're wrong, I think we're just measuring its ""success"" in different ways.",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T19:25:45Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,12
joxygl_13,joxygl,">My point is that I don't think ""The Stand"" is one of King's ""most well known books"" to the general public. Others have pointed out King's readership IS the general public, and I sort of agree, but that's mostly irrelevant here and kind of a different topic. It seems like we're discussing different groups of who this book is well known to. It will usually be listed in top ten best SK lists and such, sure, but the book (specifically, the characters/figures in it) are not cultural icons. There is no collective memory surrounding this book for the general public or movie going audience or most casual readers, though a few people have disagreed with me and pointed to completely valid counter examples.

What exactly are you basing this on? The book has more than 600k ratings on Goodreads, which is an obscene amount - and is actually the second most rated King book on that website after The Shining. Goodreads is pretty representative of the general public.

The 80s miniseries was also extremely popular, and there's another miniseries coming out soon. It came in at #53 on BBC's The Big Read poll, which counted almost a million votes from general readers in the UK to see the nation's most loved books. It actually came in *above* other King novels like It and The Green Mile.

You can make a case that It and The Shining are slightly more popular - they did have very well-known movies - but calling The Stand underrated, having no collective memory of it etc. is false.",fabrar,2020-11-06T22:03:36Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,13
joxygl_14,joxygl,"Sure, I can see how that would factor in on a few levels. Usually if the general public reads something, they'll try something like King. I mentioned that in a comment somewhere, owing it mostly to his adaptations and movie tie in re releases. But within that group I would still posit that books those people are reading are things like ""It"" or ""The Shining,"" which are more well known (at least, obviously, that I view as well known) compared to ""The Stand,"" which, my original point being, has not broken through on quite the same level, despite being popular among his fans and horror fans and avid readers. If that makes sense. Sorry if it seems like I'm rambling/repeating myself or wasting your time",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T21:08:19Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Shining,14
