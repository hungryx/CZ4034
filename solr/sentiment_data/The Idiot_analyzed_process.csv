I loved this book, even though it was a slow start and I had to search up if I was missing something because it seemed plotless. I've been where she has, pining after some guy who's lukewarm about you, while trying to get an education, not sure if you're doing that right either, and knowing you can do better at both but also just trying to live in this world.

185112g_1,185112g,"from wiki:

French and English translations were published in 1887, and a German translation in 1889. European critical response was also largely negative, mainly due to the novel's apparent formlessness and rambling style.[^(\[70\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTETerras199014-70) Morson notes that critics saw it as ""a complete mess, as if it were written extemporaneously, with no overall structure in mind—as, in fact, it was.""[^(\[71\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorson20187-71) Typical of the western critics was the introduction to the first French translation which, while praising the energetic style and characterization, notes that ""they are enveloped in a fantastic mist and get lost in innumerable digressions.""

Prominent modern critics acknowledge the novel's apparent structural deficiencies, but also point out that the author was aware of them himself, and that they were perhaps a natural consequence of the experimental approach toward the central idea. Joseph Frank has called *The Idiot* ""perhaps the most original of Dostoevsky's great novels, and certainly the most artistically uneven of them all,""[^(\[73\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-73) but he also wondered how it was that the novel ""triumphed so effortlessly over the inconsistencies and awkwardnesses of its structure."" Gary Saul Morson observes that ""*The Idiot* brings to mind the old saw about how, according to the laws of physics, bumblebees should be unable to fly, but bumblebees, not knowing physics, go on flying anyway.""[^(\[71\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorson20187-71)",Unusual_Bee_7561,2023-11-27T14:43:04Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1

115wveo_7,115wveo,"I finished it and just sat in silence for at least 10 minutes mulling it over. I felt like compared to Crime and Punishment and Notes From The Underground (the two other Dostoevsky books I've read- same as you), The Idiot had a much lighter tone. It was pure and light, reminding me of summer days. The ending could not have been further from that, and that made it hit so much harder.

It's also interesting to look at the foreshadowing. Throughout the whole book, Nastasya is saying that Rogozhin will kill her, and I'm pretty sure both the Prince and Rogozhin agree that this is possible. Then there's the scene in Rogozhin's house where the Prince keeps picking up Rogozhin's knife.

ywxgvd_1,ywxgvd,"I'm not trying to be disrespectful when I say that I think that your dissatisfaction with the book may stem from the fact that you are only engaging with Dostoevsky's writing at a surface level. To be more precise, it seems to me that you put too much emphasis on the plot and not enough on the philosophical arguments that Dostoevsky makes throughout *The Idiot*.

*The Idiot*, among other things, looks at the state of human nature. Is it possible for man to be truly good? Is human nature inherently good (as Rousseau claimed) or is it inherently corrupt and evil (as Augustine believed)? And what implications does this have on the way we live our lives? 

The entire book talks about complex philosophical issues such as the ones mentioned above. Its length can largely be attributed to the extensive dialogue that characterises Dostoevsky's work, and which is necessary for the dialectical approach to learning that Dostoevsky adopts throughout his works.

As for the Russian names, it's true that they can be confusing at first but it does get better with experience.",TheXrasengan,2022-11-16T22:45:10Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1

15dszwi_1,15dszwi,"Yeah I think there’s a lot about the Idiot which is interesting. I believe Dostoevsky remarked at one point that he was dissatisfied with the result and would have changed some things about the novel if he could write it again. This may play into some of your qualms with the book. 

I think that, and I’ve said this before on Reddit, but I think that Dostoevsky’s novels follow almost a linear philosophical train that enhances the readings as you take in more of his work. There are overlapping themes and taking in each novel grants one a dose of some perspectives on some of the bigger ideas. 

Many of his books are filled with explosive characters that are both verbose and impulsive. I do not know if he saw much of the populace in that way or if it was to amplify a message he intended.",arcangel092,2023-07-30T19:32:00Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1
15dszwi_2,15dszwi,"Brothers Karamazov is amazing … I’ve read it 3x and I like it much better than The Idiot, which is fine, but not something I’ll re-read. I agree with you about some of the exaggerated elements of The Idiot.  I didn’t find the Prince to be that believable of a character and as the novel progressed I liked him less and less. A lot of people say he is “Christlike” but I completely disagree … he is literally just a naive idiot with no social skills.  A character like that is really interesting conceptually, but in execution it gets really frustrating to read bc he never learns anything and leaves a lot of damage in his wake. 

If you like Crime & Punishment you should like BK.  It is not about high society more maybe upper middle class.  The characters are among of the most memorable ever written … and believable.",GuyMcGarnicle,2023-07-30T19:46:58Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2
18eo4n9_1,18eo4n9,"NFU doesn't make sense unless if you have read nearly his whole bibliography. It makes sense if you have BK and The Idiot mostly fleshed out, mainly the shift from religious morality to socialist atheist human determinism. 

Of all of his works, The Idiot is probably the most incoherent. But I still love it for its theme: a pure heart is mistaken as a naive fool, and he does not survive the modern world. This also has the underlying theme of the shift from religion and purity towards corruption, lies, usurpery, chaos in the new world. 

BK is arguably his ultimate. It's a bit to get through, but entirely worth it if the themes above seem interesting to you. D does not create false constructions or strawmen, he pits two opposing thoughts against each other during what was a very large shift in culture that plays out over a century, and gives them both their due.

I’ve always asked myself what would happen to someone in the modern world if they tried to live up to Jesus’ standard and I think Dostoevsky delivered that answer perfectly in The Idiot with Prince Myshkin.

I think that the Brothers Karamazov,  The Idiot and the Possessed were very demanding and I couldn't bounce off different books because it was too hard to switch gears, so to speak. IMHO it is so worth it and a fantastic book, albeit with a delayed payoff. If you aren't  vibing, I would never suggest to push through.

Luckily I lived in Seattle at the time and I had access to the best public library, all the classics I wanted to read were in audio format. I listened to crime and punishment after slogging through it and it was actually enjoyable. The reader pronounced the character's names each time identically so I could keep them straight and focus on the details. I then listen to The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov and The Gambler with much enjoyment. I've now live in a country where the library system is different and not many English language books and fewer English audio books.

v41t86_1,v41t86,"Dostoevsky struggled with the fact the he lived in a supposedly Christian society while the values, ambitions and motivations of so many 'virtuous' people stood in stark contrast to their professed faith. Now perhaps you aren't religious yourself or weren't raised that way, then I can understand where these struggles of faith might not ring out from the surface of the novel where the prince represents a truly Christ like figure set against the nineteenth century Russian aristocracy. However, looking beyond that, there's a theme throughout where everyone, including the prince seem to say one thing but do another. In fact, the prince indicates that the only people a person can be truly authentic with are children. However, unlike his counterparts, the prince is only inauthentic because of altruism. He would spare another's feelings for instance. Like how he would marry Natasha (I can't quite remember her name) in order to restore her honor, which is only necessary due to the hypocritical and judgemental attitudes of the society's elites. He would do what he could to spare her that suffering. She herself sees this because they aren't that different and consequently chooses to go with Rogozin which is basically the choice of self annihilation. In the end, the inability to spare her ruins Mushkin. This is all good stuff just at the narrative level.

Going beyond that, I first picked this book up because I had been on a big Nietzsche kick and read the he had once said that, in reference to The Idiot, Dostoevsky was the only psychologist that he felt he had anything to learn from. He himself thought in terms of levels of power. For instance, one level is punching someone. A higher level, in his view, is person who causes someone to lose control and hit them. That person has made one cede his own autonomy. In the Idiot, you can see throughout the novel this game of social Jenga. Everyone is trying to one up another and Dostoevsky goes through and gives many many different examples in how that plays out. Like hippolite's suicide attempt comes to mind where he was never in any danger but one character, I can't remember who says that they can't tell him that. The reason being that he would realize that his attempt wasn't being taken seriously. In that, he would then actually kill himself.

First I agree with you about his wonderful qualities. I always thought that Forrest Gump- like characters in modern art relied on Dostoevsky‘s idiot. Like you said, honest, true, kind, with a relentless integrity and will. Which gives him stunning charm and magic. 
However, there is definitely something wrong there. He doesn’t belong. His “qualities “ are so extreme/pure that they can hinder normal relations and activities. A person needs intellectual resilience and emotional diversity to lead a healthy life. The prince doesn’t. I can’t think of a better way to describe him in one word, than “the idiot”.

s3p7fu_1,s3p7fu,"While the Idiot is often touted as Dostoyevsky's least profound major work, it can sometimes be argued as one of his most intimate and cherished pieces due to the nature of topics and ultimate resolutions that Myshkin faces towards the end of the book. 

I'm 100% in agreement with you OP, I'm not arguing! Just trying to add some thoughts!

I feel like after reading TBK, Demons, Notes and C&P this book is certainly a little more dry than the others but I oftentimes wonder if it's because of my perception of all of his other pieces that make me feel that way. Dostoysvky was another pay-for-pages author so he definitely had his fair share of writing to meet a deadline type work but I wonder if this made his writing have more panic or paranoia intertwined because he knew how much he needed to finish the section before a certain time..?

l93zf3_2,l93zf3,">While the book was interesting in parts (specifically Parts 1 and 4 for me). I felt it just dragged on

Actually there is an explanation to why Part 1, the beginning of Part 2 and the end of Part 4 do feel different to the rest of the book. Dostoevsky started to write The Idiot in Geneva, just after marrying his wife, who was about to give a birth to the first Dosto's child. Being on the edge of poverty and putting all his stakes on the success of the new novel he decided to write about the dearest thing, which he had never even dare to try before, - the Christ-like character (in the drafts prince Myshkin was prince Christ). Moreover, The Idiot is the only novel which contains autobiographical moments which Dosto had never dared to write about, neither before, nor after - specifically, his ""last"" moments in front of the shooting squad. So, as you see, Dosto was literally pouring his heart, his soul into this novel.

Around the time of finishing the Part 1 his daughter was born, Sonya. But then, in 3 months she died (exactly by the time he finished first chapters of Part 2). There are little words which can describe how this event crashed Dosto, after that he wasn't able to write for about 6 months, had to move to another city, and then eventually to another country (Italy). 

I think now you see the connections. About the end of the book - I think Dosto envisioned it from the very beginning, so is wasn't that much influenced by the events of his life. Or, maybe it was influenced, I don't know. But what is for sure, already in the first chapters of Part 1 and Part 2 Myshkin had predictied the outcome of Rogozhin and Nastasya relations.

> Overall, it didn't seem to pack the same punch as Notes from the  Underground or C&P. It didn't really explore the human psyche as  well as it's predecessors also, in my opinion.

It does, the only problem that comprehending Myshkin is way much more difficult then Raskolnikov, or the Underground man, which is basically the core of the tragedy of this novel, unfortunately. 

>I felt the ending was quite predictable.

Yeah, already commented on that.

>I know people attribute passions to his motivation, but I don't feel  there is enough evidence to draw such a conclusion. From my  understanding each of the three main characters were intended to reflect  the three dimensions of F.: his unwavering devotion to his faith (the  prince); the nihilism he experienced and was surrounded by during his  exile (Ippolit); but what dimension did Rogozhin represent?

Dostoevsky was very, *very passionate man.* So Rogozhin definitely represents this part of Dosto. Also, a small remark - the exile is *the time* when he found his faith. *Before* it he was surrounded by nihilistic ideas, especially during literature evenings in Petrashev's club. Obviously, founding his faith didn't mean that his doubts disappeared, that's true. But i would even argue that in his exile, in ""ostrog"" (russian prison in Siberia) he was surrounded by the largest amount of believers. Also, the only book prisoners were allowed to read in ostrog was New Testament (the exact version of the book he had in ostrog he kept for the rest of his life).

>While I agreed with his answer in the end, I don't think it was  delivered in the profound way that was similar to his previous books.

About agreeing with the ending - perhaps you misunderstood it a bit. Read his short story ""The Dream of Ridiculous Man"" to understand the concept better.

>but it still left me a bit disappointed knowing what F. was capable of with his previous works.

Personally, as you can already guess, The Idiot is my favorite of his novels. The closest touch to Dosto heart, the tragedy of our modern society, but still giving some hope and light in the end of the tunnel (yeah, counterintuitive to the ending, but once again, read The Dream of Ridiculous Man).

>On to Demons now, which I'm still excited about.

Good luck with that, hope you will enjoy it. Just as a warning - first hundred or so pages can be quite boring, but believe me, they're a the necessary foundation for the rest of the book. And don't miss the censored chapter ""At Tikhon"" - it should be the last one, even though initially Dosto put it in the end of Part 2.",Val_Sorry,2021-01-31T18:12:37Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2

oebls9_3,oebls9,"The Idiot was my fav book in high school, before discovering Demons (also by Dostoevsky). I've read it a couple of times but it was a few years ago. You definitely make me want to go back to it, as back then my attention mainly went to the unfolding of the narrative and later to the philosophy behind it, and not so much to the overall structure of the novel.

If you read The brothers Karamazov and The Idiot one after the other you probably noticed the similarity between the prince and Alyosha Karamazov which is pretty interesting, especially for the ways in which they differ. I feel like Dostoevsky has a few archetypes of charachters he explored, I remember noticing a resemblance between Agláya Ivánovna from The Idiot and Lizaveta Nikolaevna Tushina (I think it was her) from The Demons.",__dash,2021-07-05T21:16:07Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,3

I did thoroughly enjoy it though; Myshkin is, like you say, such an adorable character, and it is really hard to see all the hardships he goes through.  I just wanted the poor guy to catch a break.

However, I don't think that it is better than *Crime And Punishment*, and I also honestly found *Demons* to be very enthralling, if a bit overlong; but *The Idiot* resting at the third spot in my ranking of novels by Dostoyevsky is no shade to its content.  I've also read two different translations of *Notes From The Underground*, and while I feel that I grasp its intention, I don't find it as powerful as the three novels that I've read.

k011p_1,k011p,"What I've learned about Dostoevsky (after having read *Brothers Karamazov* twice and *Crime and Punishment* once) is that he puts a *lot* of social commentary in his books that we, as 21st Century Americans (assuming you're in the USA) often miss. Remember, Dostoevsky was writing from the perspective of a 19th-Century Eastern Orthodox Christian Russian. Many of the things he addresses may seem irrelevant to us but were big issues in his time (such as 19th-Century Eurpoean philosophies such as nihilism that were making inroads among the educated and the wanna-be educated in Russia), but many of the more ""psychological"" issues are timeless.

In other words, read Dostoevsky like it's literature (which it is). By that, I mean, keep an eye out for where he might be saying more than is immediately apparent.

I have yet to read *The Idiot* (I'm looking forward to getting around to it someday), but I can't recommend *Crime and Punishment* and *The Brothers Karamazov* highly enough.

Some of it seems a little pointless, although it's probably not.  My opinion is that he uses these techniques to enhance the sense of present reality and to depict people as true agents with infinite potential.  He was a big fan of the Hegelian concept of ""man as idea"", which is about a person continually expressing and creating himself.

91o479_2,91o479,"I'm sorry to say, but I think you might have missed the point of the book a bit. 

The point wasn't that The Prince was an absolute idiot who did dumb shit - in fact, despite his 'title', The Prince displays some of the most profound moments of intelligence in the book. From making the children sympathize with and eventually love the doomed peasant girl they had previously ridiculed, to basically everything involving Nastasya Filippovna, I'd argue The Prince is actually highly intelligent. 

A little context is needed. Dostoevsky was a very devout Orthodox Christian. The Idiot is based on the author's idea of the most 'good' man, and in the eyes of a Christian, that would have to be Jesus Christ. So what the book wants to explore is what would happen if the most good man, Christ himself, who embodied Christian love and compassion, would be placed into a society devoid of those values. So it's almost like Dostoevsky was testing his own Christian values against that of Russian society, a theme which pops up in the novel in explorations of spirit of the Russian man, and I think is symbolised by The Prince's profound interest in Holstein's [The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/The_Body_of_the_Dead_Christ_in_the_Tomb%2C_and_a_detail%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg).

Why The Prince is ironically called an idiot in the novel's title, and is mistakenly considered such by characters in the book, is his kindness, empathy, and open-hearted honesty, all of which are mistaken for a lack of intellect and insight by the other characters who lack these qualities. And as a result of the defeat of these qualities, the book is naturally hopeless because the goodness of Christ is destroyed in Saint Petersburg society (which comes back around to the image of the decaying Christ in Holstein's painting, which I highly recommend checking out).

4soglc_1,4soglc,"Hi,

I read it many years ago but I love that book, probably it's my favorite.  
The first thing to say is that Dostoevskij's goal was to write the story of a man who was ""absolutely good"". Besides Jesus, he thought, the only character in literature who had been shown to be completely uncorrupt had been Don Quijote, but his adventures were a comedy, while Dostoevskij wanted to write a tragedy. His book shows the failure of such a man in a contemporary setting.  
But, alas, that was not the only failing, since Dostoevskij felt he didn't manage to reach his goal. To him, ""The Idiot"" was a book he hadn't been able to complete as he wished.

I think these are two elements to consider when you look at the book. It touches a lot of themes but the main one is the failure of Myskin to save Nastasya, another beautiful soul which has been corrupted (she was raped as a child), and who is now torn between Myskin's love and Rogozin's, his nemesis.  
With ""Demons"" another of my favorites, it's one of the most pessimistic books by Dostoevskij, there are no glimpses of redemption as in ""Crime and Punishment"" or ""Th Brothers Karamazov"".

4soglc_2,4soglc,"As fascinating as The Idiot is many people regard it as a failure. The problem I've always thought was that Dostoevsky set Myshkin up as a Christ-figure defined by his meekness and spiritual sensitivity is an increasingly despiritualized and nihilistic Russia, but he never found a way to complete the Christ analogy. Likely this would have required some act of self sacrifice probably on behalf of Nastasya Filipovna. As to why Dostoevsky decided to end it the way he did we can only speculate.

But I think I came to respect The Idiot for its look at society and interpersonal relationships with a similar detail to C&P's introspective perspective. I think. I mean, I'm definitely dressing up my opinion of it, but Myshkin's comparative outsider status gives him a unique perspective on society in the same way that Raskolnikov's...issues gave him a unique perspective on the psyche. If The Idiot is to be compared favorably to C&P, I would think it's as a result of the greater number of more complex characters, and the added exploration of their relationships, compared to C&P's very narrow focus. As [this review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/highereducation.classics) puts it (and in the words of Dostoevsky himself), The Idiot is about characterizing ""a completely beautiful human being,"" which I interpret in many ways as a perfect foil to Raskolnikov.

yzbnu_2,yzbnu,"It might help your understanding of *The Idiot* if you read *Don Quixote*  as well. Both books are, essentially, about the conflict between reality and the ideal. Both men are, in a way, caricatures of Christ. Dostoyevsky said himself in a letter in 1868:

> The main idea of the novel is to present a positively beautiful man. This is the most difficult subject in the world, especially as it is now. All writers, not just our, but European writers, too, have always failed whenever they attempted a portrait of the positively beautiful. Because the task is so infinite. The beautiful is an ideal, but both our ideal and that of civilized Europe are still far from being shaped. There is only one positively beautiful person in the world, Christ, and the phenomenon of this limitlessly, infinitely beautiful person is an infinite miracle in itself. (The whole Gospel according to John is about that: for him the whole miracle is only in the incarnation, in the manifestation of the beautiful.) But I am going too far. I’d only mention that of all the beautiful individuals in Christian literature, one stands out as the most perfect, Don Quixote. But he is beautiful only because he is ridiculous. Dickens’ Mr. Pickwick (who is, as a creative idea, infinitely weaker than Don Quixote but still gigantic) is also ridiculous but that is all he has to captivate us. Wherever compassion toward ridiculed and ingenious beauty is presented, the reader’s sympathy is aroused. The mystery of humor lies in this excitation of compassion.

This is also a major difference between the two novels. Don Quixote may be an active man, a hero (or at least try to be) but Myshkin is almost entirely passive. In many ways he's a personification of the Beatitudes.",sausagesizzle,2012-08-29T03:42:25Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2

6zuopf_1,6zuopf,"As someone below said, Welcome to Russian literature. I know quite a few Russian speakers who have the added benefit of an intimate knowledge of the language and culture who are left puzzled by the writings of Dostoevsky. I'll just say you haven't experienced the true bewilderment one gets on reading Crime and Punishment. 

Anyway, The Idiot is a daunting task, both to read and to understand. You must realise that Dostoevsky is a philosopher.  While he might not write philosophical treatises, he does incorporate certain subjects into his writing. The good news is that The Idiot is largely devoid of these philosophical points (as far as I can tell. If anyone can refute me then please do). The bad news is that The Idiot is a largely spiritual work, one which deals with the state of the Russian man. 

Dostoevsky, as far as I know, was not affiliated with the Slavophile movement. He did, however, share many ideological views with them. Just to quickly say that the Slavophile moment was a 19th century intellectual movement born out of a contempt for the Westernisation Russia underwent during the reigns of Catherine the Great and Peter the Great. Many saw the decline of Russian values, which were perceived as unique, as a threat to Russia itself, and proposed modelling Russia on traditional Orthodox values (many valued the church above the state) and trying to restore Russia to it's glorified past. 

And this is largely the basis of the book. It tries to examine the spiritual conflict taking place within Russia during the 19th century. The characters within the book are, by and large, terrible people. They're schemers, or damaged or outright rogues. There's one shining example of a good character, one who's used as a contrast to this 'degradation', and that's The Prince. Dostoevsky wanted to see what would happen if the purest man were to be placed in this network of bad people. Bearing in mind that D was a devout Christian, who is the purest man that could be thought up? Of course the answer is Christ himself. 

So that's what the book is. It's examining the spiritual state of the Russian man during the processes of increased Westernisation during the 19th century. I'm not surprised if you feel somewhat disturbed by the book's conclusion. There is no redemption in the end. The degraded Russian spirit, owing to increased European influence, destroyed Christ, and this influence was only increasing in Dostoevsky's mind (you might recall the closing paragraph where Lizaveta Prokovfyevna comments on the railways going evermore East and ominously encroaching on Russia).

This is the main point of the book, in my mind at least. There are other conclusions I've drawn from reading the book, but there is not the space here to adequately detail it. So I'll leave it here. ",ImALivingJoke,2017-09-13T22:11:57Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1

I think the biggest difficulty I am having is tracking exactly how Myshkin's actions and thoughts are supposed to represent the 'perfect' man. I just don't see it, at all. And I feel like it is really holding me back from fully understanding what Dostoevsky is trying to say...

I don't see Myshkin as perfect, or beautiful... I just see him almost as essentially... a nonentity. ",flannel_jackson,2017-09-13T22:56:43Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2
6zuopf_3,6zuopf,"Do you know what the word мышь (mysh') means in Russian? It's 'mouse', and 'Myshkin' is a diminutive of this word. So Myshkin is meant to be almost a nonentity. It's my understand that he's meant to be almost like a mouse in every scene. He's not meant to dominate each scene; he's meant to give way to bigger personalities and schemers. 

What defines The Prince is how he influences other characters despite his insignificance during each scene. While in other books characters influence the plot alone, the Prince acts to both forward the plot and influence the actions of other characters. If we think about the first time Nastasya Fillipovna met the Ivolgins, she was extremely rude initially to Ganya's family. However, due to the Princes' words, she becomes much more courteous and actually greets Ganya's mother with a kiss on the hand. And this is true throughout the novel with several characters. While he might seem like a nonentity, he's actually the most important character because it's his wholly perfect self, his rejection of societal norms, his sincerity, and his compassion, that makes otherwise reprehensible people rethink they're actions and promptly act in a much better way. 

How he is the 'perfect' man is that he is based upon Christian ideas of the ideal man, thus meaning Christ himself. He's free of any violence whatsoever, even to the point where he'll allow himself to be attacked without resistance (often to the ire of other characters). We see this in the scene where the Nihilists come to Lebedevs' and demand money from the Prince on falsified inheritance claims. The Prince allows them to continuously insult him, and after even offers them financial aide and assistance despite their fraudulent claims and personal attacks against his persons.

He's also devoid of the prejudices normal in society and possesses a strong insight into other characters. Fillipovna is a 'damaged' woman. She is Totsky's woman, and everyone knows it. It's for this reason no one will marry her, and Ganya will only do so for a large dowry from Totsky. The Prince sees through this, and what's more, unlike every other character he understands Fillipovna's actions are a result of the internalised feelings of hatred and resentment resultant from the sexual abuse and subsequent shame prescribed by society onto her. This is how he is able to influence her throughout the novel. 

Another reason why he is the perfect man is his sincerity. He's called 'The Idiot' because, unlike every other character, he is completely honest. This is rare in a world where no one means what they say. These are the reasons he's the perfect man. His actions throughout the novel are marked by a continued effort to benefit other characters, selfless actions which are to the point of harmful to himself. 

I'm not sure if any of this helps you or if the Prince is still alien to you. If there's one piece of advice I can give, it's contrast the Prince with other characters and see how much he departs from their actions and speech. ",ImALivingJoke,2017-09-13T23:39:14Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,3

And of course Leo Tolstoy. A good one to start with might be “Family Happiness.” He also wrote War and Peace and Anna Karenina—they are LONG, especially War and Peace.

I'd recommend this order: C&P, The Possessed (Demons), The Idiot, Brothers K. The Idiot and The Possessed are probably interchangeable depending on what you're in the mood for (The Idiot is a more personal novel, while The Possessed is probably Dostoevsky's most political) but I think ending with Brothers K is key.

I loved those books to death even during the more ""boring"" parts. But despite how much I genuinely enjoyed them all and felt I got a ton out of them, I struggled to finish them so as it was. They are very long, intricate, wordy, and I found myself digging backwards into the book a lot in order to reread certain things and fully grasp the entirety of the stories and all their intricacies. Not to mention the fact that Dostoyevsky has about 5 different names for each character, which I got used to, but still had me looking back trying to figure out who was talking sometimes. But God do I love his works. Anyway.

All of this to say, as much as I would love to be able to read a Dostoyevsky work in the original written language, I cannot FATHOM simultaneously learning a language and using that language to read a novel like the Idiot.

dyj8x3_4,dyj8x3,"The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin noted that virtually all of Dostoevsky's main characters are defined by the experience of threshold, unable to move towards a half-formed image of the way they could be (or society could be) but unwilling to move back either. This produces a strange sort of hysteria in them, which oscillates between agony and ecstasy, and actively resists the simplification of character into archetype. As Bakhtin put it: ""Dostoevsky always represents a person on the threshold of a final decision, at a moment of crisis, at an unfinalizable, and unpredeterminable, turning point for their soul.""

To modern readers, that aspect of his work can feel a little zany or anachronistic, but if you lean into it, the effect is still very powerful. Of course, it's important to see Dostoevsky's writings in context, as he seems to hear the music in distant rooms that weren't fully located within his lifetime. Whether that's his pre-articulation of Nietzsche, whose ideas seem to have found some inspiration or confirmation in Dostoevsky's novels, particularly Crime & Punishment and Karamazov. More importantly, although all of his work predates Freud's, you can often see Dostoevsky's intuitive sense of the subconscious, particularly in his tendency to turn to the inexplicable gesture over the statement — Lise privately crushing her finger in the door after humiliating Alyosha in Karamazov, or Myshkin trying to hide his face in a corner after being slapped by Ganya in The Idiot. He has a playwright's instinct for dramatic scene construction and the harmonic and dissonant potentials in dialogue, especially in his later work.

Bakhtin phrased that aspect of Dostoevsky as the attempt to write a polyphonic novel, where the clustering of separate, hyper-realised voices could allow both those characters and the reader to perceive a broader perspective of themselves, and indeed that without these external perspectives, it is impossible to be wholly known to oneself or to others.",Phineasfogg,2019-11-19T16:56:03Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,4

dyj8x3_7,dyj8x3,"I have recently started getting back into Dostoevsky at the age of 31. I tried reading *The Brothers Karamazov* in my early 20s but I didn't get very far. In a way, I think I just wasn't ""ready"" for Dostoevsky yet. But I always wanted to have the Dostoevsky experience, so to speak. What little I had heard about his psychospiritual themes sounded right up my alley. And, being a huge fan of Franz Kafka, I was curious to see why Kafka considered him such an important influence on his own writing. So I recently decided to finally take a serious dive into his works, and I'm already having that sensation of, ""Holy shit, I have *really* been missing out all this time!""

I first read *Poor Folk*, which was a very touching, but relentlessly bleak and sad story. I enjoyed it for the most part, though it's my understanding that it's often considered ""minor"" Dostoevsky, and not all that representative of his larger themes. Then I moved to *Notes From Underground*, which totally blew me away! The pained, conflicted rantings of the ""underground man"" resonated a lot with some of my own internal struggles over the years. I particularly enjoyed his musings on the irrational/contrary nature of human consciousness, existential boredom and inertia, the enigma of self, and the existence (or nonexistence) of freewill. And the final scenes between the troubled man and the young prostitute Liza were some of the most poignant things I've ever read. I loved it, and did a lot of page-marking and underlining of favorite lines throughout. Will definitely be reading it again eventually.

I'm currently about halfway through reading *Crime and Punishment* and I honestly can't even describe the powerful impression it is having on me so far. I'm amazed. I don't think I've ever read anything like this in my life. In it, Dostoevsky is drilling deeper into the human psyche than I ever thought writing could. It's remarkable how well he puts it all into words, and how relatable it all is. He's describing feelings and thoughts that I've just never heard described so subtly and acutely. It's the kind of thing that when you read it, you repeatedly go, ""Daaaamn, I know *exactly* the feeling he's talking about!"" It's like he's spelunking deep down into the murky human soul with a 1000-watt flood-lamp, exposing every sordid crevice, every obscure nook and cranny, all the things that we try to bury and look away from in mundane everyday life. I can definitely already see where his reputation as a literary genius came from. After I finish this book, I think I'm going to read *The Idiot,* and then try to finally tackle *The Brothers Karamazov.* I'm really excited for all that!",,2019-11-19T15:47:48Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,7

The characters in Brothers K are so relatable. I found parts of the book really uplifting. It's long, but not as confusing as other books. I found **Notes from the Underground** to be a harder read despite being way shorter. 

I've been meaning to reread **The Idiot**. I read it for school in a rush once and didn't really enjoy it, but think I would given a new atmosphere",,2019-11-19T17:35:42Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,14

28vecf_3,28vecf,"The Idiot by Dostoevsky. Still potentially my favourite book, was the first Dostoevsky novel I've read and imo probably the most relatable. So many books I've read since have been much less enjoyable ever since just cuz they can't compare. Also, totally glad u say that about 'The Road,' that's the next book I plan on reading. I met Tim Kasher from Cursive and The Good Life a few months ago and he recommended that book claiming ""It will probably be considered the first **great novel** of the 21st century""",zsteelhammer,2014-06-24T00:41:47Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,3
8adr0n_1,8adr0n,"Having read The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment and The Idiot, which one would you recommend reading first? I've never read any of his works and I have basically zero expectations/opinions. Would appreciate guidance on where to start!",conyconycony,2018-09-04T04:17:29Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1
8adr0n_2,8adr0n,"I think that's a little off. Dostoevsky was suspicious of Western Enlightenment thinking, but he didn't deny its value entirely. Rather, he thought it was a useful and powerful way of viewing the world, but lacking in a moral basis.

In his opinion, Russia had the two halves to make a great country, but lacked a way of uniting them. The Russian upper class had become too westernized and lost contact with its roots, while the lower class had retained its virtue and spirituality, but had been outdated and left behind by the advancing west. His 'pochvennichestvo' political ideology sought to heal Russia through what he saw as the only thing that could reunite these two groups: the Orthodox church, with its merging of Christianity (western) with traditional Russian values.

Many of Dostoevsky's characters seek what they sometimes call a 'binding idea' that can bring the country together, this is what he sought as well. For example, in *The Idiot* Myshkin speaks often of a unifying idea that could bring everyone together, and experiences something like that idea at the height of his epileptic fits (implied to be religious). Myshkin himself very much represents the ideal of combining Europe and Russia, as he was born in Russia but spent so much of his life in Switzerland. In *Crime and Punishment,* Raskolnikov throughout much of the book mentions how uneasy he feels around the peasants and other low-class people of Petersburg. He is certainly one of the westernized Russians at this point, being very fluent in western ideas and writing but having very little connection to his traditional roots (see his isolation from his family). But, pay attention to the epilogue - as soon as he embraces religion from Sonya, he feels a sudden fellowship and comradery with the other prisoners.

This, I think, is Dostoevsky's central political theme. Not that Westernism needs to be rejected entirely, but that it needs to be melded with traditional Russian values.",,2018-04-08T01:47:53Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2
8adr0n_3,8adr0n,"Crime and Punishment for sure! It’s mostly everyone’s gateway to Dostoyevsky’s writing. Then I’d advise you to proceed with The Idiot which is much more slow-paced and just as detail oriented like C&P but without any of the action or suspense. But it’s a highly rewarding book and will definitely be worth it in the end! I personally love it just a little bit more than C&P... 

Lastly, The Brothers Karamazov! It was Dostoyevsky’s last novel and should be the last one you read too. It’s much longer than the previous two at roughly 1,000 pages. At times, it gets boring... but if you somehow get through it, you will emerge a new person. If there ever were a book which contained the meaning of life, this one is possibly it.

fbq4v0_1,fbq4v0,"Crime and Punishment is by far the most focussed Dostoevsky novel I have read. Karamazov makes it feel like a light book. TBK is great, but it is also long-winded with an incredible amount of tangents. I wouldn't try to plough through it for the sake of it. I tried to the first time and did not enjoy it. 

The Idiot is my favourite book by Dostoevsky. If you feel like you can't get past the first half or so of TBK, but want to keep reading Dostoevsky, I suggest giving The Idiot a go. It is a bit shorter and is a better segue into TBK.",Fawkes_91,2020-03-01T08:23:51Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1
fbq4v0_2,fbq4v0,"Huh, funny to see the comments so far. It's been a while since I've read them, but I distinctively remember The Brothers Karamazov being an easier and more captivating read than either Crime And Punishment or The Idiot - which were great, sure, but TBK was just an all-around faster, fun read.

The whole thing was interesting from the start, and the characters were all fascinating. Unlike C&P or The Idiot, which were more focused on specific characters, TBK is constantly switching around multiple characters and their own struggles, it kept the whole thing refreshing imo.",BlueUnknown,2020-03-01T12:21:05Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2
fbq4v0_3,fbq4v0,"I read crime and punishment first and absolutely loved it. I read this while I was in medical school over a few months and found it pretty profound and it became easily one of my favorite books.

Fast forward a few years and I one again have time for leisure reading and I pick up TBK and the idiot. 

I could only get through a third of TBK. It felt like there were a lot of pages that were messy and rambling. So I decided to switch it up and try to read the idiot. I liked it and found it quite funny and witty but my brain must've been fatigued trying to read this right after TBK because I wasn't able to handle the number of characters and POVs being thrown at me.

Maybe I'll try reading the idiot again, been looking for something to pick up.",Rajaholick,2020-03-03T02:00:03Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,3
v975wc_1,v975wc,"I’m only just starting my journey into Dostoyevsky, but man, he is amazing. So far I’ve read The Gambler and Notes from the Underground. The Gambler is good, but Notes absolutely blew my mind. The man was a genius, full stop. 

Reading it took me back to a very dark moment in my life that I experienced a couple years ago, and it was super helpful in helping me process some of the emotions I felt during that experience. After I finished that book, I had to take a few days before I could start anything else because I needed to process it all. 

I’m planning on reading Crime and Punishment next and then moving onto his other major stuff like The Idiot, Demons, and ending with Brother’s Karamazov. Can’t imagine how they could be better than Notes, but everyone I see says BK is as good as it gets, so I’m super excited!",,2022-06-10T19:50:57Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1

b3ef8_1,b3ef8,"House of the Dead, The Brother's Karamazov and The Idiot are probably my top three by him. 

I adore dead Russians and I rank him as one of my weaknesses. 

If  you are enjoying Dostoevsky you might also want to have a look at Alexander SOlzhenitsyn. He was the Soviet era's equivalent. Right down to *One day in the life of  Ivan Denisovich* being his version of *House of the Dead* and coming out of a similar situation. Denisovich was sentenced to time the gulags for making an insulting comment about Stalin in a letter. 

I haven't read it yet but I'm dying to get my hands on *The Gulag Archipelago* as well. ",UsernameUnknown,2010-02-19T07:04:20Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,1

68kc94_2,68kc94,"I think a first Dostoevsky should always be Crime and Punishment.

But The Idiot is one I often recommend to people because it can appeal to many different readers. There is a lot of St Petersburg high-society soap-opera type stuff which wouldn't normally grab me but it was hilariously entertaining. Then there is a very well done tale of Good vs Evil with Jesus vs Satan type metaphor. 

It's a very odd story but entertaining as hell. The end, not to spoil anything, but everyone I know who read the end told me of how they literally said ""what the fuck?"" out loud.

That said... read Crime and Punishment first. It really should be everyone's introduction to Dostoevsky.",TheManInEigengrau,2017-05-01T06:29:44Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Idiot,2
