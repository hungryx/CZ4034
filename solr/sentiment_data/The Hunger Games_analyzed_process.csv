17q9ttb_1,17q9ttb,"His pure goodness makes him being brainwashed and manipulated by Snow that much more impactful. It’s such a gut wrenching character shift to see this person who is so selfless and kind become a monster. 

In the same way that it’s more impactful to have Gale be the one who commits the ultimate betrayal. He was set up to be the stoic protector. The provider. The guy who would stand up for the most vulnerable… and then he has them slaughtered. 

One of the greatest strengths of the Hunger Games is how each character is written and how their own individual journeys go on to change them.",sufferin_sassafras,2023-11-08T01:45:24Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
17q9ttb_2,17q9ttb,"I just want to chime in that this isn’t really a writing flaw, and how Collins executes it is an example of how Hunger Games really was a step above the YA dystopian drivel that imitated it.

Peeta represents “goodness” in the book. Whereas Gale is that “survival” instinct that allows her to get through the Hunger Games. Peeta never would have survived without Katniss because he isn’t brutal or ruthless enough, he’s just good.

In the end, when she chooses to stay with him and protect him, that represents a total disavowal of violence in favor of focusing on healing, nurturing, and goodness. It’s the reason why “both sides are bad” works here. Both sides in the war are bad because both sides ruthlessly use violence and manipulation to get what they want, rather than healing or fixing anything. The final message of the series is one that is deeply pacifistic. Peeta serves that purpose.",MaichenM,2023-11-08T16:16:31Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

But I agree, he really is perfect except I will add that he’s not 100% flawless to the point where he has no personality. He’ll act annoyed or sarcastic or even really angry (like in district 11) if there’s a good reason. He’s not a blank slate, he’s got a well rounded personality and is just all around kind and good and lovely. Definitely still my top book crush.

17q9ttb_5,17q9ttb,"It's literally a televised game about children surviving and killing each other. The whole point of that interaction is that he had to do something morally aghast to ingratiate himself with the careers long enough to warn Katniss, and that is that really Peeta doing it, or is it the Capitol forcing his hand for societal control and entertainment. 

A lot of the people in the Hunger Games were just regular people, who in their lives would never consider doing any of the things they did in the games in real life. Hell, Thresh SAVES Katniss because his moral compass was still screwed on straight even when he's in survival mode. Had it been Rue and Thresh at the end instead of Katniss and Peeta he would have absolutely died on his sword instead of her (there is an entire subtext of dialogue here about how black boys are aged up in treatment by society but that's another post entirely).

Like, literally the entire point is about psychologically damaging these kids for entertainment. Even the Careers, that's their name, to compete while they're growing up to be winners of child murder games, are just mentally convinced from a young age that being good at violence is a positive trait. 

But Peeta has to make a split second decision that ends one life and saves another and he's the monster?

17q9ttb_7,17q9ttb,"It’s a symbolic betrayal.

The entire subtext of that moment is that Gale has now done something that is so unforgivable and irredeemable. He betrayed everything that was important to them. He was someone that she trusted and confided in and then he did something that was just as evil and vile as the Capitol would.

He absolutely betrayed her. In every single fundamental way a person can betray someone. He showed Katniss that he became someone she could no longer trust. He was now someone who would sacrifice innocent people to score a strike against the other side. 

It’s basic philosophy. One of the central debates in The Hunger Games is “do the ends justify the means.” To Katniss the answer is no. The ends do not justify the means. You should not sacrifice people to obtain your victory. Even one life sacrificed is too many. The Gale we met at the beginning of the story shared that belief. The one we saw at the end did not.

17q9ttb_9,17q9ttb,"Of course it’s a kill, it’s the hunger games. Why would it need to be brought up again? The entire point of the games is that kills are forced to kill kids. A mercy kill is about the tamest kill you can have in the games. It’s like Katniss killing Cato after the mutts tortured him all night. She doesn’t bring up his death over and over yet we know she doesn’t feel good about any of her kills.

Yes obviously Peeta actually ended her life but Cato was convinced he killed her, they had an argument about it. So she was extremely injured to the point they were sure she was dead, and Peeta actually ending it doesn’t make him this horrible murderer, it shows his kindness at finishing the job quickly. What do you want the book to do, make him cry about this specifically? He clearly is traumatized by the games, admits to having nightmares and paints scenes from it.",cookieaddictions,2023-11-08T18:04:10Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,9
17q9ttb_10,17q9ttb,"That's not textual evidence of coercion. It can just as easily be read as the time needed to heal within the context of a loving relationship with someone who has their own wants and desires (you know, a human.)

Also, again, you can interpret the lack of follow up of some characters' death as ""their lives meant less overall"", or you could interpret it as ""their deaths were no longer important to the story."" Loads of people die in the hunger games. They can't all be focused on or followed up on - there's not room. The story also loses significant amount of impact if less people die - it's a dystopian story centered around an uprising. you need large sociatal impacts for the story to work. (Vs, say, the Giver, which is a dystopian novel centered around a single character's internal journey to ultimately reject the society, and is therefore a lot more focused on each character and the impact of their actions.) 


Which is to say, it sounds like you don't like the scope and scale of the story, and you also don't like the way you interpret the story (or Collins' writing.)

17q9ttb_12,17q9ttb,"Changing goalposts? What? If you never gleaned the not-like-other-girls, internalized misogyny these books are rife with, that says more about your media literacy than my impatience with you.

Like, dude, it's been over 24 hours since I posted my initial comment. At least a half-dozen people have already replied saying about as much as you have if not more. *Why* do you still feel the need to engage with me?

My point is the erasure. According to the Hunger Games trilogy, some people's lives are worth more than others, namely the main character and her buddies. I'm not a fan of protagonist-centered morality. If the narrative had done a better job of confronting that tendency of the books, we wouldn't even be having this debate.

Honestly not a fan of being labeled a troll for . . . having an opinion that doesn't gel with you? And not kowtowing to your disagreement? In my experience, trolls fail to meaningfully engage and resort to insults and usually bigotry. I haven't done that. Are you new to the Internet or something?

Like, with regards to the misogyny, do you want quotes? Because I can provide them, but not now because this isn't an interesting enough conversation for me to prioritize when I have work to do. But I can already cite Catching Fire where Katniss is more bothered by Joanna stripping in front of her than she is by an old man assualting her or Finnick (a 24 year old to her 16-17) coming onto her. Followed up by some bizarre-ass shit where Katniss is considered ""pure"" and that's why the older victors have the urge to mess with her. Like, wtf is that shit? That legit made teen me uncomfortable to read and *not* in the way the author intended because the ""pure"" comments come from everyone's precious Peeta and Finnick becomes an ally while the writing continues to vilify Joanna for every little thing she does.

And I'm not angry. I'm peeved and honestly baffled that you came back to argue with me after deleting your initial comment yesterday. Also, am I making shit up or could it be that I'm misremembering because it's been a good few years since I last read these books?

Pedantic? Also, what case do I have? The case of disagreeing that Peeta is a perfect paragon of male leads and that THG is an untouched masterpiece of a dystopian YA? Especially when The Giver is *right there?*

I honestly didn't initially comment to have a discussion, because I've been to this rodeo before and have heard the same rebuttals and counter-arguments time and again. I commented because I felt like I was in crazy-town with the Peeta worship. I like Josh Hutcherson as much as the next person, but Book Peeta is a manipulative conniving forced love interest who could've been a genuinely interesting character in the hands of a better writer.

My hate springs from disappointment. These books majorly disappointed me as a teen, and the criticism-lacking worship they still receive is utterly baffling to me.

I'm still going to go see Ballads of Songbirds and Snakes once it's out because the very premise still has promise and I found the The Hunger Games movies to be major improvements on their source material.

13x4ss0_3,13x4ss0,"The mental leap I had to make: To understand that society today isn‘t far away from the Hunger Games, and how the book sets you up to realize it. I went from „well, stands to reason their lives are shitty, after society went bust“ to „now wait a minute, some people‘s lives are pure luxury and leisure“ to „that‘s how it already is“.

Luxury for a minority at the expense of everyone else. Law enforcement above the law. Your privacy, your safety, your right to a fair trial, all debatable. The ruling class completely out of touch with reality. Your odds of survival directly correlated with your social status and wealth. Those who have nothing pitted against each other, so they don‘t realize who the real enemy is.

We may stop short of throwing kids into a televised battle to the death, but we don‘t give too much of a damn about children dying either. It‘s the price we choose to pay, and we shrug and say „the chances of it being my kid are really low“. Remember that in the book, you can enter your name into the lottery multiple times to get more food vouchers? So the poorer you are, the more the odds are stacked against you. Sound familiar yet?

Panem is divided into districts, but the districts aren‘t equal. The districts closer to the Capitol make electronics and weapons, but further down the line it‘s food and then wood and coal. Replace district with class, and you‘re right where we are. The upper class don‘t live a carefree life either, but they‘re better off than the ones at the bottom. And it‘s in their best interest to make sure the order of things doesn‘t get upset, or so they‘re made to believe. Which is why in the book we see districts 1 and 2 siding with the Capitol.

The name Panem isn‘t a random choice either. „Panem et circenses“, bread and circus games, was the method the Romans used to keep the poor population content and subservient.

The Hunger Games is excellent and I have always thought this. Not only is the romance between Katniss and Peeta very well-done, but the romance between Katniss and Gale is similarly well-done, as well as the contrasts between Gale and Peeta that echo what Katniss feels and needs at different points in her journey/the story.

>!Also, as heartbreaking as Prim's death was, it was necessary for the story because one of its main points is that the innocent cannot be protected in war. Katniss sacrificed everything to save one innocent person, and caused the entire story to set in motion because of this action, and yet in the end her mission failed because good things cannot survive in a bad world.!< (I'd highly recommend [this](https://www.hypable.com/mockingjay-why-prim-needed-to-die/) analysis.) Here's a quote from it:

>!""It’s clear from the beginning that Prim doesn’t belong in this world. If anything close to Absolute Truth makes an appearance in the series, it’s Prim. In fact, Prim embodies everything good, innocent, and pure. Peeta is a close second, but still not on the same level as Prim. After all, he is willing to kill other tributes if he must, while Prim can’t let a cat die.!<

>!""That’s why Katniss volunteering at the Reaping is even more significant. She’s volunteering to save her sister, yes, but symbolically, she’s volunteering to fight for and save everything that’s good.""!<

There are many other deeper themes that are explored—the uselessness of material goods in the face of things like life and death; the unfairness of wealth disparity; the impact of even small acts of bravery.

I think this was kind of lost on me when I read the books as a young adult, but I recently rewatched the movies (after my girlfriend went on an impromptu rant similar to your points) and it was seriously disgruntling. I live in New York City and the parallels between my day-to-day life and the Capitol are startling. I mean even New York fashion (which I appreciate) isn’t all too different from the costumes people where in the hunger games. I go on Instagram or walk into my office and everyone is talking about the latest celebrity gossip or what-not, and it’s easy to see how this isn’t any different then everyone in the capitol drooling over the latest bit of gossip Ceaser describes on his talk show. Meanwhile, I read the real news and all of the actual problems our country is facing and I can’t help but feel that we’re willingly distracting ourselves from reality. Many of us New Yorkers (and I fully include myself in this) live in our little bubble unaware or willingly deluded of the reality around us just like the capitol. 

I love New York, and it’s certainly not all bad, but I certainly see the similarities.

Do we know that the government ""owns"" those industries, or just that it enables them? The government doesn't own Boeing, but Boeing is going to fail without government contracts. The government doesn't own Exxon, but Exxon gets to control vast tracts of land dedicated to its industry.

Panem is very likely an exaggeration of what we have today, and what we have today is crony capitalism where capital has amassed so much power that it has wildly disproportionate influence in government. I think that's pretty clearly what's going in The Hunger Games, too -- capitalists have become so powerful that they've essentially become the government and use it to protect their wealth and status.

Pretty solid themes. Lots of fun messaging and examples of emotional and physical abuse and examples of public grooming… but all in an appealing and not too heavy package that will let kids digest it as they grow and look back on it later to appreciate the deeper themes. 
…
…
Alas, then the general public read the books, they blow up, and hundreds of thousands of kids think “oh my god I would totally win the hunger games this is so cool.” So it helps launch a massive multi billion dollar genre of video games where children get to live out the fantasy of killing each other and coming out on top as the sole survivor. So the messaging was accidentally drowned out by the novel premise of the abuse it tries to depict. Because damnit politics are boring but battle royals are just so cool!

14ozjzl_10,14ozjzl,"Not directly relevant, but I was reading an interview with Jeffrey Wright online prior to the release of the *Catching Fire* film. (It covered his involvement with *The Hunger Games* but also the rest of his career.) Now, I hadn't read the novels and knew almost nothing about the plot of the second or third book. I didn't know what I didn't know, I guess you could say! So, not really thinking about spoilers, I happened to scroll through the comments under the article. And what did I find but someone talking about how they blamed Beetee for Prim's death. Needless to say, I was stunned. Watching the first film, it never even occurred to me that Prim might die; in fact, I thought there was a chance of *Katniss* not surviving to the end.

When I expressed my disbelief that she posted such a huge plot point so openly - not even bothering to note that there was a spoiler coming - her response was just that *Mockingjay* had been out for a couple of years and she was tired of keeping quiet about it. Which… okay, that's all well and good, but the article was about an actor in advance of the film adaptation of the *second* book and she was talking about the pivotal event of what would ultimately be the *fourth* movie two years later.

Anyway, the damage was done and there definitely wasn't any chance I'd forget over those next two years. What actually made it worse was how little context I had! I knew Prim was going to get killed, and I knew that there was reason to think it was Beetee's fault, but that was pretty much it. So I spent those two years wondering exactly how and why she would die, which I think detracted from my enjoyment of the movies. It made such an impact that I still remember her screen name, and that almost never happens.

There's a time and a place for such things. Like, there really was no shortage of places where she could have expressed her opinion to an audience that would have fully understood and maybe even related to the point she was making. Basically shouting it into the void in the comments of an only somewhat related interview didn't really validate her view. And even beyond that, simply choosing to show some basic consideration for other people is pretty much always a virtue.

I too also hated how they killed him off. I wouldn't necessarily say his death was for shock factor, I think Collins added that bit as another representation of the tragedy of war.

Finnick may have come out a victor in his version of the Hunger Games, but he was only a victor in name as he ended up being just another pawn for Snow (being prostituted). Despite all the trauma, he was able to build a life with Annie, his future was really coming together. His death signifys senseless deaths. One can do everything right and still lose. War is generally just unfair.

It also makes perfect sense that he died protecting Katniss as she was what kick started the turn about in his life. Suddenly he wasn't just a pawn: he could fight, he could resist. I like to think he died on his own terms, fighting the good fight, which I think he would've prefered over being a spectacle in the games, dying for the entertainment of the Capitol.",darquess19,2023-07-03T10:17:57Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,12

14ozjzl_18,14ozjzl,"The Hunger Games is so much more than “war is bad”. 

To me, a lot of it is about power dynamics, wealth inequality, and dehumanization. 

It takes the districts so long to unite and take down the Capitol… because the Capitol has been successfully playing them against each other. It takes the events of books for the wealthy career districts to realize that they are no better off than the poor districts, they are also being oppressed and murdered, and there IS something they can do about it. It’s like real life workers that have been fed anti-union propaganda by their bosses. 

It’s not a “war is bad on BOTH sides” story; the primary question it asks the rebels is how far can they go. It’s not even just “are we any better than the Capitol if we bomb children?”- it’s also “can we trust these people who are bombing these children to be our leaders? What do we do if we can’t?” 

Also… What is entertaining can be different to people. It’s totally fine to not find The Hunger Games engaging.

14ozjzl_19,14ozjzl,"Okay I laughed at ""war is...le bad"" but also: as Truffaut pointed out ""there's no such thing as an anti-war film."" It is so, so hard to portray war in a way that doesn't ultimately glorify battle heroics, sacrifice and the camaraderie of soldiers. I think the Hunger Games manages this feat.

The original game story seems to be leading up to a decisive battle in which good outsmarts evil, and then rapidly pivots to: SURPRISE there's no winning this game. IF you survive, then your new job is to be a show pony for the capital, to be forced into marriage (Katniss) or become a prostitute for anyone the capital wants to reward (everyone else), and to be complicit in the game by training the new recruits from your district. There is no escape. And that's BEFORE she's dropped into the game again.

But then: there's an underground revolution brewing! Oh but your role is to make PR films and keep your trap shut about the battle tactics. Don't worry your pretty little head about what makes the new regime different from the old regime! I mean yeah they murdered your sister but NEEDS MUST.  Just get on out there and perform a show execution of the former president - you hate him anyway!

The series shows the trap doors of war: that there's no simplicity, no quick way to win, no clear moral winners *even when* one side is objectively worse. 

And even within this series Collins closes out with an actual happy resolution: that Katniss and Peeta - despite their lingering trauma - are ultimately able to raise children in a society where the Hunger Games are an ugly history that they never have to experience. If anything that's the outcome that ultimately wrenches the series back into alignment with the idea that there's no such thing as anti-war art.

Katniss by the last book is more a broken protagonist than a wish fulfillment hero. She isn’t much of an actual “chosen one” except by happenstance and was used, for good or for ill, as a symbol for the rebellion and wasn’t the one who defeated the Capital, and who knows whether the peace will last. The love triangle was barely even there for me as I read it. For me, it’s a bit of an unusual series to reflect upon, which isn’t bad.

11z9zcj_6,11z9zcj,"I did an English degree. I spent three years solid reading and researching serious classic literature week after week, and by the time I graduated I barely ever read a book for fun any more. 

It took a few months, but then The Hunger Games was the first thing I read that I actually enjoyed reading purely for fun again. It brought back that feeling I had as an older kid or young teenager where I got dropped into a new world, introduced to a bunch of characters, and wanted to see who would make it to the end. 

Like everything that has a wave of popularity - especially if it's *popular with teenage girls* - there's a backlash, but I agree most of the criticism isn't justified when you remember the target market. It does very well for the genre and age group. 

It's an immersive setting, but with a fast-paced  plot and many dystopian novels struggle to balance the two. 
I really got into the details of different Games and Districts. Love triangles are a YA staple but the HG one is different, a lot of the push and pull comes from Katniss' attempts to survive and how she thinks she needs to be perceived rather than just liking Boy A more than Boy B. The classical references are clunky to an adult, but would have been new hidden depths to me at 12 or 13. 

I struggled a little with the third one, as Katniss is so deep in trauma for a lot of the book, but on reflection I appreciate the darker turn. She can't be an action girl after everything in the first two books and the series doesn't try to resolve things in a neat, happy way. 

I also got a little tired of the Battle Royale comparisons people often made. There's a shared concept, but that pre-dates both pieces. In BR, the horror relies on the fact it's your friends and classmates being forced against you, while the Hunger Games always focussed on a system that would create and celebrate the big killing spree. 

People can dismiss it as a series for Middle Schoolers of they want, but hey, it's a *very good* series for Middle Schoolers.",Fish_fingers_for_tea,2023-03-23T14:01:37Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,6

It's a good concept, but these are not well written books with good character development (so far. I am on book 3). It feels like such a missed opportunity. Their could have been details about the various districts, that the author could have delved more into like how the media was used to keep District 1 citizens insulated/oblivious or just downright apathetic. There could have been more of a history between Peeta and Katniss. Not romantic, just history since they lived so close by, there could have been more details regarding when and why the districts were made, and how bloody the wars were which lead to people becoming resigned to the Hunger Games. 

There could have been so much more to make this a more layered novel series, but it feels almost lazy to me. The author had a great idea but a thoroughly indifferent execution. The writing is beyond meh.

It is one of those rare series where the movies are actually better, in my opinion.

11z9zcj_12,11z9zcj,"I have to respectfully dissent. I hated the books, because I had already read all of the books she smacked together to make this one. I did feel that it was a master class in plagiarized stories. 

The main characters: the love angle is basically Bella, but she ends up with Jacob instead of Edward. They aren't even really built out much more than that. We have lovely brunette damsel, tough broody dude, and more sensitive dude who is also somehow tough. Actually, I liked Twilight. It was an interesting twist on vampire lore. I didn't like the copy. It felt very flat. Katniss/Bella reacts. She takes no action. She is along for the ride in the story we are seeing through her. It's hard to care when she doesn't.

I have to say it. Hunger Ganes is heavily sanitized Battle Royale. This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read it a lot. You follow 42 children as they die... Trying or trying not to. And in the end you find out the ""game"" is not an experiment. It is to show people that you cannot trust anybody... Even if you see them every day. So we go to the Hunger Games. It is set up like a cheap sports rivalry. These people have never met, don't really interact before the game, and have zero reason to kill anybody. Except that like in The Running Man, they are hyped up on stage to be... Whatever the public says they are. They are fighting to get back to their families and for a boost of food to their districts. There is literally nothing stopping any of them from protest by suicide at any time. If indeed they all grew up watching this on tv, don't they know that it's pointless? (Why would any district keep watching after their players have died anyways? They have literally no stake in this. What is this, 1984 where you can't turn the TV off?) No society this opressed would have no spark of rebellion.
Plus, it IS on tv. No dictatorship would be dumb enough to run a fully live feed. They want blood, not a ""rival"" covering a somehow bloodless corpse in flowers. If they can't turn the TV off... Why show rebellion? Remember in The Running Man when they censored all his tapes so his proof of life could not also be a public statement?
So, the game. They already know they are sending children to die. They already know it's some sort of ritual. The thing that makes it a method of control is the shadow of mystery. The Battle Experiment. What is the experiment? Why is it important? What really happened to those children besides a list of casualties and how they died? You see a ""winner"" coming out of a black box the public assumes they had no choice but to fight their way out of. That fear controls the public. Not the game as designed. They don't even have dumb fake rivalries as if it were a sport. Like district 8 out for blood after district 3 killed their player last year. That might at least have made it interesting.

She knows that she needs to act certain ways to play for the camera (after others tell her this) and she knows that Peeta knows this as well, and she's trying to do the best she can while struggling with conflicted feelings and not knowing where the pretending ends and the real feelings begin.

yyp6w_1,yyp6w,"There are quite a lot of YA dystopian novels floating around, but I think the Hunger Games sticks out from the crowd for three reasons:

1) Panem is a dystopian society that has a valid basis in our own current society.  We are becoming more and more desensitized to the suffering of others because of what we see in the media when we watch war coverage and reality tv.  It's not THAT hard to imagine us devolving into a society that enjoys death matches between children.

2) Katniss is well-described.  I applaude Collins' resistance to the current trend of making the main character an ""any-girl"" so that the reader can insert herself into that role.  (cough cough, Twilight, cough cough)  Katniss is strong and defies the system all on her own - she doesn't follow along blindly until a male peer comes along to open her eyes and show her a different way.  She is a character to be admired, even though she has plenty of flaws.  She's very well-realized and very human.

3) I think the lack of resolution that you mentioned is one of the strong points of the series.  We're talking about a society undergoing a revolution.  There's no such thing as a resolution under those circumstances.  And the two main characters were thoroughly traumatized, so of course they aren't going to find their happily ever after.  Instead, they find something more realistic: an unsteady, fragile peace.  ",,2012-08-28T17:54:04Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
yyp6w_2,yyp6w,I felt that both Catching Fire & Mocking Jay suffered from the popularity of The Hunger Games. I think both books feel rushed and hammered to fit rather than crafted. I got the impression that these were completed to meet a publisher schedule for the school year and not because they were the best they could be. ,Avertr,2012-08-28T17:47:05Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2
yyp6w_3,yyp6w,"I really think that having the 'rainbows, unicorns and lollipops ending' would have taken away from the hunger games experience in itself. I would consider it poor character development if she would have been able to overcome the horror she was put through 'like that'. Of course I didn't want Prim to die, neither did I want to see Finnick die etc, but it just all adds up to the 'horrors of war' feeling that the trilogy has. 

I suppose the point is that they broke the regime, and prevented the swapping of one dictatorship for another, and that comes at a price. I confess, I was a Gale fan :p, but the reasoning presented at the  end of the trilogy was enough for me to understand why it concluded the way it did.

I agree that the point was that it broke her, which was a great way to end the series considering everything that led up to the ending. Everyone using her, her constant struggle between the two idiots fighting for her love, the hunger games themselves, ect.

yyp6w_5,yyp6w,"Everytime I think of The Hunger Games series I have to tell myself, ""It was written for kids, and these kids just over-hyped the hell out of the book -- it's not The Great Gatsby as far as impact in literature, it's not going to become a classic book any more than Twilight will, it's the B Action movie of books."" but still, after reading the first book I loved it but after reading the other books I realized the major flaws in Collin's writing style (she makes the worlds feel cramped, small and doesn't let the world breathe -- they went to the Capital three times and only on the third time did she mention the most important physical feature about it! That's like going to Venice and not mentioning the canals) but ultimately the books suffered majorly in a lack-of-logic department. But I have to forgive the books, they are for entertainment and nothing more. Maybe I've made to much out of the books, I guess that's why you don't hype thing up because when you expect something amazing and unrivaled you don't end up getting what you expected.

AND TO MAKE THIS POST EVEN LONGER!
tl;dr: they were ok books written for children overhyped by children.

yyp6w_6,yyp6w,"It feels like a lot of people are missing out on the point of Mockingjay, that IMO it was meant to be dehumanizing, it was meant to be almost horrific, because that is what war does to people.  Katniss acted, and people died, but ultimately it was other people who controlled what happened and she just sort of tagged along.  She lost everything, well you know what, that happens in war.  People lost their humanity, and when she was pleading for people to regain their humanity, treating people properly in district 2, she gets shot.  

The ending impressed me, because it is rare for a YA novel to go that deep into the after-effects of war.  Not just the PTSD, but also the larger picture, how Coin would simply have replaced Snow as supreme dictator.  The ending was as happy as it was possible to make Katniss while staying true to her meaning.  In fact, in some ways i expected her to die, and Peeta too, because of the Hanging Song...

Edited to add, I also thought the ""panem et circenses"" (Bread and Circuses(or Gladiators)) bit was just so perfect.  I knew reading the first novel that Panem was familiar but never placed it till she said it.  You have the Hunger Games (the Circuses) and Panem...

yyp6w_11,yyp6w,"I totally get what you mean, but to me, that's exactly what charms the entire ending. Coin was the 'leader' of the rebellion, so it probably seemed fair for her to assume presidency after the war against the capitol. Bear in mind that people have just gotten rid of a dictatorship, so the general attitude probably is 'How bad can this rebellion-leader be?'. That's where Plutar just hits the nail on the head, people will be people and society will be society. 

I don't think there's even a remote chance of going back to equity, there will always be the contrast between rich and poor, intelligent and smart.  Hence the decision to keep the districts running, everyone needs the resources. (Katniss' decision to renew the hunger games, it's just a person wanting revenge... nothing changed). I suppose in that regard it's a bit of an open ending, but that's not necessarily bad for me, I like the fact that I can put two and two together for myself. 

Same argument for the ending, I like the fact that Katniss doesn't come out bright and shining, she's broken, but trying to make sense of a world that doesn't make any sense. However, you can clearly see that she's trying to give her children a better chance than she ever got... that made the ending perfect for me. It's not about her and Peeta anymore, it's about the future. 

Anyway, that's just my take on it :D. ",Starmatske,2012-08-29T01:27:14Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,11

She would be a rallying point to insurrectionists if she did any more than live 'an ordinary life'.  

The truth of the matter is, she probably woke up many nights screaming, and Peeta did the same after surviving the Hunger Games, not to mention the war at the end, and everything else that PTSD would cause her to do.

I think the real issue, which ktphoenix is saying, is that Katniss handled the hunger games themselves with all the danger and intrigue, the underhanded capitol, the emotional blackmail, etc. in the first two books.  Sure, she wasn't happy, but she handled it, and she handled it remarkably well.  

Then all of a sudden in the third book, she can't handle it anymore, and we're not really told why.  Sure, the thing happens with Prim (tried to only be a semi-spoiler with that), which is terrible, probably more terrible than most of the other things that happen to Katniss, but why didn't she handle it like she should have?  Why couldn't she handle that after everything else she handled?

Granted, though, it is written for middle schoolers, so it's rather easy reading, and I have some issues with the ending (not the depressing aspect, although one death in it still makes me sad, but one part seems rather illogical.)

That's exactly what I felt the whole ""I learned to love Peeta and now we have pretty kids and some nights I don't scream from my nightmares"" epilogue was for.  The YA readership Collins originally went for needed a semi-happy ending.  However, Collins actually created a series that transcended age groupings.  (I've heard from more adults than teens/tweens that read it.)

I also think many of us are disappointed because it is a YA series and we all expected this strong, capable teenage girl to be a superwoman from beginning to end.  Readers are often upset when the strong heroine has major, unovercomable (I think I just made that word up; it's great, isn't it?) flaws that make her weaker and/or broken at the end.  Even though we knew The Hunger Games series is a dystopian fantasy, we still expected a happy ending where the awesome girl lead kicked ass and ended up on top.  It's hard to see past our need for a happy ending to understand that 17 year old people are ill-equipped for war, betrayal, death, and civil upheaval. (Not that anyone of any age is really equipped for those things.)  I agree that Collins's choice to make this series YA is a little suspect and made for the unfulfilling nature of the series's ending.

I thought, well most movies based on books rarely live up to them so the books might be kinda awesome. Plus, I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. Like Twilight, I wanted to give it a chance and know what the fuss was all about. 

So I binge read the series. I was surprised because it was one of those stories that kept me reading long after I should have gone to bed. I saw a couple sunrises reading that series. 

Then the ending came. It felt, at least to me, like by this point the author had grown tired of the story and just rushed the ending so she could just finish the series and get it out. You spend so much time with all of these characters and get attached to them only to at the end get, if you're lucky, a short paragraph summarizing what happened to them. Your main character really just...... didn't feel like she had any character growth after everything she'd been through. 

I dunno, it's been several years since I read it and can't remember everything I felt when it was over. I do remember a feeling of ""wtf just happened"" and extreme let down and annoyance.

Overall, I liked the message that the Hunger Games conveyed about power, press and propaganda, but found many characters unrealistic.

It’s absolutely tragic getting some of the POVs of kids that don’t want to be in the game, but are so terrified that they compete anyways.

17vdx4_6,17vdx4,"I understand not liking The Hunger Games - no book is universally liked and people have different tastes - but I don't understand exactly what you mean by ""bad"" writing?

>I don't like ""purple-prose"" but Collins' writing is SO simplified. There's almost no description and information is mostly communicated in rapid sentences spoken one after another.

Isn't this entirely subjective? I, for one, didn't think the books suffered from a lack of description at all. There were many things that I thought were somewhat lacking in The Hunger Games, especially the last book, but I don't think that you can say sparse description is ""bad"" writing, so much as it is just a writing style you don't enjoy. Can't an author choose to have as much or as little description as they want?

>Tons of stuff isn't elaborated on well, at all; for example, when I first read the book I couldn't figure out what happened to Gale. I was never a Gale and Katniss shipper, btw, so Gale's disappearance didn't bother me in any way; it just seemed like bad writing.

I don't get what you mean. Gale wasn't very much in the first book because he wasn't in the games. There really wasn't a way to include him in the story when he wasn't present for 95% of it.

>In fact, the whole love triangle really bothered me. Is a love triangle a must for EVERY YA novel these days?

Love triangles are as old as literature itself, and they appeal to a YA crowd who often have to deal with conflicting and easily-shifting feelings. That's not bad writing so much as it is just a trope that you don't seem to enjoy, which is okay.

>Also, Katniss is an annoying character

That's extremely subjective. What makes her annoying? Holden Caulfield is annoying to many people, but he's kind of supposed to be, and that doesn't make The Catcher in the Rye a badly written book.

Like I said, I have no problem with you not enjoying the books. They weren't my absolute favorite. I just object to the fact that you're trying to characterize your dislike of them based on the fact that they are somehow objectively poorly written.

I don't mind him going, it's just it was really weird how he just handed Katniss an arrow, and the next thing we hear, a few chapters later, is he has ""a fancy job in district two?"" What? How did that even happen? I actually checked the HG wiki for elaboration, but apparently that's all that happened without any backstory on WHY he'd have a fancy job in district 2. It's really lazy writing. 

Sorry, I'm finding it hard to put my thoughts into words here. If I had the books I'd quote a few passages, but I don't. I don't hate simple writing. Often, it's very good. 

For example, I love the way Harry Potter is written. SUPER easy to read, simple, and straightforward. No purple prose because it's written the way a teen boy thinks. 

What I don't like about the Hunger Games is the way Collins inserts a bunch of so-called deep, profound sentences into her novels, because it just reads very forced. I don't mind sparse description. In my own writing (I'm no author; it's just my hobby), I tend to describe characters' looks very sparsely because I don't think it should matter, and I know people often sympathize first with the pretty characters. However, for this subject matter, the description isn't enough. It's about a completely foreign world and, I don't know, it just seems so simple to me. I wish I could quote some passages...

Eh, yeah, the Katniss is annoying was a bad point, I admit. She's all right. However, I don't think she's as ""strong"" or ""badass"" as most people think. Personal opinion though. 

Also, I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but actually, the writing isn't my only qualm about the Hunger Games. I think the storyline also isn't great. The first book was the only interesting one, the second and third one really went downhill, in my opinion. I wish Collins had been a little more creative with her world-building, as well. It just could have been so much better. 

I don't think Collins is as creative or smart as a writer as most people credit her to be. I really don't recall any major twists or ""Oh my god, I can't believe that resulted in that"" moments in the book. Then again, I'm a huge fan of Chekhovs Gun, so I may be biased. Again, this is my opinion. 

If a book had really great style and grammar but a terrible story, I'd call it well-written, but a terrible story. And I wouldn't like that book either :)

To be honest, I think I dislike both the writing and a lot of the plot of HG.

Yes, but they must employ it well to fit a certain function. Form always must meet function or else you haven't written well. For example, Hemingway is a great example of simplified description. He did great things with what little detail he gave. Unfortunately, I don't think that is nearly the case with the Hunger Games.

Tropes are often considered the mark of a hack writer. Tropes that aren't used effectively almost always signal a hack writer.

But the thing is. It is not aimed at that. Young adult isn't written for the complexity. It is written to be an enjoyable read, nothing more. Unlike die-hard readers, most don't notice the things you have problems with. Dan Brown is considered a poor writer here, but his books read like delicious cake and he makes buckets of money off it. The same goes for almost any YA novel. Right now I can only think of his dark materials as actually well written YA.",Nirgilis,2013-02-04T22:51:30Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,23

17vdx4_25,17vdx4,"Ahh, sorry. I thought you were talking about book one for some reason. I think a lot of people complained about the ending of Mockingjay in that some things were wrapped up too neatly and some things weren't wrapped up at all. I know the ending was personally one of my least favorite things, simply because everything seemed so abrupt. But some of my favorite writers tend to suck at endings, so I guess it's easier for me to overlook.

Although, I will say that it doesn't seem that odd to me that Gale would be able to get a nice job in District 2 since the oppressive government has fallen and there's no reason people can't move around and move up in the world now, right? I mean, it would have been nice if it was explained slightly more, but I don't think it's a plot hole or anything like that.

>However, for this subject matter, the description isn't enough. It's about a completely foreign world and, I don't know, it just seems so simple to me.

I just disagree with you is all. And that's okay, I'm fine with disagreeing. I just don't think it's a black-and-white issue. Obviously you would have preferred more description and world-building, but for me she had a good amount, and I didn't have any trouble picturing things or imagining the world. The only thing that I wish had been described a little more was the Capital, but otherwise I thought she did a fine job.

>The first book was the only interesting one, the second and third one really went downhill, in my opinion.

Pretty much everyone agrees with you that the second and third book weren't as good. I agree with you too. I don't think they were *bad*, but certainly not as good.

>I really don't recall any major twists or ""Oh my god, I can't believe that resulted in that"" moments in the book.

There was a twist or two in the last book, mainly [Spoiler](/s ""the circumstances surround Prim's death, the fact that the attack was ordered by Coin, and Gale's possible involvement in it.""). That aside, I can think of a lot of great, classic books that have virtually zero ""twists"".

Like I said, totally cool with you not liking The Hunger Games. You don't have to justify that at all. I don't think they are the best books ever written, for sure. They certainly aren't without flaws. But I think it would be more correct to say you just didn't like the books that much than it would be to say they are bad writing. I think it's getting into dangerous territory to start labeling books we don't like as bad writing.",semperama,2013-02-04T19:15:14Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,25

Maybe because most of the authors probably don't have much experience with oppressive governments (I'm not saying I do, either, except being born and raised in China for a while, I guess, hehe) but none of these books ever seem the least bit realistic to me.

It's called The Dresden Files. It's a mix a noir private dectective stories and supernatural / fantasy set in modern day Chicago. The stories is about a powerful wizard named Harry Dresden who struggles against the supernatural in his city and the fact that he under a potential death sentence for having killed his evil mentor in self-defense.

It is in my humble opinion much superior to The Hunger Games (which I find plenty entertaining too) because it's not formulaic. In book of The Hunger Games trilogy you get the part where she gets her makeover, the part where she competes in the game, etc. but The Dresden Files follow no such structure and will surprise you.

There are 13 books in the series yet and while the first half is really good, it takes an epic turn at the middle and another near the end (and I'm wondering where that one leads because I'm eagerly waiting for the 14th book).

sg6jg9_1,sg6jg9,"I see what you're saying and agree. I think you're talking about blockbuster books that everyone you know read, even people who don't even dig their genre. Here's past examples

- Dan Brown/Robert Langdon
- Millennium trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)

Standalones
- The Fault in Our Stars

sg6jg9_2,sg6jg9,"Yeah, it's been a while since there has been a megahit book series. I think about this sometimes myself, so here's my guess...

The book market in general is so big and broad that it's hard for one series to really stand out and gain mainstream popularity. While individual books might achieve this status sometimes, most people don't read many books and aren't as likely to commit to a whole series.

That string of popular book series in the 2000s-2010s was a fluke. The lull we're in now is the norm. I think what happened is that HP got so big that readers and companies were actively looking for the next big hit book series, which allowed Twilight and later The Hunger Games to get so big. After that, as others have pointed out, the YA market got oversaturated so that even within that market, nothing could really stand out. Fifty Shades managed to become a hit as an adult series, but I don't know much about the erotica market so I can't say why that one got so big.

I'm sure we'll get another megahit book series again someday.",PartyPorpoise,2022-01-31T02:53:49Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

Surprisingly, many of the YA “mega hits” from my youth are still popular. People still love Harry Potter and the Hunger games, just now new generations of young adults are discovering them. 
But there are modern series which are hits too, and are still unfolding. Sarah J. Maas’s Throne of Glass series comes to mind, and her Court series (which is not specifically aimed at YA). Jennifer Armentrout’s Blood and Ash series is also popular, as well as YA series from Victoria Aveyard and others.",lemonfeminine,2022-01-30T23:23:09Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,3
sg6jg9_4,sg6jg9,"I don't know that it's necessarily the BookTube and BookTok phenomenon that's shifting things like this so much as the fact that YA has absolutely *exploded* of late compared to the heyday of Harry Potter, Hunger Games and the like. I can distinctly recall when YA was called ""Teen Fiction"" and tended to be looked at as a mostly schlocky genre for kids who weren't ""mature enough"" to graduate to ""real books"". Harry Potter and Percy Jackson are classified as children's literature most places, and Hunger Games was the more recent cultural explosion when the movies dropped.

The problem is, Hunger Games sparked a whole cultural movement, and in this day and age, that means that everybody and their grandma tried to jump on the wagon. Hot on the heels of Hunger Games, there was a movie of Beautiful Creatures that flopped, and the first Divergent movie came around that time as well to try and scrape up some of the YA dystopia fans that were still hungry for more in between Hunger Games movies, and went on to cancel the last film and then the potential series continuation because there was just a lack of interest. The same year the Hunger Games dropped, we also got a movie of The Mortal Instruments which did not great and went on to get rebooted into a TV series as well.

There was just a glut of YA fantasy and dystopia properties being adapted to film and screen within a very short span of time and it likely led to a lot of burnout by studios and discouraged a lot of them from investing in similar projects because of the bunch precisely *one* became an international sensation, a second tried and just slowly shriveled up and died at great cost to the studio, a third didn't work as a movie and wound up being a middling CW series and a fourth got a film that just absolutely bombed. That's a bit of a turn off for execs, and they call the shots on where the money gets spent. Considering that the last Divergent film was released in 2016 and Shadowhunters ended in early 2019, we've only *just* recently come down off of that particular burst of YA TV and Film properties, with Shadow and Bone just kicking off as a Netflix original. Overall, that gives more than a little pause to the entertainment industry who might pick up one of these series and propel it to greatness in the modern age. I worked in a book store for three years and heard ""I'm waiting for the movie to see if I wanna read the books."" more times than I could count in regards to YA primarily, but also across the board. Younger people these days will jump in and read something if the movie was good and they want more, and when studios are skittish to adapt them, there's just not been anything that's ""blown up"" because there's no upcoming film or series to push it to that level of hype where everyone is reading it and loving it. Harry Potter and Percy Jackson were very lucky to simply attract a ton of readers in the early days of the internet when it still wasn't a guarantee in every home, smart phones weren't a thing and most kids were lucky if they had a cell phone at all. It became a cultural movement that led to it's huge popularity. You're not going to get that kind of all-pervading hype over a single books series in the modern day simply because books alone aren't enough to become a phenomenon, at least among younger people. Brandon Sanderson fans will show you how different that is for the slightly older crowd, but that's a different kettle of fish all-together.

When you combine all of that with the fact that, after this burst of YA properties becoming movies and series that were if not successful then at least *known*, there was a huge ""renaissance"" for the YA genre, shortly after it was rebranded as Young Adult instead of Teen Fiction, it kind of goes a long way to explaining why there hasn't been a singular ""mega-hit"" series since. Combined with the newfound interest and respect for the genre, if somewhat begrudging in some cases, there was an explosion of new books to cater to that audience. When you also consider that publishing is now quite a bit more accessible for authors that are just starting out and even the option of self-publishing being very viable, there's simply too wide of a breadth of books in the YA category to unify that many diverse readers around a single one under current circumstances without an accompanying film or series. There are tons of YA readers who don't care for fantasy/sci-fi, and others who turn their nose up at more realistic fiction. Then you have the further divides of people who like those dystyopian type of stories with a determined protagonist ready to take down the man, and others who prefer fantastical tales of powerful royal scions contending with devious fey creatures, and everything else under the sun that appeals to the minds of readers who enjoy the more drama and action oriented realm of YA reading. If Harry Potter was released today, I don't know that it would have even half the following that it did back in the day, because there'd be a good chunk of younger readers who simply said ""I don't like magic or silly names. I'd rather read about demon hunters who live in a grungy city.""

Honestly, it's just kind of hit the point where a book series, at least in the YA space, can't really become a runaway hit without some studio picking it up to adapt to the screen, and even then a ton of the following will be exclusively for the show and not necessarily the books as well. When combined with the wider range of sub-genres within the category, there's just not a ton of chance that a single series will ever capture the lightning in a bottle that was Harry Potter or Hunger Games. We *might* see a burst of interest and a revival of the Percy Jackson books popularity with the upcoming Disney Plus series, but that remains to be seen, and even then, the whole series is already released and, by all accounts, finished, so we won't be seeing people flooding stores to get the latest book in the series when it drops either. It just feels to me like we've entered an age where mega-hit books simply don't happen, and the best that can be hoped for is a quiet but dedicated fan community online that loves something dearly, knowing full well that it's not for everyone and that they can't expect everyone to have heard of it.",DomLite,2022-01-31T04:40:01Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,4

sg6jg9_7,sg6jg9,"I remember when YA was called ""Teen Fiction"". It was rebranded to YA several years before Hunger Games took off, and around that time I was working in a book store. We previously had just a ""Young Adult"" section, but within the span of the three years I was there during the Hunger Games boom, it was further divided into Young Adult Fiction, Young Adult Sci-Fi/Fantasy and Young Adult Non-Fiction because there's such a wide spread of books in the category, and even within those categories there's a huge span of topics and sub-genres. Sci-Fi could constitute a dystopia like Hunger Games all the way to a zombie apocalypse or space opera, and Fantasy runs the gamut from classic swords and sorcery to dark gothic romance sagas about cursed princesses and their archfey suitors. Standard fiction covers an even wider array from the mundane slice-of-life sort of stories to romance to coming-of-age stories to heavy-hitters that deal with teenage suicide, pregnancy or other such things that are targeted to teens who have dealt with similar problems and want something to relate to. When it's basically become a genre for shorter books with more straight-forward premises than ""standard"" fiction/fantasy it's kind of hard to nail down a specific property that will grab the entire world by the eyeballs and become a runaway sensation like Harry Potter. These days people are a lot more choosy about what they put their time into, and if they don't like magic or silly names then things like Harry Potter are right out, and if they find dystopia dull and boring, Hunger Games isn't the thing for them. Unless someone manages to create some Frankenstein monstrosity series of a magical space opera set in a dystopia (which, upon typing out I realize is *literally* Star Wars...) then I don't think there's gonna be a singular property that snags the attention of the majority of the world, and even if it did, it would likely take a film or TV adaptation of it to get the books into the hands of people, and even then it's not a guarantee that they *would* pick them up to read when they can just watch.

There's a lot of stuff crammed into that genre, and it's just not feasible to expect one specific type of story to capture the entire world's heart like Harry Potter did back in the day.",DomLite,2022-01-31T04:50:16Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,7

As u/topazemrys observes, the 7 Narnia books have also been immensely popular. They have sold sold more than 100 million copies in 47 languages since they were published in the 1950s, so in the last 70 years or so.

The Oz books (the 14 by Frank Baum published between 1900 and 1919, not the 21 sequels by Ruth Plumly Thompson, which I'm not counting) that u/Not_A_Red_Stapler mentions, were also the best-selling books of their day: by the time the copyrights began to expire in the mid-1950s, over 5 million copies had been sold in 8 languages. Obviously, more have been sold in the decades since they moved out of copyright (I can't find newer stats), but the film has eclipsed the books significantly.

16dj9ho_4,16dj9ho,"In a first book, a novel concept can take you far. Once the novelty wears off, does your world building and character writing have enough depth to carry a story for another 2+ books?

Some, like The Hunger Games, pivot and up the stakes. Others like Divergent collapse in on themselves as their thin plots and weak characters run out of room.

Good writers understand that dystopian fiction is not a warning of the future, it’s a critique of the present, and Suzanne Collins tapped into real class strife in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, while Veronica Roth went and said, “Wouldn’t it be crazy if everyone in a place had the same personality? What if someone had more than one personality trait!?!”

Try Scythe by Neal Shusterman. I quite like the idea of a dystopia masquerading as a utopia, and it is probably the most nuanced and interesting take on artificial intelligence and futurism this side of the millennium.

With hunger games, I haven’t read them, but if it’s anything like the movies, the first one was cool because it focused on the hunger games, the rest weren’t as good, my opinion, because they stopped being about the games and instead political rebellion.

When a series draws you in with something and then vastly changes with the next book, it just loses me. Another example of this is Harry Potter, the first 6 books are great, and then the 7th there’s basically no hogwarts, no classes, no fun and adventure, just a gloomy series of events vastly different to the previous books.",alaincastro,2023-09-09T14:48:01Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,13

Sometimes you get a rebuilding period but the stakes aren’t as high and it’s just boring.

If you look at a classic dystopia like brave new world or 1984 you’ll notice the protagonist loses in both and the dystopia remains. Also 1984 was a one off.

People dog on the 2nd and 3rd books, but this is how I see them. 2 was an epilogue of the 1st, and 3 the epilogue of the 2nd. The characters were believable and she is the first heroine I loved in a LONG time; I can't even remember off the top of my head who the last one was. She's strong, independent, and rides a line of being selfish and selfless. 

As much as I love ASOIAF (I finished DwD before Murakami) I enjoyed this series much more. I'm 31 years old and I fucking LOVE this goddamn series. The dystopian feel of the place, the BIG BROTHER aspect of it reminds me of the sci-fi books I read 16 years ago. There's also a shit-ton of references to history and the books of the same genre. For example, there's a Squadron numbered 451, and some of the names of the characters give insight if you look up the etymology of the names.

Let me clarify what I actually said. I don't like books that get popular with people who seldom actually read books. This meaning that ""The Hunger Games"" is probably the only book(s) that they read last year. 

I have found that people who read infrequently are looking for something a lot different in their books than someone who is an avid reader. Most infrequent readers don't want a complex plot or a lot of back story, they just want to get through the book (much like a movie). 

This is all fine, but it isn't what I want in a book. A few years ago I was recommended this really great series about vampires. It was an okay story my overall experience was negative, I would say.

And the rest of the article seems mostly concerned with showing how Hunger Games exemplifies all these flaws, which makes no sense! Hunger Games was huge and made tons of money and four films!

nlzxre_6,nlzxre,"Yeah, I was a bit baffled by the choice to make the Hunger Games the center of her argument, because while a lot of THG's imitators had the problems she described, THG itself consciously upends most of those tropes. Katniss has very little power at all (and knows it), aside from her value as a propaganda piece. The story--very blatantly!--isn't that of ""good guys vs. bad guys,"" or of injustice ending with the takedown of a single leader or regime. Katniss plays very little practical role in taking down the original authoritarian state--in fact, she passes out during the final battle. In the end, she opts out of the ""new regime"" building entirely, after becoming disillusioned with the process. The entire story is about how these kinds of governments break individuals, and how impossible it is to actually escape that, even when the war is over.

And far from not being explicit in its parallels to our real-life society, Collins talked pretty consistently about the parallels--to the way we were sending teenagers off to fight in the Iraq War, how reality TV and our general media circus are used to sanitize terrible things, etc.",anneoftheisland,2021-05-27T19:08:34Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,6

Male or female, it didn't matter. Some were literary snobs, who usually never read YA books, or guys like me who mainly read dark fantasy, sci-fi or horror books. It appealed to everyone. 

Both series were a mega hit around the world but especially Harry Potter. 

My mother even read the Japanese translated version because her other Japanese friends were reading it. Their ages were like 50 to 70s. 

My Japanese co-workers, who spoke English alright but didn't read English that well, loved the books. The writing was accessible enough for them to read and they said it the was first English book they could follow and made them want to read more.  They even got in line at the bookstore for the midnight releases of new Harry Potter books.

This is a good question though.

Twilight takes place in mostly average cities / tourist destinations and isn't anything special about the environment - more the characters in the environment - the vampires.

The hunger games has the capital which is just a futuristic city but are the ""bad guys"" and the districts are ""poor"" rural areas fighting for survival. The arena is just a high tech sphere. The hunger games has a lot of more gore and is essentially a series about war.

Twilight ends with us finding out jacob is going to groom a baby for 18 years until they can be together....

You can put yourself into the wizarding world and have it be ""fun"". If you put yourself into Hunger games - you are either being mistreated and fighting for your life or from the capital and like the sport of kidnapping people and forcing them to kill others. You can always be someone on the inside of the capital feeding the rebels information to help them overthrow but like jesus what are we doing here?

17vjyui_7,17vjyui,"Red Rising series by Pierce Brown is an amazing series - but even though the first book was marketed as YA - I wouldn't consider the series YA (or even the first book for that matter). They are very violent - but really well written with awesome characters, a great plot (with lots of twists and turns), and some fantastic world building.

However, if you're squeamish or don't like violence in books - this series is not for you.

Quick synopsis - in the distant future mankind is divided into classes based on colour. The colour is represented by the colour of the hair and eyes, and by sigils on the hands. There are other differences too - size, build, bone density and muscle mass, number of fingers, implants. The Golds are the ruling class at the top of the pyramid of society, with Reds being the slaves at the bottom (and 12 other colours in between). Also Golds worship all conquers and model their society on ancient Rome - often speaking Latin to each other and having names like Cassius and Octavia.

The first book sets up the world and eventually has a sense of ""The Hunger Games on steroids"". The rest of the series focuses more on the ruling houses and their politics and wars (and back stabs) and feels more like ""Game of Thrones in space"".

Highly recommend. Full of action, tactics, strategy, politics, back stabbing, and so much adrenaline that I just couldn't put the books down.",inderu,2023-11-15T12:24:50Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,7

5axsv0_2,5axsv0,"> Well theres the lottery to decide which kids partake in it.

in BR the lottery is only made to seem to be a lottery. in actuality the government chooses which class will be next to be tossed in. 

>and start scheming to overthrow the government

end of BR the two are trying to run as hard as they can to get away from the government. they even admit it to each other that there is nothing just the two of them can do to stop the 'system' but they could at least live. 

>Battle Royale isn't it a tv show for all of japan like the hunger games is?

it is re-cut after the event, and in most cases the people only see the 'victor'. the residents do not even know if there is a 'game' going on at any given moment in time, they just hear if there is ever a victor. in fact, i think the class the victor is placed in after winning is a guarantee that they will be next to 'compete'. 

HG approaches the kids as cannon fodder, not bothering with explaining much of the kids' backstories. BR focuses specifically on the kids' stories and explains WHY these people choose to kill themselves, and why these choose to kill, and how can a group of friends (and they are friends because they have been classmates since 1st grade) can be driven to kill each other. 

comparing HG and BR is like comparing two murder mysteries and asking why both have a crime in the beginning and a person that focuses on solving the crime and in the end the bad guy is found and the mystery is solved. ",CrazyCatLady108,2016-11-03T18:29:25Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2
nllbpg_1,nllbpg,The first book for me I thought was alright till the end. After I had finished it I was legit mad about it. Didn't even bother picking up the next book. I don't remember exactly what it was but the whole series feels like it was trying to be hunger games but less subtle (if that's even possible) and more teen angst. The Hunger Games could have been terrible books if it wasn't for how well it was written. I think the main reason it's so bad is because Katniss while being the main character is never made into a Mary Sue unlike Triss.,Monst3rP3nguin,2021-05-26T22:44:29Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1

There's more modern ones with female charaters in the same line as the Hunger Games but idk all of them off the top of my head. I read a bunch of them on Amazon.

Sure the main characters are teens, but it's a YA book so what did you honestly expect? and pretty much every YA novel that I've ever read included a romance, so I'm guessing that's something that's in a lot of YA books. 

  The character's lack of emotions, and how the world ended up the way it s, is explained in the last two books. Tris might be a bit mary sueish, but she doesn't succeed at everything easily. in all the books she goes through a lot of traumatic stuff and doesn't come out of it unscathed.

It's same same issue with shonen protagonists, so many of them are just relatable, self-insert characters through which people vicariously experience a shonen power fantasy, like Deku from BNHA. I feel like every discussion of bad dystopian YA novels inevitably goes back to the Hunger Games but I feel like when reading it you're genuinely interested in Katniss as a character.

It's my same complaint with The Hunger Games and some of the random YA books I read in high school, a more talented or mature writer could have taken the base idea and made something great with it, but you have a middling story that made commercial success because it's target audience wasn't really capable of seeing its flaws.",unMuggle,2021-05-26T23:26:54Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,5

nllbpg_8,nllbpg,"I think that the only way to understand the first book of the series is to read the entire series. Let me explain. Btw, this post contains spoilers of the entire series, read at your own risk. This is what I think. So, when this book came out the dystopian worlds with teenagers trying to change everything were all the rage. which is why it's super similar to The Hunger Games and Harry Potter. Veronica Roth did add her own twist to the game, of course, which is why it made this series one of the most popular ones. Answering the questions: Why do humans only have one emotion now? Why does it matter if you have multiple emotions? Well, I read all the books. It was while ago but I did read them entirely and I think this question can only be understood by someone who read the entire series. As I read in an online article: *""The factions were created with the hopes of eliminating future war and violence. It was believed that if each person selects their faction and focuses on the faction's morals everyone will be equal and there will be no conflict""* In other words them being divided into factions was an experiment. When you are divergent it means that you are a normal human being and the people who ruled the faction wanted to stop you from being a human being so their experiment would succeed. Also answering your next question: How did the world get to the state it's in? This is another question that would be answered if you read the rest of the books.  In summary, our main characters found out that they were in an experiment. Chicago, Illinois (which is where they live) is the only place in the world that was divided into factions. When they escaped the wall that surrounded the city they ran into people. The world was kind of destroyed but it looked more abandoned and there were people living on the outside not divided into factions. This was like a Maze Runner type of thing. There were people on the outside of the wall living somewhat human lives and there were people stuck inside of the wall being divided into factions and groomed to only follow one trait. I hope this helps. Also I kind of liked the books. In my defense I read them years ago so maybe now I will have a different opinion.

6m5ubc_1,6m5ubc,"I first read this book when I after the hunger games craze in my age group and it was engrossing and disturbing in the best way. In addition to being well written it was gritty and cruel in ways other dystopias aren't. It almost punishes the readers mind, but it should, the post apocalypse shouldnt be all cheery and bright. My favorite parts of the book were the flashbacks. They truely haunted the younger me but really lets you appreciate the writing, in addition the way he describes the glossy once- molten asphalt is awesome.
Another aspect I loved was the symbolism during the trek south through the appalachians. At one point The Father figure Scavenges for supplies from the Boat Pajaro de Esperanza or Bird of Hope in english, that hails from Tenerife, which by doing some light research was known as the isle del infierno or Island of hell during the 14th and 15th centuries because of the volcanic activity there. Consider further that the Americas were collectively known as the new world and you can interpret it many ways. 1. More litterally: The bird of hope(from the island of hell) has died and being scavenged.
2. The bird of hope fled from the island of hell (the disaster) came to the new (destroyed) world to provide hope (and supplies) to the duo in the story.
And lastly 3. More figuratively(my fav): The bird is a representation of the father. He went through hell to help his son carry the fire (fire is hope) cliche part: and kind of like a pheonix, he rises from his fathers ashes(not litterally i mean death)

e8g1ge_2,e8g1ge,"I love this discussion. I'm 19 as well, and funnily enough, I've been binge-reading the Hunger Games trilogy over Christmas break. 

I first read Hunger Games in fourth grade, and I remember when Catching Fire and Mockingjay came out (I had to beg my mom to take me to Walmart). My Hunger Games stage hit HARD. The soundtracks were my middle school bus anthems, I had the t-shirts, the barbies, etc., my mom had to limit the number of Katniss braids I wore a week to school, I dressed up as her for superhero days, my teachers nicknamed me Katniss. It was bad.

My Percy Jackson phase started in third grade and sustained itself well for the entirety of the original series and I still closely follow that world. Bought a ticket for the Broadway show, etc. 

My Twilight and The Fault in Our Stars phases were milder, but still definitely there. HG and PJ were the most aggressive.  I was not allowed to read Harry Potter.  (So yes, my mom let me read HG in 4th, Twilight in 5th, but not HP in college). 

&#x200B;

I was afraid I'd be disappointed rereading HG, but I LOVE them. I used physical, audio, and ebook versions of Catching Fire all at once to read it as much as possible. They're just plain good, and I firmly believe they'll be classics in a hundred years. 

But the sad thing is, you're right. I've never seen something blow up like these series you mentioned, and they're all aging so much. I'm only 19 and HG being this old makes me feel old! Sure, I've loved books since then, but I've never seen such a wide-spread intergenerational mass-consumption of a series with giant blockbuster films. 

I work in a library too, and there's just not been many series that we need four copies of each book like these mentioned. It is sad. Subscribing to the Book of the Month club has helped me stay on top of the up-and-coming great books. They're new, often debuts, but it seems like all the Goodreads choice awards end up being from BOTM. All I'm saying is that BOTM has good taste, and usually predicts what the ""bigger"" books will be. 

And by ""bigger,"" I mean the books that are popular among readers. Not the general population. 

I would love another wide-swept series like the ones mentioned. But it's been a decade, and I have no idea what it will take to create such delicious madness again.",LanaBoleyn,2019-12-20T16:32:39Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

*The Hunger Games* empowered girls to be independent whereas *Battle Royale* mostly increased the damsel-in-distress stereotype (with the exception of Mitsuko). 

*The Hunger Games* was more about getting to know the main characters, where *Battle Royale* was getting to know the system (it was on a wider, more group-oriented scale, where *The Hunger Games* focused on the individual and the individual's goals).

*Battle Royale* was more realistic, in my mind, when it came to the vivid violence and the apathy from the government. *The Hunger Games* was a lot easier on the characters and people outside of the battleground even helped them out and sympathized with them at the end.

And how dark do you really think humans are? Even gladiators, if the crowd loved them enough, would be pardoned. They were sport stars, much like the tributes, and the crowd loved them. The gladiator crowd did not have some sympathy towards the tributes. Even if you believe that humans are heartless creatures, as you seem to, then many people in the Hunger Games got personal gain by helping a tribute win. Effie, for example, may have been promoted if Katniss and Peeta won. The sponsors won money by betting on the victor. The gamemakers want to keep the capitol citizens entertained, so they will make the games as interesting as they can.

And if we're talking about the tributes being easy on each other, then well they weren't exactly kind to each other. Katniss allied with Rue because Rue reminded Katniss of Prim.

The Hunger Games are a form of entertainment for those in the capital and the closest districts. Its nothing more than bloodsports for entertainment and subjugation. The institute is to teach the top of the golden stock how to rule, subjugate, enslave, conquer, and lead. It allows them to teach their best children how to continue the society without having wars to harden and forge them into killers. They dont needlessly kill each other after the passage. Some may die but it is never the end goal of the school to have one victor on a pile of corpses. Its such an interesting way for the golds to keep their caste on top of the pyramid of the society.

1355ez_2,1355ez,"Thank you for supplying more information about what she's read so that we can help you figure out if HG is appropriate in this case. 

This is a great list of books and based on this alone, I would say yes, definitely.  How she handles the Greek myths will be a big indication of how she would handle the Hunger Games.

Because I think it might give my opinion more weight (although you are welcome to dismiss it), I'm letting you know that I have a degree in English education and have spent the last five years working in independent bookstores reading and recommending books specifically for children and teens.  I also am in a master's program to become a librarian.

Having read the series multiple times and talked to dozens of kids, parents, and teachers about it, I can say that it's a tricky subject for younger readers because it openly shows how destructive government (specifically, authoritative) can be to its people and what individuals are driven to do to defend themselves when life-or-death situations come up.  Many young readers do not understand the history behind such political systems and therefore miss out on the important story behind how it could actually happen.  There is stark socio-economic differences throughout the books, where the main character is poverty-stricken and is forced to ""steal"" from the government land (by hunting) to feed her family.  You can see how there could be a lot of ethical issues there to figure out that might be difficult, but make for great conversation between parent and child.  

Perhaps the hardest thing to handle in the series is how young people are forced by the government to compete with each other for survival in a fabricated arena while being filmed for immediate broadcast to the country.  Their actions and behavior are basically judged by people as they go along, and depending on what happens, they receive gifts or necessary care to help them.  Kids are literally killing other kids, some do it for fun because they are trained to be ruthless victors, and others do it purely out of self-defense because they are afraid and don't want to die.

If she's never seen graphic violence, she won't be imagining anything like you or I would on reading it. 

Also, if we're censoring death and betrayal perhaps we should give Grimm's fairy tales a miss too?  It's a slippery slope to crazy when you censor reading.

The Hunger Games was the first series that high school me became obsessed with and put my all into. I obsessively looked for any little details about the movies as the were shot. I was worried when the director changed after the first movie, but then was relieved after I heard positive things. I watched endless interviews on YouTube. I highlighted in my books. I read favorite parts over and over again. I read each book in just a few days despite being a slow reader and having to take breaks from reading to go to school. This series played a big part into who I am today and I'm so excited for this prequel. My little sister is now about the age I was when I read the books. I'm gonna read the series when she picks them up. (She got them for Christmas and told me she's planning on reading then soon.)Then I'll be reading for the release of this book.

*Leviathan* by Scott Westerfeld This is a fantastic trilogy I just finished. The first book is really good, but the second and third ones are even better.

*Dealing With Dragons* - Patricia C. Wrede - Still one of my all time favourite books. My favourite thing about this book is the heroine. Many books subscribe to the idea that a badass female character has to be masculinized and better than the boys in order to be respected. Princess Cimorene is utterly practical, wears dresses, makes a fantastic cherry jubilee, conjugates Latin verbs and hates that her parents won't let her do anything useful. She's a fantastic role model for a 10 year old girl and remains one of my top five favourite characters to this day. 

Someone already mentioned Tamora Pierce, and I second that. I would say though, that if you're okay with your daughter reading about some mentions of sex, then you can start her off directly with the Alanna quartet. Depending on where you live and what her school's sex ed classes are like, it would also be a good introduction to menstruation. It's mentioned a couple times and and it's good about being very matter of fact about it and how it's perfectly normal. I'm pretty sure I read them around age 10 and I didn't come away scarred. 

One extra note: I recently moved and could only take a couple boxes of books with me while I left the rest in storage. I took the Dealing with Dragons quartet, The Golden Compass and my two favourite quartets by Tamora Pierce: Lioness and The Immortals. Every one of those books is falling apart and I never grow tired of reading them, and I suspect your daughter will feel the same way. 

*Awake and Dreaming* - Kit Pearson. I read this book over and over and over when I was about her age, and it's still one of my favourite books. 

*Invitation to the Game* - Monica Hughes. Sci fi, and a touch like The Hunger Games.

*The Secret Under my Skin* - Janet Mcnaughton. Another really interested sci fi book.

*The Oracle* (*The Oracle Betrayed* if you're in the US) and *Incarceron* by Catherine Fischer. I fell in love with both of these books, though they're very different. Incarceron had one of the coolest settings I'd ever seen. It's a prison that has sentience and can change things about itself, and a group of people who were born there go on a quest to break out of a prison that can literally keep an eye on them at all times. 

*The Thief* - Megan Whalen Turner. A classic YA book everyone should read. 

*Beauty* - Robin McKinley. Robin McKinley does fantastic YA literature. Someone else recommended *The Blue Sword* and The Hero and the Crown* and I can't second that enough.

*A Great and Terrible Beauty* - Libba Bray. This was a HUGE hit a couple years ago. Definitely worth checking out. 

*Dragon's Blood* - Jane Yolen

Every single book by Nancy Farmer. She does fantasy and sci fi and is brilliant at both.

*Journey to the River Sea* by Iva Ibbotson

*Lola and the Boy Next Door* - Stephanie Perkins. It's a sort of continuation from *Anna and the French Kiss* (no actual french kissing, I promise) and I loved it because the main character was utterly and completely unique in a way I loved.

*So You Want to be a Wizard* - Diane Duane. 

*Ella Enchanted* - Gail Carson Levine. Just fantastic. That's all I have to say about this book. 

Okay, that's all I have in me for tonight! I hope you find this list useful, I tried to go for some of the books that are amazing but a little less well known. I hope she enjoys them!

I liked the first book in the trilogy but the other two failed to have as much of an impact. I think this is because she sets up a very interesting setting in the Hunger Games but fails to execute on it effectively in the latter books. The books are quite short so I would recommend reading the first one if you are interested at all in the premise but don't worry if you don't like them you are not missing too much. ,Timonic,2014-11-24T01:41:40Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1

When you put the YA stuff aside the whole Hunger Games trilogy is really challenging stuff for a teenager to digest which is why the tediousness of the narrative is so annoying. But then again I listened to it on an audiobook when I was 30+ so I might be a bit biased. Still compared with the repetitive vapidity of cliche derivatives such as ""divergent"" or whatever the Hunger Games series is something which made a cynical prick like myself go ""wow, that's actually not bad""

4inmvk_2,4inmvk,"I'm a firm believer in knowing the classics. Classic literature, music, movies, television shows, and video games. A foundation of the classics is incredibly important, if for no other reason than they help us understand modern culture. Children should certainly be exposed to the classics, but they should also be encouraged to seek out more contemporary works as well. Because books like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games are going to become classics.

Honestly, the best way to encourage students to read and appreciate the classics is to let them see how much they influence the modern world of pop culture. As they read Romeo and Juliet, have them explore modern stories of star-crossed lovers. As they slog through the (in my opinion over-rated) Scarlet Letter, examine the themes of shame and hypocrisy in modern stories. Compare Lord of the Flies with The Hunger Games, explore classic Greek Mythology while reading Percy Jackson or Harry Potter. Read The Odyssey and then watch 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' Read any classic and then watch an episode of 'The Simpsons' that references it. 

It is a crime to make the Classics a boring obligation. It is ignorance to not understand that the reason they are ""classic"" is because they speak to the human condition in a way that transcends time. That's why modern pop culture is always alluding to these classics, if not outright remaking them.

And it's also the height of ignorance to dismiss modern storytelling. Not only does it potentially discourage students from reading, but it ignores one of the best ways to introduce the classics to children - show them how their favorite modern works are directly influenced by the classics. Any educator who can't understand this isn't worth listening to.",Funandgeeky,2016-05-10T15:10:30Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

I really didn't want to feel sorry for him. And mostly I didn't. From the beginning he seemed stuck up. But with a slight bit of sympathy, so I did warm to him. He genuinely loved Lucky Gray. But he was so snobby to Sejanus and that really annoyed me. Going to his parents expecting them to give him a cash reward. Annoying. He was happy to see him when we was sent away just to get annoyed that he was then looking out for his friend.

I'm the end I was happy with how it was left. I was gutted for Lucy Gray, but happy that I didn't like him in the end. Because then it's not like he had a massive character transformation that came out of nowhere. Throughout the book you had the feeling he thought he was better than everyone. (Or k had the feeling, I cannot speak for others). 

I really liked Tigris. And Coriolanuses love for her was evident. But somewhere down the line it must have gone wrong as she help Katniss in the Hunger Games doesn't she? Could just be with the costume. But I've just fished the films out to re watch!!

And the plant they find, Katniss, and then Katniss in the Hunger Games.... I wonder if she did in fact, Lucy Gray lived and there is some connection there? (Wishful thinking).

kjgcn_1,kjgcn,"Here's what I thought after reading the first two:

>This series is definitely going on the list for my teenage kids. It's got it all -- a strong female protagonist, an oppressive government, an uprising of the oppressed, the real effects of poverty, huge disparity between the classes, the inanity of conspicuous consumption, the barbarity of modern entertainment, the importance of art.

and these were my thoughts after reading the third:

>Let me just say right off the bat that this was the hardest to read in the series. And intentionally so. With the final installment of The Hunger Games, the book which millions of fans were bound to read one way or the other,  Collins was able to finally take her story to the darkest and most significant of places, without worrying about keeping around casual fans for the next book. The Hunger Games was the hook, Catching Fire set it deep, but Mockingjay is where Collins reeled us into the boat, and many readers may just now be realizing what they've bit into.

>Characters do not do what we want them to. Collins leads us to plot points where we expect to see some exciting and violent action take place, and then has the action happen ""off screen,"" or simply abandons the idea altogether to make a point. It's a very effective method -- as if the reader has been running down a hallway chasing a friend, only to turn a corner and smack into a wall. Important people die. Good and evil are so blurred that the reader begins to question whether anyone in the story can rightly be considered a hero. Katniss is deeply flawed. So is Gale. So is Peeta. So is Haymith. Not just flawed as in ""everyone has problems"" -- so imperfect as to be nearly irredeemable. Almost like they're real people, who are really deeply involved in the terrible and violent game of war.

>I'm less surprised that the author had this conclusion in mind, but more surprised that her editors let her carry it out. Only because of the popularity of the first two books would anyone read or talk about this novel, it would not be widely read as a stand alone, but without this third installment, the first two are in danger of being complicit in the human crime that Collins is so concerned with -- the glorification of violence and the misunderstanding of its consequences.

>I think there are going to be a lot of people who do not like this conclusion, or that at least rank this as their least favorite in the series, but in my opinion it is what elevated the story from entertaining teen fare to a significant and important work.

kjgcn_2,kjgcn,"Here are some things in The Hunger Games I found lacking (**spoilers**):

1.  Kat did not have to face the moral dilemma the situation presented.  There was a clear divide between the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", to the point where the ""bad"" were just caricatures.  When Kat had to kill, her hand was always forced as a matter of self defense, it was made clear to the reader that they were bad guys.  This is the easy way out.  At the end, when there are only 2 left and she is finally forced to confront the situation, the author pulls an absurd, cheating ending.

2.  The question of ""who can you trust"" in the arena was glossed over.  Peeta is a mindlessly loyal puppy dog, and Rue is the innocent little girl- their motives are never ever an issue.  The paranoia the games create is so interesting, yet its not even there.  The author does a much better job of including this aspect in the 2nd book, and to be honest is the only reason why I finished the 2nd book. 

3. Most of the arena contestants had absolutely no personality or backstory, and when they died there was zero emotional connection.  In Battle Royale, the reader learned about virtually every character, and that made it so much more interesting.  Why should I care that faceless badguy #12 died?   As a side point, alot of the tension just isn't there since theres never any doubt that Kat survives since its part of a trilogy...though I don't think theres anything the author could have done to fix this. Even the 3rd book, I highly doubted Kat would die because its all written from first person, so it would have been very literarily awkward.

4.  Was a sappy love triangle really necessary?  I get that its a YA book and those love triangles are popular, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about their love problems.  

All these issues were addressed in Battle Royale.  BR is far from perfect (HG does a much better job creating the dystopian society), but it did such a better job at the whole ""games"" aspect.  I will say that HG did a fantastic job of ending each chapter on a cliffhanger.  In the end, I found that the biggest overall problem with the series was that it is a Young Adult book, for a situation that is better explored in a non-YA book.

qtjnm_1,qtjnm,"I've read both the Hunger Games series and Battle Royale, and loved both of them. One may argue it's a ""rip off"" of Battle Royale, but it's actually something more. It's taking an idea and going deeper with it, pushing it further and making it the author's own story, not just a ""rip-off"". It's the same idea (kids battling to the death for, in essence, the amusement of the controlling government) but both take it in extremely different directions (although the whole battle idea may be similar). And also, what writer nowadays doesn't ""stand on the shoulders of giants"", so to speak? Not all zombie books are a rip-off of other zombie books, while they mostly have similar aspects (strange outbreak, world shuts down, survivors trying to survivor, horrific acts of humans pushed to the end). Most fantasy novels have seemingly parallel worlds, or at least themes within those worlds. It doesn't make them a rip off, it makes them the expansion of an idea that captures the hearts and souls of readers around the globe. It's the reinterpretation and revival of ideas and stories, both old and new, that makes books what they are. 

EDIT: Also, don't worry about investing a lot of time in the Hunger Games; they're generally very quick reads. My friend just read the first one a few days ago and it took her about 3 hours. That's the same for a lot of people (like 3-6 hours per book). That's not to say you have to race to meet that time constraint, by all means read at your own pace, but I'm just trying to give some positive reinforcement in favor of reading them; that even if you're a slow reader they probably won't take up an extreme amount of time, which seems to be one of your concerns.

With BR, you kinda get the bigger picture, with the narrative sweeping around and catching little vignettes of how the other students on the island are faring. Makes it a little more effective in my mind because you get to know a few people outside of the main characters pretty well.

It's been a good while since I read it, but I think Takami also did a really great job with making sure we never forgot that ultimately we're dealing with kids. Some try and work together, some profess their love for their high school crush, and others take the whole ""kill your classmates"" thing pretty well. I think that's what really sold it and made it a little more terrifying as it went on.

r5qop_1,r5qop,"I feel the book is lacking in pretty much all matters. Collins treats death as if it were a piece of bread. None of the characters seem to care that they just murdered someone. These people aren't adults they're kids. They just killed other kids, and then they are like "" Oh shucks Johnny, I just killed another kid my age, whoops!"". On top of that the book doesn't even get to the actual games untill 2/3rds of the way through the book. Even then the main character just hides in a cave, and then both she, and the writer, forces a dull romance. Then After the actual game the character whines about this romance, even though she just won the hunger games, and killed other kids in similar situations to her. Now we're in the sequel which is just a copy of the first book, and the ""Amazing cliff-hanger at the end"" takes an entire chapter to explain, and then looses all significance and meaning.
**TL;DR:** Collins doesn't understand the significance of war, and murder.  
The books are just a cop out for cash, and the movies even further so because kids have a lack of imagination. Sorry for side tracking the conversation. ",smurfsithlord,2012-03-20T23:59:15Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1

jwsp3_2,jwsp3,"First off, I have read all of ""Harry Potter"" but in no way think it is flawless work, though I enjoyed it. ""Twilight"" I despise for several reasons, but this series I think does some things VERY well. The author keeps her events and her systems, particularly the way the society is run and how the games are structured, excellently described and planned. That's why I have been gripped by the books. However, her characters have fallen into a series of YA cliches and it's depressing.

Now, in certain points, I agree. We have become increasingly desensitized to violence and tragedy and I think this is why such literature becomes so popular- on some morbid level, humanity is fascinated by bloodshed. The people in the books who revel in watching the Hunger Games reflect that part of ourselves. Look at the Roman Coliseum. Even now we have entertainment where men beat the daylights out of each other, people drive cars recklessly and sometimes explode, and our news media is always filled with murder, rape, war and destruction. 

But there are some things that will NEVER be accepted. Killing children, rape, pedophilia, necrophilia, etc.

selzg_1,selzg,"As much as I dislike Orson Scott Card as a person, I have to say he has a point. 

Maybe it isn't fair to pick on a ""young adult book"" for something like this, but the setting of the hunger games was definitely the biggest flaw in the story. 

The entire USA has been reduced to 12 colonies... each with apparently about 1,000 people, and one city. Each colony specializes in producing one product or industry. And it goes on from there. 

You get the feeling of a stripped and empty landscape (not like a wasteland, but like the author couldn't be bothered). It comes across as contrived and childish, as though created by someone who has no idea how the world really works. 

Of course, that was exactly the point, the author didn't bother with it, the setting wasn't the focus of the story.

selzg_2,selzg,"I think you might be misunderstanding what he meant by ""believable."" 

I don't think it was so much how ""realistic"" the world was or how ""plausible"" it was, but rather the detail and depth of the setting.

The setting of the Hunger Games is slapped together with duct tape and glue. Its paper thin and it shows. The entire world feels like it has about 1,000 people left in it. Each district conducts one industry. There is no real mention of the rest of the world. It comes across like something a child might brainstorm up... someone with no idea of how the real world works. No complexity. 

Of course, the real reason is probably just that the author didn't want to bother with such matters. The setting is really just an excuse to have bad people putting kids into a ring to fight to the death. The focus is elsewhere. Of course, that doesn't mean the weak setting doesn't hurt the story. It was easily my biggest issue as well, constantly pulling me out of the book.

I think that first person present has the potential to rob writing of good descriptions, but the immediacy, for me at least, makes up for the lack of imagery. I think that for the type of story in the Hunger Games, Katniss' perspective **is** the story. Her confusion over her two love interests; her horror and yet calm acceptance at the killing forced upon her; the conflict between how she views herself and how others view her; all these things seem more powerful in light of the narrative voice.

However, I can't think of other books that have used this voice/tense. Perhaps I avoided them outright, or perhaps I didn't even notice. The story, if it's engaging enough, should be able to overcome technical aspects. 

What voice/tense would you have preferred? Close third/past?

The article is talking about what the Hunger Games says about values.  The article is saying that the Hunger Games is saying that archetypically/stereotypically feminine values are decadent.  The article is more about society's values and less about individual's choices- society's greater arc is at stake here, no one cares particularly about how Katniss ends up living her life.  

The understanding that I got from the article was that the author is saying that we can't just have the stereotypically/archetypically masculine values of heroism, stoic resolve, proficiency at combat, but we also need ""possible alternatives – love, children, even just wearing pretty clothes"".

Firstly the formulation occurred to me as a bit gender essentialist, but perhaps it is defensible, also we are talking about archetypes in culture, no one said anything about nature yet.  Secondly, what are the arguments for or against this kind of value choice that the author argues for?

If it was a good night and the dreams were good, you might think you were a fashion designer in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  If it was a bad trip, welcome to House of Leaves.  All in all, as life moved on to the new millennium we began to realize that things would be more like The Hunger games; an Infinite Jest of disappointment, a Kafka on the Shore mind bender.  We turned out to be as unreliable as the narrator in Lolita and ruled by Sauron like people from Lord of the Rings.  There would be no magical Name of the Wind cures.  The future looked more like a Lovecraft Necronomicon or a tour down the Road with McCarthy.  The farther into the future we looked the more we saw Slaughterhouse V; winter is coming like in A Song of Ice and Fire.

21tptd_6,21tptd,"1984 is my least favorite Orwell book.
Almost none of my friends know Fight Club was a book.
I liked the Harry Potter movies more than the book.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the only really funny movie I've read, and I like it more than other ones.
The Hunger Games is really bad, I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters, and I was put off by the incomplete sentences despite there being plenty in Fight Club.
Lord of the Rings was too hard to get into, and I don't recommend it to anyone.

vrd355_4,vrd355,"The movie did not portray well the origin villain story of Snow. I feel like the movie was more about the origin of the Hunger Games than that of Snow. In the last part, Snow snitches on his friend but the intention wasn't to get him killed but to stop him from harming Snow too in the process. Snow already thought that the friend would be find with his father's money but eventually he never anticipated that if there were deaths the father's money wouldn't do much for his friend, and sadly when he sent the record, the deaths have not yet happened. How did this alone contributed to Snow becoming villain?! How did this contribute to him going from a boy with no money but just a big name and ambition trying to make it to a university to a maniacal that wanted the continuation of a deadly game? When Snow proposed to make Hunger Games more appealing to the public, all he had in mind was to save Lucy; not to keep the game going; the movie had already established that first, but then the movie kept making references to that being just Snow trying to keep Hunger Games going... there's no stability there. And then you have Lucy that just switched from being in love with Snow to completely not trusting him over some vague reasons without proofs. She literally started attacking him without even talking to him or making it clear if he had done anything and the movie neither doesn't make it clear what are the doubts that Lucy have against Snow... The whole breaking point between Lucy and Snow in order to make Snow become bad had absolutely no foundation and so made no sense. They didn't build enough tension or doubts for the shift it took. Plus, Snow just went from loving Lucy to wanting to kill her because he ""thought"" she was trying to kill her; not even wanting to communicate or anything... like?!?! Is it just that easy to simply go hunt and kill your love one when your whole personality was built differently?! They made Snow too soft for such shift that he took in the end. Also, why he even think that Lucy was going to tell anyone about the gun if he knew that Lucy knew if she had said anything about it, it would also cost her to be hanged too?! Like?!? Movie went for a huge drama between the characters that they did not build enough for since their whole focus was particularly on the games.",Lisa200117,2023-12-20T04:26:33Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,4

I always liked Battle Royale, It set you up thinking only one would make it out, and suprised you.  I also found its supporting roles much better.  

I realize in the Hunger games they had a better idea of what was going on, but still Battle Royale at least for me created much more suspense and emotion than the Hunger Games did.",phoenix_kitty,2013-03-26T21:56:53Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1

rc1pk_1,rc1pk,"I wanted to comment about the last sentence, despite having not read *The Hunger Games*. From how you describe it, it sounds significantly more like anti-racism than racism. It isn't racist to acknowledge that racist things have and do occur, nor does it mean an author is racist when they write racist characters or situations. *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*, for example, is commonly mistaken by people to be a racist book, largely due to the frequent use of the word ""nigger""—however, in reality, it was written as a very deliberate anti-racist book, in a time when racism was commonplace and accepted by most.

So I would say that you are very correct in interpreting this to be a reference to slavery in *The Hunger Games*, and that it was put there by the author to give more background into the wrongdoings of people in authority in the dystopian setting of the novel, rather than endorsing slavery and racism (which I know you didn't say, I think I'm just saying the same thing as you did in a slightly different way).",LoganCale,2012-03-25T00:25:50Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
ranbt_1,ranbt,"Wiki can:

> The Hunger Games is a young adult novel written by Suzanne Collins. It was first published on September 14, 2008, by Scholastic, in hardcover.[1] It is written in the voice of sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in a post-apocalyptic world in the country of Panem where the countries of North America once existed. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, holds absolute power over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games are an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 from each of the 12 districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle in which only one person can survive.

As to why it's so popular, I recently read it and I have no idea.  I've been reluctant to read any YA books up until then, and now I know why.  ",camopdude,2012-03-23T22:51:18Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1

I would recommend you keep reading, considering that Collins builds an interesting world, and does a good job with the action sequences in my mind.

w19mwq_1,w19mwq,"I have to say that, having grown up and looking back on The Hunger Games, I don't really like Katniss (as a person) all that much in the first book. Of course, she had moments of substance, but she seems bratty to me now, shallow and indecisive and sometimes gushy. But that's exactly what makes her work as a character. From the beginning of the first book to the end of it, she already saw a huge amount of growth, and that only continued to expand as the series progressed. By the end of the series, she was an entirely different person (obviously the point), but I think Collins did an especially good job of highlighting that change by making Katniss a little frustrating in the first book. It really made her quite an interesting character: matured by her financial situation and her life in general, but not *too* matured; emotionally a bit awkward and stubborn; the little kid in her unable to resist the liveliness of the Capitol despite how much she hates it; and the best part to me is that although she grew so, so much, she was still learning even at the end. Learning that Coin couldn't be trusted, trusting her gut, learning her boundaries, learning to communicate, and more.

My only recent experience (I'm 26) with YA novels is the Harry Potter series, which sure, ain't Steinbeck, is at least full of complicated characters, a stirring plot, and both over-arcing and episodic conflicts.

I absolutely agree with your assessment of the Hunger Games. The characters beyond Peeta and Katniss are at best one-dimensional. Why are we supposed to care about Rue? Other than that she's the only contestant from outside District 12 we get to know.
The veracity of the world she creates is a little creaky, as well. The capitol displays extraordinary wealth, and the entire society seems geared around a week-long celebration. What do they do for the other 51 weeks of the year? What's the point of keeping the districts so poor?

I feel transitions between scenes were not written properly and the flow of the overall book was lacking. I think if the book was writing for a more adult audience than a young adult audience the book would have been better. The book should have been twice as long.,whyyougottabesomean,2012-02-04T08:52:28Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
pa8da_2,pa8da,"There are too many awesome books to just pick one... I'll narrow it down by what popped into my head first. Note: these books are not anything like The Hunger Games.

[Cosmic Trigger II](http://www.rawilson.com/trigger2.html) by Robert Anton Wilson.

For fiction.. The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera.",BettyMcBitterpants,2012-02-04T22:10:01Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

pa8da_4,pa8da,"I do read! I'm actually still in high school, so it's hard to get reccomendations from peers. I'm not some fan girl for the Hunger Games haha, it's just the story was really cool. The rebellion, seeing how awful people can be, living in poverty etc. It made for a good read. So I posted here, looking for a similar experience, but still wanting to expand my horizons! I don't just read young adult, I really liked 1984, and Animal Farm by George Orwell, who's turned into my favorite author. I read all of my brothers English 12 novels in my spare time (ie, Animal Farm, Lord Of the Flies, Of Mice And Men, and so on) point is, I don't want people thinking I'm looking for another series to get into, only to be swept up in the hype. Sorry I had to reply to your post, it just seemed most fitting to the point I wanted to get across :). (and sorry if it's all rambled, I'm on a mobile phone, hard to lay my thoughts out haha)",triceratops3,2012-02-05T02:57:15Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,4

nrjw8_1,nrjw8,"The Road is a crushingly depressing book about fatherhood, has a unique punctuation scheme that infuriates a lot of young readers/people who aren't interested in more 'experimental' literature, and sometimes strays into iambic pentameter. It is reasonable, not pretentious, to warn someone who considers the Hunger Games the apex of hauntingness that they might not enjoy The Road.",Facewizard,2011-12-27T05:16:22Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
nrjw8_2,nrjw8,"Generally I find that watching the movie first ruins the book, because I can't create the characters. I think all the Hunger Games characters look wrong in the movie. Best example: A Scanner Darkly, the book was made strange by imagining Keanu Reeves and Woody Harrelson",kkurbs,2011-12-26T23:16:54Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,2

No, I'm not saying that the Thai military is the government in HG, simply that the use of the three-finger protest, which those using have stated to be taken from the books, may be being used because of the connotations it carries.  Again, not that those connotations are true, simply that the protesters are using them as a tool of protest. ",PM_ME_YOUR_EYESMILE,2014-06-07T22:32:16Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Hunger Games,1
