dzgebv_1,dzgebv,"So, I didn't like Eragon. I really tried to, but it didn't click for me.

But I one time, I made the mistake several years ago of taking shit about it on reddit and then who should respond to my comment but Chris Paolini himself! He was super cool about it and basically fully acknowledged that it wasn't very good, but reminded me that he wrote it when he was 15.

I felt like the world's biggest douchebag and cowardly deleted my comment, which I wish I hadn't done in retrospect. I might not have enjoyed his most popular book, but Paolini himself is a cool dude and I have huge respect for anyone who can publicly acknowledge something like that. He also still interacts with the fans of the Inheritance Cycle, which is really cool knowing that he's otherwise outgrown it.

I'm excited. I read the first book when I was in the 8th grade (I'm 29 now) and I love the series. I eagerly awaited the next book after flying through a new release. I recognize that it isn't exactly original writing and that it has plenty of faults but it was always fun to read and expect this new book to be the same.",wene324,2019-11-21T15:31:08Z,1,1.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,3

For me eragons problem was not the writing (cause I read it in middle school) but that he borrowed so much from other series without much attempt to hide it. All fantasy borrows to an extent but paolini straight up used the same names and ideas. It's basically like reading lotr combined with wheel of time,  star wars, and the belgariad.

From the Wiki:

Eragon received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having ""clichéd descriptions"", ""B-movie dialogue"", ""awkward and gangly prose."" However, she concluded the review by noting that ""for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent"".[12] School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon ""sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations"".[13] Common Sense Media called Eragon's dialogue ""long-winded"" and ""clichéd"", with a plot ""straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there.""",that_one_guy_with_th,2019-11-21T17:17:56Z,3,3.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,20

 It’s a rewrite of the eragon series- it focuses on the lore/magic of the world while bringing a truly unique perspective to medieval fantasy that I’ve never seen before. 

To put it plainly, it’s good. Really fucking good.

He's about my age and I was always in awe that he could take on such a ask and write a coherent book.

I'm very intrigued with what this new story/saga. For me, Eragon and the others were great because you can totally follow along the story and not feel lost. It was engaging and entertaining. In fact, I should read it again sometime.

dzgebv_61,dzgebv,"I mean, bits and pieces of the series were really good! Like the Seithr oil subplot from the beginning of book 1:

* Brom tells Eragon about the chemical used to torture Eragon's aunt and uncle before killing them. In its natural form, Seithr oil is used by jewlers to polish gems, but if enchanted with a blood sacrifice, it becomes an incredibly caustic poison sought after by assassins.

* Eragon gets the idea to track down his family's killers by sneaking into the shipping records of a port city to see if any orders for the jewlers' version of the oil seem suspicious, and Brom wonders why he never thought of this before when he'd previously hunted down assassins who'd used the caustic version.

As a **plot** development, this certainly couldn't form the basis for an entire mystery storyline without adding a whole bunch of extra steps, but as a sub-plot in the middle of a book where other things are happening, this is a pretty good one :)

But more importantly, as a **world-building** element, this is astonishing :D The real world has plenty of things like Draino and aluminum foil that are harmless in their intended purpose, yet dangerous – or even deadly – if used differently (deliberately or ignorantly), but how many times has this been used for fleshing out a piece of phlebotinum in a SciFi/Fantasy story?",Simpson17866,2019-11-21T20:45:17Z,1,1.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,61

Eragon did such a great job of being this naive young man's introduction to this world, Eldest was this great story of him coming into confidence and personal strength, so by the time Brisingr rolled around I was ready for it to be the climax of the story, and honestly it really read like a climax in that in a Return of the King sort of way...but then it just didn't end, the battle didn't really matter, the evil king was still waiting in the next castle.

A friend of mine gave to me Eragon. I read it in less than one week. It was just so engaging and made me feel inside the book. I'm not a expert by any means. But i really like Eragon. I have so many good memories of me reading that book, on the places i used to read. I have even read it multiple times when i was waiting the next release.

I can relate as a kid who grew up in a rural farming community.  In fairness, I bought a copy of his book from HIM at a renaissance faire in the late 90s,  one of the ones his family published and he was walking around selling out of his backpack,  so I've only ever read his home-published version that never saw a professional editor so maybe it was better afterwards.",Farlandan,2019-11-21T22:51:10Z,0,0.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,75

Growing up, I was this nerdy little homeschooled kid who lived in imagination overload because my home life royally sucked. Paolini was my hero. A 15 year old boy, homeschooled, published this awesome book and got international's acclaim for it? Maybe I could be like that! A lot of his stylistic choices I want to say influenced my early years of writing (for better or for worse. I'd like to say for the better). Nowadays I prefer to teach rather than practice myself, but still turn to Eragon as a prime example of world-building versus more common ones like Tolkein.

In hindsight, was it the best book series? Not at all. It dragged in places. I disliked the ending. I feel like Brisingr as a novel was superfluous to the series. But it gave me light and life in a really difficult time and gave me a hobby that helped me cope.

dzgebv_81,dzgebv,"So I had to look up the timelines so I could be accurate. Eragon came out, self-published, way back in 2001. Then got republished back from in 2003. I remember reading it back when I was in middle school. Say 2007, 2008. I would have been 12 or 13. I remember one of my friends, reading the book, and he told me his older brother read it. And he told me the author wrote it when he was 15. That's what first got me seriously interested. I'd had caught up with Harry Potter by that time. That means I'd had read Goblet of Fire, Order of Phoenix, and Half-Blood Prince. Read more Nancy Drew than I care to admit, and a decent bit of the Hardy Boys, found a few Sherlock Holmes. Anything Rick Riodan were the hot potatoes in my social circles. The Edge Chronical were plentiful, and of a good length to knock out in a weekend. Any Artemis Fowl book was good for the light reading of the day time. Animorphs or Goosebumps also could the lunch break, or study period gap. You get the idea, I spent more time reading, than eating. The Bartimaeus sequence was a recently new find, that had a good chunk to bite into. Something that actually satiated my appetite. Made me slow down a bit when I chewed. A decent book with a texture to the characters. The plotline was driven by more than one desire. Inkheart scratched similar itches. I've read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tangerine for English class. I could put in the work to finish something. If I wasn't enjoying what I read. That didn't matter. What mattered was that I finished the story. So I'm I'm sitting there, listening to my friend, tell me about this book, a 15 year old wrote. How it's a fantasy, with dragons, and people who could ride them. There's supernatural enemies too, with magic, elves, and sword fighting. Naturally, I listened politely at his enthusiasm. Inwardly, I was skeptical, cause while I agree, all of those elements were cool; I didn't think I could write a story at 15, I'd want to read at 13. I needed to know more stuff, right? To even just make a story that's worth someone else's time. So I'm eye-ing his book, estimating it might take me a week. Maybe a weekend too, if I was lazy with it, or focusing on other books. When he was done with it, I'd give it a shot. He finishes it, and lets me borrow it. I'm pretty sure I got in on a Tuesday. I gave it back Thursday. Within the next month I had my own copy. Since then I've kept up with the releases of the Inheritance Cycle. I'm ever thankful for Christopher Paolini, for proving me wrong. For showing me with keen imagination that a piece of art, worth spending some time on, can be made by a 15 year old. That it doesn't take an adult, with decades of experience to rely on, to make a book worth reading. I'm super excited to read something of his again. Having grown more into a palate sci-fi with Herbert, Asimov, Stephenson, and ~~His-name-who-shall-ever-be-forgotten~~ ^^orson ^^scott ^^card too; I expect Paolini to bless us with a wonderful read to grace our shelves with. Or add to our e-book collections. Who cares how you do it, its just reading.

dzgebv_112,dzgebv,"There's lots of little scenes and conversations where Eragon is feeling down and saying that everything they went through in the last book wasn't really worth it, that the good experiences they had don't make up for all the suffering.

There's a subplot about him facing the fact that he will have to fight lots of soldiers to stop Galbatorix, soldiers who are mostly regular dudes that just there because they had no other option.

You know, just the general tone, it questions many things that were glossed over in Eragon.

And then it comes, my favourite conversation in the history of literature, and I mean it.

The Elves are having a festival they celebrate once every 100 years, every citizen and guest (like Eragon) is expected to bring something they have created, and to show it in front of the whole city. Some people bring artistic creations, other's make a performance, smiths make cool weapons or jewelry, you get it.

And Eragon doesn't have a single clue about what the heck to do, because he's just the kid who found the dragon egg, and all these elves are far better than him at everything. So he writes a poem that's not meant to compete in quality, but to explain what being ""The Chosen One"" has meant to him, and he writes it in the language of magic, which means he can only speak the words if he thinks they are true. He shows the poem to his master, and asks him to give his honest opinion.

He says it's kinda bad. Like, you know, readable, just meh. But he also says that Eragon is telling something that matters to him, a story that is very real and very true, something that's personal, something that other people can relate to, and there is another type of value in that.

And when I was a dumb teenager reading dumb fantasy stories, I read this chapter and thought, ""hey, this isn't just some story with made up characters, this is a story made by a human person who is trying to talk to me, another human person, and uses this story to connect on a personal level.""

The actual poem is in the book too, it's exactly as bad as you can imagine. But every time I'm writing something and I feel it's all for nothing, I think about that stupid and shitty poem, I imagine Paolini thinking: ""yep, this is happening, I'm actually writing the fucking poem to make the point clear"" and going through every version, trying to make it just a lil better until he does something that might not be ""good enough"", but is the best he can do, something that matters because the point he is making really really REALLY matters to him.

And it helps. It doesn't solve everything because writing is hard and I'm not any good at it, but it helps. And I enjoy doing it, and sometimes people enjoy the stories I share with them.

I think this should be required reading for basically anyone involving themselves in competition of any sort, be it Street Fighter or competing for market share and readership among fantasy authors.

He didn't try to do something fundamentally new. He didn't write to impress or to sound erudite. What he did was ""cheap"", which earned him a lot of ire because it actually worked.

dzgebv_123,dzgebv,"This. Too many authors are cautious to fully define a magic system, because people will pick it apart and find any and every loophole. It has to make sense to its core if your going to break it way down. Harry Potter doesnt have to explain it further than magic words, make magic spell, and they even show that its not a scientific art for most wizards because they end up hurting/maiming/killing others/themselves while creating new magics.

But Eragon did such a good job of explaining the magic, that it really turned into a science of energy manipulation. Conversion of energy to make one thing into another, to focus light through water to make fire, it was just moving energy around and Paolini did a great job of keeping it mysterious and vague early on, and then expanding upon it across 3 more books til it was a full and robust system, with logic to how stuff was structured and how the magic even came to be. Even down to the telepathy/affecting others minds. Because of their ability to manipulate magic/energy, they just pushed their consciousness outside themselves to touch another mind/energy.

Wise old man has sword belonging to farm boy's father (anakin's lightsaber/zar'roc) and passes it down to farm boy. Turns out wise old man had connection to farm boy's father (anakin/morzan).

Farm boy rescues princess (arya/leia) and then seeks to join hidden rebel forces (Varden/Rebel Alliance). Farm boy is instrumental in victory at yhe end of first installment (destroying death star/killing durza). It was nice that eragon would have died here had it not been for arya/saphira.

dzgebv_129,dzgebv,"Sure.

Eragon and the rebel army keep conquering city after city, they have to, if they want to reach Galbatorix's (the main bad guy) fortress, because they need to keep the supply lines safe. Most of the time they are at a disadvantage, and they need to keep their army mostly intact for the final fight, so they have to get original to storm the cities, for example, sending a small squad to infiltrate from a secret tunnel only Dwarves know to open the city gates. They also have to figure out how they are actually going to defeat Galbatorix himself, cause he has trapped the Eldunari's (basically souls) of most dragons that died during the last war, and drains lots of magic power from them.

While they are celebrating they conquered the last city before his fortress, Nasuada (rebel leader) gets kidnapped by Murtagh (Eragon's half brother, who is also a dragon rider and serves Galbatorix because he knows his ""true name"" in magic language, so he is forced to obey). Galbatorix begins to torture fer, to either force her to make her troops surrender, or to learn her ""true name"". I like the books but this subplot is pretty bad.

Eragon puts some prophecies and legends he knows together, and learns that the abandoned island with the fortress of the old Dragon Riders might have a secret weapon to use against Galbatorix. So he, Shapira, and Glaedr's eldunari (their dragon master) go there. They go to the island (which has super cool creatures that are inspired on obscure european mithology) and find out some Dragon Riders managed to hide lots of dragon eggs and eldunari, then deleted those memories from their own minds, so nobody would find out.

All the rebels group, and they put together three different plans to take down Galbatorix, using everything they have. Both armies begin to fight, and they try to sneak in and kill Galbatorix using invisibility spells, but their magic begins to fail for no apparent reason, yet nobody attacks them.

They reach the throne room where Galbatorix and Murthag await, and Galbatorix explains that he hasn't exactly been sitting in the throne, he has found the ""true name"" of Magic, which means he controls magic, he can literally rewrite all the rules, and do whatever he wants, but his control isn't perfect yet. He strips everyone of their powers, which makes all their plans useles, and forces Eragon and Murthag fight for his amusement.

Eragon tricks Murthag by letting him cut him, but then wins the fight by attacking while Murthag realizes he is exposed, Murthag admits that he was always the better of two because he was willing to make sacrifices, and that he has changed as a person by watching him.

That means his ""true name"", his ""true self"" has changed too, so Galbatorix no longer controls him. He uses the true name of magic to give everyone their power back, and tries to attack Galbatorix, but he the king reacts in time, and his defenses are just too much to handle. The rest of allies jump in, and they begin to attack Galbatorix with everything they have.

But... it's not enough, no matter what they use, no matter how hard they try, it's not fucking enough, he's way too strong, there's no way they can win. And as Eragon realizes they have lost, that every sacrifice was for nothing, he thinks on all the people that were counting on him, and he wishes that Galbatorix understood that too. So he tries one last magic spell, one that will make Galbatorix understand everything he did, and experience every emotion he has ever caused, good and bad.

It's not a real attack, it's just an attemp to communicate, but Galbatorix would never conceive being held accountable for his actions, or empatizing with anyone, and he didn't set up defenses for that kind of spell, so it goes through, and it's too much for him too handle, because he has done far more bad than good, and he blows himself up with magic to stop felling all of that pain.

Then everyone is happy, and all goes well, except the country has been devastated by war, and the high degree of militarization and rebellion has encouraged every small lord or count to pillage and install their own small dictatorships, and everyone is demading compesations, and... Nasuada tries to solve those problems, but it's.. hard, really fucking hard, and it would all be so much easier if Eragon just went there, overpowered every army with his magic and dragon, and stopped every rebel mage with the true name of magic.

But that's exactly what Galbatorix was doing, and they both know it. So Nasuada tries to keep solving the problems the hard way, and Eragon flies away from the country to avoid the temptation of thinking he has THE RIGHT SOLUTION and to not meddle with government, but promises to teach all the future dragon riders that want to, once the dragon eggs begin to hatch.

dzgebv_139,dzgebv,"It actually isn't.

It is much, much more closely pulled from David Eddings, who was very upfront that he (Eddings) was following the same Hero's Journey formula that was used for Star Wars (you realize that Lucas has stated many times that he was just doing that formula, right? A New Hope was far from the first to do it, and won't be the last).

One minor character's name is Garath. A major character in the Belgariad by Eddings is Belgarath, who was born Garath.

The ""will and the word"" is literally a straight dump from the Belgariad. The only difference was the ""true name"" thing which was done much better several decades earlier by Le Guin in the masterpiece that is the Earthsea novels.

Brom is literally Belgarath with a new name. Almost exactly the same character, with only minor differences in backstory that are made to specifically fit Paolini's cookie cutter world which is a pretty obvious blend of Brooks' Shannara and Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

The Elves retreating to hidden forests that no one can seem to find unless they want them to? Done first by Tolkien and (many say incredibly derivatively) then by Brooks in the original Shannara trilogy (which is an even more beat-for-beat copy by Paolini).

Dwarves? Again, Tolkien and Brooks. Almost beat-for-beat.

Coming age of mankind? Tolkien and Brooks.

God-like being to destroy with whom the old mentor has a very personal relationship with? Sure, Star Wars, but much more similarly from Eddings' Belgariad (note that Phantom Menace was only a couple years old and Clone Wars was released around the same time).

Eragon is a farm boy orphan who has a white mark on his hand that marks his magical powers? So is Garion, the protagonist in the Belgariad. >!Brom is Eragon's father? Surprise! Belgarath is Garion's great--------great grandfather and they all come from the same family of guardian sorcerers chosen by a god to protect and serve!!<

The existence of a Mentor for example is not evidence that one copied the other, but evidence that they both have the hero's journey structure. It's the details of the mentor that will make things different. If Obi-wan and Brom have similar personalities and back stories, that's a better argument to make.

Likewise, the Death Star Plans and the Egg are typical forms of magical assistance that are pretty standard in the Hero's Journey, just like the Ring in LOTR. What would make the dragon a copy is if the Egg and the Death Star plans are used similarly in the details of their plot. Like if inside the egg instead of a dragon, its the plans to the antagonist's lair that happens to have a lot of explosives under it.

Leia, Chani from Dune, and Zoe Saldana in Avatar are all allies of the protagonistin a similar plot structure, but it's the details that would make them copies of each other.

11m06ix_45,11m06ix,"As a kid I absolutely adored the books, but even then I knew it could get really, really clumsy at points, especially when the characters had to make a decision of any kind. Everything needed to be explained and debated - all alternatives needed to be thoroughly debunked before we could proceed.

Let’s take Murtagh and Eragon’s fight at the end of the second book as an example. Before they fight, the two of them have a debate as to why Murtagh doesn’t just surrender or give up. Why are they fighting? Murtagh swore an oath. Why doesn’t he join the rebel cause? Magic oath. Why doesn’t he just let Eragon kill him? He doesn’t want to die. This back-and-forth goes on for upwards of *3 pages!*

It’s almost like Paolini doesn’t trust that, unless the answer was glaringly obvious from the get-go, a reader’s first instinct probably won’t be to pick apart a character’s decision-making process. Having it happen once or twice is one thing, but he does this constantly, as if he’s justifying to the reader why things need to happen the way they do. Why Eragon can’t be with his elven love-interest, why Eragon needs to leave at the end of the series, there’s even a debate as to why he doesn’t just try to use magic to *raise his mentor from the dead.*

Even so, I still hold a great deal of respect what Paolini’s accomplished. He’s a published fantasy author, with a full series of novels under his belt. That’s a hell of a lot farther than I’ve gotten with my own writing. What Eragon is, at the end of the day, is a huge passion project, and I think Paolini’s passion definitely shows.",Immersturm,2023-03-08T20:37:47Z,0,0.0,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,45

There’s almost *nothing* original about the Eragon series. He lifted the dragon riding from Anne McCaffrey, the magic system from Ursula LeGuin (among others), not to mention the general Tolkien trappings and the rehash of Star Wars. Which wouldn’t even be so bad but they’re just… not well written.

And I know he was a teenager when he wrote them (he also had a *lot* of help from his parents in getting it published). They’re just *bad*.

I still enjoyed the first book - there’s something fun about it despite its flaws, and I did end up reading the whole series with varying levels of enjoyment.

The ending felt rushed, poorly constructed, unsatisfying, and borderline enraging with the decisions made by Eragon and crew post fighting Shuriken and Galbatorix. There wasn't even a fight, to be completely frank. Shuriken was hyped up so much only to literally be a useless lump. The magic system with the wordsmithing was never really...expanded upon or used in any creative ways. Sure Eragon gets his fire sword...that is just...on magical fire. No fire beams, no learning more spell words to mix and match creative attacks. Nothing. It felt hollow, built up a little then just shelved quietly. 

The first two books were a ride, you were going places, had a mission, and we were growing with Eragon and Saphira. Growing stronger, learning more about each other, gathering strength among ourselves and new friends. The last two books just felt like a slog, with a very unsatisfying ending.

11m06ix_60,11m06ix,"I loved the concept of the arc, but you can tell that it was written by someone that started at 16, and that hurts a little. There aren't a lot of stories out there where the hero is a teenager, that is the fastest, strongest, smartest, best looking person on the planet, and with good reason.

There was a part of the first book, where  Brom is discussing how to strategically enter this place with a merchant or something. Both had been there before. Brom had a century of experience being a bad ass. And in comes like 15 year old Eragon, who's never left his village of like 12 people and a scared sheep, telling them how it's going to go down.

It was a really cringey part of the story, and I think it just made me even more conscious of how that kept happening throughout the stories. His protagonists are these unstoppable gods, fighting enemies that literally have heart attacks when they get looked at too hard.

Great premise. I would just love to see it reinterpreted by someone that is ok with their protagonists not starting with maxed stats in every attribute, and cheat codes running.

I mean, quick summary.

Within a year, Eragon goes from being an average teen farmer to:

The world's most powerful wizard
The world's best sword fighter 
The world's smartest tactician
Magically good looking
One of the best blacksmith's alive
Mature enough to seduce an elf princess a hundred years older than he is.

All of the forces of men, elves, dwarves, dragons, urgals and whatever else could have come against Galbatoorix and they would still have lost.

This is an issue because Paolini kept ramping up Galbatoorix' power to make him a bigger and bigger threar, and ended up writing himself into a corner. He had to introduce a Deus Ex Machina because it's impossible for him to have lost any other way.

11m06ix_122,11m06ix,"Yeah, out of all the things to complain about in these books, I hate that everybody focuses on Eragon and Arya. One of my pet peeves is every single female character always needing a love interest and this series was really good with not going down that road, and when it did (like with Eragon's cousin and his eventual wife) it felt more natural as a result. 

Arya and Eragon following that route would just have given me incel-ly ""nice guy gets the girl"" vibes; Arya certainly cares about Eragon but I never once felt that she loved him and she made that very clear on multiple occasions. I honestly think Eragon even knows this at the end himself; his departure isn't so melancholy just because he has to give up on his first love, but because after losing so much throughout the course of the series he has to give up almost everything he's gained (Saphira excepted) to do what he thinks is right. If you want to complain about the ending, picking on that makes more sense than saying he didn't get the girl.

Even if you approach it from the perspective of Arya being willing to start a relationship with Eragon by the end, it's still a good ending that makes more sense for them to not be together. Relationships being made impossible just as a result of circumstance is also a real occurrence, and it's not uncommon. Arya would absolutely choose to stay and fulfill her responsibility as queen of the elves and the newest dragon rider, and even if Eragon stayed it doesn't seem possible for him to be in a relationship with her as queen given how much importance is place on young elves and the need to replenish their already small population after the war.",PrisonerLeet,2023-03-08T23:31:31Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,122
17getme_1,17getme,"My youngest daughter had a significant reading issue when she was young. She was (is?) mildly dyslexic and struggled with reading, even See Spot Run type of books. She was held back in 2nd grade - she couldn't connect enough of the text to make a 'story' and just hateded reading. She and I started reading in bed before going to bed. Her sisters were all about Harry Potter, so we started with that. As the stories unfolded, she learned the wonder of books, and began to read more on her own.

A few years later, her cousin gave her Eragon for Xmas; she inhaled it. We bought the other books in the series for her. She adored them. 

When she was in JH, I was flipping through the channels and saw Eragon, I vaguely remembered the name and jumped in a half an hour into the story. It was execrable and I turned it off after a bit.  But the story premise was interesting and I knew we had the series so I started the read. 

Like a number here have said, the first book was obviously written by a young author looking for a voice. The later books were much improved, I don't remember that the third installment was as interminable as some here indicate. The fourth book came out and I reread the first three to refresh, and I was very disappointed in the ending, it seemed a setup for this next tome. 

All in all, a quick read, not top quality but worth the time.",francois_du_nord,2023-10-26T01:45:44Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,1

17getme_11,17getme,"These were my favorites as a kid. I read Eragon maybe 30+ times, and my copy is all taped together. I read Eldest maybe 12 times. By the time Brisingr dropped, I had kind of aged out of it, and I only read it twice: once initially, and once again when Inheritance dropped. That book I only read once, and I only remember one major plot point from it >! about the vault of souls and what’s inside. I don’t even remember if Eragon faces Galbatorix and who wins? !<

I’ve spent months reading a chapter aloud to my wife before bed and it’s been fun to see her experience this for the first time. She has theories and predictions, and now that we’re midway through the books I don’t remember as well, it’s been an exciting experience. I can’t wait to see how it ends! 

>! For example, in Eldest, she insisted that Murtagh was still alive and predicted that he would bond to the red dragon on the cover. However, when his familial ties to Eragon were revealed, she SHOT out of bed, slackjawed and sputtering !<

I will say that Book 3 is DRAGGING a lot. A lot of these chapters feel unnecessary, like they could’ve been avoided with better narrative choices. The books seem to get slower-paced as they go on.

As far as the fantasy world being derivative, I think that’s almost unavoidable. If you read a fantasy book, it’s either “this rips off Lord of the Rings” or “oh cool this deviates from Lord of the Rings.” LOTR is still the axis. For me, this series is just like I get a helping of extra LOTR, and I’m grateful.

That's not what happens in this story. Galbatorix has been around for over a hundred years. He crushed all of the riders a century ago. His victory already came and went, this is just maintenance. Eragon, a boy who had less than two years of training, isn't going to defeat him at his own game. 

I love the climax because the way he is defeated follows a running theme throughout the books of introducing riddles and puzzles. The solution to a problem is NEVER the most obvious one.

Is volume 2 of the fork the witch and the worm coming before Book 5 or after ?

I've always wonder how you felt about Hollywood's take on the World of Eragon. The Inheritance Cycle is my all time favorite series of my childhood, but that movie haunts me to this day. I avoid it so vigorously that my close friends use it as an inside joke. 

So my question I suppose is; how do you feel about the Eragon movie and how it represents the story and universe that you created? I know it wasn't the first novel/series to be...reimagined by Hollywood (look at Darren Shan's Cirque du Freak), but I've never got to pick the original Creator's brain about.

g4vfqt_6,g4vfqt,"OOH, OOH, I’ve actually been wanting to ask this for years!!!

WHAT IN THE *HECK* KIND OF ELDUNARÍ WAS IN LORD BARST’S BELLY????

((It’s been about a year since I’ve read the series last so please forgive any lapses in memory/details))

Now, maybe I’m misunderstanding a lot, but: 

1. The bigger the dragon, the bigger the Eldunarí, and the more powerful it’ll be. 

2. Magical wards expire with the strength of the caster. Deflecting/protecting with wards wears down the caster significantly.

3. Wards don’t last suuuuper long, especially when taking heavy fire. From the examples of wards deteriorating in battles, Eragon and others have had to refresh them quite often, and use large amounts of energy stored before the battle. (Granted, they’re not as powerful as dragons in the first place, so an Eldunarí *would* be naturally better at warding)

4. I’m under the impression that the storage space in Lord Barst’s armor was on the small side, giving his stomach a bulge not much bigger than an average beer belly. Enough to fit like...a four or five inch diameter Eldunarí? Maybe a couple?

It seems to me that in order to have the level of protection Lord Barst has, he’d have to have access to an *insanely* powerful Eldunarí.

He face tanks HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of blows with all sorts of weapons and catapults and teeth, claws, and horns, and it takes (hours?) to take him down.

Wouldn’t he have needed an Eldunarí so powerful that it would be too large to carry? Especially within his stomach-armor-thing? Or maybe he just had multiple Brom-Ring-levels of energy stored in various jewels throughout his armor? 

Whatever the outcome, it still completely blows my mind, and the battle of Urû’baen is my favorite of the series. (While I’m here, I gotta say—I am ***SO*** pleased with how you wrapped up that final fight!!!! Absolutely flawless!!!!) 😊

Thank you for your time, and this AMA as a whole!!!!!",Gatekeeper-Andy,2020-04-20T17:09:46Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,6

1. Who would have a final say in potential conflict of interests between Arya and Eragon? Theoreticaly Eragon have higher political position but I can't quite imagine him bossing her around. Is it going to work like 2 kings in Sparta or something?
2. Does Arya have higher possition than other kings because of her being a dragon rider? Will elvish houses try to influence riders through Arya? And in overall, how is this girl going to manage all the responsibilities you're placing on her shoulders?
3. Who will be training young riders before a trip to Mount Arngor and who is going to be the next egg courier (is it still Arya?)
4. How will new order ruling structure look like? Is it still going to be one lider and a council? Who will be directly managing riders once they go back to Alagaesia?
5. How will Eragon keep track of all the events taking place in Alagaesia? Just by Eldunarya and scrying mirrors or will he have his own metode

On dragons:

1. Is the newly hatched dragon bonded or wild?
2. How far will two-legs be involved in raising wild dragons? Will they just raise a few and then let the rest take remaining eggs and Eldunarya of wild dragons to let them be ""as wild as possible""?

On human tribes:

1. Where do they came from? Are they the same people who came to Alagaesia with king Palancar?
2. Can humans from wild tribes living next to Mount Arngor become dragon riders? Will we see such riders in upcoming books?

On war and politics:

1. Why didn't dwarves and elves want more for participating in war? (Come on! Their casualties were severe and they got almost nothing for it!)
2. Will relations between the races (for example dwarves and humans) still be so peacefull and friendly in the future?
3. How Imperium's political system used to work like? It seems a bit like european feudal system but why then there is no landlord in Carvahall or other villages?
4. Did the war made an impact on Imperium's society (like improving villagers laws or reducing a number of nobility)? And how about other races?

Games:

1. What are the rules of Maghra, runes and other games being played in Alagaesia?
2. Will fans ever get a merchandize connected to this games or official set of rules to play on our own?

I’ve always thought if they took the time to make a GoT style show with Eragon and the crew it would be so huge! I think GoT and online streaming sites have opened up this genre to the public and they’d be far more on-board than they would’ve been 10 years ago. 

Do you think your material would benefit from a series or maybe an extended length movie trilogy instead?",Justfluke,2020-04-21T07:28:01Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,45

g4vfqt_47,g4vfqt,"I have tons of questions and really hope I will get some answered :D 

1. Tornac: Did Murtagh actually get his hors (which he named after his teacher) before or after leaving Uru'baen? If he gets him before, why did he name him after his teacher? wasn't that very confusing? 
I remember him saying that he got his horse when he was still a foal so it should have passed quite some time between him geting the horse and the first meeting with Eragon. 
--> fun fact: The guys who translated your book to german got quiete confuse whith you naming Murtaghs horse and his teacher the same. So in the first book when Murtagh and Tornac left Uru'baen in the german version the horse got killed nod the human Tornac... it's something that confused me since my teenager years, luckyli 25 year old me reread the book in english and know everything makes more sense xD 

2. Did Brom know of Murtags existence? 

3. Did Brom ever consider to save Murtagh from his father and the king? For exempal after Selena died? 

4. Will we ever learn more about Tornac and Murtaghs childhood in the books to come? I really think Tornac is an underrated character so far and I would love too learn more about him. 

5. As I love random facts, do you have anymore random facts about Thorn and Murtagh which you can give us?

Anyway first I would like to say thank you for making this awesome book series. It was my introduction as a kid to the fantasy genre and it has even inspired me on creating my own piece of fantasy! 

Now if you are still reading these, I have a question. 

Why Eragon had to leave Alagesia? 

Dragon Riders are supposed to be the defenders of Alagesia so why Eragon has to leave? Also isn't it easier to simply rebuild the old Dragon Rider stronghold using magic with the help of the Edlunari than journey to the empty sea not knowing if anything is there after all, or if their supplies will last?

And he dismisses Alagesia which is an entire continent by not having a place which is remote enough. 

Apologies if my question seen rude, English is my first language. I just fail to see Eragon's reasoning. 


And one more question. 

Do you read fanfics about your franchise?

I hoped for a kiss between Eragon and Arya in the last book. With the years I thought a lot about a kiss between them but end with a weird feeling about it.

I remember reading Eragon when it first came out in grade school. I’m 26 now and graduating grad school in May. Time sure does fly! 

Fun Facts: I actually read Eldest (and I think Brisingr, memory is a little fuzzy) before the real release date. The librarian at our local library got an advanced copy and she saw how much I loved it and let me read them early. She was RAD. If I recall, I’m pretty sure they sent advanced copies out for editing purposes. I helped point out some misspelled words to her. You’re welcome!

Seriously though, those books were my absolute favorite as a kid growing up. They really introduced me to fantasy and I’ve been an avid reader ever since. I just wanted to say thank you! I still have my original copies sitting on my bookshelf.

g4vfqt_57,g4vfqt,"I remember saving up coins and dollar bills for months in a small black purse in order to buy Eragon. I had first seen it in a scholastic catalog in elementary school and I was inexplicably drawn to this book although I had no clue what it was about. When I finally had enough money to purchase the book, I was OVER. THE. MOON. But when I began to read it, it was slightly too advanced for me in the beginning. I did not understand what was going on with the unfamiliar names etc. I gave myself some patience, read it more slowly and I was soon absorbed by the story and became a forever fan. I bought every new book as soon as it came out. I will never forget my love for the series since I saw he first book in the catalog. It is still my favorite fantasy book I have ever read. The characters are just so real and their struggles are so relatable. So thank you so much for writing them.

In case you check back and see this... I have questions...

I've seen that you recommend plotting as instrumental in having a solid first draft; what is your plotting process like and how is that balanced with world building? 

Who are the authors you look to as role models in writing?

Do you develop characters on their own or as they fit into the story? I have a few character ideas but even though I want to have them be the hero I feel like they would end up being a villain and I'm not sure if I should let them or if I'm just trying to shoehorn to much into a character. 

Once you have a character how do you decide what their starting point is? I feel like so many authors rush their characters into being a bad ass that they don't take time to show why they became that way or the other character development that occurred along the way.",Foobidee,2020-04-21T07:00:06Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,58

Can you go into more detail into how the riders political system worked? (Both the dead one and the current one)
What are your thoughts on the r/eragon subreddits thoughts on the movie? (Also what are your thoughts on the movie)
How the heck was barst able to tank so many attacks from the elves? He only had 1 eldunari, and that would probably make him weaker than some of the forsworn who would have had multiple but if (forgive me for forgetting the name I haven’t read the series in a few months) the elves that were guarding eragon could have taken out any of the forsworn then how were they unable to deal with lord barst? 
Will the covid pandemic affect TSIASOS’s release date? Really hyped for it.

Few weird ones (Just stuff I’m curious about ignore if you wish)

g4vfqt_61,g4vfqt,Question I've always had. The arrangement with the dragon eggs is that lines of kids would pass in front of it and the egg would possibly hatch for one of them. Problem is that you'd have no way of knowing who the egg hatched for. By Eragon it took a while - presumably at least a week or 2 - before Saphira hatched for him. By that point hundreds of kids could of passed before the egg. How would they figure out who the true Rider is? Also what would happen if the egg hatches and someone else sticks out their hand and touches the dragon first?

I know you've answered tons of questions about the relationship that Eragon and Arya have built through the series, but I wanted to know how you put yourself in such a mindset to flesh out their story. Specifically the heartwrenching scene between them in the Agaetí Blödhren. I love how absolutely real that conversation/situation felt between them, as well as how pivotal is was for both of them to allow the relationship to grow to what it is now.

1) Where did you get the inspiration for their relationship, or was it something you just let grow on it's own over time? As a younger teenager reading as the series unfolded it really felt as if us readers were growing in our understanding of relationships alongside Eragon for a while, at least for me.

2) I know it can be weary and monotonous focusing on a single project, do you see yourself at a stopping point for this world you've created or do you plan on continuing for the foreseeable future? I ask because there are just so, so many different views I would love to see. Anything from the viewpoints of the Dwarven gods, the other landmasses and their happenings, to the rambling and possibly incoherent thoughts of Tenga and his possible connection to the Grey Folk or even Galbatorix himself. Of course that's not even considering the standard requests of Angela, Brom, and Murtagh.

3) I've seen before that there is so much going on that you write down many details of the project you're working on, would you ever consider releasing an unpolished/uncensored/behind-the-scenes version of your notes for us to see the world of Alagaesia from your view?

In the last book, when Eragon visits Vroengard, there was a rider who turned himself into magical energy and caused a massive explosion, which then rendered most of the island uninhabitable. 

Was this explosion similar to a nuclear blast?

My question is: how do you come up with the names of your characters?? 

I know that sounds like a stupid question, but for my story, my characters are named by spelling some of my co-workers names backwards. Some of them sound really.... Fantasy-like when pronounced. And I was even thinking of adding a pronunciation key like you did, so the names are said correctly.",BadBunnyFooFoo,2020-04-21T13:56:18Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,91

(Sorry I'm late) 

But, the only questions I can think of is: what tips do you have for aspiring authors?
Is there anything about the writing process, finding a publisher/editor or anything that you think we should know or be aware of?



And I wanted to say thank you.
 Thank you for sharing your talent with the world, and for persevering in spite of challenges you may have faced. 
The Inheritance Cycle was one of my favorite book series when I was younger, and it continues to remain so even now.
The characters and the worlds they lived within were so colorful and descriptive I had no trouble being easily absorbed by them. 
Your success gives me hope that I can do the same someday with my own writing. 

(Also, I was homeschooled too, so I thought it was neat that we had that in common. 😄)

1. Do you think attending a college/university is essential when trying to become a successful author?

2. Probably can’t answer this but will Eragon be the center of the next book or will it embark on a new protagonist with new side characters?

3. Will the new story resemble the height of the riders or is it closer to a handful of riders being chosen? 

4. Will the new book be a new series or only a single addition to the series?

5. Will the world be expanded past the continent and locations we’ve learned or is the main setting remaining like the previous cycle?",Qowling,2020-04-30T15:20:30Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,95
g4vfqt_96,g4vfqt,"Hello! I know I'm kinda late, but I just couldn't resist the temptation to jump at the opportunity to say something to you. Thank you so much for making the Inheritance Cycle. Ever since I first started reading Eragon in my school's library, I instantly fell in love witht he series. Not many fantasy novels catch my eye anymore, but your series was revolutionary for me. From the beautifully described landscape to the epic battles waged to the hardships I was taken through with Eragon and the gang, I became truly immersed in the adventures in Alagaësia. New concepts were introduced to me that I hadn't even dreamed of being in fantasy and I loved every one of them. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating the best fantasy series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. You are truly a master of fantasy literature. Anyways, on to some questions.

1. What inspired the idea of the gedwëy ignasia and the mental connection it allows between Rider and dragon?

2. (Spoiler alert for those who haven't read Inheritance) When Galbatorix shouted ""Be not"" in the ancient language, did he literally make himself cease to exist? If so, did he do it just because he knew he was going to lose?

3. How did you come up with the ancient and Urgralgra languages?

4. What's your honest opinion/evaluation about the Eragon movie?

5. What would you say is your favorite part in the series?

6. Since the elves do not have any gods that they believe in, what is their theory about creation?

7. I've heard all the buzz about you working on a 5th book. Is it the start to a new arc or will it just be a big epilogue?

8. Would you be able to see the possibility of the Inheritance Cycle getting a movie reboot or possibly a game? The game would probably be similar to Skyrim, but it'll be its own game with elements from the series and sorry if that sounds like a bad idea. I just would love to see the series done great justice and brought to true life in one of those ways.

Again, thank you for such a wonderful series.",Bite_Sized_Asian,2020-05-01T06:14:57Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,96

>! Eragon at one point learns about a magic that enables him to drain the life from other living things, and in exchange it gives him a great power. I remember this would have to be the last resort to defeat Galbatorix if everthing else didn’t work. In the end though, this ability is never again mentioned.

Also, I'm still waiting for the 5 book that will continue the history of ExA. The ending from Inheritance turned me off of reading series for SO long. Because it was so open, so I never felt as it was finished.

1. Will we ever have an Arya PoV? 
2. Will book 5 happen before those of Murtagh, Brom and Angela?

Thank you for introducing me to lengthy fantasy novels! Something I'll always remember is begging my dad to buy 'Inheritance' for me the day it came out. Oh, I don't think I've been that excited for a book since!

You have such an ability to illustrate. I could always vividly imagine what you were describing to me. One passage I'll always remember --from 'Inheritance' I think -- it's when Saphira, Eragon, and Glaedr are flying high, maybe away from the Vault of Souls, I don't recall.

[I found it! It's here on /r/Eragon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/9xjx62/the_sky_is_hollow_and_the_world_is_round_how/e9sxwyk/)

It reads:

>At long last, Saphira detected a slackening of the wind—slight but noticeable—and she began to prepare to fly out of the stream of air.

>Before she could, the clouds above them thinned, and Eragon glimpsed a few glittering specks: stars, white and silvery and brighter than any he had seen before.

>Look, he said. Then the clouds opened up around them, and Saphira rose out of the storm and hung above it, balancing precariously atop the column of rushing wind.

>Laid out below them, Eragon saw the whole of the storm, extending for what must have been a hundred miles in every direction. The center appeared as an arching, mushroom-like dome, smoothed off by the vicious crosswinds that swept west to east and threatened to topple Saphira from her uncertain perch. The clouds both near and far were milky and seemed almost luminous, as if lit from within. They looked beautiful and benign—placid, unchanging formations that betrayed nothing of the violence inside.

>Then Eragon noticed the sky, and he gasped, for it contained more stars than he had thought existed. Red, blue, white, gold, they lay strewn upon the firmament like handfuls of sparkling dust. The constellations he was familiar with were still present but now set among thousands of fainter stars, which he beheld for the very first time. And not only did the stars appear brighter, the void between them appeared darker. It was as if, whenever he had looked at the sky before, there had been a haze over his eyes that had kept him from seeing the true glory of the stars.

>He stared at the spectacular display for several moments, awestruck by the glorious, random, unknowable nature of the twinkling lights. Only when he finally lowered his gaze did it occur to him that there was something unusual about the purple-hued horizon. Instead of the sky and the sea meeting in a straight line—as they ought to and always had before—the juncture between them curved, like the edge of an unimaginably big circle.

>It was such a strange sight, it took Eragon a half-dozen seconds to understand what he was seeing, and when he did, his scalp tingled and he felt as if the breath had been knocked out of him.

>“The world is round,” he whispered. “The sky is hollow and the world is round.”

*“The world is round,” he whispered. “The sky is hollow and the world is round.”* I remember reading that for the first time... it was so, so awesome!

g4vfqt_130,g4vfqt,"My husband and I have struggled to find a good couple hobby, but we decided to start reading together and started Eragon last summer (he’s in medical school and doesn’t have much free time).  I had already read the Cycle like 10 times before but now it’s so fun to hear his theories and predictions. He accurately predicted that Murtagh would be the rider for the red dragon on the cover of Eldest. We’re about 100 pages in on inheritance and he has no clue who the rider for the green dragon will be!!!!

Your books have brought us closer and I’m so excited to read something new to both of us next! We plan to read your new book when it’s out, so my question for you is: what else should we read next?!?!",chocolateeyes,2020-04-21T00:01:56Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,130
g4vfqt_131,g4vfqt,"Hi Chris,

Big fan since I was young and the Inheritance Cycle is still on my Audible rotation. Not gonna lie though, the ending hit me like a brick when I was a teenager and I was a bit disappointed Eragon decided to fly away into seclusion. Anyways my question is about the Belt of Beloth the Wise. It seemed like a bit of a Chekhov's gun but I can't remember there being a situation in which Eragon wouldn't have got by without it and then BAM it's gone before the final battle. The wiki article says Eragon couldn't even scry it after defeating Galbatorix using the Name of Names. So my question is what was its purpose in your opinion?

Thanks again!",monsterosity,2020-04-21T00:47:45Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,131
g4vfqt_132,g4vfqt,"Hey Chris. I'm not gonna pretend I have a question to ask, I just want to express my sincere gratitude for your work and, especially, how young you were when you did it. I was very young when *Eragon* released, and I vividly remember being sucked into it immediately. It engaged me in a way no book had before, and few have since. It instilled within me a desire to hold that spark, to be able to create a world that others would enjoy and get invested in just as much as I had.

My mom is a bookworm hardcore, and a massive fan of Lord of the Rings, so I always had this view of authors as crotchedy old men and women who were profoundly experienced in life and had all these experiences to draw on - so when I read you had written Eragon at 15/16, it unlocked that mental door for me. It opened up a whole new passion and gave me the closest thing to a 'life goal' I could say that I have, in that I want to be able to stick to an idea long enough to write my own novel about it.

So, thank you, Chris, for giving me a dream. You're an absolute inspiration, and I really have to get back to reading actively so I can check out your latest work. Thank you for everything you've done - you're an idol to me. I'll do my best to stay focused and put something out there someday.",RTSUbiytsa,2020-04-21T01:45:03Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,132

I was a lonely kid, and it meant a lot to have far away worlds with friends like Eragon. I hope book 5 is in the works soon! Any hope for Arya and Eragon working things out? I’m a sucker for romance stories and can’t help but root for them. 

This AMA makes me want to reread these books. I’m late so you probably won’t see this, but really, thank you so much for writing these books. Your stories comforted me when I was a kid, reading about Eragon, feeling his triumphs and failures (God I cried so much when Brom died), and they stuck with me all these years.

g4vfqt_137,g4vfqt,"Just wanted to stop and say thanks for writing my favorite series of all time. It has such a fantastic story, world and characters, the best system of magic i’ve ever read and is the only one that truly quantifies and grounds it in rules, and such a satisfying overall arc in which all the characters grow and the world changes dramatically. The ending is among the best you could ask for in any medium. 

Only question off the top of my head that I haven’t already seen is whether with Disney’s acquisition of 21st is there a chance for a reboot of Eragon either as a movie or as a series akin to Netflix’s the Witcher? Although I think the cycle would adapt to a series much better.

Also how hard was it for you to avoid a more cliché ending where the Hero overpowers the villain, and instead making such a miraculous and unexpected path to victory? And did you know all along that was how you wanted it to end or did you come up with it somewhere aong in the writing of the cycle!

Thanks again, and congrats on the near completion of what will surely be a big hit.

I do have one question that always bugged me though: after Galbatorix is defeated Eragon and Saphria share their true names but I always wondered how their true names stayed the same and did not change after such a huge life event just happened. A part of their life, a huge chunk of who they were is now over. And with Murtagh it seems all it took was a smaller event to alter his true name. So just curious about this is all.

I'm a college student now, but I remember reading the Inheritance Cycle way back in middle school, and it's still one of my favorite fantasy series to this date. I know you've collaborated to create in the past to develop an Eragon movie and video game, but I always felt that the movie and game were too short to do justice to the original novel. On top of that, there have been huge leaps in production technology that could display Alagaësia in a new, magical way. I was wondering, have you every considered conveying the Inheritance cycle in a television series or perhaps even rebooting with another video game studio? If you have, how difficult is that process and are you more concerned with a studio staying true to your original work or creating a quality product overall? I ask this specifically after seeing how reknowned the Witcher books have become after the author collaborated with CD Projekt Red to create that amazing trilogy of games and moved onto to make the Netflix Original.

Publishing: first step, write a book. Hopefully one people want to read.

To quote from an answer elsewhere in the thread:

""We lived/live in the middle of nowhere in Montana. My parents had self-published (via print-on-demand) an educational book while I was writing Eragon. As a family, we decided to do the same with Eragon. We paid to print all the books -- couldn't afford more than fifty at a time -- and did all the promotion ourselves, which involved me cold-calling schools, stores, and libraries in order to set up author events. It was a TON of work, and we didn't have any help from anyone in the traditional publishing industry.

We quite literally bet all our savings on Eragon. If it had taken another month or two to turn a profit ... we would have had to sell our house, move to a city, and get whatever jobs we could. Makes for a great story after the fact, but it was rough as hell living through it.""

Knopf approached us after we'd been promoting the book for about a year. We sold around 10,000ish copies of Eragon ourselves, mostly in schools.

Do your research. It's easier to get published now than at any other time. And don't give up!

I could do a better job line-by-line in writing Eragon. Also, in Eldest, I'd add another chapter from Nasuada's point-of-view, showing how the Varden got from Tronjheim to Surda.

g4vfqt_251,g4vfqt,"Lotta great questions here. Let's see:

1. No one. They're of equal standing. The rest of Alagaësia might give Eragon a bit more standing, but the elves will side with Arya, and the elves are not to be trifled with. Plus, they're both Riders now.

2. Arya's position among the other leaders is high because of the amount of military and economic (and magical) power she wields. Not just because she's a Rider.

3. Yes, Arya and the elves will oversee the first stages of training for Riders whose eggs hatch in Alagaësia prior to traveling to Mount Arngor.

4. You'll have to wait to read Book 5 to find this one out. 

Dragons:

1. No comment.

2. Humans/elves/dwarves and even some Urgals will be *very* involved in raising the young wild dragons, since Saphira is the only semi-grown dragon around who isn't an Eldunarí.

Human tribes:

1. They came to Alagaësia later.

2. Any human could become a Rider (in theory).

War & politics:

1. The dwarves are going to get a huge amount from reopening trade with the humans. The elves don't care to expand their territory much beyond Du Weldenvarden. These things will be explored in greater detail later.

2. No comment.

3. Morzan actually held title over the lands of Palancar Valley at one point. When he died, Galbatorix assumed control over his properties. Thus, Palancar Valley was essentially owned by the state, not any one noble/earl.

4. Huge impact. Again, something that will be explored in later works.

Games:

1. Hmm. I'll see about getting some rules posted on my website in the future.

2. The merchandise situation is tricky, as Fox owns a lot of the rights (they bought them along with the movie).

The Grey Ones messed up a whole bunch of spells, which poisoned the land and nearly destroyed their society. The Ancient Language was essentially weapons control for magic.",ChristopherPaolini,2020-04-20T20:43:13Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,251

The new Riders will be returning to defend Alagaësia once they're trained up. And Arya and Fírnen are still there to help.

""Since my parents owned a dictionary of word origins, I pulled   it off the shelf and flipped through it.

After the end of your series, because of how it ended, I now go out of my way to get spoiled about whether the main love interests get/stay together at the end of a series BEFORE reading the series because of how devastated I was that they didn't in Eragon.

I went from it being my favorite series at the time to I would have rage quitted it if wasn't basically over anyway. Since then I've never reread the series even once, that's how much it was ruined for me (and I reread other series that I love DOZENS of times).

I also typically do not read ongoing series until they come to a conclusion because of this.

So yeah, I'm still salty about it almost a decade later, so I suppose that speaks to your writing skills and how good your story could have been, but at least you taught me to do my homework before reading a series so that I don't get my heart broken again.

&#x200B;

If you're a big fan of this, I would highly recommend Brandon Sanderson's adult novels. They're epic fantasy with very intricate and interconnected worldbuilding, magic systems, and plot. His writing in certain aspects can be a touch on the YA side which is probably the main criticism against him, but it doesn't sound like that would bother you at all. His main series are also all part of the Cosmere and take place in the same universe, and if you really pay attention there's an absurd amount of subtle hints, details, background references, and hidden plotlines that you'll only catch with multiple read-throughs and careful cross-referencing. Mistborn and Warbreaker are common recommendations for good starting points, though The Way of Kings is also fine if you don't mind diving headfirst into a big complex epic fantasy where it will take a little while to figure out what's going on (though if you read Dune and enjoy it, WoK is similar so you should be fine in that regard as well, and Dune is pretty awesome).

nbpfgt_10,nbpfgt,"Hey, same here! I recently found my old Eragon series and thought ""why not? I like dragons"". Eragon is definitely geared towards a younger audience but I thoroughly appreciated how much time Paolini dedicated to building the universe, characters, and languages. I first read it when I was a kid but forgot a lot of it, so reading it again as an adult was an interesting experience. For example, a lot of the conversations around philosophy and religion in the story completely went over my head as a kid, but I'm glad I revisited the series to fully appreciate those parts. I don't get why some people hate it, it's a solid series overall. Really makes me wish Paolini could come out with a sequel or side novel that addresses some of the underdeveloped aspects of the story!

On a separate note, highly recommend Dune if you ever get to it.",ghost_sharked,2021-05-13T20:41:11Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,10

nbpfgt_12,nbpfgt,"Ah, I have such mixed feelings about Eragon series. I was gifted the 1st book on my 11th birthday and I absolutely loved it. I probably read it like 10 times. I cried so, so hard as a kid when the Brom thing happened.

Then the second book came and although it was a little slower paced than the 1st, I enjoyed it too. The Roran story was fascinating.

After that it went downhill pretty quick. The 3rd book wasn't that bad yet, it had good moments. I just feel like Paolini got a bit inconsistent with his story as the time went on. I began to question the logic of the plot.

But the 4th book... man. It was one of the biggest disappointments in my life. It felt like Paolini lost his ideas at this point and tried just to close the story. The ending was just so antyclimatic. You build a narrative of a terrible king that rules the entire known world, he is described as the most powerful entity in the universe - and he is dealt with within as many pages as George Martin describes a fancy garden. 

In my head I slowly pushed the ending away. These days when I think about Eragon, it is just about these two first books, which make me fall in love with  fantasy in general.",ves_111,2021-05-14T04:21:00Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,12

I finally found the hardback at a garage sale and it's been sitting on my shelf for a couple of years because I moved away from home and left the first three books at my old house.

Anyway, I remember I really liked the first two books, even though the first book had some random shit like a chapter being 3 pages long. But Eldest...that was fire. A great book. I did have some minor issues like dragons instantly becoming geniuses and the elves just being so much better at everything and everyone, but that's standard fantasy stuff.

I don't remember liking Brisingr quite as much. I think it's because it had a lot of stuff that I felt just wasn't needed, though the beginning few chapters were pretty awesome. Because it was originally one book before it got split into two, right? But it had some neat stuff in there.

It has been a ridiculous numbers of years since then but I don't know if I want to go back to it.

It is always a delight to see you pop up in r/Eragon occasionally and hopefully one of these days I can catch an AMA while it's happening.

I actually re-read the entire series last year during the summer, and man were they a joy to read. Brisingr and Inheritance are my personal favorite, but I do love Eldest and of course, Eragon holds a special place in my heart. The ending and death of Galbatorix was perfect. Death by empathy. It's something I can really relate to as someone who is overly empathetic, so I understand how for a monster like Galbatorix it was too much. And then the way you described Roran's cry of anguish as Eragon left, I almost cried during my re-read last year.

To me at least, she feels too convenient, too idealized. I haven't read it in quite a while, but I think she was lacking internal conflict. Her mother, the queen, died, and she had to step up. I'd like for her internal conflict to be more clear, how does it affect her relationships, etc. If I try to materialize her in mind and talk to her, her dialogue would feel generic and she'd seem empty because she is more of a cookie-cutter character. The princess of the elves who happens upon our hero, Eragon. Perhaps, this is a good argument for Christopher Paolini using a lot of cliches/inspiration from novels of the same genre.

I don't entirely agree that Christopher Paolini is bad at writing female characters as I found that Nasuada was developed well, especially in the prison. We got to see some of her inner conflict and her thought process with how she deceived the guard. 

That said, I think the ending was really powerful and I can still savor the bitterness of parting to this day. Towards the end, Arya was getting developed well, but I think that Christopher Paolini was weak with character development (at least women because Brom's death still haunts me) in the beginning. I can tell that he matured as a writer towards his third book.

What would be fun is a retelling from Murtagh's perspective, because I liked the complexity of his character.",PM_ME_CLEVER_STUFF,2021-05-14T07:44:13Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,78

nbpfgt_81,nbpfgt,I disagree with the spell. In my mind Galby was created to be too powerful. He simply had too many dragons behind him and spirits. I didn't think there was a way to defeat him through conventional mean and I found the spell to be kind of ingenious. I was a bit disappointed that the spell was just cooked up on the fly though. I thought the despair scenes Eragon goes through throughout the book would have given him some idea of how to hurt Galby without actually physically hurting him given his wards would protect from physical injuries.,Altair05,2021-05-14T03:47:08Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,81

nbpfgt_86,nbpfgt,"TBH I don't think that was the problem with Arya - she had plenty of internal turmoil. For one she and her mother are alienated because Arya chose to risk her life and leave the Du Weldenvarden forests to try to fight against Galbatorix.

The second turmoil is caused by Eragon and his affection. She knew he fancied her a lot, but she didn't see him that way. This became a very heavy strain on their relationship, but she didn't dare to cut him off because he was the chosen one.

While the latter relationship is seen mainly through Eragon's eyes, we can still see how uncomfortable and conflicted Arya is. I think in this regard Arya isn't a badly written character, but I think it's true that it's a shame that we only get to see her turmoil through Eragon's eyes.",trollokvoltak,2021-05-14T07:59:39Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,86
nbpfgt_87,nbpfgt,"My thoughts exactly. The whole time I was reading Eragon, I kept thinking this was some idealized elf woman Paolini had just thought up for himself and for Eragon, and I just wasn't feeling it. I understand the elves are supposed to be naturally distant and foreign to humans, but Arya just felt flat. On the other hand, I absolutely love the way Nasuada was developed, from an unassuming minor character to a political mastermind. The fact that she was given her own POV was a good choice I think. I agree, I can definitely see where Paolini matured as a writer and in character development with Book 3 and 4, and the introduction of new characters and new races. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he set up Arya to be a certain way with Book 1 (which he wrote as a teenager) and kinda had to stick with it until the end, haha. 

A side story or something with Murtagh, I'd actually enjoy. IMO I found his character to be confusing and frankly kinda annoying. His whole relationship with Eragon felt surface-level and I also just felt no closure whatsover when he broke free of Galbatorix's control.

nbpfgt_88,nbpfgt,"It’s been a hot minute since I read the series as well, but when I think back to Arya’s character I don’t remember her really having a conflict at all. External ones, sure; she was in lots of fights. But internal ones, Eh.

They brought up how one of the elves that died protecting her and Saphira’s egg was kind of like her partner I think, and she mentioned how she was upset that she was gone. But she never really showed signs of grief for him.

If I remember correctly, her relationship with her mother was supposed to be a little bit strained, but I don’t recall that having much bearing on the story or her.

Her “relationship” with Eragon felt very one sided, she never really showed much interest in him other than platonically. There wasn’t really anything shown about her wanting to be with him but having to choose her duty instead, or not being over her old partner, or not being able to get over their age gap or race differences. It was just Eragon texting “you up?” And Arya leaving him on read lol.

And throughout the story she never struggled with much, she never grew, she never had to overcome anything. From what I can remember at least. So it’s like she’s just a fantasy version of a manic pixie dream girl.

I’ll have to read the series again to see if this is how it really is, if my perception of her holds up. But yeah I recall her being less of a character and more of a prop.",Rybur525,2021-05-14T08:03:53Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,88

But... the books come with so, so much cringe. The Eragon and elf-girl non-romance. It began to feel like Eragon is an incel. Even though he could fuck literally any non-elf consensually. 

The elves were made so powerful that the author had to magically make Eragon basically-an-elf for his existence to make sense.

The most glaring issue of the series is that Galbatorix, the most insanely powerful being in the conceivable world, with more magic than anyone could possibly know what to do with, just let everything happen. He did nothing to try to stop Eragon, other than send another corrupt rider after him, which almost worked. He should have been like, ""Oh shit! That other rider almost killed Eragon with 1/10000000000000 of my power? I should go kill him real quick on my own and stay in power.

It isnt like some sort of Sauron deal where the bad guy is tied to Mount Doom/Mordor. Galbatorix can and did fly around briefly. But it just ends up being like, ""What if Superman had power over every facet of life, but kept sending Green Arrow to fight his enemies""

Eragon flying away to the distant lands at the end was a perfect example of how the story is just kinda copying things. In LotR, frodo is so destroyed by his experience in the war, and so closed off from other people, that the only way he can find peace is by riding off into the sunset, into the nameless lands where he's never seen again. He dies. 

Eragon does the same thing, except I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be taken as eragon finding peace in death. He's spreading dragon riding culture to other places, he's still around.

Not only that, but the plot of the early story is basically a fantasy version of ‘A new hope’. Now I know that most stories follow the same plots and this is just another example of ‘the hero’s journey’. There is nothing wrong with reusing this plot line again. 

However, Eragon did not need to be raised by his Uncle in a rural farming community. His uncle didn’t need to die. He didn’t need to be found by the local hermit who happened to be one of the only remaining practices or a fabled magic. He didn’t need to be one of the next generation of these fabled magicians.

m0hfls_4,m0hfls,"As a story Eragon is fine. I like the first one better than the second. The third one is the best. And the fourth one doesn't wrap anything up, and in fact leaves way more questions. 

The most annoying part of the whole series is how he gets those prophecies in book 1, and nothing substantial comes of it really. Literally the only reason he leaves and never comes back is because the prophecy said thats what happens. Same with him not getting with Arya. 

I do think the series overall does a decent job of setting up Galbatorix. Although his defeat was dumb. They set him up to be too powerful. So the only way the heroes could actually win is if he defeated himself. After 4 books of set up our final confrontation is like half a page. And Galbatorix wins. Everything he wanted to do Nasuada is going to do. The empire just has a new coat of paint slapped on and now the people in charge think they are justified because they beat a bad guy to get there.",Doctor_Expendable,2021-03-08T23:29:22Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,4

m0hfls_11,m0hfls,"I think its perfectly natural to have read books when you're younger and then grow up, reread them and be like, ""What was I thinking?"" It shows that you have grown as a reader, as well of a person.

I read The Hunger Games when I was in middle school and thought it was the most hardcore book ever, obviously I realized that wasn't the case. Books like Eragon and Hunger Games are meant for that young age, but as you get older and get into more adult material, you'll find that those old books can't hold a candle to what you read nowadays.

Looking back at my own reading journey, it's weird to think that I'm reading books by authors my younger self would've dismissed as ""boring"" and such. 

If my younger self heard I was reading books from the likes of Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Cormac McCarthy, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Thomas Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, and so forth, he'd be like, ""Huh? Why in the hell would I read stuff from all those old guys?"" Oh the mind of a child...",ZeroSight95,2021-03-08T16:52:50Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,11

m0hfls_13,m0hfls,"You can definitely tell that the books were not edited sufficiently. It’s a big problem with popular established authors that their editors stop saying no, and the page count balloons. First Harry Potter was barely 200 pages, but every book after 4 exceeded 600. You see it a lot with other series like Percy Jackson, where the fast pace and tight plot is what made it special, then move on to Magnus Chase and they just never stop dithering.

Eragon started out with that lack of a reasonable editor, and the series got absurd from there. There was no reason for Inheritance to be half as long as it was, considering there’s like a handful of battles and Eragon disappearing to find himself. I can forgive the series for being really basic hero’s journey material, because that’s part of the charm, but after a certain point it just feels like an author is wasting your time or stroking their ego with a 200,000 word slog.",cats4life,2021-03-09T03:52:26Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,13

Ive spent much of the intervening time since first reading that book and now, studying aircraft, and air warfare.

Id been putting up with the generic action prose and nonsensical description of special forces land warfare - it wasnt great, but it also wasnt my area of expertise.

I got really angry with the main character at several points through the story when he did things that were sometimes needlessly cruel.

While the theory works as written by Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces, there are nothing in any Story theory that says:

Princess about to be captured  has to send only hope to young boy on a farm who happens to be the son of a traitor and who is constantly being watched over by the Old Hermit who is secretly a member of an order the Emperor destroyed and who fought with Farmer-Boy dad and keeps a colored sword.

Nothing says:
Old Hermit and Farmer Boys go on an adventure meet a dashing Jack of all trade and together they save the princess. Or that the Old Hermit has to die.

Or:
The heroes are followed to the Rebel base and have to defend it. 

Those are plot points taken from and developed in the exact same order as Star Wars and while it's a good story structure and it's simple, it's fucking Star Wars.

Hell, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, Wheel of Time, Dune, Princess Bride and even fucking Game of Thrones have ""The Hero's Journey"" in them as it was theorized by Campbell and yet, Eragon is just Star Wars.


And I'm just talking about the first Novel here. Let's not talk about how Farmer Boy over here  has to fight a relative before the end of the thing or the 1 000 other stuff that are taken straight from Star Wars.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, as I've said Star Wars has a fucking solid structure. But Paolini stayed very close to it. 

Eragon doesn't have his own ""Hero's Journey"" he has ""Luke's"" most of the time. 

And that's not even talking about how some of the name are straight up coming from Lord Of The Rings. 
Paolini's parents published his book and while it IS impressive he was able to write a fucking entire book at 15, it doesn't change the fact that he went full Star Wars.",TheDeltaOne,2022-07-26T19:35:08Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,20

Then you have your fine outline. Then go in and flesh it out. Give it imagery, and paint a picture. Make the characters jump off the page. Make us feel like we’re there. Give us chills imagining doing the things that the character does. In this respect, Paolini fails as well. By the end of book 2, I couldn’t care less about Eragon, his cousin, Murtagh, Arya, any of them. The best written character in the books was Saphira, but even she was beholden to Eragon. Eragon is just a subpar book, written by a kid, who got a hyper-inflated ego from the attention of said book, and coasted the next few books on star power.",Shadpool,2022-07-27T04:21:26Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,21
w8gp7m_22,w8gp7m,"It’s not just the pacing. It’s basically everything, but I’ll hit the bulletpoints. It’s a long running joke, that’s not quite a joke, that Paolini has a thesaurus taped to his hand. He loads up his books with 10 dollar words like truncated and splendiferous with only vague notions as to what they actually mean, which in turn makes his stuff  onerous to read, especially when he’s not really saying anything at all. Books like Where The Red Fern Grows manages to deliver maximum emotion without needing the triple word score. And what he was too inexperienced to write, or neglected to load it up with pretentious word-of-the-days, he left to generic phrasing, and continued on. I’ve already mentioned that his stuff is unoriginal, citing Star Wars and LotR, but it’s more derivative than that, since knowing the thing’s true name in order to control the magic is straight out of EarthSea. The journey is D&D game 1 cliche. The plotline doesn’t make sense sometimes, like the Varden. Why are they fighting Galbatorix? He’s not really interfering with them at all. He starts wars and raises taxes, and as far as I can tell, that’s all he does. And if Durza is as powerful as he shows he is at the beginning of the book, why does he need the Urgal things? The characters are cardboard cutouts, and you never really feel an emotional connection to any of them. The female characters are cliches, ie, Arya is the stronger warrior, who will eventually be weaker than Eragon. Nasuada is the strong female leader who eventually gets demoted for Eragon. Female characters are only as good as a stepping stone for Eragon to surpass. And what’s worse is, Eragon is more than a little stupid. He believes everything everyone tells him immediately. Then there’s the plotholes. I don’t even feel like listing them, but I’m sure GoodReads has a forum or two on the subject. It’s just a teenage boy’s hormone-laced fantasy, aimed specifically at other hormonal teenage boys. And the fame from the first book did nothing but turn Paolini from what could’ve been a great talent, into an precocious, arrogant little bastard who treats his fans and everyone around him like stewed crap.

However, good alternatives are A Song Of Ice and Fire by Martin, anything by Tolkien, the Shannara series by Brooks, the Pern series by Anne and Todd McCaffrey, the Wild Magic books by Pierce, the Covenant series by Donaldson, pretty much anything by Feist, the Kingkiller series by Rothfuss, maybe the Dresden Files by Butcher if you like a little noir and comedy with your fantasy.",Shadpool,2022-07-27T10:09:58Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,22

Dude, if you want to compare Brom to someone then compare him to Obi Wan and not Vader lol.

A princess sending a McGuffin away also isn't that unique.

The main character being related to someone important also happens often.

A rebel base confronts the evil empire, yeah, only happened in Star Wars and Eragon, sure /s

Which relative did Eragon fight? Do you really mean Murtagh with that? Lol.

List those 1000 things, I am curious. So far you didn't impress me.

How are Eragon and Luke even remotely comparable other than they were farmboys (nothing special in fantasy series) and that he fights a dark lord (oooh so original). At least Eragon fights himself and has an unique approach to defeat him.

I read Eragon in German, so I didn't experience those problems. Good job to the translator I guess.

Everything is a DnD reference if you try.

Are you really asking why people were opposing Dragon Rider Hitler?

And iirc Galbatorix was about to attack them anyway, so them preparing is a good move, whether they are neutral or want to get rid of this dark lord.

Why do people need an army to hold a conquered country? Hmmmm

Hey, I know the famle characters could be better, but Eragon has more competent and complex women than most other series.

Arya doesn't fall in love with Eragon which I see as a huge plus and she even manages to do something great at the finale by killing a dragon herself.

And it takes Eragon a lot longer and some training arcs to become stronger than her. Something that some shitty novels do mid book1.

What was the problem with Nasuade? I don't understand what your problem there is.

Also we should remember the girl that Eragon cursed by accident and the weird witch.

Got a link for those plot holes. I am really curious and I say that without sarcasm.

w8gp7m_27,w8gp7m,"Brom is the Old Hermit in my comparison so yeah, I did compare him to Obi Wan.

The Traitor I'm talking about is Morzan, who is Eragon's mother husband? (Stepdad is weird in this context.) and was killed by Brom.
I don't know why you wouldn't consider Murtagh a relative of Eragon tho.. 

Like idk... Anakin being Luke's father and who ""died"" fighting Ben Kenobi. There's a twist to that formula in Eragon but the formula is pretty heavily inspired by Star Wars 

A princess sending a mcguffing away isn't original. You are right.
A Farmer Boy being the MC of a Fantasy Setting isn't original either.

A Princess being captured and sending the McGuffin to the Farmer Boy who's being watched by the wish version of Obi Wan Kenobi is some Kurosawa inspired shit. And guess what, that's George Lucas main inspiration. Star Wars is based on something and Eragon is based on star wars. 

You are talking about how each point individually are pretty usual for those kind of story and you would be right. The thing is IT'S ALL the same in the same order (for the first novel at least, then it stays pretty close to it but no more than any other Fantasy YA would.)

Nothing is original and would ever be in this kind of fantasy setting. But this is ticking every star wars plot point one after another in the exact same order, with the exact same specificities. Hell, Princess Bride is the exact same story, because Campbell was right when he theorized the Thousand Faces. But the Specificities of Princess Bride, Star Wars or like Dune are different enough because they weren't based on one another. And you can convince yourself that Eragon happens to take a lot of element from the genre where other novels succeed in twisting those elements enough, it won't change the fact that it's likely not what happened and that Paolini just based his story on Star Wars. 

Take Weel Of Time. It's pretty close too if you think about it that way, yet it's not the exact same story beat for beat. Eragon IS. Why does one feel so derivative and the other one feel like it's own thing? Because one respect the Hero's Journey and the other one is taking point from Star Wars. 

Eragon and Luke are comparable in the sense they are both having the exact same story. Beat by beat. 


Look man, I've seen you answer a lot under this post about Eragon. So I guess you like Eragon. In the end, I don't like to seem like I shit on what people like. I had a blast reading the books when I was younger because Star Wars but with Dragons is a pretty cool thing for me. You have your own reasons to like those books and you're right, they are cool. 

As you said, I didn't impress you with the elements I brought forward and I don't think I'd manage to convince you and I'm frankly not especially eager to do so. If you enjoy Eragon and don't see the similarities with Star Wars good on you man.

Yeah, let's hope the series becomes a success, and also that Paolini will deliver on the next Eragon books that he said he will be writing after his Sci-Fi novel.

nc8wfc_8,nc8wfc,"The other thing to remember is that many of these series are introductory series for those authors, and the writing will grow and change as the author does. I think the Inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini (Eragon, Eldest, Brisngr, and Inheritance) are a prime example of this. He started writing Eragon at 15, and it clearly shows in his writing. But if you stick with the series, you see his writing style not only improve, but mature. The series grew along with its audience, and you can't witness that until you get to the end of the fourth book.   


It is important to understand the audience the book is trying to impact, and thinking from that age groups perspectives. One example in that series I can point to is romance. In almost every single YA book, there is the standard teenage romance and attractions. In Eragon and Eldest, this is seen in Eragon's Interactions with Arya. But as the 3rd and 4th books continue, we begin to see that not only does Eragon's own perception of the attraction begin to change, but Paolini's writing style, and mature understanding of adult relationships, begins to twist the way the relationship is not only approached from, but how it is interpreted afterwards.",psweeney1990,2021-05-14T18:48:19Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,8

nc8wfc_17,nc8wfc,"Yes and no.

Targetting kids is not an excuse for being shit. Not an excuse for movies, shows, games, or books.

There are countless examples of creative books, shows and movies aimed at kids or teens that are well done, engaging, and consistent.

You don't get a free pass on plotholes, one dimensional characters, poor pacing, etc. because your target audience is ""whoever can't see this is bad""

Yes, there are topics that are meant for children, you shouldn't expect to fall in love with the premise ""10 year olds run the world for a day"" or something along those lines, or something edgy meant for teens like ""this one quirky, very special, one of a kind person doesn't fit into their oppressive society"" thats fine. If you aren't hooked by those that is ok, just doesn't appeal to you. But you can still spot good and bad writing. 

I hadn't heard people speak badly about Artemis Fowl, well about the movie perhaps, and I am not familiar with Eragon. But, divergent is a pretty silly and flawed story. It is not wrong to call it bad regardless of whether you fit the tatget demographic or not.

I think more important to remember is that you are allowed to like, even love, bad media.

For example twilight and 50 shades are pretty much universally hated and memed on by the internet. And yet, a lot of people still like them, love them even.

I didn't put myself through the books but my girlfriend likes 50 shaded and we watched the movie. Not a very good movie, but we still had fun.
I also have guilty pleasures. The DC shows forb example. The flash makes no sense, is extremely poorly paced with stupid one dimensional characters and nonsense pseudoscience that has no level of consistency. Still watched it all because the drama is serviceable and the high points are very fun to see.
I would not call it a good show, but I still love it.

We can agree that something is not that good and still love it above things that you know is better.

So you love a bad book, or loved it when you didn't know better... so what?

Yes, there will always be an element of subjectivity to art, but that doesn't mean there are no objective metrics. I think it's possible to break down pretty clearly what makes the MCU an objectively ""better"" narrative than the DCEU, and it isn't because of box offices or rotten tomato scores or number of downvotes.

Lots of people like Shakespeare (or will at least say they do) and plenty of people think it's deep and incredibly meaningful; however if you actually dissect what he's doing it's mostly just pop culture that's persisted a real long time. Clever word play, tons of dick jokes, some love stories that don't hold up to even a bit of scrutiny. Just because a lot of people believe his works are high art doesn't make it true.

I reread Eragon a couple months ago and while the writing wasn’t spectacular, I still really enjoyed it because of the nostalgia.

It doesn’t matter that the writing is subpar or the plot seems lazy because it’s not for people who are conscious of that. All they expect is to read a book about a 15 year old that can ride dragons. It’s not so serious to call it garbage just because you’re not the intended audience.",Boring_Sundae1994,2021-05-14T20:49:22Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,27
nc8wfc_28,nc8wfc,"Kind of sort of. 

I read the Eragon books when I was in high school and couldn’t finish the series. Why? It’s bad writing. It’s famous because a kid wrote it, no other reason. It’s a gimmick. 

In the case of Twilight I have found that the primary audience it resonates with are teenage girls who don’t have the experience to understand how damaging the book’s concepts are (oh my 120 year old boyfriend left me. Guess it’s normal to sink into major depression for months. Or, it’s so romantic that he breaks into my room to watch me sleep at night!) and people who have unsatisfactory marriages and they need some kind of escapist reading.  

I read a lot of YA outside of being a YA and some of it is fantastic and some of it is bad. Kind of like any type of genre. 

So while I understand the point you’re trying to make.... Does not magically make it a true blanket statement.

So people can have a problem with this books for very valid reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not they fully fall under the target audience umbrella.",Ok_Ad_6626,2021-05-14T17:32:23Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,28

nc8wfc_48,nc8wfc,"I don't know if it's just because of the timing but many of the series listed I read as a young adult. I loved some of these books. I was even aware of that with some series. As Twilight became the series to dunk on I was unabashed to say that the only reason I probably liked it was because I was the target audience. Same with Eragon by the end there.

But some series were blatantly bad. Hunger Games and House of Night are the series I can point to the most of being egregious. With Hunger Games it was a solid first book, then a rehash of most of the themes, followed by some supposed closure for a series that really didn't need the series treatment. Whereas House of Night had a fun yet cliche premise. Vampires, Mary Sue's, and implied adult content. Then it got to the point of no longer even being fun trash and more a blatant cash grab.

There is definitely a difference in target audiences in all fairness. If you stay in that target you may never know better.

The Lion King is one of the best movies of all time, and yet that, too, is not meant for me.

A lot of the books you've named are just plain bad. Twilight, for one, is 0/10. Artemis Fowl, on the other hand, gets a 6/10 - and that's because it's too immature for me. If I were of the right age for it, I'd probably rate it better. That's a clear difference between the two.

nc8wfc_54,nc8wfc,"An interesting thought, but I don't really agree. I'm 27 so a little beyond YA target audience at this point, but I've been a long-time enjoyer of YA novels. Some of those books really are much better quality than others. Most of the better written ones are enjoyed and appreciated by many adults because they have good characters, interesting story, relevant themes. Even the things that focus on themes more pertinent to teenagers than adults, like fitting in at school, puberty, youthful insecurity, etc. can still be appreciated by older people because many of us can remember what it was like to be that age and we can recognize a good portrayal when we see it.

Some YA books are entertaining, but ultimately not well-written. Some of the ones you mentioned (I haven't read all) like Eragon and Twilight, and I think Divergent are like that. They're fun to read because the characters are attractive, or have cool powers, but some of those other areas are really lacking. I can see how in that category, you would probably have more teenagers who like them and more adults who don't because adults hopefully don't enjoy lusting after attractive teenage characters and we might get more bored by the formulaic plots. But there are a lot of adult books that are poor quality like that too. People may enjoy them, but it's also totally fair for people to critique them as being bad. They're guilty pleasure books.

There are a lot of YA books I've read that I will happily re-read, recommend to people, and proudly share that I love. The guilty-pleasure ones usually make me cringe to think about now because I recognize that they were not good books and the only reason I liked them was because the main character was hot. Twilight is definitely in that latter category...

So in summary, some books are objectively better than others regardless of target audience. Most YA books that are well-written are actually very enjoyable by adults too. There are poor-quality YA books and poor-quality adult books that people might enjoy reading, but that doesn't mean they're not poor-quality.",fuzzlandia,2021-05-14T23:31:05Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,54

There's a Philip Pullman book called Clockwork, that belabours the point about how you need to wind up the story and then let it happen.  You can't try to force it in another direction.

It's often over-the-top edgy for no good reason, and contains a lot of gratuitous scenes that seem to be put in just to make it seem more ""mature"". Think unlikable characters with sexist views, backstabbing that doesn't seem to fit with character motivations, and sex scenes that just don't seem to fit with the rest of the narrative. Moreover, I've read plenty of adult novels that ramble on about things that could have easily been pared down to make the story less tedious. I want my spec fic to be fun escapism, not an overwrought, grimdark portrayal of human weaknesses.

As an aside, I thought Eragon was universally hated, but every now and again I'll come upon adult fans who not only like the book, but seemingly have no idea about the hate base surrounding it. For the longest time I thought older audiences universally hated it, but apparently not.

nc8wfc_87,nc8wfc,"Hate is probably a strong word, honestly. It's a... disappointing book. I got hooked on it at first, but after reading Eldest and having it be not great, I reread Eragon and realized how it's very much a book *written* by a teenager. It has all these ingredients I should like, but the whole product is just kinda bland. That opinion only deepened as I got older and read much better books. I hold a little bit of a grudge for that disappointment, I guess, even if it doesn't really make sense. A lot of people have similar experiences of realizing that it just wasn't as good as they thought.

It's also a popular choice for people either getting back into reading by reading the one book they remember from high school, people who are new to fantasy, or people who haven't reread it and just have nostalgia for it, which means it gets posted here a lot. I think that fosters a little resentment with a lot of the userbase.

It's totally fine to like Eragon, but it has a lot of legitimate criticisms and was a lot of people's entries into reading and fantasy, so it will always be a hotly debated topic until our generation ages out or it falls into obscurity.",SwayzeCrayze,2021-05-14T22:26:53Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,87

  If you don't like the book or think it's derivative, that's fine. Just say that. Don't just yell ""book bad, author bad!""

Ex: I love the themes and settings of Cormac McCarthy, I listen to analysis and interpretations of his works, but I just can't read the books myself. His writing style is just so unreadable to me that no amount of worldbuilding or story elements can make me read it.

nc8wfc_91,nc8wfc,"It's not just a similar ""hero's journey"" trope, most of the major plot points and character roles are almost exactly the same.


Young man who never knew his parents raised on a remote farm by his uncle finds a blue and white object sought after by the evil empire. Young man goes to senior-aged acquaintance for information and is told about the ancient order of peacekeeping warriors with mystical powers. The acquaintance was himself one of these warriors, and gives the young man one of their weapons. Agents of the empire kill young man's uncle, young man and old mentor leave on their journey together. Mentor is killed by a powerful agent of the empire, a rebel princess is rescued from prison, when the young man joins the rebels his traveling companion doesn't but still helps in the big battle. Young hero wins the big battle with a well-placed attack. After the battle, hero goes to train with a surviving member of the warrior order hiding from the empire. Leaves before his training is complete to help his friends, is defeated by emperor's right hand man, given a crippling injury, and it's revealed that they're family.

Some of the events happen a bit out of order and some of the roles played by Star Wars characters are split between multiple Eragon characters but it's all there. Luke is told right away that that his father and Obi-wan were Jedi, Eragon doesn't learn this until later. Durza and the Ra'zac play the role of the emperor's right hand in the first book, Murtagh takes over the role later and adds the family relation twist, and even betrays the emperor at the end of the series just like Vader.

I just finished rereading the series last week, it's an enjoyable series and one of my favorites, but a *lot* of the first two books reads like one of those ""Hey can I copy your homework?""

nc8wfc_96,nc8wfc,"Again, it's totally fine to like Eragon; there's lots of cheesy or bad books that are fun to read and that's totally cool. If you want to reread it to get your foot in the door, I say go for it! Always read what you *want* to read. Forcing yourself to read something just because others think it's good never ends well. If you like a book, read it. If you don't like it, put it aside and start a new one!

If you're looking for fantasy in general and something that's easily digestible, one of my first reading reccs in general is Discworld by Terry Pratchett. It's a huge series, but pretty easy to dip in to. There are several ""sub-series"" following recurring groups of characters, but you don't necessarily need to start from the beginning of any of them. I'd recommend *Small Gods* (a standalone), *Guards! Guards!* (the first in the ""City Watch"" sub-series), or *Mort* (sort of halfway between a standalone and the start of the Dᴇᴀᴛʜ sub-series). The books are mostly light-hearted, but Terry Pratchett was a master of making a book be a satire or allegory for something else, while also making it fun to read by itself, so some of the books explore some pretty deep themes. I grew up reading these and never tire of rereading. Pratchett made his characters lovable enough that it's like seeing an old friend every time. [Here's a reading order if you stick with the series.](https://i.imgur.com/VNnXF7Z.jpeg)


Another author who does easily accessible fantasy is Brandon Sanderson. If you like well built magic systems and world-building, Brando Sando is your boy. His two main series are *Mistborn* and *The Stormlight Archive*, though he has a bunch of other smaller series or standalone stuff. The majority of his books are all part of a large interconnected universe, but this is usually only shown in subtle ""Aha!"" ways. *Mistborn* is the lighter fare of the two, with borderline anime-esque action and power scaling, and is the quicker read. It has two separate narrative sections; it starts with a trilogy of books, and then there is a separate trilogy (with another book on the way!) set in a later era on the same world. The first half is mostly Victorian era and has a heavy ""we're saving the world"" feel, while era two basically goes full steampunk and has lower stakes. Book one of Era 1 is *Mistborn: The Final Empire* while book one of Era 2 is *Mistborn: The Alloy of Law*.  
*Stormlight Archive* has four books so far, and while the narrative isn't impenetrable or anything, the tone is a bit darker and more serious than Mistborn. Each book is around a thousand pages, but if you enjoy the first one (*The Way of Kings*) you'll blow right through them. They're very fun and detailed books, and have lots of depth but don't try to be any more complicated than they need to be. Brando Sando is a competent author, and I rarely find myself bored by anything he writes. I'd also recommend two short stories of his as jumping on points; *Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell* and *Sixth of the Dusk*. Both nice and bite sized while squeezing in very interesting worlds.

If you want to jump right in to some deep fantasy, I really really loved the *Liveship Traders* series by Robin Hobb. It's actually a bit like Eragon, I guess, except with sentient boats instead of dragons. They have some wonderfully developed characters, and some of the coolest worldbuilding I've ever read, at least in my opinion. There's a decent amount of life on boats, politics, and commerce stuff going on, but I never found myself bored. The first book is *Ship of Magic*.

Kind of an off the wall pick is *Spiderlight* by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It's essentially a deconstruction of the quest/prophecy narrative. The main protagonist is a giant spider and minion of the Dark, who is forcibly transmuted into a human and compelled by a Light adventuring party to guide them on their quest. It's a unique book, if a bit tongue in cheek, but I enjoyed it a lot. If you like sci-fi, he also wrote another book I love called *Children of Time*!

I'm kind of terrible at book reccs because I have a tendency to forget books unless I've seen them recently, so I can't drum up lists easy. But if there's any particular genres or needs you're looking for, I'm sure I and others in this thread will do our best to help.",SwayzeCrayze,2021-05-15T06:30:08Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,96

ebueqv_26,ebueqv,"I've heard that the teenager in the writer is really prevalent in the first book. I have not read it but something about what you said makes sense to me if you'll allow some speculation.

LotR is saturated in lore and back history which, while well conceived and documented, is ultimately a slog. At the time certain Tropes didn't exist in the mainstream as things like LotR weren't already popular enough that 1 in 5 households might have someone with approximate Middle Earth knowledge (just for context, my mom filled in a lot of gaps from the Silmarillion). Eragon, however, did not have the issue of being a trend setter.

I imagine a lot of the writing errors in Eragon come from a culture that's already pretty able to visualize a medieval fantastical world. It's like the effect the LotR movies had on the fantasy genre in film. Without those movies I doubt anyone would have done anything but turn their nose at the Game of Thrones series on HBO (even without the Sean Bean hook). I think that fantasy writing is so mainstream that authors either put in too much filler-lore (my own issue), or they themselves have such an easy time envisioning a fantasy setting that they leave out a lot of details that help build worlds because they write as though their audience can view their world through their eyes.",captain_rumdrunk,2019-12-17T16:23:34Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,26

They lack a well-designed tension and plot.  Both have too many  strange deus ex machina saving dead characters which hurts the overall story telling.  Something written by a younger writer having dreams of always winning, and losing isn't a loss, but just some strange semi-winning state.

Ed Greenwood has improved over the years.  I wouldn't considered him on par with Dragon Lance writers Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis.  But he has grown.  Maybe Christopher Paolini has grown in his writing, but after two books I pretty much had enough YA written by YA.

As for LotR... I have different issues with J.R.R. Tolkien. It is the same issues I have with modern Steven King novels.  They both need an editor.  I'm all for ""it is about the journey and not the ending.""  Which is why I honestly don't care if a book/movie is partly spoiled by knowing the ending, but when the middle seems to only semi-relate to the over all plot and it kills pacing it makes me not want to read or even listen to it on audio books.

If you like the medievalish stuff you may like The Deamon Wars Saga  by R.A. Salvatore (another good writer that came out of the TSR days).  There is a lot of good tension.  Deaths have meaning and impact, and characters you think should be dead that come back have it setup well in advance so when you get back to them you realized you missed the signs.  I'm on book 4 of this series, and so far it has been satisfying and the end of book 3 upended enough to justify a continuing series.",mouringcat,2019-12-17T16:39:17Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,27

ebueqv_29,ebueqv,"The author of Eragon himself claims that the books aren't all that amazing - and repeatedly asks people to please keep in mind how young he was when they were written.

That being said - yes, personally, I think there's a lot of stuff that was ripped off. BUT that doesn't mean it's actual plagiarism. The story is still beloved by many and the magic system, as far as I've heard from fans, is pretty darn cool. 

I have a LOT of friends who adore Eragon. And even though I'm a LotR-maniac, I blame noone who can't manage to read them. Tolkien was a linguist first, an author second, and at the end of the day it shows in his style. He tried to create a world because he realized that he can't create languages without culture and lore. 

You can enjoy whatever you like, if you ask me, as long as there's no obviously problematic messages (I'm talking romantisizing abuse, violence, racism and shit like that - none of which can be found in Eragon.)

ebueqv_30,ebueqv,Eragon was a great book for me as a kid because I didn't understand tropes and such. I tried to re read it as an adult and it just seems a little childish to me. That being said I'd compare it to the hobbit which I see similar issues with. The books after Eragon are where Paolini really hit his stride. The second book is still a little wonky and teenage angsty but it handles it really well and is the gritty book of the series. Books 3 and 4 are phenomenal writing imo. I've read the series multiple times and its a fantastic series I just as an adult can't read the first one without constantly reassuring myself that it was written by a 16 year old. Please keep reading and I'm glad you're enjoying it. I hope my comments haven't been offensive or anything.

ebueqv_31,ebueqv,"As a die-hard Tolkien fan, Eragon is also one of my favorite fantasy series. The plot and characters can definitely be a bit contrived at times, with Eldest being the worst in general opinion, but by the third and fourth books, I think Paolini really hits his stride with his world. There is a lot of in-depth exploration of the world and so many of the characters, in my view, feel like genuine people. When I finished Inheritance, I was left hungry for more, and desperately wanted to see the characters again. In my opinion, that's the mark of a good book. 

As for LotR, I've only read through the trilogy twice; once when I was 12, and the other time was last summer. I have started Fellowship so many times and gotten bogged down before I even got halfway through. The first part is a long transition, as we go from the comfortable familiarity of the hobbits and the Shire to the wider, scarier world. Once you get past Rivendell, things kick up quickly. I've found that to really enjoy it and get through it, you have to be in the right frame of mind.

He probably wasn't set to writing a financially succesful bestseller. You know what most 15 year old authors produce? Fan Fiction. I've never actually watched or cared about Star Wars, but I think one of the accusations is that Eragon has lots of plot similiarities. 

Might be an unpopular opinion, but taking someone else's ideas and changing them on the low to medium level to create your own thing is the *rule* not the exception with art, including writing novells. And this doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. 

Eragon has some great caveats, as well as obvious weaknesses. Nothing wrong in enjoying it. Something doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyable.

And even though JRR Tolkien might have been an all around intellectual and on a completely diffrent level than Paolini, I actually don't think that his writing style or the structure of his novels is that great either. Tolkien was a genius in which he created a completely new genre, but that doesn't say he was a great author, if that makes sense.",,2019-12-17T23:48:27Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,37

Reading Eragorn is unlikely to cause harm, so how could enjoying the process be considered ""bad""?  Most books aren't about Serious Business.  Most books do not aim to challenge your biases and assumptions.  Most books are not the sort of deep inspection of the human condition that might lead you incrementally closer to enlightenment.  Lord of the Rings certainly isn't.  Lord of the Rings is popcorn reading with uncertain pacing and a wooden, formal style that is often off putting to modern readers.  Reading Lord of the Rings isn't inherently ""good"" any more than reading Eragon might be inherently ""bad"".

The only bad reading is what happens when a book neither challenges you, nor entertains you.  A bad book is one that wastes your time.  Eragorn isn't wasting your time; therefore, Eragorn is a *good* book.",EclecticDreck,2019-12-18T15:02:24Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,39

There is a theory in writing that there are only 7 (I might have that number wrong) story lines.

The “hero’s journey” storyline can be used completely by accident. And Tolkien was not the first person to write a “hero’s journey” storyline. In fact, he used it at least twice.

Here are just a few hero’s journey stories.

ebueqv_45,ebueqv,"No not bad at all. It's my favorite series. Yeah sure it's a little derivative but it's not completely plagiarized. Just because he reused some story beats from other books and movies doesn't mean he didn't work hard on his creation. Dude researched a lot of old (Norse I think) to come up with a language system. Considering that he originally wrote it when he was 15 and published at 19 it's a pretty good book. And if you keep reading you can see he slowly comes into his own as a writer and gets less derivative as the series progresses. It's really only the first 2 books that borrow elements from other media.

Edit: to add to the comments about LotR I personally find that Eragon and the rest of the inheritance cycle is infinitely more accessible to readers than LotR. Yeah LotR is a classic and an progenitor of the genre but holy shit it is not a good read for someone that is just starting high fantasy. Eragon is an excellent entry into high fantasy.

So it's been pointed out that Paolini first came up with the concept for Eragon as a teenager, and I think that makes him much less culpable for any kind of wrongdoing since we all know teenagers lack the ability to reason effectively. Still not cool, but kids will make mistakes, it's just a part of growing up.

Secondly, I haven't touched the series in about a decade so I'm really not recalling anything blatantly plagiaristic, but after I post I'll look into it and see (how wrong I probably am, lol). However, maybe some people here will be familiar with a non-fiction writer Joseph Campbell, who coined the idea of the 'monomyth'. This idea is that myths, legends and narratives about heroes all contain the same basic structure of 17 steps through three acts. It's a little on the nose that people keep mentioning that Eragon is very similar to Star Wars, since George Lucas has said on the record that Campbell's work strongly influenced his own.  


So, if the charge is being derivative of Star Wars and that's a bad thing or makes it a bad story, then I'd say that argument is flawed because Star Wars in and of itself is derivative of the bible, and other preceding works.",Ethical_Existential,2019-12-17T15:48:52Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,68

I think it’s a bit more sophisticated than Eragon is, but I don’t think it’s unapproachable...definitely in the middle-young adult age range (although I am re-reading them at 23 and I love them).

ebueqv_83,ebueqv,"Actually you may enjoy *The Once and Future King* series. The books start with *The Sword in the Stone* (is the source for the Disney adaptation) and is made with young readers in mind but the series kinda grows up with the reader culminating in The Book of Merlyn (Yes, they spell it like that) which kinda like a Symposium that takes place the night before the Strife of Camlann.

In the matter of *Lord of the Rings* i find it understandable maybe try the hobbit first it's a lighter read.

Also in the general matter of ""Is it bad to like something"" I would say no. You can like whatever you like but I find interesting searching why I like something. Eragon could be seen as bad to some people maybe because they find it too  derivative of fantasy tropes but there isn't nothing wrong with the book by itself.

Like I definitely think as far as author recognition goes, if its blatantly obvious that a story has some roots in someone elses work, a nod should be customary. But at the end of the day, it doeant matter how many experts get together to say who should get credit, its the audience that determines how successful a book is. If it sells, it sells. LOTR is a hard series to read, and i think Eragon, while maybe not original, is much easier to swallow.

m2o6sm_1,m2o6sm,"Short answer : nostalgia.

Longer answer:
The real reason a lot of us adults praise it is because Eragon was our intro into fantasy.
When I first read it I had never read anything else (other than watching LoTRs growing up) so Eragon came across fresh, exciting and had characters my age doing magic with dragons. I loved that shit and still do.


The issue is it doesn't hold up to time, nor would it be anywhere near as interesting for someone who has read fantasy previously. It's tropey, very clearly inspired by other stories such as Star Wars, The Pern series, Lord of the Rings, and other massive classics you may have read.

I first read eragon in my mid 30s and loved all 4 of the books (no nostalgia or teen-taste in my case). Tastes are different and if its not for you, fine. Doesn't make it a bad story. Just not your kind of story. 

There are plenty of books that have been hyped that I didn't like either. And I might vomit if I ever have to read another book by my best friends favourite author.

My point is, wouldn't it be boring if we all had the same taste? You don't have to like books because other people like it.

It does feel like it’s following a formula: everyday hero with special sauce, a mentor, a rebel leader love interest, and an overpowered evil dictator whose death will solve absolutely everything wrong with the world.   The dragon fills the spot of ‘companion who will never abandon/judge you’.  

But I don’t see that as an issue with the story itself, simply an old formula playing itself out time and time again.   They are tropes for a reason.  

I still see the ghost of that story structure appear time and time again across movies, books, and even writing reference books in regards to plot and structure.  

Eragon was a trailblazer in another sense: the author was a teen, who self published the first book.  I don’t know if he was the first to self publish, break into traditional, and become a bestseller—but he’s the oldest example I can think of.  

I was just graduating HS when the first Eragon came out, or thereabouts.   So for me, it was a YA novel, or at the least a New Adult one.   As such, it holds a place on my shelf—although if another book followed all of those tropes I’d likely not read past 100 pages, either.",Intrepid_Fortune_1,2021-03-11T11:56:50Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,5

Do I think Eragon is great literature? Of course not, but, I enjoyed reading it. Similarly, I also enjoyed Twilight and The Hunger Games, even the newest one that everyone likes to hate. 

There are some authors I just despise reading- Nicholas Sparks, James Patterson, Stuart Woods.. I can't even really put my finger on why I hate reading them and then loved reading something like Eragon. 

Similarly, I HATE lima beans. I don't know why I hate lima beans, I simply think they are the most despicable food known to man. I love arugula and brussels sprouts which my husband feels are poisonous crap suited only for the trash can. 

I guess the point that I'm making is that there are great works, which you should suffer through occasionally because they tell you something important. But, you can pick more agreeable ones from among the classics, different vegetables that you find more to your taste, you don't have to eat the lima beans even among the great classics.

m2o6sm_8,m2o6sm,"Funnily enough, I just finished rereading Eragon like a day ago. I had read  the series as a teenager and young adult and had fond-ish memories of it and wanted to reread it to see how my outlook on it had changed 15 years down the line. 

I know that it gets a lot of hate on this sub but I found it rather enjoyable. I think the thing I liked most about it was how easy it was. Coming off of Malazan, it was a breathe of fresh air. It was really nice not having to work my brain trying to figure out what was happening. I could just plug in my headphones and enjoy my daily walk, and focus on other things if I felt like it. The prose were evocative in their simplicity, and I think the themes and plot reflect that. 

Most interesting to me was how it made me reflect on what I thought when I was younger. It’s pretty clear that Eragon was written before the author had had a lot of life experience, and you can see that in the way Eragon reacts to things in the book, such as lamenting why a god would let his uncle die. I can see why that might turn others off, but it reminded me of similar thought that I had when I was that age as well. Now that I’m more than double the age that I was when I read it, I can see that the world is more complicated and nuanced.

I think that it jives with young adults. In terms of quality I would recommend the Inheritance trilogy to young adults or someone just dipping their toes into fantasy. It’s not as clever or well written as Harry Potter, and IMO that’s fine. It doesn’t need to be. If it’s not your cup of tea, that’s fine. Just find something that does reflect your taste. Life is too short to waste on something you won’t enjoy.

To answer your question: it does get better but not so much that if you didn’t enjoy the first one, I don’t know that you would enjoy the later entries.",zombiebrains88,2021-03-11T21:40:21Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,8

There are a great many immemorable books. Books that are maybe popular for a season, but, then you never see them mentioned again. Any book that is still being brought up regularly 15 years after it's publish date is at least a memorable book. So many books are published every year, for a book to still come up regularly more than a decade after publishing likely means there was something about it that stuck with people. 

Twilight and Hunger Games were sensations before the movies, Eragon was a smaller sensation in spite of its' terrible movie.

m2o6sm_41,m2o6sm,"> I think a lot of people have trouble understanding that their personal preferences don't actually mean a book is good or bad.

I agree. 

I couldn't finish Jane Austen's *Emma*, although I know people who love it. It's not that I don't think it has any merit whatsoever, it just didn't engage *me*. 

It doesn't matter how ""good"" a book is, not everyone's going to like it. Yet for something like Eragon, some people just blankly state, ""objectively bad book"", when it's a book that speaks to other people. 

Unlike OP, I've not seen the threads full of praise for Eragon here - only the criticism. It feels like a circlejerk to me at this point; a book/series that a lot of people like to crap on, or state that they read it in their teens but hate it now. 

I'm not claiming that Eragon is some great work of literature. I'm just saying I enjoyed it. I absolutely accept the criticisms of the book - the Hero's Journey, copying Star Wars but with dragons, tropey, etc, and don't deny any of those criticisms. I'm certainly not blind to its faults. But this sub seems to have a problem with anyone enjoying Eragon, just because *they* don't like it.",glitterswirl,2021-03-11T15:17:16Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,41

That said, I think he put too much stock in the “never return” part of the prophecy. He’s a different person at the end of book 4 than he was when it was made in book 1, so it may not even apply at all. I mostly expect him to come back after the riders are on a good footing, and/or if a suitable threat arises.!<

>!I didn’t personally have a problem with the vault of souls. Like yeah, it was pretty telegraphed that it would contain Eldunari, but I didn’t mind.

I hadn’t re-read them since then, but about a month ago, I didn’t have a next audio book queued up after I finished one, and I saw Eragon on Audible, so I got it, then quickly went through the rest of the series. 

If you like audiobooks, I can mostly recommend them. My only problem with them was that I greatly disliked the voice the narrator did for all the dragons, but especially for Saphira. It was a horrendous, rumbly, gargling marbles type voice. Very jarring when I always mentally read Saphira’s thoughts as at least somewhat feminine.

4yg3vm_3,4yg3vm,"Eragon was okay, at best, for me. It was one of my early fantasy books and I did end up finishing it. The problem as someone else mentioned was that he took so long. By the time the later books were coming out, I had already read more fantasy by better authors. Going back to finish the series was difficult for me, and I never felt a desire to re-read them. Anyways, here's a list of books that I have read multiple times, or I will read again if I ever stop looking for new fantasy:

- Malazan Book of the Fallen (re-read is almost required to appreciate the depth of the story)

- Wheel of Time 

- Chronicles of Amber

- The First Law trilogy and the other books in same world

- The Broken Empire

- Acts of Caine (similar sci-fi and fantasy blend like CoA)

- Farseer Trilogy

- The Long Price Quartet



Those are my definite re-reads, but here are a few other series I've read and enjoyed:

- The Black Company Trilogy (later books are okay, but first three are great)

- Mistborn

- The Seventh Sword

- The Dagger and The Coin

- The Sword of Truth (maybe) - It's been a long while since I read this one and I know there's a lot of politics and philosophy the author tries to force on you. But there's just something about Richard with the Temper that I find nostalgic. Plus Zedd's ""nothing is ever easy"" is one of the best sayings I've ever found in a fantasy book. 



Lastly, I hate myself when I start reading series that aren't finished, but these are series that I've started and am excited to see wrap up:

- Starlight Archive

- The Gentleman's Bastards

- The Fitz and The Fool

- ASOIAF (if I'm honest here, I thought the last two books were not that great and did not move the plot forward at all. That said, I enjoy the TV show so much that I'll have to finish the series) 

- Kingkiller Chronicle (minus the incredibly awkward sex scene in the second one)",,2016-08-19T12:43:07Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,3

My problem with the Eragon series is that it's very blatantly a mash up of LOTR, Star Wars, and Dune. I tried re-reading the first book a while back, and just couldn't get over it. ",tahmatwork,2016-08-19T11:55:06Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,4

4yg3vm_8,4yg3vm,"Someone at my work who knew I was a fantasy fan recommended Eragon to me and pitched it as a light YA fantasy book. I figured why not and read it over the course of a few days. As I read it I enjoyed it enough, but wouldn't use anything stronger than ""okay"" to describe it. But when I finished the book it dawned on me that I just read, almost plot point to plot point, A New Hope just set in a middle-earth like setting. Now I understand the Hero's Journey isn't anything new and Star Wars wasn't the most original thing either, but the similarities were just insane. 

Fast forward a while later and I gave Eldest a shot. While it didn't follow Empire Strikes Back as closely it still covered all the main points, wrapped up in a really boring book with an insufferable protagonist. Eragon goes from sounding like a mature level headed individual to a bratty kid in a span of a couple pages a whole lot in that book. 

In the end I felt compelled to finish what I started so I checked the third book out from the library. But then it starts with the main characters planning a rescue mission and I just couldn't do it. I returned it an hour later.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the series. As for series I've been captivated enough to do rereads: Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire, Kingkiller Chronicle, The Dark Tower.

ithob8_30,ithob8,"It feels that Eragon doesn't grow as a character from the start of the second book all the way to just before the end of the fourth, where he suddenly becomes woke. He's a whiny baby in the first book, which is understandable, but he maintains that throughout the entire story. Book 2, waaahh my back hurts. Book 3, waaahh my sword is gone and my dad is a dick.

I also despised Rorans parts in Book 2. I think when I re read the books I just outright skipped those chapters. Learning cool new Elf lore, lets take a bit of a break to look at Roran, fuck no.

I really didn't like how he handled he problems he introduced. The biggest offender being the final battle with the big bad dude. Guy is built to be unbelievably strong. Utterly unkillable realistically. Oh but it's fine because the heroes find a weapon right at the start of the 4th book which bypasses all magic wards. Wow that was lucky. So he's solved his problem right here, pretty shit way to solve it but w/e. But THEN he makes the bad guy even stronger so that weapon is now useless against him and he has to generate another cop out, except the weapon would have at least given an epic battle at the end the second cop out kills the bad guy by making him feel bad. It's like he tried to do it like how the Palps dies in the ROTJ but it just falls flat on its face.

Similarly with his back problems. It just gets magiked away near the end of book 2 for reasons. It's not like he even grows as a character, right after he gets his back fixed he just goes and breaks the arm of one of his sparring partners. Our hero ladies and gentlemen.

The lore and world building is great though. A lot of cool interesting things that were never covered but could be done in other books. I always wondered, since you can't lie in the Ancient language, what happens if you say a paradox.",Nickizgr8,2020-09-16T08:50:43Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,30

I really wanted to read this book as soon as I heard about it specifically because of how much I didn't like Eragon. I knew he wrote it when he was much younger, and I was curious so see if he improved (he did!). 

I am a librarian, so I probably have different reasons for choosing a book than others might have. I read a variety of topics and genres to keep my breadth of literature nice and wide. I also know that many of my patrons are going to be interested in To Sleep in a Sea of Stars because of it's author, and I wanted to be able to have a better discussion about it with them. 

The story is really fun and engaging, and I think technology fans will have some really interesting opinions, because I couldn't tell if the science stuff was total crap or actually potentially possible. The last 5% or so of the book is Paolini going real deep into explaining his book's technology, so if you're having trouble understanding something, flip back there to read more about it.

Not through something as easy to point out as breaking into Gringotts or the ministry, but rather through all it took to have a shot at learning his true name. Him learning that in Vroengard might have not been very exciting, but I think that was a journey that had gone on for such a long time. So many times he struggled to look past his own feelings and recognise what it meant to be a leader figure in Varden, or to be good enough for Arya. To realize that he would never return to being just a farmer when it was all said and done. I kinda look at this all as his journey to enlightenment and understanding his overall quest, and himself. So, I found learning his true name like a long process that was rewarding to read in the way it paid off in finding the dragon hearts.  

&#x200B;

But either way, what I want to get at is that even with the things he got, they were not in themselves enough. He gained so much power and yet it was not close to enough to straight up overpower Galbatorix. In the end, he needed to find a way to use the power in a smart way to make up for the lack of power. And I could see why there would be differing opinions on whether the way Paolini did it was satisfying or not, but to me it mostly was - I think much because I would have not expected Eragon to figure this out earlier in his life, before all the personal growth that I do think he had.",Iceman6789,2020-09-16T21:35:48Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,56

And part of what makes the plot slow is Paolini tried doing world building. If you think Eragon is slow, reread Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time. Any time you try to build a new world, you have to take time to describe it and use lots of exposition to give the reader (a newcomer to the world) a feel for what it's like. That's why Eragon is so ""slow"" but Eldest was faster-paced. He didn't have to do as much exposition as the world was already established in the first book.

It's not great literature, but it is a remarkably impressive work by a 14-year-old nonetheless. As far as the fantasy I've read goes, it's about in the middle of the pack. It's not the head of the pack, but it's hardly the worst.",super_ag,2017-01-09T13:48:52Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,3
5mwuw2_4,5mwuw2,"Funny that you recall people praising the books; I remember when they came out that everything I heard about them was overwhelmingly, ""They aren't very good. Just watch Star Wars and read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter instead."" There definitely was a lot of hype about how young Paolini was when he wrote the first book, and I have to admit that is impressive, but I feel like they've always been largely seen as pretty mediocre at best compared to almost any other fantasy series out there.

I think the source of their popularity has been primarily that: 

1) the author was very young, 

2) the books are very clearly geared toward young kids and, despite their wall-of-text exposition, are fairly accessible, easy reads compared to a lot of other fantasy (e.g. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Ursula LeGuin, George R.R. Martin, etc.), and 

3) they are entirely dragon-focused as a series in a way that wasn't really seen since Anne McCaffrey's *Dragonriders of Pern* books (and *Eragon* is more accessible that McCaffrey's books, as above). 

Yes, there are other books about dragons. Tons of them. But I think *Eragon* struck a nerve in a way that pretty much none of those other books did. When I was a little kid, I tried reading through the *Pern* books and was just totally baffled by... most everything. I still am (I'm really, really not a fan of them), but I was even more so then as a 6th grader. I imagine that if *Eragon* had come out then, I'd probably be obsessed with it too. I read lots of stuff that isn't particularly original or well-written (some of the *Star Wars* EU books, some of the BattleTech/Mechwarrior books, etc.), and it never occurred to me that some of it wasn't very good until years and years of reading it when I started to notice that people were relying more on repeating the same cliched, comfortable phrasing (if I see *one more* laser described as an ""emerald beam"" or ""ruby spear"" ""piercing"" anything, I'm gonna scream) than trying to create something really engaging.

I think *Eragon* hasn't aged well, but it wasn't really all that good to begin with. It's not an issue of it ""not holding up""; the problem here is not time passing, though time certainly hasn't *helped* it either. I think if you're a little kid obsessed with dragons and need some heavily-detailed-yet-accessible action fantasy, *Eragon* and the other books in the series fit the bill, and that's about it.",nova_cat,2017-01-09T19:04:42Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,4

5mwuw2_6,5mwuw2,"They were never that good to begin with, and I say that as someone who loved them when I was younger.  They're not a bad jumping-off place for kids to get into the fantasy genre, but even then, there are much better YA fantasy series out there- Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, Percy Jackson, anything by Garth Nix, etc.  If it had come out 10-15 years sooner when the market was less saturated, it might have been more relevant, but the time it came out (and more importantly, by the time it wrapped up), there was enough good YA fantasy that it didn't really have much reason to exist.

I will say this: if you look at the books from a meta perspective, you can practically see Paolini growing up, especially because Eragon is such an obvious self-insert protagonist.  The first book reads like it was written by a kid- it has a basic plot, a derivative setting, absolute black-and-white morality, a main character who acts almost exclusively in service of the plot, generally with little thought or reason.  The second book feels like it was written by a college student.  Eragon starts being introspective and much more angst-ridden, and becomes a fairly militant vegetarian and atheist (traits commonly associated with obnoxious college students) seemingly out of nowhere.  By the time the later books rolled around, everything had leveled out somewhat- the story became less morally absolute, the main character started acting like an adult and reigned in his overbearing stereotypical-college-student values, and the story became less predictable/generic.",Volcanicrage,2017-01-09T18:27:34Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,6

1. The companion should be dragon. Dragons are very different from fictional mosters like pokemon or real life animals. They are very well known to everybody as they are very common in fantasy worlds. They are very powerful and can be somewhat compared to real beings unlike pokemon who I always found so far from real as possible. Thus dragons are especially appealing as a companion, at least to me when I was younger. Also you can fly a dragon, that's just badass.

5mwuw2_21,5mwuw2,"I definitely agree with you on that, people should always be encouraged to read and make an opinion for themselves - in a way it is even good to experience bad literature, because it informs our opinion of what good literature is. And about your earlier comment, I admit I was a bit unfair when I said what I said and I too can think of at least a few fantasy books which are definitely good, just off the top of my head. What I meant to say in my original comment, in a very clumsy way, is that the people that give Eragon a bad rap are perhaps the same people that then praise countless other samey fantasy books just because they're more ""adult"", for lack of a better term. People shouldn't complain about bad writing in a book and then give a free pass to another just because the lack of quality is well hidden beneath a shiny layer of bombast. The genre will never reach its true potential like that.

P.S. I still like to remember the Eragon series to this day because it acknowledged a simple point that nevertheless most fantasy books, isolated in a ""continent"" which is really just a ~500x500km square, fail to make: that there is a wider world and large unknown swaths of planet which are completely and rightly unconcerned and unaffected by whatever the big baddie wants to do to our heroes and whatever small province they find themselves in.",JackJacko87,2017-01-09T19:09:15Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,21

The second and third could've been shortened and combined. They got a bit bloated and purple-prose-y. I don't enjoy them because not much happens. They were way gorier than the first as well, which was always seemed an odd choice to me.

Four was solid. I don't think it was amazing, but I did like how they defeated Galbatorix in an unexpected and creative way. Heck, nothing about the way it ended was the way I expected, so kudos to Paolini for defying expectations in a way that was still logical.

What, besides LotR, qualifies as ""real fantasy"" according to them? If it's stuff like LotR, *all* of that stuff has tons of rip-offs of the LotR trilogy. Authors don't even realize that they're doing it half the time, I think.

I don't like Eragon mostly for stylistic reasons. I remember writing criticisms of the writing style in the margins of my sister's copy shortly after it came out when we were in middle school (we collaborated on the criticisms, and I'm sure they're about as cringeworthy as you'd expect from two middle school girls). They weren't unfair criticisms. Paolini himself acknowledged some of the weaknesses in interviews, even at the time. The plot was also really predictable. But people who like it aren't somehow reading ""fake fantasy."" 

It's not masterfully written, but it's not like enjoying something that's not written for a college lit class somehow makes you not a reader.

7twt8q_3,7twt8q,"I recently reread the Inheritance Cycle several months ago, having read each book only once since they were released. I knew going in that these books wouldn't hold up all that well from what I remember. Even then I wasn't the biggest fan of Brisingr and Inheritance when they were released.

With this reread, I do think a lot of the criticism thrown at this series does have a lot of merit behind it. There is merit in discussing why these just don't work.

I also don't think Paolini deserves any hate or bashing for simply publishing his fiction. It wasn't his fault that it got as popular as it did. There's really nothing offensive in or about the series. 

To be honest, I don't think you argue your opinion well enough in this write-up. I'll take your Deus Ex Machina section as one example. No where do you argue why it shouldn't be considered one beyond it plays into a certain theme, which I think it doesn't. 

Eragon getting his back healed by the dragons is most definitely is a  Deus Ex Machina. It does come out nowhere with no foreshadowing. That's not something up for debate.

It destroys all potential moving forward as Eragon doesn't have to deal with it. Proactively make Eragon's journey dealing with this injury pointless. It also doesn't strengthen your whole idea that the series about dealing with scars. It does the opposite, it removes a scar in a very contrived way. 

I've never thought of nor heard of the empathy spell being called a Deus Ex Machina, but it does kind of come out of nowhere. I found that whole section disappointing for entirely different reasons. 

I'm glad you enjoy this series and it holds a special place in your heart. Nobody who criticizes these books is trying to take that away from you. Those people just want to discuss why the book didn't work for them.

7twt8q_4,7twt8q,"I only read the first book, and I read it when I was fifteen (six years ago) so I can't comment on specifics, but I do remember that I didn't like it. It reminded me too much of my own writing at the time. Part of this was something you mentioned, advertisers making Paolini out to be some prodigy, when his writing was like anything my friends were writing at the time, only in novel form.

Based on what I remember, I don't think you could argue that Eragon is a ""good"" book, ie. That it has any literary merit. You're right that many authors borrow tropes, and that no art is created in a vacuum, but, from what I remember, Paolini doesn't bring anything remarkable to his take on the things he borrows. His work reads like a teenager who really liked fantasy decided to dedicate some time to writing a book, because that's what it is.

Ultimately though, I don't think any of this matters. What matters is that these books meant something to you. They don't need to be ""good"" to be enjoyed. There are plenty of things that I love that aren't considered ""good"", like the 2000’s remake of The Prisoner. I think it's awesome, but lots of people think it suck, and lots more have never even heard of it.

7twt8q_6,7twt8q,"The online Eragon hate circlejerk is actually a big part of what got me involved in literary discussion. Almost all the small book-related sites I used to read were full of people complaining about the series and the author, often in comical, over-the-top ways, some of which were quite unfair.

Recently I've gone back and read some of this type of content again (""sporkings,"" reviews, enormous screeds, etc). Much of it doesn't hold up very well. It's the 2000's equivalent of smug YouTube video essays about why some movie is dumb because of ""plot holes"" or whatever. A lot of the things that get insulted are either not *that* bad, or else not bad at all. Stuff that gets called ""bad"" is often only ""bad"" by the standards of commonly-repeated rules of thumb that are *regularly* broken by great classic literature. This type of content tends to fixate on tropes, cliches, plot holes, or extremely shallow criticism that can be reduced to a flowchart (""How much agency does the main character have? Are they a Mary Sue? What about the Bechdel Test? Does the author use adverbs too much? What about too many dialogue tags? Do they use the word 'is' more than 4x per page?""). In turn, this sort of fixation can prevent young writers from understanding what is or isn't working in their own prose. You start to think of ""good writing"" as a set of rules rather than the subtler aspects of a text.

In general, this content seems to cater to young, insecure aspiring writer types who resent the success of works that seem mediocre to them and are also afraid of producing ""bad"" content themselves. They gravitate towards snark and mockery, in particular towards anything even slightly ""purple"" (such as Eragon) and/or emotionally charged, whether or not it's particularly bad. That can come out of discomfort with anything that appears to be ""trying too hard."" And the focus on rules or tropes can be a comforting tool to make a person feel like there's a formula to literature.

With all that said, I have to give this type of content credit for getting me interested in actually writing, first with short stories and novellas, and most recently (and many years later) a draft of a manuscript (which is probably significantly worse than Eragon, but that's what rewrites are for). I also took a lot of English classes in college, and really loved that experience.

It's probable that spending time with more ""serious"" or productive book-related stuff is also what started moving me away from the sporkers, TV Tropes, etc. and into other types of discussions, especially in real life. But I still have to fondly remember that ""community"" for doing so much to advance my interests in books and writing in the first place. However, people should be careful not to *stay* in this stage or this mode of thinking for too long. It's fine to start there, it's fine to come back and visit sometimes, but ultimately it's not a healthy way of thinking.

I know you're mostly talking about the Eragon books themselves, but you're also thinking about the criticism, and this topic has been on my mind lately.

On your point about Brom I think if anything he's more inspired by Thom than anything else. 

I think the series was sort of polarizing because it seemed like it took forever for Paolini to finish writing the series when I was a kid. I think I read Eragon in late elementary school a year or so after it came out, then Eldest as soon as it was released then it seemed like I was waiting forever. By the time Inheritance came out I was really too old (I think 17-18) to be reading the series for the first time and had read much more mature fantasy so the ending wasn't as impactful to me. I think a lot of people around my age share the sentiment. 

I haven't gone back and read it because I haven't been especially inspired to. But there are other stories that are suitable for a similar age group (Redwall and The Edge Chronicles namely) that I go back and reread parts of every so often that have just aged so much better for me and I think were so much more creative.

For the empathy spell, I think it was properly foreshadowed in Shapira's memory of Brom, when he tells Eragon that defeating the king won't be a matter of raw power, but of seeing a weakness that Galbatorix could never think of.

I don't recall anything that you've mentioned here when I reread Eldest. Eragon didn't develop PTSD from his fight with Durza. I remember Eragon creating the poem just to be a gift and not some elaborate capstone to an emotional arc.

I don't have a problem with the idea of an empathy spell, just everything leading up to it leaves the moment makes it anti-climatic and boring. Eragon never engages with the real series antagonist in any kind of meaningful way or struggle.  

I don't think Paolini used this piece of set-up when he wrote Eragon defeating Galbatorix in this manner. Also, it's not foreshadowing in a sense. A key component to Brom's advice is that in order for Eragon to find a weakness, he had to understand how his opponent thought, view the world, etc. 

When Eragon fires off the spell, he doesn't come from a place of understanding anything about Galbatorix. It wasn't written like ""Ah hah, I figured out something about you in this moment so if I worded my spell this way it will bypass this ward."" 

The way that Eragon begins the idea for the spell isnt' because he suddenly understands that Galbatorix lacks empathy.

He didn't write, edit, and publish in the span of a year. He took two years to edit the book, another year to self-publish with his parents and another year before it gets picked up by Knopf/Random House. Which would put Paolini at being around 19 when the book everybody knows as Eragon is published to the wide world.",,2018-02-02T18:08:20Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,18

154y32e_5,154y32e,"I agree, he’s a low-tier writer. He got a modicum of success as a kid, because his parents published Eragon for him, then took him on a US tour to sell it. The book was picked up by Carl Hiaasen’s stepson, who showed it to him, and Hiaasen took it to Knopf to see if it could be published. So, the man who wrote ‘Strip Tease’, the novel that the Demi Moore movie was based on, was solely responsible for Eragon being published. 

Then it blew up because he was 16 with a published book. That’s it. They’re not original, they’re not well-written, and Paolini, in his head, has equated this fad-success for true talent. In the world of the written word, Paolini is a fidget spinner, a Giga-Pet, or some Pogs. Temporarily mildly entertaining, and soon, easily forgotten and discarded.

154y32e_7,154y32e,"This isn’t bitterness. This is disappointment. I could write a response four times that length on why I like Jim Butcher. I think a lot of people don’t realize that the author of Striptease (whose movie got a 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, a whole 3% lower than Eragon) is the sole reason we can even discuss Paolini. I don’t understand the fascination, and I definitely can’t comprehend how one was elected to become a film in the first place. If a writer is subpar, that’s worth noting as much as a great writer. Bad reviews are nothing more than constructive criticism if one reads between the lines.

For example, Butcher. I love the Dresden Files. I devoured Changes when it came out, easily my favorite book of the series. His prequel, A Restoration Of Faith, wasn’t compelling at all, and the character of the little girl wasn’t believable. Storm Front was much better, but he was still getting in his stride. Fool Moon was even better than Storm Front, and I liked how it really put some definition into Karrin Murphy. And he consistently got better with every book. 

My point is, as bad as Restoration was, it wasn’t terrible, and it wasn’t Butcher at the top of his game. Paolini is confined to ripping off tropes and flaunting his weak vocabulary, insistent that somewhere in his drivel, there’s a bestseller. And nothing points this particular fact out more than that although both Butcher and Paolini are both NYT Bestseller authors, Jim Butcher has three Hugos and a Locus, as well as three Dragons against Paolini’s single nomination for a German award, which he lost, as well as that the NYT Bestseller List is hardly objective and easily manipulated. Just look at how ‘Triggered’ and ‘Real Marriage’ made it onto the list.

Is Paolini the worst writer I’ve ever read? Not hardly. Does he seem willing to accept any criticism, constructive or otherwise? Nope. Every subsequent book from Eragon follows the same tropes and same gaping plot holes, showing that despite the consistent outcries against his usage of stale plot, he considered himself above devising any shred of originality. This is nothing but hubris, no doubt caused by having his ego padded beyond his means and ability from a young age.

Had he took the unpublished Eragon manuscript for peer review from more accomplished authors, they would have pointed this out to him. He could have honed himself, become a better writer, and published later when he was more mature. Instead, he rushed it, and his parents are more at fault than he is, as they should have been the voices of reason and experience in this situation.

You might be thinking, “Who is he to talk about the accomplishments of a published author?” I’m an author too. Unpublished, of course. My book that I’m working on is well over 500 pages, likely to be 600-700 when complete, mostly block text. I haven’t bothered to break it into chapters because it’s still in the works, and I’ve been refining it, off and on, for 20 years. I’ve brought in editors, and people of every race, sex, religion, and nationality mentioned in the book to ensure that the dialogue is necessary and believable. I’ve had three friends who are authors (Two of which are published) to read, review, and give notes on the manuscript, all of which I took to heart and made any suggested changes within reason. In fact, I wasn’t going to publish at all until one of them suggested that I try. Originally, I was going to self-publish an extremely limited run for friends and family.

But after all of that work, I’m still not comfortable publishing, and likely won’t be for years. This amount of dedication to the craft for my single book is more than Paolini has dedicated to any one of his books, by far. And it’s obvious to us as readers. If he cannot muster the commitment needed to write a book worth reading, why should we commit to reading said book? Paolini could be better. He should be better. But he won’t. His ‘star-power’ alone is enough to guarantee sales, and that’s fine with him. Like I said, disappointment.",Shadpool,2023-07-23T06:59:46Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,7

wd2a7f_1,wd2a7f,"Researchers of literature have determined that there are only six basic story types:

1. Rags to riches – a steady rise from bad to good fortune  
2. Riches to rags – a fall from good to bad, a tragedy  
3. Icarus – a rise then a fall in fortune  
4. Oedipus – a fall, a rise, then a fall again  
5. Cinderella – rise, fall, rise  
6. Man in a hole – fall, rise

So it's not that any book is a ""clone"" of any other book (well, some are poor imitations), but that the basic story TYPE is the same.  Star Wars (the first movie), Harry Potter, Eragon, all fit type number 1 - a steady rise from bad to good fortune. Humble beginnings to success.

Starwars, particularly luke, and Harry Potter do share a lot of plot beats, I agree. From an orphan to being picked up and taught magic to defeat the big bad in the universe. They meet the 5 class types along the way, and establish an army. Lackey has several series that hits all these plot points too, including one that takes place at a magic school and one that takes place with a wise elder in the woods. Feist as well. Prachett makes fun of these exact plot points.

Prachett is always good for lampshading a thing. It's skill I would put on par with Weird Al, sometimes the parody is a work of art that transcends the act of parody it was conceived as.

Fiest I don't know much of, though I might have once had a TTRPG book based on his universe. Never played it but probably mixed and matched with some GURPS content to build adventure ideas for other games.

The magic school can find it's parallel in earthsea, though I think they are handled differently enough to not really share much beyond the idea of the school for wizards. Just like telepathically linked dragons and riders are shared 'costuming' between Pern and Eragon but don't quite qualify them as 'clones'. like using different hair, beards, color accents and code names to make different characters using the same base :D .

I'd be hard pressed to  come up with real Narnia, LotR, or Thomas Covanent clones. Though I suppose it's in part that I may just not have encountered them personally. 

LotR might be seen by some to be heavily cloned, in that it established most of modern fantasy. But that feels more like the set and the pieces to me, and not the story that are reused. For me to see it as a LotR clone, it would need an unassuming group who are ideal because of their unassuming nature, to take up the burden of going into a world of more powerful beings in a larger realm, to destroy a macguffn that is nigh indestructable and offers power to it's holder that can and has corrupted others. and along the way have the mischievious and bumbling duo, the simple loyal best friend, a grumpy veteran, and the reluctant heir to a throne and his love for somebody set up to be impossible for their love to be. etc. we could miss a few of the story beats and combine or split certain characters, but in the end I should be able to describe both stories with the same description.",doinwhatIken,2022-08-01T03:40:00Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,4

I do think this criticism is overused, but I don't think it makes it any less true. Eragon is most definitively derivative (to the point where it does actively hurt his story) in every sense of the word, especially for the fantasy genre. Whether or not he plagiarized is an entirely different issue that's up to the individual person. More accomplished authors can weave their influences into something unique and wholly original. It's entirely understandable why Paolini wouldn't be creative as other authors. He didn't have the experience as he was so young.

>Hero With a thousand faces was ripped off of just as much by Star Wars  as Eragon supposedly ripped off Star Wars. LoTR ripped off just as much  from fantasy works from 1890 - 1940 as it did (christ LoTR was a world  made for a language he wasn't even trying to be uniquely original with  it). Lovecraft uses direct names from earlier authors like with Carcosa.

5v2fev_3,5v2fev,"I thought Eragon was mediocre based on critique which has already been listed here. However, there are certain people to whom I ALWAYS recommend reading it. My husband is not a strong reader. When we (listened to audible CD) Eragon together, he loved the story. He thought it was really good and couldn't stop listening. He was really enjoying it and wanted to see what would happen next. Eragon is great for struggling readers or young readers new to the genre! Because it's written in a very accessible manner. Yes, there are certainly a lot of similarities between Eragon and other fantasy novels like Lord of the Rings. But for someone new to reading, it's easy for them to pick out and follow. The story is really interesting and I think it provides a great starting point to get a reluctant reader interested in that style of story, and familiarize them with what to look for in a ""typical"" sword and sorcery fantasy world. My husband loved it as one of his first fantasy novels, and was able to move on to Mistborn and The Name of the Wind, so I often recommend this book for young readers or ""male college graduate who hasn't read a book since elementary school"" because I think it's perfect for these kinds of readers.",yaybiology,2017-02-20T10:08:18Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,3

""Oh, well he's young"" is not a good defense in my opinion for what I may view, personally, as lackluster or subpar writing. In response to your second reply to my comment suggesting that Eragon only got good reviews, the wikipedia article cites numerous critical reviews, and states that reactions were mixed critically - as they should be. Ultimately there should be mixed feelings, because writing is subjective, and what some view as good writing may very well be seen as horrible writing by others. I like this, all art is subjective and our view of art is influenced by our own experiences, influences and other interests in related and unrelated areas. I don't want to go on and on about this, I just hope you can understand that it is unfair to call someone unintelligent simply because they genuinely think that the writing is subpar: a feeling I hold myself.

And so we find ourselves at the end of this grand cycle (formally trilogy) of books. And what resolution has this author provided? A cop out magic fix all. A word soooooooooooo powerful that it can just fix everything, animals not having true names, destruction, memories no doubt, crushing a mad king. Its great and somehow its still overshadowed in the end. As we watch the main character, our dear friend Eragon, gather up the reamaing plot (a horde of dragon eggs conveniently stashed behind a suit of armor,) and actually fly off into the sunset.   
  
  
To make something seem so imporbable in a world with dragons and magic creatures truly is an impressive achievement, but not for a good reason. It was closer to watching a train wreck and wondering how it could possibly be worse, then realizing half the cars were carrying explosives. 
  
But sure enough, ol' Paolini pulled it off, desperatly cramming together people and plots lines, leaving a trail of broken plot, unanswered questions, and confusion all around.He took a universe that had almost endless potential filled with half mentioned plot lines, hidden backgrounds, missing stories, and characters, and wasted it abandoning both the story and the readers.   
  
It goes down as the least satisfying series of books i've ever read, more so than other books where all the best characters die, and the loathesome antagonist wins. the best way to experience the books is to read the first one, marvel at the world, put it down then imagine what could come next.",,2017-04-30T13:01:13Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,2

It was an okay book. It was fun enough that I finished it, and good enough that it sparked my interest to read the second book (I never read the third one though, mainly because I wasn't interested enough to). But now that it's been a couple of years since I've read it, I can tell you that it wasn't memorable. If you asked me about Eragon, all I could tell you is that it's about a boy, a dragon (they can speak to one another telepathically), and it takes place in a fantasy medieval age-esque setting. 

It's like a block buster summer movie. It's enjoying enough to watch that you wouldn't switch the channel, but it's not good enough that you would go rent it and watch it again. In fact, in a few years, you'll probably forget about it, remembering it only in passing. 

If fantasy is your thing, and you're looking for a few hours of fun, by all means pick it up. But I wouldn't expect much more from it.

Critiques of Eragon often pointed out the similarities to other works such as Earthsea and Dragonlance. Reviews also called the book a notable achievement for such a young author as Paolini.

1rxnzt_3,1rxnzt,"I enjoyed them.  I really loved Eragon when I first read it in Jr. High; and while I've come to see some of the flaws in the books*, I don't think they're bad books.  I read the entire series start-to-finish this summer (reading the 4th book for the first time, rereading the rest), and still enjoyed reading them.

Some of the flaws of the books are that the writing is unpolished, that it does tend to get caught up in not terribly engaging political bits, there's bits where it seems like the author is trying too hard to put his own opinions into the book, and that some of the characters tend to be relatively one-dimensional.

But in it's favor: it has an excellent setting and an interesting magic system; the plot is engaging if not earth-shatteringly original; it has some really good moments. 

If you don't mind that the books aren't perfect, I think you can have a good time with these books. If you get easily distracted by flaws in books, I might recommend you give these a pass.  

*Side-note on the flaws; you'll notice I don't list ""It's a rip off of Star Wars"" on that list.  It's because I don't really find it to be a legitimate complaint.  Yes; there are a ton of similarities between the plot of Star Wars and the series (particularly book 1), but 

1) it doesn't help that Star Wars is a fairly generic plot itself; it's basically just textbook ""hero's journey"".  Notice how Star Wars being somewhat generic doesn't stop it from being a really awesome film series.  

2)  Even given that the book is at least ""inspired"" by Star Wars, that doesn't immediately make it a bad book.  Isn't ""Star Wars, told as a fantasy book with dragons"" something of an interesting premise?",Retsam19,2013-12-03T03:55:51Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,3

Really - its one of the more rewarding stories of family support and a kid just putting himself out there. 

The Book itself is pretty formulaic and predictable - and is a grafting of numerous well played tropes. 

The best explanation - its Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. 

However - really - knowing the history of how the book came into being, and then reading the story from the view of this was a 17 YO bringing this into creation - I enjoyed it. It allowed for an easy forgiveness of some predictability and some less than stellar writing.

For me as a elementary/middle school girl reading the books, I can't even say how much I idolized Arya. She was a truly strong and independent female character, who took her own life into her hands and made her own fortune. She was born into wealth and royalty, but denounced it and pursued her interests rather than succumb to the pressures of familial expectations, only accepting them again when she felt she was ready to assume the elven throne. 
I also loved that Eragon's love for Arya remained unrequited, and that this didn't destroy their relationship. Too many young adult novels have the resistant women worn down by their male pursuers affections, which is an incredibly unhealthy worldview to teach to young people. It was refreshing to see a female character who simply said ""no"" to unwanted attention, and to see Eragon's character come to accept that and value their friendship for just what it was. This is one of the main reasons I love the series: the characters are so real, and aren't perfect. Eragon is immature, irrational, and doesn't think before he acts. Arya is too proud and won't accept help when she needs it. These are real personal problems that people can relate to when they read the books, and so having characters like this deal with their problems in healthy ways can help readers to do that to!",spagsnell,2017-10-24T20:24:12Z,1,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,2

1s1ath_1,1s1ath,"i have not read many books that were as similar as this series of books and the original trilogy of star wars. i mean they are both in a civil war with rebels, the old ""hermit"" just happens to live in the same town as eragon. one of the first person he saves is a person of royalty who is involved with the rebels. there is an evil emperor who's number 2  is related to the main protagonist. Obi WAN was close friends with Darth Vader Brom was close friends with the Emperor. i haven't read another book as similar. ",enjureyogi,2013-12-06T19:09:39Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,1
27u7hh_1,27u7hh,"My mom bought me Eragon for Christmas many years ago when it first came out. I remember reading it and waiting for it to pick up its own ""voice"", but it never singled itself out as its own kind of story. It reminded me a lot of fanfiction I read. I know it is popular to rag on this series, but it's not for nothing - Eragon is *below average* story telling, filled with cliches, and I believe the only reason it was successful was because they marketed the book as being by a child prodigy. *If a 16 year old writes a fantasy epic, it must be worth reading!* That was basically how it sold, and that marketing worked million dollar wonders.

27u7hh_2,27u7hh,"Well, it's definitely opened my doors to High Fantasy novels, so I appreciate it for that concept. Although with more and more books I read, it's sad to see a book I loved in elementary is pretty generic and cheesy when it comes to fantasy. I did finish the series with Inheritance back in 2011, but by then I realized that initial magic was gone, and Paolini really doesn't know how to end a series. Kind of like the end of any Terry Goodkind novel, convenient Deus Machina at the end, no real accomplishment from main character. Dialogue is so stiff, Different races are just copy paste LOTR stock, and just how unbelievable the characters became. I know it's fantasy, but every hero has their limit. 

There's some pretty good YA fiction though, and if you enjoyed Eragon, try out Sabriel by Garth Nix, or perhaps The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman. My definite favorite YA fantasy novels, one of which is guaranteed to make you cry at the end  ;)",camden92392,2014-06-11T13:24:31Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,2
27u7hh_3,27u7hh,">A young farmer living with his uncle figures out that he is the last of a dying group (dragon rider, Jedi). After the death of his uncle, he goes out into the world with a wise old man, attempting to bring down an evil leader, and also to figure out the mysteries of his father (who he never met). On the way, the wise old man dies and the hero meets a rebellious and mysterious man (Han, Murtagh). Together they save a princess, and continue on their journey. 

>This is the summary for both Star Wars and Eragon. The resemblance is too striking to be a mere coincidence. And Christopher Paolini has admitted that Star Wars was one of his inspirations.

28onwm_1,28onwm,"i thought the entire series was terrible and the last thing we need is another one

to start with, he can't even get basic timelines right. i think he had a woman who was pregnant for a year and a half, etc

then secondly the entire thing is stolen from Star Wars and LOTR. the first book is literally Ep 4 of Star Wars, scene by scene, its ludicrous.

then he insists on putting things in there that are flat out impossible, like how Eragon becomes a sword master in 3 weeks while he's using his non-dominant hand the entire time, etc

it just reads like exactly what it is, a book written by a 15 year old. Good for him for making some money off of it but its not ever going to be good no matter how many fans it has.

if you, or Paolini, wants to write more stuff set in the same world or start a new story, then great. but Eragon was basically LOTR fan fiction run amok and i personally dont want to see any more of it.",jsh1138,2014-06-21T13:48:05Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,1
1vbzs4_1,1vbzs4,"I haven't heard much hate on the eragon book other than you can kinda tell a 15 year old wrote it. Most of the hate is for the movie, which did such a deplorable job of following the book's plot that it is essentially a different story and has no way of tying into Eldest",Duskopis,2014-01-16T03:22:41Z,3,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,1
1vbzs4_2,1vbzs4,"It's been a while since I've read the book, but I think one of the main problems with the movie was with those creatures who are stalking Eragon. I remember there were about 30 in the movie and they just showed up out of nowhere.

In the universe of the books I remember that it was fairly important that there were just two of those creatures.",,2014-01-16T16:22:19Z,2,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,2
49j3a4_1,49j3a4,"Yes.

If we take the book at face value, Eragon has basically no motive for killing Galbatorix. His goal at the start was to kill the Ra'zac. That's it. Unless he is an extremely weak-willed individual (which he isn't, judging by him not submitting to Galbatorix at multiple occasions), he has no true reason to wage war on Galbatorix. That was an elf's war against Galbatorix; Eragon has no reason to be there.

I'm not sure why Galbatorix sent the Ra'zac to destroy Carvahall, but I remember Eragon only hearing of it after he officially joined the Varden. There are really only 2 plausible reasons he joined the Varden in the first place:

1). Longstanding relationship to Brom. I don't remember Brom telling him to join the Varden, though. I only remembered him telling Eragon to go learn from some Dragon Riders there.

2). Him hating taxes. It's really the only thing we know of Eragon's motives, after all. The book doesn't really explain his other motives, other than him wanting to kill the Ra'zac to get revenge on them killing Brom.

It's also pretty obvious he dislike Nasuada's policies, which is why he left. He probably knew that crippling your country's own magical defense is not good for politics or war (or even trade agreements).

Of course, Eragon might just be a complete pushover and I might be completely wrong.",Phelitium,2016-03-09T02:10:31Z,0,,COMMENT,Fantasy,Eragon,1
