hrhmv_1,hrhmv,"Normally I'm a huge fan of Tina Fey's work on 30 Rock, but I really did not find *Bossypants* funny at all.

All the humor seemed to be centered around being female and I guess I just couldn't relate.

My girlfriend loved it though.",regul,2011-06-05T00:19:29Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,Bossypants,1
hrhmv_2,hrhmv,"I'm currently listening to the audiobook because I wanted that extra dimension of vocal inflection. It's pretty great so far.

It is very hard for books to get me to laugh (*Good Omens*? Nothing, gave up half way even though I typically love wry Brit humor. *Confederacy of Dunces*? Got through the whole book and I giggled maybe twice). In fact the only writer who has consistently tickled my funny bone is David Foster Wallace but *Bossypants* is damn funny.",UberSeoul,2011-06-04T20:34:17Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Bossypants,2
hj1d1_1,hj1d1,">Instead of wasting time deconstructing her wit, Fey displays it. Bossypants is devoid of lofty pontification of what/why/how people think about being funny; instead, itâ€™s just funny. 

And here the article's author unintentionally sums up exactly why, as Hitchens explains it in the video linked, she fails to make an actual cogent argument against his assertion. 

I think Tina Fey is a fantastic comedian and 30 Rock is hilarious, and I imagine Hitchens does too. But that says nothing other than that she is a funny woman.
