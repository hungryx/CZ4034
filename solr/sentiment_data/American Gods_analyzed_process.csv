z4tggv_3,z4tggv,"I wanted to like American Gods. I love Good Omens. I  quite like Sandman. American Gods was an amazing idea that just never really went anywhere. The prose was amazing. The characters were amazing. The worldbuilding was amazing. I was bored out of my mind. And finally when we make it to the end that's been super hyped up and is going to be worth the slog, everyone just changes their mind and goes home. I get its appeal.

z4tggv_5,z4tggv,"I love Neil Gaiman, but *American Gods* is one of his books that just didn’t click for me. I like it well enough, but I don’t love it.  

I liked *Anansi Boys* much better, and I think *The Graveyard Book* is probably my favorite piece of fiction he’s written.  I just recently went through his book of essays and introductions, *The View From the Cheap Seats*, and I think I might like his essays even more than his fiction.",sdwoodchuck,2022-11-26T03:58:11Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,5
z4tggv_6,z4tggv,"I have read this book numerous times.  I've found it quite compelling every read.   

American Gods has that meandering pace and almost desolate feeling that is somewhat unique to English and Scandinavian literature.   

I feel that a great part of what makes it rereadable is that what isn't said paints as much of a picture as what is said.  (Like the music theorist who suggests that the space between the notes is at least as important as the notes themselves.)   

There are so many details that people don't seem to discuss.  

>!""Shadow"" is a shade, ghosting through his life, not really alive.  Yet the cost of the resurrection that brings him fully to life means... What? He's Baldr returned, but he gave up his name. So then who does he become?!<   
>!That's probably also why Scandi Odin knows him, but doesn't identify him.!<    

>!Anansi tells stories.  Partly because stories are part of his shtick.  Yet, very likely, every time he tells one of his spider stories to a group of humans or even gods, he's getting a trickle of soma. That's why he starts those meetings with barely relevant stories.!<",PlaceboJesus,2022-11-26T05:06:38Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,6
z4tggv_7,z4tggv,"Love that book. 

Makes a strong argument that public figures (celebrities, actors, politicians, etc) are nothing without a willing public there to offer support ie. worship. 

But beyond that, it's just incredibly engaging and readable and does that thing that I love most about Gaiman; take ordinary, mundane things that you would normally ignore and not give much consideration and then looks closer to find something magical there. 

I love that shit. 

It's more of a comedy but I really recommend you check out Anansi Boys. 

It doesn't have a epic scale of American Gods, but it does take place in the same world and while I don't think it's as good as American Gods, it's still a terrific, fun and funny read",derpferd,2022-11-26T11:30:28Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,7
z4tggv_8,z4tggv,"I went into American Gods expecting a strong major plot and an exploration of the “new” gods we worship in the West. Instead, I got a book about the unique struggles that are so common, and often unspoken, in America. The major plot was weak and forgettable because it was really just a vehicle to explore these other issues. I do wish Gaiman had spent a little more time exploring the idea of “new” gods and the implications it has for society though.

American Gods wasn’t my cup of tea but I think it’s safe to say it’s one of the greater works in recent years and it will be a great peek into the modern American life for years to come. I wouldn’t be surprised if it someday was considered a classic even. Wonderful writing by Gaiman, I’m glad you enjoyed it.",Slightlydifficult,2022-11-26T06:28:13Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,8

z4tggv_17,z4tggv,"I liked it at first but by the end was really unsatisfied. Felt like there was so much in the story that was just a waste of time and amounted to nothing. The chapter about the cab driver getting throat fucked by that djinn, but then having literally zero tie in with the rest of the story? And then the constant alluding to Shadow being Native American and his connections to Native American gods…but then all of that foreshadowing just got tossed out the window just for him to be Odins son? 

I think the prose was good, the story had a good foundation, but it collapsed at the finish line with a ton of unrealized potential",anythingfordopamine,2022-11-26T04:59:44Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,17

But I still absolutely loved this book. It's bizarre that I've only recently started reading Gaiman. He's completely in my wheelhouse and it's a name I've known for as long as I can remember, but for some reason I never picked up one of his books until last year. Read Neverwhere and had a great time. Then someone at work found American Gods in a charity shop and gave it to me as an impromptu gift. Which was so nice of him (I'm actually right now wearing a scarf he gave me yesterday that he bought in Madrid! Such an awesome dude). Fantastic writing and a really interesting take on the history of the USA and its relationship with immigration.

z4tggv_34,z4tggv,"I'm a traveller, and I love road trips. The very thought posited by Gaiman that ""every country except America has roadside shrines, and so this country's holy places are roadside kitschy attractions"", really struck me. I've driven past, stopped at, or otherwise seen thousands of these shrines pass by- and the melancholic air that surrounds these dilapidated visions of success that someone cooked up years ago, still reminds me of American Gods to this day. Be it South of the border in south carolina, Virgin, Utah western town, wall drug in South Dakota, or the ""world's largest ______"", I can't get enough.

z4tggv_41,z4tggv,"I too did not enjoy American Gods. It's nice that it resonated with the OP, but for me so many of the asides just seemed to be pointless and dull. Gaiman totally makes up for it with Anansi Boys, though.

I finally got around to reading Sandman many years later and I think one can definitely see seeds of some of the same ideas later reused in American Gods, especially in volumes like ""Fables and Reflections"" and ""Brief Lives"". I suppose it works a little better because there's no expectation that the more disconnected bits are supposed to be building to something.

z4tggv_42,z4tggv,"Same. I love most everything Gaiman has ever written. His book *The Ocean at the end of the Lane* is my absolute favorite novel, but American Gods just fell flat for me. 

It wasn’t bad, it just didn’t do anything for me. Reimagining pagan deities in a modern world has never been a particularly interesting thing for me, so from the get go I knew I wasn’t the target audience, but I love so much of Gaiman’s work that I hoped my love of his style would help me get past a premise that didn’t interest me.

Unfortunately all it served to do was make me more aware of the elements of his style that I don’t like.

It had really cool characters and I enjoyed it initially, but it had pacing problems around the middle of it, and I felt like all the pieces were on the board, but nothing was happening, and I had to force myself to the anti-climactic end.

It was almost as if Gaiman invented this incredible world but didn't know what to do with it. So overall I would say the novel was just OK.

mwquw6_5,mwquw6,"What I got from the book: the traditions and rituals that shaped our ancestors' lives are mostly lost. (Even rituals of Christianity are lost on many of its observers today, such as Passover). The book asked me to look at what we exalt in society today and imagine what if we worshipped them as deities like our polytheist ancestors did. Then, what if those gods were manifest in the flesh as Odin was in Norse religion. How those gods interact with the world around them in American Gods is Gaiman's take on their effect on our society. It is interesting to ponder, even if you don't agree with him (though I think I do).

Back to Odin and maybe to my earlier point that traditions of our ancestors are lost on us - most people wouldn't know that Wednesday is a reference to Odin (though maybe the book mentions it - I listened to the audio book long ago). The word Wednesday is the latest rendition of the original word that translated to 'Odin's Day'. (Thursday is from Thor's Day, Friday is from Freya's Day, or something like that. All of them are Norse Deities. Tuesday may have Norse origins as well). So maybe Wednesday is an oblique reference to an ancient god, but one we still carry with us. We have lost our reverence for Odin so Wednesday has lost what was once Odin's power, but we still carry forward in society this religious vestige. That in itself tells how important Odin once was.

After reading this book I began to be a little unhappy that Christianity had painted every Western nation's history, culture, and heritage more or less the exact same shade of white. I don't know where my people are from, but I would enjoy knowing if they worshiped the Piskies or the Norse pantheon or some other pantheon of ancient gods that had bestowed upon them good fortune. I ended listening to more books that covered such things and found them very interesting. I like how Greek gods are imperfect and walked amongst their worshippers in mythology. Their goof ups and clever or tragic turns of fortune are more relatable to me than striving to be perfect.

In the end, the book set me on a path I found to be interesting and fulfilling. It made me want to learn more about more about how ancient people worshipped - and that is truly fascinating. The only piece of writing in the book I really enjoyed was, I believe, read by Gaiman himself in the audio book. It was the part about Essie (I think) who got passage to America after she made a deal with the judge. That was a beautiful and poignant chapter. The rest I found hard to 'get into'. I was just there for it.

Edit: Corrected proper name of Essie and the Piskies",BlergFurdison,2021-04-23T14:29:21Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,5
mwquw6_6,mwquw6,"I love the book (though, not having read it in years, that may change).

What I like about it is the same thing I like about Gaiman's Neverwhere; that there are things around us that we ignore and take for granted that turn out to be magical. That lurking beneath the surface of modern day society is old magic that very few people ever notice. I really love how Gaiman pays so much attention to the mundanities of the world he builds, only to pull the curtain back and show us something magical every so often. 

There's something thrilling about that.

I also enjoyed the metaphor of it, that America is a country that runs on the assumptions and the belief of ideas as it does anything real and tangible (the American Dream for instance) and that those things die with the fewer people that believe in it.

American Gods works as much as a metaphor for celebrities and politicians and other public figures, and the power the public gives them, as it does a straight supernatural adventure.


And Mr Wednesday could easily be seen as a foreshadowing of Donald Trump, a conman who needs to convince others to believe in him and follow him lest he die from not having their worship. I guess those kinds of characters are baked into society, but I feel like the comparison holds

mwquw6_8,mwquw6,"Neil Gaiman is one of my favourite authors... And I am inclined to agree with you! The first time I read American Gods, especially, I found the end third really convoluted and hard to follow. I appreciated it more the second time (and loved the first season of the TV show, disappointing after that though), but it is one I would hesitate to recommend to someone who isn't already a fan or interested in the concept. Because the concept is great.

It's so often a problem though, that the hype can ruin a thing. You aren't 'supposed' to get anything out of a book than enjoyment, or whatever you want to, but that feeling that you have missed something really gets in the way!

I'm sorry this one wasn't for you, but such is the way of books. Not everything is for everyone. As someone else mentioned, Anansi Boys is better in my opinion, and just less overhyped! I hope you can go back to it someday.",QueenOfThePark,2021-04-23T10:43:03Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,8
mwquw6_9,mwquw6,"My opinion on what one should get out of it: Mostly it is human nature stuff that Gaiman is so skilled at bringing into focus. The power of not just higher functioning belief but the belief of small rituals and frankly the small attention we individually give things that cumulatively adds up to the existence of hiding eggs for hundreds of years and the existence of random places like the House on the Rock. Which are frankly mind-blowing if think of it from outside the culture. The way we quickly forget origins of our American cultural traditions and and bleakness underlying some of them (and end result Americanized version never is bleak). How we are always one stupid mistake away from death - and often that mistake is not paying attention to the moment. How susceptible we are to be conned - even when we know we are dealing with conmen!

But most of all you are supposed to get the Midwest. And the Midwest is really hard to get. It is seldom featured accurately in media and even less in the sort of books where the location is a character. The Midwest is is at first deceptively warm and friendly and proud. And on longer acquaintance cold and private. And disparate and jealous. Protective and stubborn. And quirky and dying. 

Like all Gaiman writings it is his personal experience made fictional and expanded to reveal raw truths. The experience of a British man familiar with America through media and contacts and visits. Who writes a whole universe convincingly set in Seattle. Who has not really felt culture shock on his visits or seen anything in the coastal cities that was bone-jarringly a different world. Who truly believes he already understands America’s and Americans (he is married to one!) And then he moves to the Midwest because it is financially a good move with the exchange rate and his wife’s family is there. It will be good for the kids and after all, he can write anywhere. And he is connected - he is family. But he finds he is a stranger there and experiences a strong culture shock. To the people and society - to the very climate. And he has questions that no one ever asks so there are not answers to. And he takes these road trips and finds even strangers things which prompt more questions.

The heart of the book is Lakeside the rest is his wonderfully crazy way of exploring questions about the general human condition and why America - and especially the Midwest - is like it is. 

I saw Gaiman interviewed in NYC. One of those “An evening with . . .” Just chance I was visiting the city then and I bought a ticket. It was the 10th anniversary tour. I remember the host basically asking him if it was masochism - why did he jump into depicting the most difficult subculture of America.  And he threw up his hands and was like “I didn’t know! I had no idea!” It is true he had this idea about what happened to the Gods when they came to America. That was his prompt and why he started the book. It isn’t what the book is really about. He was well into the book before it turned into being about setting as much as anything else. 

About land where people put junked cars in the middle of the ice and treat it with the reverence of a religious ritual and then have it as a constant topic of conversation for months. And a land where the House on the Rock, giant ketchups bottles, and humongous balls of rubber bands exist. Where you can drive for hours and hours and stop in a town that looks the same as you left. The church, the Dairy Queen, the high school sports champion team, the dying Main Street. It has all the same basic things in the same style - except the one building/institution that stands out as the town pride - “you can’t find an [X] like that anywhere else” (the castle library in Lakeside or the crocodile bar). But the people have a slightly different lingo and insist their town is VERY different from the town you left. And you are sure (if you are at all familiar with the Midwest anyways) that if you spent enough time there to know the place you would agree with them but right now you certainly can’t see any difference.

And about a land where the people never look at all these things and ask “Why?” At least not the ones who stay. That is what you should get from American Gods. A second hand culture shock and bafflement. And an appreciation for the quirky dying America that doesn’t die. Just  always perpetually dying like the dust gathering on the spectacles at the House on the Rock. It gives the impression it used to better - or at least had kept up better appearances in the past. But maybe that is how it always has been. Always the old way is dying - the “new gods” do not last, but that is the same story and roles just cast with different characters. Like Lakeside historical book - things are just the same and the roles people hold are the same and the same things happen with the same lack of questioning. 

I sometimes wonder if people who don’t get this book are just bicoastal or big city people that mistake much of the realism of the book for fiction. Because very little is exaggerated. But that is just a theory.",oddlikeeveryoneelse,2021-04-23T23:10:29Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,9

People hold on to identities that never belonged to them, describing themselves as Italian/Irish/German-American etc, without ever having been there, just like the Norse-American Gods and the other characters. And then how modern society is destroying this idea of a cultural identity even if it is tenuous at best.

I just... didn't care at all. This was many years ago though, so I couldn't point you to anything concrete.

I will also say that I tried to pick it back up when the show came out and didn't get very far.

mwquw6_17,mwquw6,"I think you disliking it doesn't have to do much with 'hype', but with the fact American Gods is just on Gaimans weak end Now, I might not have the cultural predisposition to enjoy it (being European), but I think there are fundamental flaws with the story telling.

Pacing is just abysmal. We are left pondering in boredom (snow town), while interesting bits are rushed through (goddamn war among gods!).

The main character is just bland and boring. Instead of having an impact on the story, he is dragged through it without any action, reaction or even commentary. Yes I realise it was kind of an artistic choice (him being Shadow and all) but, that's very weak justification. It's like restaurant serving you bland, tasteless meal, but you should somehow enjoy it because that was the chefs intention.

Also, I can't comprehend how some people here praise it for avoiding cliche. The book is literally filled with overused tropes and cliches that make my eyes roll. However they may not have been overused in the time of this book release (2001), so whatever.

All in all, this book is in line with Gaiman writing. He is very strong in writing fairy tails and short stories, because of the 'streamlined' structure, while fails to deliver in high-concept, more artistic attempts.

That being said I don't understand what answers these types of posts hope to receive. It's normal to not like a book, including popular ones. Demanding that fans of the book justify why they enjoyed it and provide some type of higher analysis of the reading seems like a thinly veiled excuse to write a post to complain (or sometimes brag) you didn't like a popular book and only vaguely disguise it as a question. 

Some books are there for enjoyment's sake and not to provide some higher learning process. The story of American Gods is pretty transparent in its nature, that religions derive power and influence based on their believers and not the other way around. If this was not compelling that's okay. What answer could anyone here to provide you about the higher purpose of the book that would answer your question to a satisfactory level? 

I didn't enjoy The Kingkiller Chronicles and DNF'd during the second book.

mwquw6_39,mwquw6,"I... really don't like American Gods, as in not even in theory/as a concept. It could potentially work, but it seems to me Gaiman made every bad choice there is in regards to this. Or rather, I don't think he has the strengths as a writer, necessary to pull this concept off. If you're gonna do this whole shtick of old gods existing but losing power due to belief and stuff, and there being new gods etc. you kinda have to have a fairly tightly knit set of very clear-cut rules and a robust system in place for it. Basically... a hard magic system, just not for magic in this case. Gaiman's approach is the exact opposite though, it relies a whole lot on wishy-washiness of definitions and being generally vague and whatnot. 

It also doesn't help that a lot if the ideas he goes for are really basic and kinda dumb. The whole concept of ""new gods"" runs into literally a million issues and is kinda compounded by the above mentioned lack of specificity and rule rigidness. The question of ""what would the gods do in modern times!?"" is just kinda silly? They're gods. They're not going to do anything. They're not going to swoon over modern humanity and whatever random shit they're doing and try to adapt to it. The best reaction you could hope is to get scoffed at or some wrath. This exact same question and approach to bringing gods into modern times was used in Percy Jackson.... a book series for children, and even there I found myself aggressively rolling my eyes and how dumb the idea was. 

People like to say that American Gods showcases some deep love of mythology... yeah if deep love is the same as some guy jotting down a dozen or so names off the wikipedia list of ancient deities. And in some cases that's literal as some of the gods picked for American Gods basically exist as a name only with no depth to them. It's less an exploration of mythology and more ""here's this bunch of random whacky characters with vague mythological and folktale-y impressions"". I'm not saying that Gaiman doesn't like myths and whatnot (he wrote a retelling of a collection of norse myths for crying out loud), but American Gods certainly doesn't come across as a great showcase of that.",Fehafare,2021-04-23T13:52:56Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,39

I don’t have a strong positive or negative opinion of his stories (I liked Neverwhere and disliked American Gods), but it’s funny that my apathy towards it reflects his apathetic lead characters.

I think it depends on the type of reader you are. American Gods is an attempt to blend mythological tones into a realistic setting.

Im a fantasy and sci-fi nerd. I love the Dresden Files and Clive Barker. I appreciate a lot of imagination and good settings in my stories. Because of what I'm used to American Gods feels flat outside of a few scenes that were really cool.

If you are a reader coming from more grounded stories. The type that finds the ridiculousness of Dresden or Barker offputting, American Gods is a great way to dip your toe in the water of fantasy.",DerekPaxton,2021-04-23T15:49:12Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,54

mwquw6_56,mwquw6,"Personal Ranking of NG's work (Books only)

1. American Gods: The first time I read this book, I couldn't get into it, I didn't understand it, I  didn't understand the hype. Then I heard someone describe it as a ""Brit's love letter to America"" and suddenly everything clicked. I suddenly Got It and ended up buying the  nice annotated version. But yeah, I've stopped pushing it because nobody I know really liked it, and I don't want to push people off NG.
2. Smoke and Mirrors: This is the short story collection that got me into NG. It was here that I realized that NG's work is built to be read aloud. ""Chivalry"" is so, so, good. 
3. Anansi Boys:  A tight, screwball comedy set in the same world as American Gods. Unlike the massive scope and somber reflection of its predecessor, its a short fun book that is easily his funniest read. 
4. Neverwhere: Dark, interesting, but also very obviously his first book. Its good, but a lot of the elements of it are reused in a much better manner in later books. 
5. View From the Cheap Seats: I just like essays man. 
6. Good Omens: I'm the only person on this earth that thinks this book is just ok. There are really funny moments, but I had to slog through a bunch of parts. No, I don't know what's wrong with me.
7. Stardust: Just wasn't my jam. \*shrug\*",2whitie,2021-04-23T15:55:55Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,56

Now I can get that when we’re dealing with mythological gods, this kind of rape is remarkably common in their legends, but the story never deals with the ramifications of that for the woman raped.  Instead, it’s viewed purely through the lens of Fat Charlie’s sense of betrayal, which is assuaged by his moving on and getting with someone else who we’re supposed to understand is a better match for him.  And not only is her rape never handled as such, but his fiancé discovers that she’s actually really into Fat Charlie’s brother, essentially having her fall in love with her rapist.!<",sdwoodchuck,2021-04-23T14:01:42Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,62

>  
>And about a land where the people never look at all these things and ask  “Why?” At least not the ones who stay. That is what you should get from  American Gods. A second hand culture shock and bafflement. And an  appreciation for the quirky dying America that doesn’t die. Just  always  perpetually dying like the dust gathering on the spectacles at the  House on the Rock. It gives the impression it used to better - or at  least had kept up better appearances in the past. But maybe that is how  it always has been.

Gaiman does paint the idea of Midwest beautifully. And yes these new ""places of worship"" are nicely integrated into the story and mentioned as being places of power. As Varys from GoT said *""Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.""*

Maybe it is because this concept has been used a lot recently in other books and is not novel anymore, maybe it is because I am a big city child (not in North America) that I don't ""get"" it (but these *""cheap""* style attractions exist all over the world in rural areas. There has to be some entertainment in the vastness of the country, and people do end up driving quite far to visit them.  As a urbanite, the payoff is always disappointing),   
but it wasn't as overwhelming to me as it should have seemed.

One thing that really bother me is how quickly they travel. Most of the book takes place in central US (Illinois area), but they visit SF. The reader does not get the sense of this journey that would be by car, it happens at the turn of a page.

If I had to guess—and understand this purely conjecture on my part—I think originally (and maybe just in the planning phases) the story was closer in tone to *American Gods*, and probably dealt with that issue a little more head-on, but at some point he realized this one worked better as a more light-hearted tone, and anything dealing with that darkness was trimmed and left on the editing room floor, with this one plot line being a simple oversight.

mwquw6_106,mwquw6,"American gods builds on elements of multiple pagan religions from multiple regions.  Without those bits of knowledge it gets hard to get the messages in the book at all.  He definitely improved on that in his other writing and didn't require nearly the knowledge base.

Requiring being at least an amateur religious scholar to really understand a lot of the message is generally going to alienate some people.  This combined with a very straightforward plot that you've got to me more interested in how it plays out as opposed to what will play out can definitely make people bored out of their mind or just generally not interested.

In general every time he touches on a supernatural creature or god there's mythological precedence for their actions, but with a modern twist.  Generally on at least 2 levels.  The first is the level that they're roughly what would be expected based on the myth only modernized, but there's always a subversive role reversal there that I can't really write more about without dropping huge plot spoilers.  While the plot doesn't go anywhere too surprising without knowing enough about the religions it's really hard to actually see that second subversive level.  You don't need to know a lot about them but you really need a rough outline of virtually all of them or that second level totally fails to materialize.

If you don't know anything about them and are curious about this, read through the wikipedia article for ""weird characters"" that seem like they could have one and out of place names in the book as they come up, then through a quick basic page for any religions that are associated outlined there.  A lot of people don't like doing this kind of research for a non-fiction book as well, and this can definitely turn people off when they realize what they're going to need to do to actually enjoy the book on a deeper level.",Dozekar,2021-04-23T15:45:11Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,106

oa7rjp_7,oa7rjp,"I think you've captured the fundamentals very well.

Gaiman felt comfortable writing about gods like Odin or Nancy or Horus because these gods are distant from us (from Gaiman), and can therefore stand in for a set of tropes that represent modern America and its relationship with the Old World, which is unquestionably what the book is about.

American Gods is fundamentally the encounter of a European (British, English) man of a certain era with America, Gaiman has said almost as much himself. People like Gaiman, Pratchett and Roald Dahl all grew up in an England that was rather in awe of America. America was the land where everything was possible, where everything new came from, where everything was Big, and drawn in Bright Primary Colours (or Colors). These days us Brits and Europeans are far more critical, the world has become smaller and we are less enamoured by the US for all sorts of reasons. But for people in Gaiman's age group, that magic is still retained, and you see it in much of his work.

Jesus and the God the Bible are too near, too sensitive to Gaiman to be used as something to explore America and its relationship with the modern world with. It draws you too close to religion and theology, which oddly enough has *nothing to do with the book,* despite it on the surface being a book about gods and their worshippers. Really, the Gods are standing in for the multiculturalism of America, as well as its peculiar Puritan savagery, from a European point of view. They attempt to represent the indigenous population, the colonisers, the slaves; and the modern world Gaiman saw coming into being in the 90s, which felt like a cold war watershed of consumerism and information.

Those are the themes, and the Christian God (at least the Christian God of the world Gaiman grew up in) would have overwhelmed them, and brought in new issues that were not what he was really writing about. The Christian God is similarly absent from The Sandman series, and even from Good Omens, though Satan gets in by way of Milton. He's not *totally* absent, but he is not engaged with, because that would be engaging with a debate which the stories don't require; it doesn't drive them forward for Gaiman's imagined audience, which is people a bit like him.

It's really interesting to imagine a version of American Gods that really did engage with Christianity though. I imagine you would need a variety of Christian 'Gods', all more primitive and cruel than their European counterpart, arriving in waves. Fleeing persecution, yes, but doing so because of their absolutist and fundamentalist nature and lack of compromise. The Catholic God of America scares me in a way the Catholic God of Austria or Italy or Poland just  doesn't. Quite aprt from the Puritan monstrosities that America created. If there is one thing that seperates America from Europe, it's that Americans genuinely *believe* in a way that few Europeans do, for all sorts of reasons. Few European Catholics believe like American Catholics do. Hell, few European Atheists believe like American Atheists do.",Stralau,2021-06-29T23:35:51Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,7

It's how Gaiman takes that and makes it into a premise for looking at America as a whole. 

It's getting to see the country through the fresher eyes of an outsider from a country where most villages are older than the nation the book is set in. 

Gaiman finds America both charming and... spiritually rudderless. A mess of new gods like media (... watch season 1 of the TV series JUST to see Gillian Anderson as Media. Holy shit she was perfect) alongside gods settlers and immigrants brought over.

68j0xp_1,68j0xp,"American Gods has some absurdist/surrealist themes in a non-sequitur, ""things just happen because they happen like that"" kind of way, which is my opinion, takes a lot of finesse to pull off. 

if you allow these themes to run rampant, you end up with something that leaves many more questions than answers (think Kafka on the Shore, or really any Haruki Murakami books). and this isn't a bad thing, it's a stylistic decision. In my view, Neil Gaiman wants us to have a few questions by the end, but for the most part know how and why things went down 

if the themes are too sparse, they will seem out of place/won't even be picked up on, or seem too much like a deus ex machina 

in my opinion, American Gods has a very well crafted balance of these themes, giving it an extra vibrancy within the context of what it's trying to do

American Gods gave me the impression of a world set loose from the chains. It's really hard to describe the feeling, but it meshed well with everything that makes me find America a fascinating place and explored the concept of hundreds of ancient traditions set in their ways being ripped up into a new place and jumbled together.

68j0xp_4,68j0xp,"I have a complicated relationship with *American Gods*.

On one hand, I really respect the quality of the writing and the sheer amount of Americana that survived transcription into text. Like with some Stephen King works, it showcased but didn't beat into the ground the Americana elements. America has some serious cultural issues in that all of its parts come from somewhere else much of the time. It's hard to form a solid cultural identity without falling back onto who your 'people were in the old country' or pulling out a religious denomination. This is very well analogized by the experiences of the transplanted gods. They've become American-ized. I really respected how Neil captured it. That mood of transience.

On the other hand, I *really* didn't enjoy the book. It felt impersonal, distant, and like watching an art film that doesn't share any mutual contexts with me. It had places where I felt things were under-described and I just couldn't picture the atmosphere, and other parts where the narrative lingered on a place or object in detail, to the opposite effect. It felt very imbalanced and this resulted to reading it feeling like a chore at times. The pages didn't turn themselves by virtue of moving my hand. I could have sat it down at any time and not had the urge to pick it back up. Yet I did finish it; somewhere between making myself and reading it out of casual indifference toward stopping.

It's a curious thing, that book.

It feels like staring at a well-crafted sculpture and just shrugging. You can tell it's beautiful, you can admire its lines, how it was made, etc, but it just doesn't *spark* anything inside. It's a wonderful piece of writing craft, but it just didn't touch me. I'll always remember a few turns of phrase from it, perhaps a few scenes, but most of it was ultimately forgettable. Which was also how I felt about Federico Fellini's film *8½*, as well. Perhaps there is some truth to those comparing it to the absurd surreality of Murakami, etc.

It's slow and ponderous, takes its time on things that other books wouldn't. It gives it a very peculiar feeling, like you're reading through a dream. There is this interesting sense of detachment, not quite knowing what is real or imagined.

The lead character of Shadow was also basically not a real character, he felt more like a camera than a person, which was interesting. We just borrowed his eyes to observe the story, rather than it being a story about him.

The various mythological and religious elements were cool to me, especially the Norse and Egyptian bits that I'm already familiar with.

Nor is it a book I sing the praises of unlike some of his other works (see the previous 3 books). This makes it seem like I may not like it, but due to Gaiman's own style, it makes some of his books hard to recommend. Gaiman is a consummate story teller, but if you aren't into his style or haven't found much like for his other books, you won't like *American Gods* either normally...anecdotally in my experience, etc.

Overall I loved the roadtrip aspects of the book, plus it's kind of bleak, meandering style. The characters are for the most part fleshed out and really interesting to follow, its a spectacular journey through America.

One of the hallmarks of the picaresque style is that it has no real plot, we just kind of follow the main character around through a series of adventures. 

It's been a while since I read American Gods, but that was what I remembered, just sort of a rambling story of Shadow interacting with modern manifestations of mythological figures.

It's the story of Shadow Moon, a man who is suffering from severe PTSD following what is likely the worst day of his life.

It's a book about grief, which is why the seemingly endless tangents about the various Gods appear so surreal and out of place. The book rarely devolves beyond the preternatural, which keeps the book firmly rooted on Shadow floating through a world that neither makes sense nor cares. 

I love American Gods because despite the endless stream of ideas which are scrapped as quickly as they are introduced, it is a human story. The various Gods are mediums through which Shadow's psyche, and the nonsensical nature of the world post-tragedy, are explored. It is a look into the soul of America as well, of course, but this all complement the notion of the individual. 

It's an incredibly simple story with some very large, broad implications. That's why the real climax isn't set on the battlefield where a million Gods are battling to the death. No, it's set in Hinzelmann's cabin instead. Because that's *Shadow's* narrative, rather than the one he has been forced into.

68j0xp_36,68j0xp,">I can believe things that are true and things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not. 

I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen - I believe that people are perfectable, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkled lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. 

I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. 

I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. 

I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds. 

I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. 

I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. 

I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. 

I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. 

I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. 

I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.

Neil Gaiman, American Gods (American Gods, #1)

This quote sums it up for me

68j0xp_37,68j0xp,"Gaiman, in American Gods and the Sandman at least, haven't finished Stardust, is good at creating three dimensional characters who just happen to be mythical beings / gods. His range of inspiration is pretty diverse and for being a big nerd about myths and forklore, doesn't bog down his narrative with too much detail or background. These are things that fantasy authors typically have trouble with (too many unrelatable two dimensional characters and inelegant info dumps) so Gaiman stands out in terms of cross over appeal.

68j0xp_39,68j0xp,"American Gods resonated with me due to Shadow and the profound sense of loneliness and emptiness I found in the book. Shadow has lost everything and is just a shell of a person, he wants nothing more than rest. The old gods are clinging to life, finding any way they can to survive, just shades of their former greatness.

At the time I read it I was in a similar situation - just broken up with, stressful job, far away from friends/family and living in my first apartment that my ex-girlfriend chose for us. I was living out the rest of the lease before she could come back and move her stuff out.

It was a good book for that time in my life, it kind of wraps up that feeling for me.

68j0xp_44,68j0xp,"American Gods should be spoken about next to [Good Omens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens), as Neil Gaiman worked on both of them and they each deal with religious/mythological themes.  With that in mind, American Gods spent more time fleshing out the mythological universe while Good Omens focused on telling a tight story.  The late great Terry Pratchett co-wrote Good Omens, so it isn't quite an apples to apples comparison.  Good Omens also focuses on Judeo-Christian metaphysics, think angels and dukes of hell.  It might've clicked better for me because of my familiarity with Christian stories.

But once it was over I didn't think too much about it. The ending and resolution to Shadow's story doesn't feel _wrong_ to me but it does feel kinda empty?

My father had the option to learn Greek when he went to High School :)

There are four works I know of that all came out in the 1990s, exploring these ideas about gods and their role relative to mankind:  Small Gods, Good Omens, American Gods, and Dogma.  The first three are books, the last is a movie.  To some degree the ground had already been roughly mapped in the late 1980s by Douglas Adams (in ""The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul"").    

To my mind, the most interesting thing about this corpus is the synchronicity -- clearly several of my favorite authors were thinking about these things at about the same time, and to some degree playing off one another.

Series that are similar to Dresden that do have that sense of wonder for me are the Libromancer books by Tim Hines, The Courts of the Feyre by Mike Shevdon, Shadow Police by Paul Cornell etc.  I think the main character being in the dark and exploring the world along with the reader is a lot of the appeal for me.

I loved American Gods, but it was my first Gaiman book, I love mythology (which if you haven't gathered is the major focus of the book), and I had never encountered this sort of story based on mythological creatures in the modern world before (which I have since discovered is almost its own genre known loosely, I think, as ""urban fantasy"").

2av1yp_20,2av1yp,"*American Gods* has a lot going for it, but it ultimately missed my expectations. The premise is fantastic, and it's clear a lot of work has been put into it. The main character is interesting enough, as are his companions, but there were some very weak points to the novel.

First, the antagonists of the story are pretty flat and kind of unbelievable. The point of conflict isn't very clear, so all of the posturing that occurs in the book feels impotent and meaningless. And that's where the real damage occurs because the story has no real conflict with which to climax. There's all this build up but no release. All this posturing, all this interweaving of mythologies and storylines and personalities and histories, and it all culminates into - well, it doesn't really culminate. It anticlimaxes instead, and that left me feeling like I didn't get a return on my investment (both time and emotional investment).

There are some great lines. Gaiman also has some experimental chapters that don't use the same voice as the main chapters that follow Shadow, and I found those to be fun and interesting. But, fun as they were, they never really connected to the main story (and thus is another point related to Gaiman being unable to bring it all together). It's also witty, and I laughed out loud a number of times. Gaiman knows how to write. Some scenes were very gripping, and I found myself reading chapter after chapter to see what happens next.

It's the one book I've read that I wish I could love more than I can. No other book has left me feeling so disappointed in its resolution. Lots of other people seem to love it, flaws and all, and because of that, I still cautiously recommend people to read it, if not for the premise alone.",TheGhostofWoodyAllen,2014-07-17T01:55:39Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,20

For most of them, I can't buy into the concept that ancient gods would care two whits about the town, neighborhood, or even pizza parlor where the novel must (by storytelling constraints) be set. I always find there's an absurd and tritely comical element in the ""old vs. new"" gimmicks, such as having Thor get used to taxicabs, for example.

American Gods is the rare ""Armageddon Now"" style book that deals with its subject matter knowledgeably and respectfully. Moreover, Gaiman employs a very graceful plot loophole - the gods you see in the novel are merely the American versions of those gods, brought to the New World with immigrants. So now you can envision a Slavic dark god, muttering away like an old-age pensioner in a crumbling attic, without dismissing the author's diminution of another culture's mythology.

2av1yp_27,2av1yp,"I've only read ""American Gods"", but I didn't like it at all. Here's why-

""American Gods"" is, to me, a book with an interesting concept (how we as a species are driven to worship things, whether they are actual ""Gods"" or commodities/luxuries), with a horrible execution. Shadow (besides having a name that sounds like a 12 year old's idea of ""cool"") is a cardboard cutout of a character, a character that is so extraordinarily passive that he does not make nearly anything in the plot happen- instead things merely happen to him (not to mention how terribly unbelievable he is- from his inconsistencies (Shadow- ""I'm not doing anything illegal"" ...5 pages later... Shadow- ""Sure Wednesday, I'll help you rob a bank"") to how he first comes to accept that the Gods are real). And the sad thing is, the rest of the characters don't far much better in the personality department.
Now Gaiman's poor characterization and his clunky prose (when I was reading the book I considered writing down some of my favorite clunkers, and I regret not doing so) would be almost forgivable if he managed to craft something with a noteworthy plot. But once again, Gaiman failed in this regard. A solid 99% of the action in the novel is never shown- Wednesday's quest is infinitely more interesting than the meandering ""adventures"" Shadow gets caught up in (and by that I mean, passively accepts) but we barely see any of it. Instead we are left with a plot that goes seemingly nowhere and with a character that does not make one bit of difference to the story for the first 95% of it. And then to top it off, we are force fed an entirely different plot about a child killer hiding in a small town- a plot that quite seriously has no bearing to the book as a whole. It is a plot cul de sac in the vein of the rooftop Chris-R scene in Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"".

Overall, the biggest disappointment with ""American Gods"" is just how much of a missed opportunity it is. The concept of what a modern day ""God"" is is actually a really interesting one, that in the hands of a talented writer could have made for an engaging work of fiction. Sadly, it appears that Gaiman was not the correct writer for that book.",lifeinaglasshouse,2014-07-16T23:44:46Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,27

2av1yp_32,2av1yp,"I can't speak for the Celtic mythologies, but to the best of my knowledge there is pretty much no post-Christian versions of Norse mythology available to us. In Snorri Sturlasson's (or whichever localized spelling you prefer) time Iceland had been officially christian for over two centuries, and the other Scandinavian countries either similar or longer times. Whatever runestones and the like we may have that can be said to certainly predate christianity don't tend to tell any detailed mythological tales. Maybe a dedication to Odin or the like. But the stories were, much like syphilis, passed orally from generation to generation. And that's sort of the thing about a lot of these stories from religions that didn't have much (or anything) in the way of an organized church. They were most likely very fluid and varied even at the height of their popularity. There wasn't any kind of canon because how could there be? And y'know... that's kinda cool. That's kind of a neat thing that the Gods and their deeds changed with the people telling their stories.

Source: I am a välfärds-viking who grew up on these stories. 

For the record I greatly enjoyed American Gods. The writing style with the utterly flat protagonist actually reminds me a bit of the old tales in that characterisation wasn't really a thing back then. (Not around here anyways.) It was usually more of a ""Ragnar's whole family was slain. Ragnar grieved and took up his axe to seek vengeance."" kind of thing. With Mr. Wednesday, Mr. Nancy and all the others, I might not have given a shit about Shadow even if he was anything but a foil for the world around him. That worked for me. I can see why it wouldn't be everyone's cuppa, but to me it's actually a nice point.

Then again much of it may also be incidental to other things. I've never quite been able to enjoy the Lord of the Rings-trilogy as much as others of my kind, because I find that there is not a single interesting character in the books save Gollum, and the amazing world can't quite keep me entertained if I don't also have deep characters. So clearly my reaction to the same thing in American Gods was the exact opposite. Had my first encounters with the two books been switched around I might have felt the opposite way. Or maybe my blood still bears loyalty to the All-Father so that anything involving him becomes good in my eyes. I don't know.",Gurusto,2014-07-17T04:08:11Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,32
2av1yp_33,2av1yp,"Mieville is the man for urban fantasy. It's often easier to find urban fantasy in YA or children's books, so it can be a bit touch and go. Some of the best I've ever read was by Robin Jarvis - the Deptford Mice Trilogy - absolutely terrifying, brilliant books. But they are aimed at kids so go in with an open mind. For teenagers but still a pretty compelling story is White Cat (followed by Red Glove and Black Heart) by Holly Black. 

EDIT: I forgot to say Ben Aaronovitch!! Bit wasted on readers who don't know London at all, but they're witty, clever, dark and twisted. Based on a policeman who interviews a ghost by accident, and then gets picked up by the occult squad of the London Met Police - one guy, who's the last wizard remaining as far as he knows. Involves the same clever twisting of deities and figures into real people/forces, but much more fast-paced and funny than American Gods.

The man is probably one of the best writers in the genre. It blows my mind how many books I've enjoyed only to seeing his name in the acknowledgments thanking him for his help in writing the book. The dude was even in charge of editing the English dub for Princess Mononoke.

I'm sorry to be geeking out like this right now, but I see a lot of other people recommending similar authors and I think you would be doing yourself a huge disservice if you pass over Neil Gaiman's other work. Why read something similar when you got a decently sized bookshelf worth of the real deal?",offtheclip,2018-11-22T12:10:25Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,18
9zarmm_19,9zarmm,"I love it, its one of my all time favourite books and I re read it at least once a year.

A book is always going to be somewhat subjective..I couldn't even finish Stardust, and Anansi Boys seemed to me to be written by someone who thought they were much funnier than they actually were and I had to battle on to finish it, whereas American Gods and The Graveyard Book I adore.

A lot of people seem to dislike Shadow as a main character, but the clue is in the name.  He is half God, half human, and for the majority of the book the God half is unawakened and non functioning and Shadow is just drifting through life going where the current pushes him.  The one person who could change this, Laura (we are told it was through her that Shadow became involved in the crime that sent him to prison, which is something that Wednesday hadn't counted on) has to be removed for that very reason and once again Shadow becomes a drifter.

9zarmm_20,9zarmm,"This book strikes a really respectful tone about the old gods, and gives touching, eloquent insights to their struggles to fit into modern society.

Too often in this genre, it descends into kitsch as ""foreigners from another time"" (oh look, Heracles is confused by hot water plumbing again, and Daghdha can't figure out ATMs, har har har). But Gaiman's work never settles for the cheap laugh and instead fleshes out the old timers with their own pathos and tragic falls.

It also helps - immensely - for me that he stresses the point that these gods are merely the *American* continent's versions. So the Bilquis you see is not Bilquis herself, but the manifestation of some immigrant person's memories of her from their homeland's worship.

The parenthetical chapter about Nunyunnini was one of the most powerful and bleak passages I've ever read anywhere. (And recently I read a theory that a comet impact in Greenland may have caused the Lesser Dryas cooling period around 11,000 years ago - possibly coinciding with the Siberian impact story in American Gods.)",,2018-11-22T13:22:19Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,20

Not every protagonist needs an obvious arc and backstory and quirky personality trait to boot. That’s a bogus meme of modern drugstore fantasy, because that kind human appeal easily hooks a reader. 

If that’s what you need in your fiction, that’s fine. For the most part, I do, too. But to say Shadow was a “poorly written” character is really speaking out of turn. Everything about Shadow is intentional, including his lack of intent. There’s a lot of subtext to that character, especially through the lens of American Gods’s greater thematic goals.

I love the concept of the gods walking among us and that they need belief to sustain them - an idea used in one of my favorite Discworld books Small Gods. Also that that its based around a road trip - the characters not just going from A to B across America in 'the main plot' but also mini stories about how different Gods made it to America scattered among the chapters. Maybe this meandering road trip feel to both the structure of the book (as well as the plot) is what alienated you?   

I am interested by commenters saying they felt it was the beginning of  a trilogy and many found the ending unsatisfactory, I would be interested to know what more you wanted? I have a preference for self contained narratives anyway but found the book long enough as it was and did not need any more build up or world building. As far for the ending being underwhelming I was happy first tike to be surprised by the twist and enjoyed my my second reason the ""its so obvious"" plot hints.

To me American Gods was as much a love letter to Norse Mythology as his actual Norse book, something else I saw referenced today in the sub.  

As others have said Gaiman's writing is more about mood than plot and it is deceptively simple - no literary flourishes you get with his idles like  Shirley Jackson. I have friends that hate him ( a joke they often say is ""its all just dead children"") so I know its not fort everyone but as the responses were so negative I thought I would chuck in my 2cents.",WondrousDavid_,2023-09-05T11:06:34Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,5

I've read all his novels at this point, and have been working my way through his graphic novels. Some are stronger than others.

I've seen people cite that Shadow is an empty vessel (for lack of a better word) but that didn't really bother me. I, too, felt this book was overly long, meandered too much, and could have been well served being tightened up. The ending did little for me.

American gods and neverwere just made no sense. The abilities and powers of characters were never explained properly and it was confusing. I never understood why anyone was ""strong"". 

Every battle or fight was just a weird poorly explained montage (American gods final battle). When characters died it made little sense as to why or how. The two assassin guys in neverwhere are a good example. They are never explained, only what they've done and their reputation. Then all of a sudden an angel is terrified of them and they all just get sent into a weird dimension. Total wtf. Nothing about how they fight or what process they use. In one scene in American gods one of them just gets ran over with a car...the story is epic but just way too little explanation on how the universe works.

Despite featuring Anansi / Mr. Nancy, Gaiman's novel [""Anansi Boys""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi_Boys) is officially NOT a sequel to ""American Gods"". Still a great book, though.",JugOfVoodoo,2021-02-23T21:59:25Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

Neil Gaiman's writing style is pretty much my favorite, so I didn't mind the descriptions or the slow build-up. I have fun taking it slow and just enjoying the confusion. 

And you're right--his stories always wrap up so neatly. The first time I read AG I had no idea what to expect, and learning all the ways in which Shadow was manipulated was fantastic (and heartbreaking).

It's a story that I feel naturally lends itself to an audiobook or public reading format, rather than a paper one. Sentences that seem to run on when written down instead feel flowing and ""real"". The characters' voices become more engaging and clear when people are re-enacting them.

But I persisted reading a few pages once a day till I reached the good parts. I really wish he made the plot a bit more interesting in the beginning.

Regardless of the politics of it (advocates for skepticism regarding climate change claim methodology, but not in the way you're expecting when you read that sentence), but such a great story and a good read.

Back to American gods, I had moments where I just had to set down the book and go for a walk! Couldn't recommend that book enough.

American Gods is quite a meandering mess that can be quite polarizing, but I enjoy how loose it is at times.

197lcsp_2,197lcsp,"This is an entire sidebar but, as a rabid Neil Gaiman fan, if you’d like recommendations for similar works - ones that leave you satisfied and empty and are somehow a slog and a breeze to get through, where you know you’re missing meanings and details and layers because the author is writing a legitimate masterpiece - check out Gene Wolfe. 

Wolfe was a huge inspiration to Gaiman! I believe the story goes; Neil used to read Wolfe’s stuff, wrote him a few fan letters that Wolfe actually replied to, and later Wolfe read some of Gaiman’s work and contacted him and they became friends. But it’s fun to read because Gene Wolfe was truly a master of his craft, and Gaiman is so deeply influenced by him and American Gods is where it’s most evident. 

Anyway, I could wax poetic about Wolfe and Gaiman forever!! I feel the same about American Gods. It’s an absolute drudge and just simmers in the back of your brain forever after!!",danger_wasteland,2024-01-15T22:54:42Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,2

They stick their necks out financially so that we can be immersed into a totally different world and their shows are quite different from the other predictable, shitty shows other networks air. Other Networks (most notably AMC with Breaking Bad) have tried to get the hang of what HBO are doing by emulating it and putting their own twist on it but HBO keeps upping the ante with shows like Game of Thrones.

American Gods isn't my favorite book by Neil Gaiman. I really loved the novel he wrote with Terry Pratchet called ~~Bad~~ Good Omens (favorite book as a kid). Even so, it is a superb book. I think that this coupling with HBO will up the ante of the gruesomeness and the humour will floor people who haven't read the book.

The book did drag on in some places though so hopefully HBO is given some creative legroom to swap things up and insert scenes they feel will benefit the storyline.

I don't think the style had much to do with the demise of the show - just the costs didn't add up - the production costs were huge for a TV show, but these days high budget TV shows are definitely making money for studios...

I made a side trip there when I was in Tennessee and it was even more surreal than described in the book. It was very clear reading American Gods that Gaiman had embarked on something that was big, maybe too big for him. I feel like he succeeded overall. He nails enough small details to give the book the regional differences it so desperately needed in order to be called American Gods. His line about people coming to Vegas not to win money but to lose money was one of my favorite insights.

After many years of reading Gaiman I've come to realize that he writes great dialogue and when it comes to the intersection of myth and reality there are few who are better at storytelling, but he is not going to burn a hole in your head with the radiance of language. If anything American Gods is almost Hemingwayish: very straightforward descriptions and almost no purple prose. This is not his default setting. It seemed like a deliberate mode that served the purpose of the book. After all, the novel was about gods walking among us. It had a stake in maintaining a believable reality that would not have been helped by the kind of prose found in, say, Stardust (which is my favorite Gaiman book).

Overall, I'd say it deserves its high reputation. Maybe not top ten, but it's a great book with a lot of compelling ideas and a shit ton of marginalia and esoterica. It's worth it just for the grifting scenes, though I guess it's really just one big grift anyway.

Likewise, I think many classics enjoy the same bias.

What's difficult of course is distinguishing timeless literature from the works that were purposely obfuscated in an attempt to seem clever or simply suffered from poor or insufficient editing and re-writing.  Either can be rewarding in their own way to finish, but if you want evidence that a difficult work isn't necessarily better than one that is easy to read, then simply compare _American Gods_ to _Charlotte's Web_.

He wants to tell you -an adult- a story similarly to how one might tell a story to a child. With that being said, he's quick to throw details at you that might seem overdone -when in fact- they're usually done with an understated wit.

I think that becoming more acquainted with the various mythologies it incorporates makes a reread much more rewarding. I know that after reading into the Norse myths, there were loads of little details that I spotted that, while not necessary to understand the story, definitely add a little something overall.

3d054n_9,3d054n,"Kopied from an earlier post of mine regarding this book

>I'm a huge fan of Gaiman's work, but IMO ""american gods"" is a novel that is seriously overrated. I want to like it, because the premise for the litterary universe it is set in is just SO GOOD, but Gaiman clearly left it at the potential level.
Here's The reason why I think it is not that good:
Shadow (seriously, what a lame name) is a crappy character. He is impossible to empathize with. The combination of an introspective personality coupled with emotional bluntness COULD have worked if the book switched viewpoints often (or if he was a supporting character), but as the main character in a modern fantasy, it kills the general sense of wonder. The universe filters through the characters, and shadow makes everything boring. Not ""dark"", not ""suffering"", but boring. He is unresponsive and lame. Good enough as a character, horrible as a MAIN character.
And because the reader's only way into the unverse of ""american gods"" is filtered through that apathic, gray filter that is shadow, everything else in the book becomes.... well, bad. The motives of the other characters (in particular wednesday), the general plotline, and the exremely clever way of writing the gods into modern american society- all of the good stuff, is dulled by the hopeless main character. He quite litterally casts a shadow over all of the good work.",coffee_in_bed,2015-07-12T19:45:28Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,9

While these Greek gods occasionally interact with deities from other cultures, not once through the entire story is there any mention of the Dreamtime or any reference to Australian mythology - and only one paragraph that mentions the current dominant religious views of the country.

bbp72h_1,bbp72h,"Try Neil Gaiman's [The Sandman graphic novels](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40372-the-sandman).

I'm a huge fan of Gaiman, but like you, I wasn't that impressed with *American Gods*, but keep in mind -- this was Neil Gaiman's first foray into novel writing (at least his first published novel).

Gaiman had come off a magnificent award-winning career as a comics writer when he wrote that novel, and I think much of the sparseness you felt was that he was being too oblique, as in the past, he relied on an artist to help crystalize his concepts to the reader. He gets better as he contines to write more novels and short stories.

But again, if you want tons of mythology, lore, and world building, try the *Sandman* series. It goes way deeper than American Gods. In my opinion, this is where Gaiman really shines -- in the graphic novel / comic medium.

In the first volume of the graphic novel series, Gaiman is still finding his way, but by the second and third volume and onwards, it becomes so good (and epic).",UltraFlyingTurtle,2019-04-10T21:24:10Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

9aqj49_4,9aqj49,"Agreed.  


The main character has no curiosity, and no real agency.  It's really hard to get invested in what happens with him, and you don't even get to learn about the world through him.  He's just a passenger in this, which makes you, observing him, even further from the choices being made.  Stoic is one thing, but Shadow is just a cipher.  


And after a little flirting with it, the reader learns about the world of the gods.  And then…  that's it.  We never really journey into it, we never really learn the rules of it, or see a game played out.  The only real mechanic we need to know or care about is that blood sacrifice in Odin's name would be a big deal (to him, at least… I don't think the reader really cares one way or the other at that point).  


The worst part, to me, is how non-distinct all the gods are.  Besides Loki being a conman, and Ibis being an undertaker, nobody really represents their elements.  They don't have different powers or influences or weaknesses… they just look different when they're ""back stage"".  It made meeting new ""gods"" pretty moot.  Why do I care about Johnny Appleseed?  


And the thing that really struck me as an 'FU' from the author was the whole zombie wife thing… that seemed completely unearned, was never really explained, and repeatedly served as a deus ex machina to advance Shadow's ""plot"" forward.  


\-----

While it's a totally different genre, Long Dark Team Time of the Soul (Douglas Adams) plays with a similar world, but does it better.  It has humor and plot, and still does the one interesting thing that American Gods hangs EVERYTHING on better than Gaiman did.

My favorite - and completely uninformed and unfounded - theory that I made up about Neil Gaiman's is that he really really hates his first wife. That's why all his heroes start out with annoying and or horrible love interests.

I really liked it. 7/10. Maybe this is because I didn't build up any hype and then get disappointed.

I tend to like mythology and enjoyed the characters Gaiman created, how he wove it all together. 
I also liked the protagonist. He was passive while being surrounded by active people; he seemed to absorb rather than emit anything. He contrasted, of course, which made him stand out, and I found it interesting. 
The whole book had a certain other-worldliness that appealed to me.

Playtone Productions also talked a little about the other projects they had planned(it was basically a media event for a smaller TV and film studio) but in relation to American Gods for HBO they threw out a few ideas; from the article:

Now slated for six seasons, each season will be of 10-12, hour-long episodes with a budget of around $35-40 million per season, targeted to debut on the cable powerhouse in 2013 at the earliest. 


Neil Gaiman will be the executive producer and writer and has said:

 ""I'm worrying about it one episode at a time [and] one season at a time. The overall plan right now is that the first season would essentially be... the first book, with a few interesting divergences.

And for those asking, No, 6 years of AMERICAN GODS on TV doesn’t mean just the 1st book. It means I need to write the 2nd now, for a start.

So there will probably be more than 2 books as well.

>Then there are the American gods. In all that time I spent listening, I only know four. 

They're all American Gods. It's a story about how various people's and their myths have traveled to the continent over the centuries. That's what the vignettes also show. Odin and Ra are now American Gods as well. (And spoiler alert, you do meet the European Odin as well). 

>The gods were incredibly underwhelming and odd. I never would have pictured Odin, war god, granter of berserker rage, who trading his eye for knowledge of everything ever, being a con artist and hustler, or charm women into bed.

I think you should reread your norse mythology. That stuff is fairly in character for him and also Odin is very upfront about how he's down on his luck. 

Meanwhile, he's still a war god. That's the whole reason he's in the book. He's trying to fight the war of old gods vs. new. 

>Why should I be against these gods?

You don't have to be. But it's clear why the Old Gods might be interested in their own self preservation. 

> A book without any awe, without wonder, that seems to me drab and colorless?

But you just complained about how Shadow didn't react properly to all the crazy stuff that happens. But we do learn why Shadow is a bit detached from everything by book's end.

4vzkxn_3,4vzkxn,"What you describe struck me too, but if you had read/listened to the entire book you would find out that it's how Shadow is. His wife visits him in a graveyard (or a forest, I don't remember exactly) and she tells him that the problem with Shadow is that ""he just is"". And that is part of the reason she had the affair. That is how his demeanor has been throughout the story. Personally I think he is depressed: all the symptoms are there. I mean the guy agreed to hang from a tree for seven days for his employer, whom he had met a just few months ago! If this isn't a death-wish, I don't know what is. In the end when he goes to Norway we see him start to slowly recover- he has finally figured out who he is. He smiles at girls and resolves some issues with another avatar of his father. I guess we just have to accept that it's his nature (to be passive). 
Neil Gaiman has also written a short story, as sort of sequel to American Gods where Shadow has to fight Grendel in a death-match spectacle. I personally think Shadow to be a little more alive and proactive in that story. Maybe you should check it out.",hardtrier,2016-08-04T10:27:11Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,3
4vzkxn_4,4vzkxn,"I agree with you completely about Shadow. The only reason I kept going and finished it is because I've had an interest in mythology for a long time and am very interested in any book that reimagines mythologies in any way. So I was interested in the overall story and the gods themselves, but it was hard at times to get through Shadow's inherent disinterest. I did want to share what I think happened to this version of Odin who is so unlike what he is supposed to be. At the very end Shadow is in a foreign country (like Iceland or something, I can't remember exactly) when he runs into a different version of Odin whose appearance at least seems more in keeping with what it should be (you don't get anything about his behavior). So my guess is that the place the gods are shape how they look and who they become, maybe it also depends on who exactly is worshipping them, I don't know. For whatever reason America turned their version of Odin into a greasy con man trickster type of God. That may explain it, but I do agree that Odin shouldn't have really been like that. I would still recommend you check out Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman. I think it is so much better than American Gods. It deals with the sons of Anansi and the main character actually has emotions and reactions.

I guessed some of it based on remembering mythology and never had trouble following the plot.  I can definitely see that if you didn't know who people were based on their name (Wednesday) or a description of their appearance you would find it mysterious.  There were definitely enough twists to unsettle me and keep me guessing, partly due to the large cast.  I did identify with the main character, sometimes uncomfortably so; [spoiler](/s""there's some allegory regarding living with an abusive or often absent father, what is worth making sacrifices for and how much sacrifice for family approval is too much, working at a soulless corporate job, disfunctional extended families, poisonous marriages, addiction, overlooking abuse of children for convenience and more"").

Of course Gaiman has had Coraline and Stardust made into movies and he's been hugely popular with fantasy fans for years. However, nothing has launched him into the mainstream stratosphere like American Gods has and that's because of the TV series as well as the book....it was the same with George RR Martin.

Mr Nancy and Czernobog are both more sympathetic than Odin and Loki. Hell, HINZELMANN is more sympathetic than Odin and Loki. No really. 

About the whole ""people still are violent, tricky and smart"" thing, the ascension of Christianity and Islam as dominant world religions (especially Christianity) resulted in the deaths of a lot of pre-Christian religions and the conversion/death of the worshippers of those religions which led to the gods of those religions being forgotten about or misremembered as demons. It's something that happened a lot of the time in actual history/reality. Baal (to name one example) just gets misremembered as Beelzebub.

You don't have to like it, but its not some great big mystery as to why you dont... its just not your type of book. There's no conspiracy, no super secret handshake that we all made up and excluded you from, my clubs front door does not say ""no Gaiman haters allowed"".

1z2s6t_4,1z2s6t,"I found it to be pleasurable and immersive but ultimately not as epic as it promised to be. I enjoyed the perspective of an British transplant on America's cultural melting pot all filtered through the most iconic American right of passage: the road trip. I enjoyed the metaphor of  inevitable steamrolling of old culture and tradition by inevitable and seemingly unstoppable ""march of progress"" that we call modern convenience, but at holds greed at it's heart. 

The new gods aren't the American gods and the old gods the foreigners.  They are all American gods.  It's a story about America being at war with itself.  We're an odd country. Most our citizens' ancestry is European. Immigrants brought that with them, because that was what America was about. But with every progressive generation we retain less of the culture we imported and replace it with what some may argue is meaningless fluff. 

Think of 1940's New York. With it's strong Italian American cultural alcove. It's celebrations, and holidays. Think of 1900's Chicago, with its neighborhoods were German was the basically the native language.  Or the French/Islander Creole mix of Louisana. The Irish of Boston.

Now think of an average suburb. Or watch prime time network television. Very little of that diversity is represented. And when it is, its usually in stereotype.  Think of what the media feeds us as being typical American.  Our previous identities are fading. We are perhaps trading them for a certain cultural homogeny.  This is what I feel was the heart of American Gods, and I appreciated that. 

(That being said. That's just me. I hate a lot of well lauded books. Don't sweat it. Read what you like and screw what anyone else says.)",Mister_Grumbles,2014-02-27T16:48:32Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,4

All of the characters were uninteresting, but Shadow was the worst. I didn't care about what happened to him and so it was hard to care about the plot. I still really like the concept behind the book, but a great concept can only carry you so far.

What I loved about American Gods is its atmosphere, if you will. It has a meandering, story-telling tone that I think really captures this ""American folklore"" spirit. I love that Gaiman describes a pages-long back story of some minor character, and he does it in a way that is irrelevant to the plot and an absolute joy to read. Will I read it again? No. Will I recommend it others? Probably not. Am I glad that I read it? Absolutely.

On a side note, I'm currently reading Anansi Boys. It has the same ""god personified in the modern world"" concept behind it, but I'm finding the story and the characters significantly more engrossing. Admittedly, I haven't finished it yet, but maybe you'll like it more as well.

7dle94_1,7dle94,"I read American Gods when it first came out..I re read it at least once a year because its a story I really enjoy.

I can understand why Shadow comes across as ""flat"" and empty but I think the clue is in the name...remember he is really part god, but not only does he not know that himself, but that part of him is unawakened, so he really is a ""shadow"" of what he will later become.  It isn't only the death of Laura that makes him that way, as Laura remarks at one point that sometimes she would come into a room and not realise he was there sitting in the dark.  Laura and his love of her seem to act as his anchor in the world and that is why Wednesday has to have her removed so that Shadow is available when he is ready to make his move.

Belquist was the introduction of the plot of old Gods and Goddesses existing in modern day America...later its explained how they actually came to America, and then how new Gods are made in America so tying the past and present together.  Shes just your first picture of the ordinary and the extraordinary living side by side.  Same with the stories of various arrivals...they appeared to be placed randomly in the book to show the randomness of their arrivals..some were brought deliberately, some were carried almost accidently, but they all ended up living in a strange land almost forgotten and having to struggle to survive.

Shadow was prepared to undertake the vigil on the tree because he had to, he had taken an oath and drunk the mead and this was his last act...he had nowhere to go, nothing to do or any future plans at this point, he had been drifting along doing as Wednesday asked and now Wednesday was dead and this was his final act for him.  In Norse mythology, Odin hung upon the tree, a sacrifice of himself to himself, and this is how he gained knowledge, as Wednesday hints when he quotes one of the old verses to Shadow earlier.  So here you have the two mythologies meeting each other..a son being the most powerful sacrifice for a father re Christian mythology, and Shadow also (unknowingly) being part of Wednesday so that after he is taken from the tree he is finally fully awake, he has knowledge, and although at first he only wants an end and death, he then re enters the world and finally acts with some self determination.",Oscarmaiajonah,2017-11-17T19:51:17Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1
7dle94_2,7dle94,"I also just finished American Gods on Monday. It was my first Gaiman read, and I came away from it with mixed feelings as well. First off, obviously a brilliantly creative book. He’s clearly a fantastic writer, but I agree that parts of it felt very slow, particularly the Coming to America segments. At times, it felt like Gaiman just crammed lots of brief descriptions of different Gods into the book to make it live up to its title. It could have been more entertaining to read if the parts about the old Gods had been more cohesive to the specific part of Shadow’s journey.

I loved Shadow’s dream sequences, especially the fact that they sometimes have consequences on real life, like the Thunderbirds one. I thought that was brilliant.

I thought the coin tricks and the eternal coin keeping Laura half-alive, even after her funeral, were very cool plot points. Also loved the bank con, I wish Gaiman had written a few more cons like that. Finding Allison McGovern’s body in the trunk was a crazy surprise, and the ending scene in Lakeside was awesome. Lots of suspense and interesting twists.

I agree with what’s been said about Shadow’s relationship with Laura. Shadow’s emotions are sometimes described as angry, other times as apathetic, and others still as longing for Laura. No matter what she does to him or says (telling him he’s not even alive but Robbie is, telling him Robbie liked fucking in a mirror, etc.), he doesn’t ever sway or feel conflicted about his love for her. Huh? It almost seems like he ties himself to the tree out of spite, but not to get back at her. Almost to...get her back? But then he doesn’t want her back? But he does? Weird arc for me that could have been written much more compellingly.

7dle94_3,7dle94,"I'm a week late to this party but here's my thoughts:

I grew up reading myths/legends/folktales. I loved all of the shout-outs to various cultures and mythologies. It made reading American Gods so much fun. 

Shadow is one of my all time favorite characters. I wanted to slap him upside his head most of the book for being a complete and utter dipshit. He made so many bad decisions by refusing to take control of his own life. In the scene where he takes the job from Wednesday at the bar there's a line. ""The drink was a tawny golden color"". I literally yelled ""Don't drink it! It's either magic or piss!"" But of course Shadow drinks it. Then Wednesday mentions it's mead and I was like ""Yep. You're fucked. Dumbass drinking stuff when a dude just said he's a leprachaun.""

I also loved how descriptive and long and winding the book was. I enjoy description and long plots. So that was a plus.

I think the reason why the characters were so flat is because they dont portray people. The characters portray ideas and concepts that look like people and live like people. Even one of the few human characters, Laura, is a zombie. She isn't living Laura. She's dead Laura who Shadow brought back. I would be willing to bet that she might even be Shadow's idea of Laura instead of Laura herself.

Shadow is the most complex character because he is more than an idea that looks human. His mother was human so he is partially a living breathing human being. He was a hollow man though throughout the book because he literally couldn't be a full person if he only relied on his human half. He didnt get angry at his wife or feel betrayed because there wasn't enough Shadow functioning to care. He was on surival mode. It was only after he realized and accepted that he had another half that he was a full person. That's why he wasn't as much of a dumbass once he came back to life and finally stopped being a pushover.

TL;DR: American Gods isn't for everyone. It has stylistic elements that a lot of people don't care for. However, if you like long, winding stories and characters that aren't quite people you might like American Gods.

7dle94_5,7dle94,"And to add to the comment below about his choice of the afterlife being flat, I totally agree. It felt like a forced way to label Shadow as a tired everyman. I love Haruki Murakami’s books, and he does an amazing job of depicting boring everymen in absurd, fantastical situations, with interesting payoffs at the end. Different style, but wish American Gods had had a little more of Murakami in it.",yogurt_viking,2017-11-17T17:18:14Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,5
bgpip2_1,bgpip2,"I agree, but for reasons different than yours.  American Gods, the book, was about America first and God’s second.  The show glosses over the unique American landscape and culture with the gods serving as soundboards for different aspects of America and the immigrant experience.  The characters in the show are too concrete most the time and when they’re being metaphorical it’s with all the subtlety of a hand grenade.  

The actual human characters were pretty awful in the book and choosing to focus so much time on them was a mistake.  Shadow especially, he may as well been in how not to write protagonists for dummies.  He was purely reactive in the book aside from one event 1000 pages into it and when you translate it to the screen it’s so much worse.  

The over all visual tone of the show is also too stylized.  When everything is Tim Burtoned you actually lose the unique aspects of your location.  

Finally it needs to pick up the god damn pace.  There’s no reason it needs more than 2 seasons.  

It’s not terrible, but it’s not as good as the book and the book had major problems.",Twokindsofpeople,2019-04-24T12:22:47Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

As far as the changes go I think it's kind of unique in my experience in that it's almost a completely different story from the novel but I don't think it would work as well for someone who hasn't read the book as it does for me.  I think the slow pace of the show would get frustrating for someone going in blind, but for someone who's read the book and knows at least in broad strokes what that pace is building to it works fine.  Usually adaptations that stray as far from the original as American Gods has loose what made the original appealing but I don't think the show has lost that spark, that's kind of impressive.",stereobreadsticks,2019-04-24T14:42:32Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,3

(\*googles furiously\*)

Ha - I'd be happy with either of those illustrating a Gaiman cover.

We disagree I guess, though I don't really see why people have issues when a screen adaptation turns out differently from how they  imagined it, when (important) the same creators are involved with both.

See, if LOTR had turned out wildly different, that would have been a problem for me. The Hobbit did, and that *was* a problem. American Gods, Altered Carbon, even Hitch-Hiker's Guide? In each case the original creator was fully involved with each iteration and such differences as were introduced I've always found acceptable.

It's a personal thing though. If you don't like something then it's up to you. Move on, find something else, write about that :).",jfffj,2019-04-24T13:47:52Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,7
la2gz3_1,la2gz3,"Urban fantasy written in archaic, high-fantasy prose would come off as unbearably pretentious. The whole point of urban fantasy is the layering of the fantastical over the mundane, usually from the POV of a character from the mundane world. Do you know anyone in real life who talks like Elrond from LotR? Unlikely, and if you did you’d probably think they were a pretentious weirdo. This is especially the case in American Gods because it’s all about how the mysteries and power of the old gods has become diminished to the point where they’re almost mundane themselves.

I can understand having a problem with the slow, meandering pacing of the book, but again if you got through the whole of the LotR trilogy then that shouldn’t be as much of a problem for you IMO.

As for the characterisation of Shadow, this is a man who has spent the last three years of his life in prison with the only thing keeping him going being the thought that he’d get to see his wife again, only to find out that she was not only dead but that she wasn’t who he thought she was. And then all the god stuff on top of that. When faced with an overwhelming change of life circumstances like that, some people focus on their feelings and try to sort them out and process, and others bury their feelings and just focus on trying to get through their day. Shadow is the latter. When the weird stuff happens he thinks that he’s hallucinating or going crazy and decides to just roll with it until things start making sense again. As a result of this Shadow is a bit flat in the first half of the book and a lot of his character development happens later in the story.",RebelScientist,2021-02-01T13:54:23Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

5mgwnw_2,5mgwnw,"I read this book precisely because it was popular. And that may have been part of my mistake. I should have stuck to genres I like. But I thought Gaiman would be like Pratchett and I thought American Gods would have good character interactions between gods.

This is the only Gaiman I've read, and I can see he's definitely no Terry Pratchett. His writing isn't bad, per se, and the word building is decent, but I still found reading a chore. Maybe it was because I read the extended edition which Gaiman said he oreferred. His writing lacks a certain flow that eases me into the book. Each new paragraph, I found that I was willing myself to go along. Defonitely not my favourite prose.

Then the characters. Shadow is literally the shadow of a character. He falls flat, essentially, and is not someone I could relate to. The 'gods' appear to me to be like cameos. I feel like Gaiman went through the explicit effort of finding unknown Gods and adding them to his storyline. I found most uninteresting. This is a subjective opinion, of course, but I think OP feels my pain. The gods seemed like puppets on stage, really. 

And then at last, the length and pacing. Don't get me wrong. Some scenes were good. The scene with the goddess giving Shadow the coins as blessings is really interesting. So is the mention of the exact centre of the USA and of gods occupying different stations in life across America. But Shadow spent way too much time in the amall town in the middle of nowhere. Nownit could have been good if he tried to show a small town experience in America. In a way, he did succeed. But again, it was something about Gaiman's prose that drove me to boredom. He lingers just a little too long on things I don't care much about. In short, it lacks the force of 'Gilead' and the quirky humour of 'Small Gods.' i liked both those books, but this I didn't.

Many people also mention the roadtrip aspects. Even so, I think there are better books on roadtrips across the UsA or journeys in general. I never felt an epic sense of scale or a wanderlust on readin their travels on the road.

So I guess this just isn't the book for me. Many people also recommended 'Stoner' and I despise that book. People said 'TaiPei' by TaoLin. I didn't like that either. People said 'Grapes of Wrath' is amazing. I couldn't make it three pages in ( though this I may need to read later)

So yeah, not mu cup of tea. The prose was bad, the characters underwhelming, the pacing slow and the journey unmemorable. I can understand why people love it, but I won't. ",Anon4comment,2017-01-07T04:51:05Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,2

5mgwnw_5,5mgwnw,"To begin with, I love Gaiman. I'm plowing through Stardust right now. With that in mind, American Gods is one of my least favourite books. To me, it felt nothing like his other books. Maybe because he focused on characters (at least tried - Shadow was boring as hell to me) more than a streamlined story, maybe because he set it in America and I favour his British settings more - I don't know. 

I get that Gaiman likes to set up the 'rules' of his universe sometimes with little explanation, but there were so many random occurrences in American Gods that I kept saying ""what is the point of all this"" and ended up putting the book down before too long. 

The reason I bought it was because every person and their mother (especially on Reddit) seemed to rave about how brilliant this novel is, but to me it was subpar at best. I think part of the reason I didn't like it was just that it was so overhyped, it could never possibly live up to the reputation it formed.

The books that I enjoyed most by Gaiman have a very streamlined story, thus never really falling into a slump like American Gods tended to do. For that reason his other novels might be worth a look, but I totally get if American Gods put you off him.

If you haven't already, Good Omens might be worth reading. Terry Pratchett and Gaiman co-wrote it, and in the author-notes at the end they discuss how they hit the point where Pratchett's and Gaiman's writing became non-distinguishable.

American Gods touches on this, gods are tied to the local areas.  American Odin is not the same Odin as Iceland Odin, although they share a common background.

Therefore, there can also be multiple variations of Jesus, reflecting the many  wildly different ways he's worshipped.  There *are* Christians in the middle east, but they're a minority group in the region and in some cases experience persecution.  (Yes internet, I'm glossing over a wildly complex sociopolitical situation, but we're not here for an essay on regional interfaith conflict.)

The big reveal that Wednesday was Odin was painfully obvious with his extremely heavy handed foreshadowing. I think he ran a lot of tropes into the ground and started on some potentially interesting concepts but never went anywhere with them.

I've only read a few of his books but I get the same feeling from all of his novels. I hear his short stories are better but I haven't tried them yet. Maybe if I was 13 or 14 I think I would have enjoyed his book a lot. It just felt very underwhelming and like he could have done it a lot of justice.

I also get this feeling of smugness from the way he writes. I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like he tries to seem really clever and witty with things that.... aren't.

Hinzelmann creating a town and killing a bunch of children was terrifying. Especially given that the evidence could have been uncovered at any time and Hinzelmann could have just denied all of it. (If not for Shadow)

8qxub9_5,8qxub9,"i’m a big neil gaiman fan and i know it’s not a super uncommon opinion among big neil gaiman fans to think american gods isn’t one of his best. i think it’s important to remember that it was written over 15 years ago now and i think the aspect of fantastical americana has been done better since then, but overall i agree that it just feels like there’s something fundamental missing — and for me that was warmth. there was really detached quality that made it difficult for me to care about the characters + the most interesting characters were the side characters. i think he tried to be “gritty” but it just felt blah and cold to me. it’s so sad because the concept is so fucking cool, but it fell really flat for me. 

i actually liked the starz series a lot more as far as american gods goes, though (or because) it takes a significant amount from creative liberties w/ the story and even tho i’m not the biggest bryan fuller fan in general. i do recommend checking that out. it’s a real treat visually if nothing else. 

as far as neil gaiman goes i don’t think american gods is a super good representation of his style. i really liked both anansi boys and neverwhere because i felt they were very warm, so if you want to try more i’d check out those. i really liked the graveyard book as well. that being said, he’s not a great writer. he can be a really fun writer. but he’s not a great writer and i don’t really sit down and read a book of his and expect a masterpiece, though i really do think some of his graphic novels are incredible. but overall imo american gods is super overrated and i think it hasn’t aged that well.

Shadow *is* Baldur.  You never learn where he came from or what his real name is, so we can assume his personal history is out when it comes to thwarting his god status.

The big eye-opener for this is actually a novella that Gaiman wrote as a direct sequel to *American Gods* called *The Monarch of the Glen*.  It is the last piece in his novel, *Fragile Things*.  If you liked *American Gods* and want to see Shadow realize godly potential, pick up the collection of work that is *Fragile Things* and read the last piece!

1qrq0i_2,1qrq0i,"1. As other readers have alluded to, I think that the monotheistic God (capital 'g') couldn't care less about the affairs of the lesser pantheistic gods, as they have no reason to feel threatened by the new gods (media, highways, etc.) and therefore had no reason to intervene in the story.
2. Odin and Loki were trying to bring about [Ragnarok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarök) which would actually have brought about their deaths.  This is difficult to understand if you don't look at the event from a viking perspective (think of the Klingon ""It is a good day to die"" mindset and you'll get a glimpse of that perspective).  Even though they die, it leaves only two humans left on earth to repopulate, but one would assume that those two humans would probably worship the norse pantheon having seen the end of the world at their hands, thus imbuing that pantheon with the only power left, and also destroying all other gods in its wake.  One might also assume, based on the rules Gaiman sets forth in *American Gods*, that Odin and Loki would essentially return, based on the remaining humans' belief in them.  Since all the humans who would follow in that path would probably believe in/worship that pantheon, they would essentially regain power as the human race rebuilt.

94puf2_1,94puf2,"There's a lot to unpack here. But I'll keep it semi-brief and say I liked American Gods because it is dreamlike. I don't think Gaiman intended it as a commentary on religion or the gods, but as a commentary on humanity. The whole of American Gods is a metaphor or meditation on the idea that humans are greater than gods, because humans created the gods in our image. That's why they die, often nonsensically,  but are still able to ""live"" a la Mad Sweeney, that's why they are depicted as petty, squabbling, destructive, erotic, money and morality poor, decrepit, self defeating and at best egotistical. It's why Odin is depicted as Wednesday and not Wotan.( Also remember Odin dies in Ragnarok so cannot die in battle with the new gods and almost certainly would have, Shadow knows this.) And that's why the New Gods are Media, World, TechBoy et cetera and not Jesus who, technically is an Old God because he's an adherrent and proponent of The Old Ways. Also isn't a god because he actually existed, tho he does make an appearance in the TV show as ""White Jesus"" (because the image of Jesus that we see depicted most is ""bigger"" than the Jesus who actually existed) Shadow is half human, half god. He's the person that bridges the gap between the two, but is neither. 

I thought the ending was a little anticlimactic as well, frankly. I found the scenes featuring Laura lurid and boring - but I understood her place in the narrative. She is Chekov's gun. But I did not interpret this book as a book about The gods and the battle they face for ultimate  supremacy. It's about humanity, people, and what the belief of people has the power to manifest for better or worse, often without them even noticing or fully knowing, or ultimately being responsible for the materialization of what they manifest. It's just an allegory, like all myths. 

You mention Gaiman's Sandman, and it's themes are similar. The entire series basically hinges on Dream's struggle with being more powerful than gods, older than the universe but ultimately useless without humanity's triumphs and failings. It is not an ""action"" comic but a philosophical one.

But I dig why people don't like AG. Most people who I know do not.

94puf2_3,94puf2,"> The whole of American Gods is a metaphor or meditation on the idea that humans are greater than gods, because humans created the gods in our image.

It is very hard for me to see it that way, considering everything significant happens because of a god or by gods.  Shadow isn't a person, he's the son of Odin, and manipulated by him to carry out his wishes.  And Laura didn't kill Loki on her own, she used a branch from Yggdrasil and stabbed him after being brought back to life by a magic coin from a leprechaun.  If anything, it shows that humanity, despite not really believing in these old gods, can still be manipulated by them, and killed by them, and things in their lives happen because of gods.  

I think you and I took completely different lessons from this book (which is fine, but I'm surprised by the divide).  I still don't see how Media or the fat kid are really even gods.  They represent tools that humanity uses!  What, before media was there a god of cars?  Before cars, was there a god of books, or god of the printing press, or god of canons, or god of hammers?  Why are the ""new gods"" represented by these very specific tools of humanity when we've had thousands of years of tools to choose from?

Early in the book an incident is described where Laura says she would come into a room thinking it was empty, turn on the light and find Shadow had been there just sitting in the dark.


When he comes out of prison he finds his adored wife and his best friend are both dead and dead in a manner that shows they were having an affair, and at this point he has given up on life, merely walking mechanically through the actions needed to live.  He eventually agrees to go with Wednesday because he has nothing else to do and nowhere else to go.


Only after he has hung on the tree himself, as his father did, do his two halves become integrated and he is fully alive, able to act and not just be acted upon.


American Gods is a self explanatory title, it really isn't about magic but about Gods, how men make and destroy them and make them anew to fit the society they now inhabit.

blf8pf_5,blf8pf,"Please note that I don't speak for Neil Gaiman in any way, but I'll give you my observations here. He tends to write stories because he wants to write them, not because the audience or publisher is clamoring for them. In one of his short story intros somewhere in*Smoke and Mirrors* or *Fragile Things*, he even talks a bit about how since he's become Neil Fucking Gaiman, he's got more trunk books now than you'd believe because  they aren't up to his standard but he knows they'd get published with minimal shopping and rework by editors because of who he is. 

Now maybe he's got an itch to scratch in the universe again because of the TV series, but he's written **American Gods**, **Anansi Boys**, **Black Dog**, and **Monarch of the Glen**, even updated **American Gods** to an Author's Preferred Text in 2011, and none of the other stories really flesh out the magic system from the original AG. Even if **Anansi Boys** is a companion instead of a direct sequel, it still plays by the exact same rules as AG and would've expounded on the rules of magic if Gaiman wanted to do it. He's had the opportunity to do what you want and he chose not to. To paraphrase Neil Gaiman's defense of George RR Martin though, he is not your bitch.  

Now there's nothing wrong with books that use a hard, coded magic system. Harry Potter, while I agree it is full of inconsistencies, is a terrible example to bitch over because HP shifts from an advanced children's series to a more mature young adult series. There's a major split between the first 3 books, where Rowling is writing under deadlines with a lot more pressure to pay her daily bills, to the last 4 where she's a cultural phenomenon and much better writer. But by the time she gets to the later books and the time and money she now can afford, she can't undo the problems and inconsistencies of the first 3. She can't rewrite them to the scope and depth of the earlier books and would ruin the magic of them if she tried. Those 7 books are important for the cultural impact they had on the world, but also make a great example of the evolution of a writer.

I'm guessing you're calling AG middle stage magic based on Brandon Sanderson's middle ground in his Sanderson's First Law post. Now there's some hard magic in AG and the biggest example would be Wednesday's 18 Charms - these are defined abilities. 
He sacrificed himself to himself and that is what he got in return, just like you get bread when you pay the baker. If you want more hard magic in that sense, read up all the mythology your eyes can take in. That will tell you what this god or that one can do.

But that's not what you're after.  You want a hard answer to the philosophical, why Odin IS, the existence of the gods, things like that. Odin is there because we, humanity, really believed that Zeus, Odin, Kali, and Bilquis existed and defined the laws of our universe. The belief that there's something more, larger, ineffable behind the scenes, that's all humanity. Whether you call it God, Buddha, Muhammed, aliens, or science and technology that you don't understand, humans still do it today. We have always believed that there's something greater and more powerful than us out there. What you're asking for when you ask for a harder magic system in this context isn't more rules or conversion rates, you're asking for an answer to the human condition.",see-bees,2019-05-07T15:53:25Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,5

Authors, and books by the same author.

Fred Saberhagen is an SF author who's written a lot of novels which sound interesting based on the blurbs, but I find the actual novel too boring to finish the first chapter. I've made a couple attempts, but now won't even look at anything by him.

When the second chance succeeds, it's usually because I have problems with an authors specific book.

No.

>They believe that the book is sort of anti religious towards Christianity. 

It's not, it's simply that God is not involved in the wars between the gods. It's below His paygrade.

>When I was younger I read the Percy Jackson series, and they seemed fine with that. If these two series are similar, then I'm pretty sure they'll let me read it. If you have read from both of these series, could you give me your opinion?

It's R-rated, but I don't recall anything in Percy Jackson which denied Christianity. If they're okay with the one, and okay with you reading R-rated material, they should be okay with the other.

It's Neil Gaiman. Just tell them he's an award-winning comic book author. It's a gross simplification, but if that's what it takes to make them feel better....",Halaku,2017-05-07T22:54:28Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

Christianity doesn't figure into the world of American Gods (there are reasons for this in the book). 

The series is more ""adult"" in content as well. There's sex, violence, etc. But it's not sacrilegious and I think it makes some good points about idolatry and other things that would fit in a Christian worldview. ",madmoneymcgee,2017-05-08T16:02:45Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,2

If your parents are the kind that police your reading, though, they would throw an absolute shit fit over American Gods for a number of reasons, and all of them pretty good if you're under a certain age.

3y5glg_3,3y5glg,"I just finished it. I did not like it.

It's always awkward when I get told a book is so unbelievably great by pretty much everyone, and when I finally get round to it, it turns out that I kind of hated it. American Gods is an enormous chore to get through and incredibly difficult to read, while at the same time being a book that I didn't entirely want to put down.

It's main problem is that it's not really about anything, while also being about a huge amount of things. That doesn't make sense, and that's okay because the book doesn't make much sense. The most excruciating thing is how little is really explained, not only to us as a reader but to the character, Shadow. Shadow blindly accepts everything and this makes him a completely unrelatable and unrealistic character that I couldn't care about. The gods that appear are all uninteresting and annoying, unpleasant people who don't really inhabit their space. You can go through hundreds of pages and realise that NOTHING IS HAPPENING. There are numerous interludes and chapters that jump around to unrelated tales; I wish I had been told beforehand that I could skip these because they add nothing.

Around the halfway point I unexpectedly found myself enjoying the story. I loved the depiction of Lakeside with its friendly people and was happy to forget about all the gods and the silliness happening elsewhere. It lasts for quite a while, and is another example of how the book spends a long time delving into unrelated things.

I just didn't get this book. The resolution was not remotely compelling and I was skimming paragraphs by the last 50 pages. Apparently, things just happen in this book because they do and Neil Gaiman thinks that's reason enough. I don't.",LeftHandedGuitarist,2016-01-01T12:31:06Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,3
3y5glg_4,3y5glg,"American Gods is easily the best thing Gaiman has ever written, and the only one I care to re-read. His other books are YA fantasy, whether they are labeled as such or not. His other books are fantasy, weird or horror, but they are encased in a safe viewing area from which the reader need not feel in danger. His other books don't threaten the reader with the need to think or the need to figure out what's going on, and more importantly what it means.  

But American Gods does ask that of you. American Gods will not tell you who Wednesday represents, or any of the other characters, or what the story is saying about religion and myth in the modern world. That is left to you the reader, and so American Gods is Gaiman's most Gene Wolfe-like book to date. And by that measuring stick, his best in my opinion.

I had a double-take trying to remember who Julia Roberts is and what did she write. Needless to say, that was flawed comparison. More so because I'm of the opinion that an Oscar is not as prestigious as a book awards.

rlw1g_1,rlw1g,"Overall, American Gods is a monumental work, mainly because of the scope Gaiman puts in the novel. I mean, god, the man crosses most of America in his writing and throws in characters from every age and mythology you can shake a stick at while still maintaining a mostly consistent plot. You can't beat that. I love that he turned the whole concept of mythology on its head to demonstrate to the reader the changing tides of legend and lore and how there is never a death of myth, only an evolution. He advocates a remarkably equal world in which women and all races are represented as *people* in that they could be shitty or nice based on their character, not their genetic outcome, and he reveals the magic in life.

That being said, there are bits I wasn't particularly fond of. Some of the scenes just seemed a little unnecessary and, at about the halfway point, I suddenly hit a bog of excess and irrelevant plot. It didn't last long but it was enough to make my urge for minimalism groan a bit. 

Overall, I was incredibly impressed. It wasn't absolutely perfect (what is?) but, for such an immense undertaking, the man delivered.

All that said, the imagery remains constant and dense throughout the book, and even increases at certain supernatural points. Again, symbolism is being used heavily. If you really don't enjoy it, or can't get past it, his work may not be right for you.

If you stick with it, however, you may find yourself learning to appreciate the prose.

I enjoyed The Ocean at the End of the Lane but felt that it was underdeveloped. It should have been longer.

It is helpful to have a cursory knowledge of mythology from a handful of cultures, but I found that knowing too much took away from the experience. You'll probably notice a thing or two that the rest of your club misses out on no matter what.

What you should do is prepare to read it again in a year or two, if you're at all the type of reader who goes through a book twice. I'm sure it's enjoyable to absorb everything on your first run, but it's much more rewarding to go back and note little details you missed at first.

If you find the paper-thin connective tissue that makes American Gods a novel instead of a short story collection tedious, as some readers do, give Ellison's original work a try.

-The rich and deep variety of themes it covers that intersect with all the subjects and issues brought up in the book (sexuality, relationships, family, love, a whole span of emotions, politics, social class)

-Tolstoy's famous attention to detail, but the ability to not get bogged down in at the expense of the story

-How it transports one to a different culture/society and period of time (I greatly enjoy Russian period pieces, so this is a good one for me!)

-The way it combines a number of different literary styles, some very historical, some ahead of its time

-The different tones and settings and characters... It's not all about one person's point of view, or all dark and depressing or happy and exhilarating, or all in a bedroom or on a train

-Finally, the subject matter in and of itself was pretty enlightened in its approach to not overtly moralize about Anna's life or choices

-The quality of writing... speaks for itself!

Dressed — as always — in black, with his unkempt hair and stubble, he’s a bit of a rock star himself. “I fantasise my own anonymity, and then people’s Twitter feeds are full of ‘passed Neil Gaiman on the street just now’. My wife says ‘You love being famous’, and I say ‘I love the useful bits of it’ — but mostly I like knowing I’m part of a crowd.”
To understand Gaiman, it helps to look at him through the prism of his wife. He refers to her constantly — she is clearly the fulcrum on which his life turns. A talented musician and singer, who once worked as a stripper and performing street statue, her feistiness has won her a devoted following. She has written one book, The Art of Asking, which throws more light on Gaiman than the dozens of books he has written himself. Gaiman, 57, sighs affectionately: “That book contains so much of our relationship.”
I comb through it, determined to crack the enigma that is Gaiman. “When Neil and I first met,” Palmer, now 41, writes, “we didn’t find each other all that attractive. I thought he looked like a baggy-eyed, grumpy old man, and he thought I looked like a chubby little boy. I now think he’s smashingly handsome, and he calls me ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’. Ain’t love grand?”

She says Gaiman is shy and easily embarrassed; that he cannot dance nor drink more than a glass or two of wine “without getting obnoxious or falling asleep”. That he has “abandonment issues” and spent months convincing her to marry him. Gaiman laughs: “When I met her, I was almost 50. I thought, ‘I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’ve never met anybody else like this one.’ ” But how does he handle being with someone so open if he is really as shy as she says? “It’s only weird for me because Amanda and I share different amounts. [She once said they had an open marriage, something Gaiman would not have revealed given the choice.] We are definitely an astonishingly unlikely couple, but it works. Standing next to Amanda Palmer is really good if you’re shy, because nobody is looking at you.”
Now I understand why he’s brought me to her concert. When I listen back to the hours of conversation, I find he has talked lots about Palmer and given me many interesting stories and digressions — but very little that reveals how he ticks.
“Nobody gets to know Neil,” Palmer tells me later. “I don’t either. I’ve been with him nearly a decade and I still find gigantic surprises lurking around every corner.” She believes that his prolific output of weird fiction is part of the smokescreen. “He stands behind a lot of personae.”

Grim fairy tale: Coraline was adapted as a film in 2009, and will be performed as a Royal Opera production in March

They married in 2011, and now live in Woodstock, New York, with their two-year-old son, Ash. Gaiman has three adult children from his first marriage, to Mary McGrath, and is also a grandfather. He would make a point of reading to each of his children every night, even when he was travelling. “We would have two copies of the same book and he would read it over the phone,” says his youngest daughter, Maddy, 23, who agrees that her father has different guises. “People think he’s some dark, goth weirdo, which he is, but he’s so warm and kind-hearted too.” His breakup with McGrath in 2002 was very civilised: “They were so cordial,” Maddy tells me. “He would stop by my mum’s house to walk the dog and we would still go on family holidays together.”
It is his children whom Gaiman credits with inspiring much of his material. He wrote Coraline for his older daughter, Holly. “When she was four or five, she would climb up on my lap and dictate nightmarish stories to me — about a little girl called Holly who would find that her mother had been exchanged for an evil witch who would lock her in the basement with the ghost children.”
Gaiman’s editor read Coraline, a warped fantasy based on his daughter’s imaginings and told him it was brilliant but “unpublishable” as it was “horror for children”. Eventually Bloomsbury published it, and it became a bestseller, then a 3D fantasy horror film. And next month sees the premiere of the Royal Opera production of Mark-Anthony Turnage’s new work based on the book.
Most of his creations, he says, are just elaborate daydreams. “I feel that ideas are balloons. If I don’t catch them someone else will.”
Yet there is something unique about his voice. Even if someone came up with a similar concept, surely no one could write a book as strange as Neverwhere, which depicts a fantastical underworld beneath the real city of London, where the homeless and dispossessed join the Black Friars and the Angel Islington.
“I’m always surprised,” he says, “that everyone doesn’t think the same way I do. Amanda is convinced I have a very strange relationship with dreams. Maybe I just bring things back with me.” He is currently writing a sequel, The Seven Sisters. “It’s about the nature of refugees and how we make homes.”
Apart from their weirdness, his books have no unifying thread: “I do nobody any favours because each book is so different. You could read American Gods and hate it and not know that you’d love Stardust.”
In person, Gaiman is courteous and genial. We chat over tea at the Contemporary Arts Center, then he suggests dinner before Palmer’s concert. He picks a restaurant in the French Quarter of New Orleans, housed in a crumbling mansion. It feels like a suitably gothic location, and on the way Gaiman excitedly points out the strange kilnlike structures in a cemetery. “They are like ovens, you put the bodies in at the top and four years later you take out whatever is left — ashes and a few bones. It frees up an awful lot of space.”
It brings to mind The Graveyard Book, another of his terrifying children’s stories, about a small boy who survives a brutal massacre and is raised by ghosts.
Over dinner, as Gaiman works his way through a plate of Murder Point oysters, I ask him if death — which is sprinkled liberally throughout his novels — bothers him. “It ought to,” he says thoughtfully, “but it doesn’t. Although I’m wussier than I was. I’m definitely not as enthusiastic to murder characters. I often twist things around to keep them alive.”
He used to worry that he would die before he could make his mark. “Now I feel I’ve written my name on the wall. Still, you never know what you’ll be remembered for, if anything. There is nothing like looking at the bestseller lists of yesteryear for teaching humility.”
If he could be remembered for one book, he would choose The Ocean at the End of the Lane. “It is so personal,” he says. Written for his wife, it encapsulates the imaginary terror and magic of his own childhood. The Sussex countryside where he grew up plays a central role. “I once tried to show Amanda the places of my youth, but they had gone.”

x6szb_2,x6szb,"I'm pretty sure the episode with the eye and Mimmir (Mímir) and the episode with Odin hanging himself in Yggdrasil are two different stories. When Odin drank from Mímirs well, he recieved wisdom and the ability to see everything that was going on in the world with the eye he gave to Mímir.
Related because it was his thirst of knowledge that drove him to do both things is when he hanged himself as an offer to himself (yeah, I know) from Yggdrasil for nine days without food or water and was stabbed (maybe constantly tortured, maybe just stabbed once) to gain the runes (and songs and wisdom as well)

But the thing about American Gods is, well, it's *American*. The Norse mythology that's hinted in the book is mostly (just in little ways, but enough to irritate me), well, wrong. At least it's inconsistent with what I learned when I learned about Norse mythology in school. 

Nina-edit: The original poem from the Hávamal - only in Danish, couldn't find it translated, sorry. 

**Odins indvielse (Odin's inauguration)** 
""Jeg ved, at jeg hang
i vindomsuste træ
ni hele nætter,
med odden såret,
viet Odin,
selv selve mig,
i det træ,
som ingen ved,
af hvilken rod det randt.
Brød gav de mig ikke,
ingen bød mig drik,
ned så jeg nu:
med et råb tog jeg
runerne op
og rev mig så løs.
Ni kraftige sange
fik jeg af den kloge søn
af Bøltorn, Bestlas far,
og en drik jeg fik
af den dyre mjød,
østes med Odrører.
Da blev jeg fyldt
med frodig visdom,
fik vækst og veltrivsel;
ord blev til ord
og avled nye,
værk blev til værk
og virked nye.""

s2li1_1,s2li1,"I'm glad you liked it! American Gods is probably my favourite novel. I picked it up about a year after it was first released, and I have read it a number of times since.

1) I think that America is a bad place for gods simply because they are forgotten there. People come to America and bring their gods with them, but soon they forget about them or do not teach their children about them, and the gods become obsolete. They are replaced by the new ""gods"" of America. 

4) I agree with what aflamp said, that it is neutral ground where neither the new gods or the old have an advantage. At the House of the Rock, Wednesday notes that tourist attractions are the most ""holy"" places in America. This was meant to be a tourist attraction, but no one came. It is like a church to no god.

(Good grief Neil Gaiman has terrible taste in women. That character just explains Amanda Palmer so much.) You can just feel the book start to sag, lose direction and flail around aimlessly about 300 pages in, and while it finally corrects itself, I still felt cheated out of hours of reading time.

He needs an editor who can stand up to him. When you're a best-selling celebrity rock star writer and the center of a vast worldwide fanboy circlejerk, you can get a lot of stuff by editors. When he was writing The Sandman he was already getting away with a lot by comics-creator standards, but he still played it safe most of the time and didn't let it drag. That said, he has good ideas, and usually good execution (Ocean At The End of the Lane was tight and mostly avoided his usual flaws.)",roalddalek,2014-09-29T14:24:20Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,American Gods,1

I could be wrong on that, of course, but I thought it was incredibly clever honestly. 

In the end though, I think good writing stands above all else. Even if Whiskey Jack was simply just a caricature of Native American culture written by a guy who didn't do enough research, the character was fantastic, the story on point, and everything about the book spoke to millions of readers worldwide.
