8d24yi_1,8d24yi,"Fun fact, I'm loosely related to H.H Holmes. My mother's side of Mudget dated back to him, I haven't yet had the chance to pick up ""The Devil In The White City"" but after reading this post I might give it a read! <3",NaughtyFrogRogers,2018-04-18T06:06:46Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
8d24yi_2,8d24yi,Thanks for suggesting The Devil in the White City! I'm gonna take a look after I catch up on my backlog lol,,2018-04-18T13:02:50Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,2
8d24yi_3,8d24yi,Erik Larson is a really enjoyable writer. I picked up Dead Wake after I read The Devil in the White City. Also phenomenal. Highly recommend. ,them0rrigan,2018-04-18T13:35:50Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,3
8d24yi_4,8d24yi,"Larson is one of my favorite authors. Thunderstruck is thematically the closest, it's also an interwoven tale of early 1900s invention and murder. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed The Devil in the White City. 

Dead Wake about the Lusitania and In the Garden of Beasts about the American ambassador to Nazi Germany are also excellent. ",SkywayCheerios,2018-04-18T02:37:41Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,4

orgbxo_1,orgbxo,"I'm with you.   I am honestly stunned at how many people here are expressing how much they loved the book.  I guess its a sign that people are different and opinions clearly vary.  I really wanted to like the book, I really love the topic, I even tried to read it a second time... But I cannot agree with OP or the lovers posting here.  I was so disappointed by it and would never recommend it to someone.  I think the worlds fair and city were relevant, and I think they are a large part of why Holmes was able to do what he did.  But to me the author failed in his attempt to link them in a captivating way.  If anything I feel this book is a droning, dull, disjointed example of how there either wasn't enough material to just make a book on Holmes, or the Author just didn't know where to go or where to stop.  I'm glad so many people enjoyed it, a great book is such an amazing thing... but the Devil in the White city was in no way that book for me.",Th3Instruct0r,2021-07-26T04:18:28Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
3gjv5x_1,3gjv5x,"Oh my god is this going to be amazing.  I stumbled upon this book when doing a history project back in high school.  We decided to do it on the [World's Columbian Expo of 1892 hosted in Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition) because we were a suburban Chicago high school, and we had just got done learning about the great Chicago Fire.  Chicago wanted to host the event to prove it was back after nearly being destroyed.  It was only during our research that we learned of the Serial Killer whom The Devil in the White City was based off of.  When I learned about it, I had to go out and read it, and was not disappointed one bit!  Complete page turner and keep you interested the whole time, plus it had a lot of history to it that helped our project.  If Scorsese and DiCaprio team up for this, it will be fantastic!  Think Sweeny Todd without singing and more serious, it will be AMAZING",atworkbeincovert,2015-08-11T22:01:04Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
3c5trf_1,3c5trf,"I felt the wikipedia article, on H.H. Holmes, was a better read than The Devil in the White City. The book has a great title and that is about it. It took a fascinating and horrifying true story and somehow made it as dry and bland as plain toast.",nopedog,2015-07-05T06:18:00Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
3pk3d1_1,3pk3d1,"This book was the first one I read on H.H. Holmes. I enjoyed Larson's writing style, it does read a lot like fiction, which I think only enhances the richness of the outlandish nature of this story. I think I prefer a different style in reading true crime, however. I read a lot of true crime, as it is my favorite genre. A CUNY professor, Harold Schechter, wrote *Depraved* - a great book to read in addition to The Devil in the White City if you are truly interested in the topic of H.H. Holmes. It reads a lot differently than Larson, but Harold Schechter is by far my favorite true crime author. I have read many of his books and have always enjoyed them thoroughly.

1iulqp_1,1iulqp,"I read both fiction (all genres) and non-fiction.  I think the Devil in the White City is a great non-fiction book.  His writing draws you in.  I thought I would be more interested in the H.H. Holmes parts of the book than the World's Fair but I have to say, by the end I was really into the World's Fair chapters.  His non-fiction is compelling and reads like a great historical novel.",cvilla7,2013-07-23T03:00:07Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
gibbd_1,gibbd,"There's a book called ""American Lightning, Terror, Mystery, the Birth of Hollywood, and the Crime of the Century"", which is presented as 'narrative history' (sorta dramatized and such), is a pretty fun read, about the tangled events surrounding the 1911 bombing of the *Los Angeles Times* by union leaders.   It might fit your fancy.  And I'll check out ""The Devil in the White City.""",Hippiespawn,2011-04-04T17:42:58Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
15r3vk_1,15r3vk,"These are the top 10 that I'd say stuck with me the most over the years:

10. The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey
This book changed how I look at money.  There's no big secrets or magic formula, just simple, common sense information.

09. The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky
This was like a page ripped out of my early high school years.  At times the book's diary entries mirror the journal I kept.

08. The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell
Like all of Gladwell's books, this one pulls back the curtain on life to see that most times there isn't as much luck involved as assumed.

07. The Road by Cormac McCarthy
This is every father's anxiety filled nightmare.  The fact that someone wrote it all down assures me that I'm not the only one worrying.

06. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
Despite the high school English teachers of the country (myself included) forcing this book down the throats of young readers nation-wide, this is a great story and one of the few ""classics"" worthy of all the praise.

05. Superstud by Paul Feig
This is one of the few books that I have found to be laugh out loud funny, but that's probably because it was honest and embarrassing.  Few people would ever have the courage to admit to the what Feig did, although many of them are guilty of some of the exact same things.

04. I Love You, Beth Cooper by Larry Doyle
When you were an awkward teenager, reading about the mishaps of a follow brethren is funny because it's true.

03. Columbine by Dave Cullen
This will be the next book I write on so for now I'll just say, most of what we thought we knew was wrong.

02. The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson
If only all history books were written like this, but then again not all historical events are this interesting.

01. East of Eden by John Steinbeck
The average person could probably name 4-5 Steinbeck novels and East of Eden wouldn't be one of them, but it is by far his best.",O1ogy,2013-01-01T15:34:38Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Devil in the White City,1
4ci63z_1,4ci63z,"Great book, and I love Erik Larson's stuff. In the Garden of Beasts is probably my favorite by him. 

I host a podcast called The Town Pub Book Club and we're doing The Devil in the White City right now. I'd love any input about that or his other books. 

Here's the podcast introducing that book (it's a no-spoiler episode)
