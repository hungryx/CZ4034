k51srz_1,k51srz,"The Maze Runner trilogy left me wholly dissatisfied by the end. Everything it set up had a terrible or anticlimactic payoff in Death Cure imo. >!Chuck’s family, Thomas and Teresa’s relationship, the cure for Flare, Vince and the opposition!< and more. It also ended with a very confusing moral message by >!destroying Denver, dooming the rest of humanity to die, and proving WICKED truly was doing an ugly but necessary thing with trying to kill Thomas for a cure. The writer also failed to properly develop Teresa and forced this nobody Brenda on Thomas.!<It just felt rushed and didnt payoff anything properly imo. 

I think Maze Runner was the only truly great one because of its unique storytelling device of  >!starting with an amnesiac Thomas, being thrust into a foreign environment, and the insane amount of tension when dealing with Grievers or learning about the  Griever Hole!<. However, as the series progressed, it became obvious that Thomas has plot armor. I think Scorch Trials is only good because of its mystery and atmosphere.

I decided to read the next two in the series and have to say that IMO, they were a real step up from the first book. Scorch Trials I think is the best of the three. The writing is not fantastic, but I enjoy the story line enough that I can get past that.

I think they adapted the Maze Runner book into a fantastic screenplay and I think the actors definitely suited the characters. I'm looking forward to seeing how Scorch Trials goes when it comes out this September.

2drv69_1,2drv69,"I haven't finished the entire trilogy, but I have gotten past the first two books. I'm mostly favorable to the first book, *The Maze Runner* itself , and fairly neutral about the second book, *The Scorch Trials*. As for my review below, I hope I've kept it spoiler free for someone who has seen the movie trailers.



**Review**

I think the concept of the book is fairly brilliant. A group of older kids set up an entire society in this region called the glade,  in the middle of a large and seemingly impossible to solve maze. The way these kids handled everything - from managing food, to sanitation, to the maze runners who hunt for a way out of the maze - was well-established, and had a bit of anti-*Lord of the Flies* flair that I particularly liked.

The book itself was very fast-paced, and was very don't-put-it-down-until-it's-done like Dashner is fond of cliff-hangers that seem important but usually aren't, and while I was occasionally annoyed that almost every chapter seemed to have an almost melodramatic final few words, it did keep me reading the book and finishing it quickly. If I'm motivated to read a book as fast as I did *The Maze Runner*, then I'm more than willing to recommend it.


The issue, and I think this is where the not-so-happy reviews come from, is with the main characters, particularly Thomas the protagonist and the mysterious girl, Theresa. They're a bit boring. Thomas shows up to this glade of dozens of teens, and is abnormal and atypical, and sort of popular, without much explanation why except for the fact that he's that one special hero that we often see in the dystopian teen novel genre (plus a couple spoiler-related reasons that I thought were just entirely silly). I think he was a little too sulky and broody about his circumstances at the start of the novel, but considering he's confused and his memories are screwed up, I mostly glossed over that issue. Theresa didn't do much. At all.

So, I didn't like the heroes much, thought a couple things were just goofy, and was a bit annoyed with how most of the moral dilemma questions were solved by having the wrong/bad guy killed off.

I think, from what I've seen of the trailer, the movie may have the potential to be put together better than the book. Thomas seems potentially more likable, my favorite characters are better than I imagined, and the monster creatures - grievers - look pretty darn cool, much cooler than their descriptions in the books. There are some scenes in the trailer that didn't happen in the book, but they look interesting, so I'm more than willing to accept some deviation.



**TLDR;** The plot was cool, the maze itself was cool, the main characters were boring, and some of the climax was a letdown. But, it's still a fun, action-packed read that I certainly recommend.

If you want me to expand more on a certain... anything, let me know.

**Edit** some spelling and grammar errors

32ch5s_1,32ch5s,">every book wanted to be twilight, not it's own thing.

I think most authors consider their stories to be their own thing. It's the rare terrible author that notices a lit trend & actively embarks on writing a whole novel ripping it off (although they probably exist I guess).

The marketing of the thing is another matter entirely though. Publishers come to the author going  ""yeah we're going to liken The Maze Runner to The Hunger Games on the cover since they're both YA dystopia"" and the author could be like ""yuck NO! I don't want my genius piece of work likened to *that* popular mainstream drivel!"" 

The publishers come back being like, ""look do you *want* people to buy your books or not? We - and you - shouldn't care if it's drivel; if it's popular & mainstream then putting its title on your cover is going to push *your* story as popular and mainstream. This is a proven method of marketing which *does* attract readers & increases sales - meaning *you* get to make more money off your work.""

Authors are people that have to pay bills just like you and I... and it literally *doesn't pay* to reject proven quality marketing strategies based off something like a useless, unprofitable sense of superiority.

Basically : if you want to make a living off writing, you don't just write a quality piece of literature - you have to push & market & promote using all the tools of the trade you can so it gains exposure & builds up a fanbase. The goal - for writers - is to become popular/mainstream and as a result make money so they can keep the lights on & bring home the bacon.

32ch5s_2,32ch5s,"This is random but you know what marketing strategy really gets my goat? Attaching the first chapter of the book's sequel onto the end of the first book. Drives me absolutely bonkers & I always absolutely refuse to read them if they're there. They feel more like spoilers than teasers... and also like they're devaluing the second book: if I got to read the first portion of the second book in the first book, then reduce the cost of the second book by the percent of pages I got & read of it in the first book, damn it! (lol)

I saw The Maze Runner movie before I read the book & totally loved it. I was coming from having already seen The Hunger Games (I was unimpressed but I read the book series anyway since it was becoming so popular & liked it well enough) & Divergent (the movie was so terrible I didn't bother reading the series) and I was... basically prepared for really bogged-down slow-paced universe-exposition scenes as well as lengthy, rather boring, special fx scope-shot extravaganzas. 

I tend to think all adaptations fall victim to these two things really easily (with the understandable goals of 1) making sure those who haven't read the books still understand what's going on, and 2) capturing & doing justice to the visual imagery in the books)...

At any rate, the director of Maze Runner, in an MTV interview, talked about why certain things in the book were excised & he kept coming back to: will it keep a thrilling pace? will it be visually *exciting*?

For me, someone who hadn't read the books, I was basically on the edge of my seat the whole time throughout the film. The pacing was perfect for me. *Also* - Wes Ball wasn't going for ""visually *stunning*"" - he was going for ""visually *exciting*."" He wanted to keep people immersed & intense about what was going to happen next plotwise (which he succeeded in doing for me) versus showcasing his visual effects team's prowess with unnecessarily long & languishing shots of the Maze.

I also think Maze Runner was such a great film adaptation because, unlike other YA dystopia stories, the way the universe works is actually just as confusing to the main characters (in the beginning) as it is to the audience. TMR didn't require the film adaptation to be slow as hell in the beginning to explain the ""way things are"" before launching into the plot (like The Hunger Games and Divergent) because, in the Maze Runner, figuring out ""the way things are"" *is* a huge part of the actual plot: almost each and every development is another ""clue"" to figuring out what exactly is going on in this fictional universe. So... that was really cool to watch (and read). :)",stophauntingme,2015-04-12T20:25:54Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,2

immelo_1,immelo,"> the Hunger Games sometimes fails at this, the Maze Runner, Divergent and so on. Interestingly enough, the titles that I just mentioned are mostly young adult novels and apparently, dystopian stories are common in YA books.

The reason these fail is because their authors also seem to have failed at understanding the original history and purpose of dystopian fiction. If you look at the origins of dystopian fiction, it's original purpose was literally to serve as a social critique and especially as a critique of real world social oppression and authoritarianism. In The Time Machine, Wells' focus is on class warfare and oppression of the working class. In The Iron Heel, which was perhaps the first modern dystopian novel, the focus was on a capitalist oligarchy that again brutally oppressed the working class. Even in 1909, Jack London's work continues to contain relevant references to electoral control by the capitalist class, the use of warfare to spread nationalist rhetoric and distract the working class, etc.

Whether it's The Time Machine, The Iron Heel, The Trial, Nineteen Eighty-Four, It Can't Happen Here, A Handmaid's Tale, Parable of the Sower and so on and so forth, these novels are drawing on real world oppression and social issues to form the basic premise and driving force of the novel. With books like Maze Runner of Hunger Games, very little of the content is actually rooted in real world social oppression. Honestly, I had a lot of fun reading Maze Runner as an adult, it was an entertaining series for the most part. But as dystopian or apocalyptic fiction, it was not believable because it was not rooted in real world oppression nor real world issues. Even when it came to back to the ""climate catastrophe"" aspect and the reasons behind government actions, it was incredibly outlandish and made little sense. So that's quite possibly what you're picking up on...the contrast between genuine dystopian fiction that stays true to the original purpose of the genre vs the more recent trend (particularly geared towards teenagers) that is basically just telling the story of rebelling against a vaguely oppressive government that doesn't really act in the same way as real world systemic oppression.",D3athRider,2020-09-04T20:04:21Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
7wbs4w_1,7wbs4w,"I read Station Eleven and have it 4/5 even thought it was Definitely Not For Me. I liked how it took a different look at the aftermath of a plague and it was well written. But I didn’t like the constant flashbacks. 

I’m adding Emergencies Only to my TBR. You might want to check out War Hospital by Sheri Fink. 

I only read The Maze Runner and I didn’t really like it.   How is the prequel?",conservio,2018-02-10T17:55:05Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
7wbs4w_2,7wbs4w,"Thanks for the recommendation! I'll go pop it on hold now. Yeah if you weren't keen on the Maze Runner definitely don't try the fever cure, much of a muchness. I want to read more books about plagues from different perspectives, I really liked that about station eleven too. ",katandkuma,2018-02-11T01:52:15Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,2

89he1k_1,89he1k,"I read The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner and Divergent nearly back to back and all 3 basically were the same plot to me with just different reasoning. Hunger games had the characters pitted against each other for sport under the watchful eyes of the Capital, Maze Runner had the characters working towards the end under the watchful eyes of the W.I.C.K.E.D. , and Divergent had all the characters following mislead instructions for eradication of the divergents because of the erudite. 3 stories taking place essentially in a bubble that followed the main characters breaking out of said bubble to take on the bigger powers at work and although the reasoning and motivation was different they were essentially the same thing as far as I saw. It really felt like just a niche genre that I'd somehow found 3 separate stories about. ",Emerystones,2018-04-03T20:03:54Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
3tr1zp_1,3tr1zp,"I see what you did there - the uglies was *bad*.

Never Let Me Go is probably one of the most heart-rending books I've ever read. Definitely a slow burner, but absolutely astounding. I just lay in a slump the entire day after I finished that novel. I just couldn't get over it.

And, well, as of writing this I'm 24. I know - *John Green is for teen girls! 13 Reasons why? You girl!*

The truth is I've never liked that gender discrimination in books. Books aren't like films and aimed at either gender or another (or they shouldn't be). Secondly, YA books are usually easy to read, which make them great come-downs after something of the heady classics, or sweeping high fantasies. Not only that but a lot of them are fantastic books, that touch on subjects I find very interesting and that are important to me. I might not be a teenager, but I like imagining I am. And then there are books like The Maze Runner and Holes, which tap into my boyhood excitement of guns and big tanks and exciting and shiny things. And I won't lie, I might be a semi-adult, but I still really like those things.",AJakeR,2015-11-22T00:23:03Z,2,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
3tr1zp_2,3tr1zp,"The Hunger Games left a bitter fucking taste of my mouth. Like shit - rolled in more shit - and then cooked in an oven made of shit. Ok, I really hated The Hunger Games.

But I couldn't ignore The Uglies. The premise sounded really interesting, and so many people were saying good things. But I never went in with the intention of reading more than the first one. A lot of these books have an initial idea that they run with, (The Hunger Games themselves, or The Maze in The Maze Runner) but after the idea gets spread too thin, and the next few books weaken out. Combine this with my distaste for The Hunger Games - and how similar the two were - my belief that the main character was only a girl to feed off the Katniss Everdeen cake of success, and I wasn't interested in reading beyond that initial concept. And though the idea was good, and parts of that book were OK, the execution was mostly lacking.

Ok, I suppose that's unfair. I didn't go into the book so cynically - I just wanted to find out what it was all about, explore that interesting sounding premise, and see if it was worth the hype. If it was really good I would have read the rest, but the book was meh. ",AJakeR,2015-11-22T00:29:03Z,0,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,2

lef49_1,lef49,"My daughter says the Maze Runner trilogy was better than Hunger Games, but I haven't read it. I thought Hunger Games was a great book by itself; the trilogy altogether was not as good as the first book.

Haven't heard of Chaos Walking, but looks like my daughter will have a new series to start. Thanks :)",,2011-10-17T00:00:05Z,1,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
lef49_2,lef49,You should read them yourself too.  The Hunger Games is a good action filled book.  I felt 2 was too like 1 and 3 was OK.  But worth reading.  Nice easy reads.  But Chaos Walking are excellent well thought out novels.  Each has it's own character and each novel brings something new to the trilogy.  I'll be checking out the Maze Runner Trilogy myself.

p4z1e7_1,p4z1e7,"There are also ones that came before, like King's The Long Walk. Have a look into that. It's an amazing book. There all different though in there own way, I know The Maze Runner is always regarded as similar to The Hunger Games, but they are both very different. One is in a post-apocalyptic landscape, and the other is in a dystopia. But, there are loads of similar books.",RoadToFreedom-90,2021-09-04T04:10:46Z,3,COMMENT,Action,The Maze Runner,1
