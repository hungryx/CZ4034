12lyat4_1,12lyat4,"New Orleans local here.

While the internet and TV have made a lot of us lose the stereotypical accents and whatnot, the vernacular in this book was spot on for the time. The description of the city and life in it was dead on for the time and is still fairly accurate in the modern day.

There is also a statue of Ignatius J Reilly on Canal St (the main boulevard in downtown NOLA) in front of one of the hotels.

We love us some John Kennedy Tool, at least posthumously. It's sad that he did not live to hold his Pulitzer Prize. A Confederacy of Dunces did not do well while he was alive, and its failure, along with a string of others, led him to take his own life at 31 years old in 1969. He was not awarded the Pulizter until 1981.",,2023-04-14T22:01:41Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Confed of Dunces,1

I'm fully aware that the characters are irredeemable because they're *written* to be irredeemable.  And that the situations in the book are cringeworthy because they're *written* to be cringeworthy, and that the plot is painful to read because it's *written* to be painful to read.  
  
The problem is that O'Toole succeeded in writing a book with characters that are so irredeemable, situations so cringeworthy, and plot so painful that I simply can't read the book.  

It's as if a sculptor took a block of marble and carved it into an enormous fecal bolus so incredibly lifelike that it was like a giant took a dump right there on the floor of the MoMA.  
  
I could understand that the artist *intended* for his work to be revolting, but I would not have any desire to view it, and if I had done so after repeated and persistent urging from friends and fellow sculpture enthusiasts, I would regret it immediately.

1jzu3k_3,1jzu3k,"Shit, I wish I had an answer to this question because I've wondered the same thing myself. It's pretty much my favorite novel, and on one hand one of the reasons it is so special to me is that as far as I know it IS one of a kind, nothing I've read has ever come close. And books I have read that are touted as being like it in the pretentious superlative blurbs on the back are NEVER anything like it, in my experience (reviewers/other authors do the same thing regarding The Catcher in the Rye). In my opinion people don't really know what they're talking about when they try to compare other books to it... The closest I find are books that aren't at all like ACOD itself overall, but include a character that is vaguely similar to Ignatius, but not quite. Though maybe this is what you're looking for.

Anyway, on the other hand I do find it really frustrating, the fact that there aren't other novels legitimately similar enough to satisfy me, because I would like to read things that make me think of A Confederacy of Dunces, even if they are obvious imitators. 

I'm anticipating that Don Quixote will be the most mentioned book in this thread. I tried to slog through it once basically for this reason, but didn't get too far. I'm curious to see what else gets mentioned though.",withnailplus1,2013-08-09T01:07:07Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Confed of Dunces,3

g5tkde_1,g5tkde,"Interestingly, the author -John Kennedy Toole-Would never see the success of his book.
He committed suicide (1969) shortly after writing the manuscript. His mother found the copy in his home and tried to get it published multiple times, with no success. She finally convinced author/professor Walker Percy to read the manuscript.
These were his words in the Forward :

“ ...the lady was persistent, and it somehow came to pass that she stood in my office handing me the hefty manuscript. There was no getting out of it; only one hope remained—that I could read a few pages and that they would be bad enough for me, in good conscience, to read no farther. Usually I can do just that. Indeed the first paragraph often suffices. My only fear was that this one might not be bad enough, or might be just good enough, so that I would have to keep reading. In this case I read on. And on. First with the sinking feeling that it was not bad enough to quit, then with a prickle of interest, then a growing excitement, and finally an incredulity: surely it was not possible that it was so good.”

That it is relatable to this era we currently find ourselves in is amazing.

I both agree and disagree with this. It seems like guys like Ignatius are a dime a dozen nowadays, especially in certain convoluted right wing circles on the internet. I also see a lot of borderline autistic qualities in his character. If A Confederacy of Dunces had been written nowadays it would've been seen as a deeply tragic and disturbing work.

5yd6jo_1,5yd6jo,"Let's see, it's a tough question. I'm finishing the LOTR trilogy by Tolkien and those are definitely up there, Fahrenheit 451 by Bradbury, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. Definitely a lot of other works that I can consider in this list so this isn't in any particular order. ",eccentricrealist,2017-03-09T07:07:55Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Confed of Dunces,1
5yd6jo_2,5yd6jo,"Its a good list, and while there are some I couldn't really finish on that list(LOTR, Frodo's parts were not my cup of tea...) it is a very good list. I haven't heard much about A Confederacy of Dunces!",2OP4me,2017-03-09T07:17:15Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Confed of Dunces,2
