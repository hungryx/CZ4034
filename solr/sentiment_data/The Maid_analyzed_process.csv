vhv53r_1,vhv53r,"I searched “the maid” in this sub after seeing the Goodreads post precisely so I could read a post like this. Yes to all the above. It was genuinely so cringe to read, and the “twist” was no only slapped together, but genuinely the most YAWWWN “who cares?” moment",imminentsnark,2022-06-22T03:44:02Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,1
vhv53r_2,vhv53r,"I've long since stopped trusting Goodreads. 1-5 star based reviews are pretty much useless since everyone uses a different metric for it. 2.5 stars is 'okay but not great', while another's is 'dogshit doorstopper'.

That said, The Maid sucked. I couldn't stand the protagonist.",kiss-shot,2022-06-22T09:38:01Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,2
vhv53r_3,vhv53r,"Your thorough and thoughtful review persuaded me to skip this book.

I love Goodreads (esp. the community--not so much the glitchy website). Whenever a book is recommended by a friend, relative, or Youtuber, I often find myself on the book's Goodreads page (especially now that my overwhelmingly long reading list is approaching 800 books.) That said, take Goodreads lists with a massive ~~grain~~ block of salt. Sorry to _Twilight_ fans on here, but that series blatantly and undeservedly appears in the top 5 YA, top 5 fantasy, top 5 everything--even the Best Books Ever list alongside great works of literature. If you want to get a better sense of the book's authentic rating, scan (but don't closely read lest you risk a spoiler) the top five or ten comments which are usually written by seasoned Goodreads reviewers. (In the case of _The Maid_ see Goodreads user Elle's review, among others.)",RADdit2020,2022-06-22T12:48:19Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,3

I had read that the author has worked as an editor for the company who published The Maid, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was nepotism or some other connection that really helped this book’s marketing.",roses_and_daisies,2022-06-22T14:47:18Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,8
vhv53r_9,vhv53r,"I have spent some time this year reading books lauded for their literary merit and learned that does not guarantee being entertained.

People just like different things and it's perfectly alright to not like something others like. Even when the others are literary critics.

That said, I really like The Maid and what OP feels about it does not match my experiences. OP seems to feel like the book insults their relative and I do not think that is the only interpretation of the book and its characters.",dbratell,2022-06-22T14:57:32Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,9

vhv53r_11,vhv53r,"Any place you look for recommendations is gonna be trash if you don't take the userbase and what it is into account.  Goodreads is fine if you look at it knowing it's very big and appeases to the main main stream just because it's the most accessible website for that kind of thing, you can say what you think about the maid in particular but it ranks high exactly because it a very accessible book that is an easy topic of conversation, so it's gonna do well on goodreads.

vhv53r_13,vhv53r,"This is a murder mystery, that's the whole premise of the film, and it's based on three suppositions any of which are ridiculous:

>!That the whole murder was based on a basic accident caused by the maid/nurse!<

>!That the murder victim then decided to collude in his own death because he wanted to help his maid!<

>!However, the twist was that the absolutely random accident derailed a real murder plot that was supposed to occur in the same manner of the accident!<

Again, see Sleuth, Deathtrap and The Last of Sheila by comparison. Each one is a tightly plotted murder engine that, once started, can't stop until a thrilling climax. Unlike the ramshackle, coincidence-strewn, plot contrivance-littered 'Knives Out'.",Vy892,2022-06-22T14:38:07Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,13

1854pga_2,1854pga,"That's an accurate depiction of The Maid but I still read it and liked it ok but I felt dirty afterwards. I'm a housekeeper though so I felt I needed to support more maid fiction since maids/housekeepers are the second least developed characters in fiction after prostitutes.

I lasted about 8 pages into a Song of Fire and Ice like 8 years ago before deciding it was completely not for me, and I actually have read exactly zero pages of fantasy since then, not counting a f-ton of RPGs.

Turns out, I like fantasy in games and science fiction in books.",,2023-11-27T17:00:20Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,2

1854pga_6,1854pga,I finished the Maid but the ending was super disappointing. I think the book was hampered by its first person narration. The reader doesn’t even see the denouement.,Striking_Sky6900,2023-11-27T15:52:47Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,6
1854pga_7,1854pga,"Actually, same book, but quicker DNF for me. Opened The Maid at my local library and didn't get past the second page because the writing style is sooooo unpleasant to me. I acknowledge that this is subjective, but to me, it just seemed the author was trying to use every ""pretty"" turn of phrase there ever was, all at once. Just blithely lining up the clichés - going nowhere. :(",janicetrumbull,2023-11-27T20:30:33Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,7
1854pga_8,1854pga,"Chapter one. On a manga series no less, so it's probably 20 pages. Hated the MC so much for being such a typical loser for the genre that I knew the chances of a redeeming quality were very little. I'd also already read a series with some similar aspects which I enjoyed so if I wanted I could just reread that.

I don't mind complete loser MCs if I can believe or relate to them but this guy did not seem to be like that.

Never read The Maid but by your description I'd also nope really fast. There are so many good murder mysteries out there that there's no point reading one you dislike.",AzoreanEve,2023-11-27T16:44:09Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,8
1854pga_9,1854pga,"Is it bad that I liked The Maid?

Personally, I'd say that the main character (Molly) was almost the exact opposite of the manic pixie girl.  She was a moderately autistic (presumably) woman who appreciated structure, organization, consistency, habit, repetition, and tradition, and was very reluctant to do anything novel or unusual.  Which gave an interesting perspective to all the curious happenings around her.",cox_ph,2023-11-27T17:52:09Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,9
1854pga_10,1854pga,"I just finished it. It's SO fucking bad. It's an absolutely _okay_ book, but the last approximately 25% of the read takes it from like a 6/10, to a 1/10. I'm not sure I've ever read a book with a worse ending than The Maid. 

>!The fact that they have this stupid tea party to mastermind a plot to prove Molly's innocence, and hide the details from the reader leads you to believe it's going to be something more clever than them telling some dude to go into a room, and then tell the police to go to the room too... Like... that's it... that's the plan... And it works... Also the transformation of the dishwasher into this simpy loser who loves wiping shoes is so fucking force fed... !<

I just hated _everything_  in the last several chapters. I can't believe that book is so lauded on things like GoodReads. It's a complete piece of shit. You just got me all worked up thinking about it again.",ArryPotta,2023-11-27T20:30:31Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,10

otl2to_1,otl2to,"This was something I came across the first time I read the book, and it makes perfect sense when you re-read it with that mindset that the whole thing is being expertly manipulated by the maid. But I feel this somehow gives a little too much credit to Nelly as some sort of mad genius who has merely to pull the strings and have her puppets move as she wills.

I am of the opinion that instead, it’s more likely to assume that Nelly is merely an unreliable narrator. Other than the very short interactions of Lockwood with Heathcliff in the beginning and near the end of the novel, the entire novel is either told straight from Nelly’s mouth, or is a retelling of what Lockwood heard from Nelly herself. But this is all still told from Nelly’s perspective ultimately, since Lockwood has no ulterior motive to color the events he heard from Nelly, and indeed, seems more than willing to believe everything Nelly says without question. This is despite things clearly being shown in Nelly’s own words that she may not be as trusting as she may appear to the reader who focuses on Heathcliff’s alleged villainy, despite the fact that he doesn’t appear anywhere near as demonic in his interactions with Lockwood than what we hear from Nelly. We know Nelly dislikes Heathcliff, so it is not unreasonable to assume she would paint him to be in a darker light than what he actually may have been. The only other objective evidence we see are the letters Nelly produces and shows Lockwood, but could there also have been other letters Nelly didn’t show Lockwood that would have painted a slightly different picture? No one can really say, but it goes to show that your opinion of someone can be seriously skewed if you only hear one side of the story, as Lockwood did from Nelly.",Tooko1005,2021-07-29T00:36:17Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,The Maid,1
