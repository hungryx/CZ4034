8ms5gw_2,8ms5gw,My favorites are the Wee Free Men books. It’s one of the only times I’ve ever preferred the audiobooks to reading it myself!,GreenhelmOfMeduseld,2018-05-28T23:53:34Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,2
8ms5gw_3,8ms5gw,"Hmm, good question.  Have they seen a lot of fantasy, like LotR?  Are they aware of, say, Death being represented by a tall, *really thin* guy with a scythe?  And would they be amazed to find out that Death has a big white horse... called Binky?  If so, The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic are cool, though the entire series gets much better as it goes along.

My best guess is, yes.  You didn't say what gender your kids were, but it might not matter.  Tiffany Aching - the first one, The Wee Free Men, has the heroine at 9 but way smart beyond her years, who has to go into Fairyland to rescue her brother.  If they can understand Scottish accents (has to do with the titular characters) maybe that'd be good.  

Other than that, Mort.  Also, try not to get the abridged ones, they're good, but you need the full thing.",throway_nonjw,2018-05-29T14:55:42Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,3
67k4ss_1,67k4ss,"It depends on how conservative you're talking about, and what their views on the supernatural are.  The Wee Free Men has magic, the supernatural, and fairies, which doesn't sit well, with some of the more ""religious"" folk.",anteus2,2017-04-25T23:53:05Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,1
xrhxl0_1,xrhxl0,"> They have a whole vocabulary of nonsense words such as ""crivens,"" an all-purpose curse that I'm going to start using daily, and their typical approach to any problem is to rush in and start kicking it. They rule. 

All of the wee free men ""nonsense words"" are just Scottish terms lol

xrhxl0_4,xrhxl0,"These were my first Discworld books. I don't think I fully comprehended the satire at the time, but the stories were very genuine and enjoyable. (And I'm not ashamed to admit that a young me grew a little crush on Tiffany.) The Wee Free Men were just awesome and hilarious; these books I think are the foundation of my sense of humor and I really need to reread them. And also the rest of Discworld.",SobiTheRobot,2022-09-30T02:13:12Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,4

xrhxl0_8,xrhxl0,"* I'm glad to see that you've already noted the unisex value of these books - that's what I was mainly going to comment on. One of the many, many great things about Pratchett is that he doesn't write boys and girls, he just writes ~~humans~~ people. His characters are sometimes *treated* differently depending on their gender, but their personalities are unique and not dependent on their gender, which is part of what makes such a seemingly silly world feel so heartbreakingly real. I grew up as a boy reading Tiffany Aching, and she remains an inspiration in my everyday life to this day.

&#x200B;

* A few lessons I learned from Tiffany: You don't need to have responsibility thrust upon you. You can choose to be the kind of person who takes care of things when they have the opportunity. Success requires work as well as vision. Even selfishness can be harnessed to the benefit of others. Everyone will at some point be forced to deal with the unavoidable. These are very complex lessons, but with the help of these books I was lucky enough to be taught them at a young age, before that kind of thing starting seeming intimidating.

&#x200B;

* I'm also in love with so many of the quotes from these books (Discworld in general, but especially Tiffany Aching). The one that's etched most strongly into my mind from The Wee Free Men is “It doesn't stop being magic just because you know how it works.”

&#x200B;

* I also had no idea that 'Crivens' were an actual Scots word! You learn as long as you live!",Animal_Flossing,2022-09-30T13:03:48Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,8
xrhxl0_9,xrhxl0,"I didn't read those when I was a kid, for the simple reason that I was 40 when *The Wee Free Men* was published.  Doesn't matter.  Old guys can read them, too.  Wintersmith is one of my top 10 Discworld books.  Tiffany really comes into her own in that one.",Wadsworth_McStumpy,2022-09-30T13:08:08Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,9
xrhxl0_10,xrhxl0,"I did.  🙁 I bought the first e-book for my cousin’s daughter and put it on my used e-reader, but I guess she’d read the Little Princess and liked that (no clue if she’d ever read the Wee Free Men . . .  Probably not).",Mammoth_Move3575,2022-09-30T07:26:18Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,10
xrhxl0_11,xrhxl0,"The Wee Free Men are the greatest characters I’ve read in a book in a long time. I’ve adopted “Ack, Crivens!” As my go to when frustrated. Soooo funny",flannelheart,2022-09-30T16:55:16Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,11
xrhxl0_12,xrhxl0,"The Discworld itself is necessary reading imo. An amazing world with wonderful characters and brilliantly funny. You can find something for everyone amongst the 40 something books in the series. The writing is just so stellar and Pratchett can turn on a dime from hilarious comedy to moving drama.It saddens me no end that Pratchett is gone and I don't have any more books to look forward to. But I take solace in reading all the wonderful books he's left behind.

u/LazarusRises If you like the Nac-mac-feegle, check out 'The Bromeliad trilogy'. It's an earlier work from Pratchett, but its very much a sister book to *the Wee Free Men*.",shadow_jc,2022-10-01T00:44:17Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,12
xrhxl0_13,xrhxl0,"Agreed. I avoided this part of the series for quite some time due to the YA category, but The Wee Free Men was the only thing available in Libby one day and I immediately fell in love.",Cook_n_shit,2022-09-29T22:47:19Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,13
xrhxl0_14,xrhxl0,"Yeah this distinction was a decision by Pterry, who occasionally liked to dip into other target demographics when their owners weren't looking.

It's not like Discworld had any trouble with mainstream popularity by that point. The Wee Free Men came out in 2003, when Discworld was already an institution. 

Terry Pratchett was literally the number one best selling author in the UK in the 90s and very early 2000s (he got overtaken by JK Rowling somewhere in the middle of the Harry Potter series).",Splash_Attack,2022-09-30T07:06:51Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,14
680cb2_1,680cb2,"I have read this series. You are going to love the rest of the series if you liked ""The Wee Free Men"".",prowolfpc,2017-04-28T02:27:57Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,1
680cb2_2,680cb2,Discworld is a series but one where several main character groups/sub series that are loosely connected. Most are connected in some fashion. Small Gods which is also one of the best ones is probably the least connected and even that has a few connections. The wee free men is a bit different since the Tiffany Aching subseries is aimed for a somewhat younger audience then most books.,jyper,2017-04-28T04:36:24Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,2
680cb2_3,680cb2,"The Discworld books are great, you're in for a treat.  To be honest, there are clunkers here and there, but they just got better and better.  The Tiffany Aching series (of which The Wee Free Men are the first installment) is the last of the series (maybe Steam was?).  The Discworld books don't have to be read in order, but some go together well (the Aching books, the Nightwatch [my fave!], the Witches, The Lipwig books) look up a reading guide, there are several online.  If I had to pick one book from the lot that's my fave, it'd have to be Hogfather.
Enjoy!",XrayAgent,2017-04-28T14:48:04Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,Wee Free Men,3
680cb2_4,680cb2,">And I think the whole of Discworld isn't actually a series but they all happen in the same universe. Some are connected, others are stand-alones.

Yep, all the books work just fine on their own, but some chronologically follow the same protagonist (or group), so with the Wee Free Men you have begun the Tiffany Aching stories... however if you jump to any other book you won't really be missing out on anything because they're pretty much self contained, and you can come back at any point. 

I think I've read 13 unique books at this point, my favorite varies depending on how I feel but in general the ones that are more standalone actually tend to be favorites of mine - Small Gods is usually at the top, Monstrous Regiment, Hogfather.

60l9cg_1,60l9cg,"The City Watch series is my absolute favorite, but you should still work in some of the other stuff as well. If you binge on one, you might feel depressed that you can't go back to it for the first time again ^1

I would recommend the Wee Free Men series, and the Death series. But really all of them are great.

60l9cg_3,60l9cg,"I agree with you completely. Sir Terry created such a rich and wonderful world in Discworld. Then he filled them with fantastic characters. Anytime I randomly pick one up to read, it almost always leads to me reading at least the rest of that segment (be it witches, Vimes, Rincewind, Moist, or the wee free men).

1mpbig_1,1mpbig,"Honestly, they're all excellent, read them in the order they were written.

you'll find that you'll get introduced to some of the main recurring characters and as you progress through the books the series will come back to those characters and progress their individual stories as it goes along.
