x93co5_2,x93co5,"I loved it. Read it as a teen almost simultaneously with Stephen King’s The Stand. Swan Song is a much more visceral experience. Wolves chasing Sister down I-80. Strait jacket game. The magic is no more slap dash than The Stand. The two are worthy of comparison, I don t think one novel vastly out performs the other. It’s hard to write a 900 page American dystopian novel when some guy already did one with a different doomsday a few years before you could. But that’s life.",Oblique_Strategy,2022-09-08T16:02:55Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,2
x93co5_3,x93co5,I read swan song many years ago and it really was one of my favorite books. I used to devour books and that one made one of the biggest impressions on me. It's probably been 25 years since I read it. I used to think about it all the time but as a busy mom I think of it less now. I never knew anyone who read it and I rarely hear it mentioned so I just want to say thanks for mentioning it pal!,cokakatta,2022-09-08T18:51:42Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,3
x93co5_4,x93co5,"I'm a hard-core Stephen King fan, and *Swan Song* is one of my favorite books. I'm even part of a King-themed horror-group, and they all love it too. It's considered by many the only book of its kind that can stand up to *The Stand*, and has a better ending to boot (30 years after first reading it, I still remember the code to the briefcase).

I had even missed that Mccammon started writing again after a long hiatus, and this summer I finished all the books (so far) of the Matthew Corbett-series.",Keffpie,2022-09-08T17:09:19Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,4

x93co5_9,x93co5,"I really think they're both excellent and very fun books. I wouldn't say that any one work deserves a heap of praise over the others.  Spoilers below.


Swan Song is essentially a blockbuster look at cold war tensions. The highs are high, the pacing is upbeat, and the story beats come right in time, right as you think they would/should. 


It's predictable because it's not there to challenge the reader, it's there to entertain and engulf the reader in a world of desolation shining with hope. 


The Stand was written by King a near decade before he recovers from his alcoholism and addictions. It feels less like a feel good blockbuster and more like in looking at a hermits diorama of the apocalypse. These animatronic characters wound up and let loose to wander the hell inside his drug-addled mind. 


Swan Song is a salve for the cold war fears that gripped every American's heart. It's a triumphant adventure filled with American hero's and uniquely American villains and victims. Our heros emerge literally beautiful and the world in blossom. 


I understand why people are so quick to compare. They both even feature the evil of actions, a human villian who's objectives and motivations are understandable and abstract the forces of evil. 


But King has no hope. Features American people.  Dumb, and awkward. Stoic, sensitive. Courageous and kind. The good guys die more than you'd think, almost as often as the bad guys. And sometimes the bad guys don't get their just deserts. The good are traumatized by their efforts, sometimes there is no victory. 


Swan song ends in peace and love. It ends full of brightness, a bounty signifying their triumph.



In the Stand, Evil takes the day, as the last bit of the book simply has Prime Evil survive the un-surviveable and walk off into the sunset. 


They were both right, of course. Does evil prevail? Does hope? It depends on what you pick up, what you like. It depends on the story you keep in your heart, when you close the final page. 


For me, they're different stories, told at different times for different reasons. 



Which ones better? 

On my good days, Swan Song is better. You can still have merit without being gritty. You can leave behind the doom and gloom of our world, and exchange it for a world with hope. Optimism is my shield against a rapidly dimming world. 


On my bad days, The Stand is better. If evil were a lesser breed than justice, after all these years the righteous would have freed the world of sin. The house wins. Stoicism is my camouflage in an unreliable world.",Because_Chinaa,2022-09-08T18:55:10Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,9

I didn't know about the comparisons with Stephen King but I really liked it more than anything I've read by him. Mostly bc when a female character is sexualized it's bc another character is doing it, not the omniscient narrator going on and on about preteen girls' nipples.

I totally agree with what you say- I didn't even like Swan Song THAT much but it's really stayed with me since finishing it. I was always devastated when a character died or parted ways.

x93co5_16,x93co5,"SPOILER ALERT

Swan Song may be inspired by The Stand, but it is far superior.  The Stand starts out well enough with the Captain Trips plague but after the survivors get to Boulder, everything falls flat and the story becomes a relatively dull cold war between two small towns.  The ending is also very disappointing with the literal Deus Ex Machina  solving everything and the looonnnnnggg journey back to Boulder and the epilogue.

Swan Song, on the other hand, is a truly epic treatment of a similar story.  Everything about it is better and more spectacular and involving.  Mccammon saw what was wrong with The Stand and did it right.",PacoElFlaco,2022-09-08T20:55:14Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,16

x93co5_23,x93co5,"Hardcore King Fan here. Personally I liked this more than The Stand. The Stand is all build and it really doesn't deliver ultimately. 

It is a shame to hear he stopped writing even briefly. This is a great book. Beyond ""the world ended"" prologues they have little in common. The Stand is better written but the story gets somewhat offtrack; Swan Song may be less overt in style but it's sotry and characters click a lot more. 

The most interesting part of the Stand is the plague. Honestly everything after that is kind of middling, IMO. And I say this as a guy who had that presented as the quintessential King book, by my best friend who is no longer with us. The book is very special to me but I'd be a liar if I didn't say I enjoyed Swan Song more at the time.",Resolute002,2022-09-08T21:20:57Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,23

Although the beginning with the antagonist just laughing watching *Faces of Death* thinking about how he helped a little but mainly mankind that brought itself to destruction was cool. As was “I’ve always walked alone” or the last thing he said to Roland.

x93co5_37,x93co5,"I’ll try the best I can. Swan Song explores the nature of good and evil through the environment of an post apocalyptic nuclear world with evil itself roaming the wastes in celebrating with the accomplishment of destroying the world. 

However humanity still thrives and evil is thus threatened. You start in a barren and totally destroyed Manhattan setting, with a homeless woman named Sister who drives herself forward with a benevolent lost object. You’re also trapped in a underground bunker, with a military veteran and boy who is keen on surviving together by any means necessary. Finally you’ll be following a former pro wrestler who has found that he has been tasked with protecting a child (who has her own attributes that aren’t of this world) in a now unpredictable world full of the same dangers that they all must endure and face at one point or another. 

If you love dystopian novels. This and the stand by Stephen king will shoved in your face. I personally love characters and the question of morality. Does good or bad matter when it’s already the end of the world? What is there to even live for and why would you? What propels anyone to just take another step? I loved this book and am jealous you’ve never read it lol

Like I said you may not love like it, like I did. But it’s still a worthy ride and very enjoyable house.",yoyo01323,2022-09-08T18:58:50Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,37

x93co5_40,x93co5,"Swan Song is the better book because McCammon can write an ending unlike King, and I’m saying that as somebody who quite enjoys King. The best part of The Stand, in my opinion, is the societal collapse section. That’s one chapter that is like 80-100 pages and is basically a companion novella sandwiched into the end of the first section. It’s horrifyingly visceral and some of the best writing of King’s career. Everything after that is much weaker, even if King’s characters keep you engaged and reading through to the end. It is blatantly obvious after a first read that once the group reaches Boulder, King had no clue what to do with the story, so he wings it for 300 pages until he pulls out a literal deus ex machina to wrap things up. Swan Song, comparatively, feels like a cohesive narrative from beginning to end.",NeoNoireWerewolf,2022-09-08T23:22:59Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,40

Both are great at the set up the suspense, the man how will they get out of this mess, only for them not to know either. And just sweep it under the rug, or Peter out, or just pull something ridiculous out of the air and complete inconsistent with the reality set up so far.

16xdv5c_1,16xdv5c,"McCammon was poised for what I think could have been a massive breakthrough in the early 90s, having just released some of his best works, but abruptly retired in 1993 due to a number of reasons: depression, fights with his publishers, exhaustion from overwork and wanting to spend more time with his family. When he did finally return to writing in 2002 it was with small press publishers and with vastly different work (Gothic historical fiction with horror overtones). Since then he has worked at his own pace, writing what he wants to write and not what publishers think he should be writing.

I wish he had more exposure and popularity, but truthfully he seems much happier being out of the limelight.

Hunter Goatley's Robert McCammon site (at https://www.robertmccammon.com/) has a ton of history, interviews and biographical info that helps make a lot of this a lot clearer.

My personal favorites of his are Boy's Life, The Wolf's Hour and its follow-up The Hunter in the Woods, Swan Song, and the Matthew Corbett books starting with ""Speaks the Nightbird"".",dslartoo,2023-10-02T00:52:37Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1

16xdv5c_16,16xdv5c,"I first discovered McCammon in the late 90's when I found an absolutely beat up copy of *Stinger* at a yard sale for a whopping $0.25. I enjoyed it for what it was and went looking for more. That led me to *Swan Song* and *A Boy's Life*, which are both utterly fantastic novels. 

Also, if you have never seen it, The Twilight Zone reboot from the 1980's adapted his short story ""Nightcrawlers"" into an episode, and it is arguably the best episode of that series. It was on YouTube last time I checked. 

I admire how he essentially didn't want to be pigeonholed by publishers, so he said screw it and focused on raising his family. His new books on return are historical/gothic pieces and just as good, but not mainstream King/Koontz style horror.",,2023-10-02T16:42:54Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,16

The supernatural component seems to come out of nowhere and yet is totally accepted by the characters. The whole thing is completely unbelievable. Not to mention derivative of The Stand.

That’s my opinion. I’m glad you enjoyed the book - I don’t purport to be the expert on what people should and shouldn’t enjoy. But he’s not some kind of genius written whose appeal would be universal if more people knew about him. 

Stephen King, on the other hand - since you mentioned him - spends chapters and chapters on character development, backstory, internal life, and more. All that while continuing through develop the plot to keep the reader turning pages. His stories have not only a who and a what but a why and a how. I see McCammon attempting that (for example, in his explanations of how the world got to the point of nuclear apocalypse) but not mastering it.",space-cyborg,2023-10-02T00:24:20Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,20

It is hard a bit hard for me to understand calling Swan Song vastly inferior, though. I would like to understand your take better, it's so distant from mine that it's fascinating haha.

I think Swan Song had a much more satisfying conclusion (King's penchant for weak endings was a running gag in one his own movie adaptions). I think Swan Song is grittier and more visceral, with stronger characters, too. That said, The Stand is a culturally monolithic work that exists well beyond the sum of it's parts.

If I was forced in a corner to really explain my core take though, I think it would be best boiled down as,  ""they are both once-in-a-lifetime authors, and they both would have made an absolute mess of attempting to write each other's novels.""",UnpluggedUnfettered,2023-10-02T13:18:01Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,49

Based on your post, I may give Swan Song another read. However, I quite strongly believe that anyone who uses The Stand as an example of King having weak endings is wrong and has likely misunderstood The Stand. 

Swan Song felt like a well executed supernatural thriller/horror but did not strike me as innovative in particular. The Stand struck me as very innovative in that it is effectively a Newer Testament to the power of God and, frankly, given the specific conceits of the novel, the ending is very much in keeping with the story.",partisanal_cheese,2023-10-02T17:01:46Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,54

p2sn74_4,p2sn74,"I just finished reading swan song about 2 months ago. I gave it a 4/5. While perhaps some of the characters were a little flat, and the bad guy was a little underwhelming, (plus I believe there was about 150-200 pages taken out of the story, perhaps from an editor’s suggestion to keep it under 1000 pages, around where the man with the Scarlett eye meets up with Macklin—which felt super rushed, and something that would’ve taken maybe 115 pages to get to, but this is just a guess on my part), I found the story rather enjoyable, and it was good enough for me to want to read the rest of McCammon’s stuff. It was my first book of his. His writing is incredibly detailed and rounded, but not in a clunky, overload sort of way—except for maybe a couple actions scenes. It pulls you in regardless. It really does the long form horror about as well as can be asked. 

I’d heard about it after seeing stuff about Stephen King’s The Stand. I’ve listened to most of that audiobook, and seen the 1994 TV series, and I found the beginning part of that story to be possibly the scariest thing that king has ever written, but the rest really fell flat for me, and lost me. Where as Swan Song kept me going all the way—even if it wasn’t as “scary” after the nuclear war—plus you get to see the president, which is damn cool, and is in one of the book’s best scenes IMO. My copy was 956 pages, and it does not feel like a 956 page book. It’s “all killer, no filler” as the kids would say. There’s always something interesting happening. Plus, I think people calling this a stand rip off are really doing this book a disservice. Its absolutely good enough to stand on its own, and the stories diverge rather quickly, and share far less in common than you would think. Unfortunately it’s been saddled with that albatross. If you’re reading this and have not read swan song, it is NOT a rip off of the stand. Don’t be afraid—youre going to enjoy it. Like I said earlier, this book was good enough to sell me on the rest of McCammon’s work.

8rwpxr_1,8rwpxr,"I've read them both multiple times, and love them both.

They're both fairly equal really. The stand has King's trademark weirdness of course, which is either a plus or a  minus depending on the opinion of his weirdness. But in the stand, I think it works pretty well for the story and feel. Like the fire bug running around chanting whatever phrase it is (bumpty bump or something like that, I can't recall offhand), or the m-o-o-n, that spells *insert whatever word that isn't moon here*.

But the underlying story with mother  Abigail and Flagg and the fight for humanity is pretty compelling and well paced.  It's one of those books that remains a good read despite it not really being able to fit the modern world at all. The fears and social unrest of the era it was written in don't resonate the same. But the classic idea of humanity being both good and evil rolled into one, and supernatural forces trying to exploit that is a powerful one.

Swan song though dives a bit more into the standard post-apocalyptic, war torn insanity. There's still the element of the supernatural, but it's almost an afterthought. The bag lady in particular shines through the messianic front that is Swan. To me, she's the real main character.

But job's mask is a very cool idea. The blend of the transformative, butterfly experience coupled with the new faces under the mask revealing the truth of the person just rocks. It keeps what would otherwise be just a post nuclear apocalypse story from being trite.

The differences between the two are more or less surface. The  deep story is the same really. The execution of that surface though, that's where the fun in. McCammon treats it more like a horror story, showing the darkness in humanity being overcome, but only barely. King turns it into a broader statement of how his universe works, and imo is the book that really defines his shared universe (despite it really being unified only in the dark tower series).

I can't say either is better than the other. It's two really skilled authors doing an epic story across the world.  I do like the *characters* in swan song better. They feel less like paper dolls that are dressed up and interchangeable. There's more depth to them. In the stand, every character feels less like a person and more like a role that needs to be filled.

I've read them back to back several times in an attempt to really pick apart both. And while each has flaws, they each have moments of genius. I can say that swan song stands out better by itself. You don't have to have read the rest of his stories and be a fan to appreciate it. The stand has King's trademark weirdness running through it, and if you aren't a fan of that, it could be hard to get through.",southsamurai,2018-06-18T04:43:17Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1

So far I like how McCammon has described the post-apocalyptic environment the characters are left with. I felt like King did not give enough description of what the world around the characters was like. That could possibly have something to do with a plague rather than a nuclear war.

I'd be surprised to hear someone think that Swan Song faltered at the end, when, IMO, it only gets stronger as it goes on, and a bow is put on nicely at the end. No supernatural elements get overused, no deus ex machina, just the willingness of the characters coupled with the life that got them there. The Stand has a few better developed characters, but the story of Swan Song is better.

Considering some of the parts with the bag lady, you could even say that no other form of world shaking event could have worked and resulted in the same story.

And with King, he made some use of infrastructure being intact, but not as much as he could have. I couldn't help but think that with abandoned military bases and such, either side could have had tanks and major weapons.

Swan Song is a much tighter book. McCammon is a great author often overshadowed by King. Boy’s Life is 4-stars, in my opinion, his best work. Compare it to, say, The Stand, though.

It was only through his wife Tabitha's constant encouragement, that he finally started seeking out publishers for what would be his first published novel. The rest is history. That could be YOUR history. If you don't have a Tabitha, encourage yourself, find enough confidence in yourself to do something with your novel, and put it out there in the world. You can never fail if you don't try, but you can never succeed either.",WordUnheard,2018-12-14T07:14:51Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,6
a6299f_7,a6299f,"I haven't. The only audible book I've ever listened to was The Mist, in 3-D sound. I have a short attention span, and I find it hard to listen to and follow a normal dialogue. I would be completely lost, listening to an audible. I wish I could.

I'm excited for you! One of the creepiest parts of the books takes place in a dark, desolate K-Mart. Keep that in mind, when you reach that part. I turned my niece on to McCammon's work. She now owns an autographed, first edition hardback of Swan Song, that her husband bought her for Christmas a few years ago. I envy her so much! It's in pristine condition, too. It's a very rare and expensive book to buy in hardback, and that's without the autograph. I can't imagine how much her husband paid for it.",WordUnheard,2018-12-14T08:40:10Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,7
1v809u_1,1v809u,"being a king fan first and foremost I read the stand first, loved it, read swan song years later, wasn't aware they were _that_ similar but loved it as well. so I say both at some point and start with the stand if you like king.",Dohi64,2014-01-14T21:44:15Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1
1v809u_2,1v809u,"Well I started reading the stand a couple of days ago, and I'm already half-way through (it's 1200 pages). I love the stand, it's an amazing read so far, and I've never read Stephen King before. I'll have to check the swan song out sometime...",Mafiosa-Minded,2014-01-14T22:41:35Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,2
1v809u_3,1v809u,"Adore The Stand and Swan Song has been purchased, downloaded, and waiting to be read on my Kindle for over a year.  Hearing so many comparisons as well as positive reviews, I think it might be time to read it.",bengraven,2014-01-14T22:53:22Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,3
1v809u_4,1v809u,"My circumstances are almost exactly the same as yours. Stephen King fan, loved The Stand. Read Swan Song years later and loved that too. Although I prefer The Stand. It is remarkable how similar the two books are. Coincidence or something more?",sagantyson,2014-01-14T21:48:34Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,4
2szzoy_1,2szzoy,"I am well known for overwhelming myself with books to read. I have The Stand and Swan Song next to each other on my book shelf because I need to read them both. I go through some weird phases and I recently exited a postapocolyptic one. Although I think it's gonna be hard to top those two classics there are still some other good ones. I would read the Strain but only the first one, The Passage was good as well. There is also a series that I honestly can't find where it starts or stops but the one I read was called Wool and it was a new twist on apocalypse that I greatly enjoyed. Hope you find some good reads.",littleowlwobble,2015-01-20T01:29:58Z,2,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1
2szzoy_2,2szzoy,"I read The Stand a couple times before I read Swan Song and I have to say I preferred Swan Song. There are so many memorable scenes and the writing was excellent. I loved how the book ends with the same sentence that begins the story.  Love the scenes in Dome Mountain and on the shores of the Great Salt Lake.  Like OP said, the books have LOTS of similarities and they're both excellent, but I have gone back to Swan Song more often than The Stand over the years.",Shaqfu89,2015-01-20T05:51:39Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,2
2szzoy_3,2szzoy,2 of my favorite books hard to say which it better.....Swan Song was alittle more coherent as a story but I remember charcters from the Stand more than those from Swan Song. Different ways of telling a similar parable.,,2015-01-23T21:52:12Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,3

140fza_2,140fza,"I'm reading this right now, actually. I've read *The Stand* a few times and there's just no escaping the similarities. I'd love to know if McCammon or King have ever publicly acknowledged or commented on this.

I like *Swan Song* enough so far. It is interesting and entertaining, but I have to say I very much prefer *The Stand*. *Swan Song* just seems to have much less depth. There are (so far anyway - 1/3 of the way through) far fewer characters and they are each less developed than King's. Perhaps I'm biased towards preferring King's writing style but McCammon's writing seems a bit obvious to me, like there isn't much flair. I'm struggling to articulate what I mean though, so I guess I have no room to talk.",repocode,2012-11-29T21:20:38Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,2
140fza_3,140fza,I hate to put the two against each other since I will side with the stand every time but I did enjoy swan song also,TY00702,2012-11-30T04:18:05Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,3
3j88px_1,3j88px,Swan Song is one of my favorites. A great example of a book you can escape in to.,chrisbrolumbus,2015-09-01T16:05:03Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1
2b58wq_1,2b58wq,"I actually read Swan Song when I was in 7th grade. It was the first full length novel that I decided to read for myself, and I have gone back to it many times since then. The journey of the characters is what truly drew me into the world that McCammon created, and why I still love it today.

if you haven't given it a chance do yourselves a favor and pick up a copy. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it is worth reading.",HenryJakubs,2014-07-19T18:14:25Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1
2b58wq_2,2b58wq,"Dude. Swan Song is literally my favorite book of all time. I even played the Japanese visual novel (which is more of a loose homage than an actual adaptation). 
And Sister is one of my favorite characters ever.
I loved The Stand as well, which was good in a different way.",HermanMachina,2014-07-19T21:27:00Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,2
1tvp94_1,1tvp94,Just finished rereading Dies the Fire and The Protectors War. Plan to work thought the whole series again. All are a great read. Haven't read Swan Song so can't say which to start with but the novels of The Change require a bunch of time to really appreciate the scope of the story line.,smeadley,2013-12-28T16:13:05Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,Swan Song,1
