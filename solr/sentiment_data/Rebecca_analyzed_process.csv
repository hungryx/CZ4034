The whole thing is like... I feel uneasy and nervous but not sure why... Just like this portion. Why is she so ashamed... What's that about?

I'd say it's her aversion to the idea of taking advantage or being manipulative. 

Shopkeeper: ""If you can manipulate your mistress to keep her coming back it'll be worth your while."" 

While not necessarily illegal or particularly immoral… the protagonists shame/embarrassment just speaks to how she is innocent, not conniving or selfish. 

This sneaky streak wouldn't have bothered Rebecca or Mrs Danvers and, almost her whole arc is about her fear of being manipulated or subtly controlled.",johnzer88,2024-02-15T13:42:08Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1
1arcnnv_2,1arcnnv,"I think this is the best explanation. Although class may come into it I think the point of the interaction is to show us the protagonist's character. Not only does she not accept the offer but she feels gross about the idea of it and picturing herself as the type of person who would accept. It also is an interesting contrast with other parts where she pictures herself as confident and knowing as Rebecca, not understanding what that actually entails until the reveal.",,2024-02-15T16:54:05Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,2

1arcnnv_4,1arcnnv,"You also have to add religion into this. Historically, royalty was seen as having a divine right to rule, and therefore if something went wrong (losing a war, not having a male heir) it was quite literally your fault and a message from God that you had lost His favour through some sinful transgression. Conversely, becoming king was a sign from God that you were the best person for the job and morally pure.

Extrapolate that downwards, and you get a class mentality that people who are born into wealthy families are naturally morally superior, and people who are poor are innately morally inferior. The upper class are the moral gatekeepers of society (hence rich people not only patronising churches and individual clergymen, but having  an unquestionable right to decide who is worthy of patronage). If someone is in a ""better"" trade they are literally a better person. 

Similarly, if someone rises through the ranks via trade (think Captain Wentworth in Persuasion) they become more socially acceptable not just from having more money but because their success itself indicates moral superiority. God has indicated their worthiness by allowing their choices to result in good things.

Conversely, women were not seen as decision makers in marriage - men choose a wife - so a woman who rises above her station through marriage is morally questionable. It's what happens *after* such a marriage takes place that determines her worth; if she is a success (children, social success), then again God is ratifying her rise in station. If she is a failure, it's proof that she was not meant to have the role to start with and is morally not good enough. Rebecca's social success helps to hide her moral failings, whereas the protagonist's social stumbles aren't just gauche, they are in some sense indicative of being fundamentally bad/wrong for the role.",Comfortable_Fig_9584,2024-02-16T09:08:01Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,4

I've also started reading collections of her short stories. I find her writing fascinating. Unique plots, interesting characters, and beautiful description. I'm reading Frenchman's Creek next!

Oh and I also highly recommend the 1940 film version of Rebecca. Hitchcock did a masterful job and stayed true to the text!

Hitchcock does such a masterful job with Rebecca and while faithful to the book probably added a little more horror vibe than some of us envisioned while reading.

ytbt3j_1,ytbt3j,"I don't know if it's in every copy, but the commentary in mine by Sally Beauman about Daphne Du Maurier's personal life playing into her treatment of both Rebecca and the narrator had me thinking about this book for WEEKS after reading it. 

She talks about Du Maurier's life, being bisexual and having past relationships with women before marrying someone quite conservative and moving to Egypt and having to be 'a proper wife'. Beauman talked about Du Maurier possibly basing both the narrator and Rebecca on the different sides of her personality, as she's not exactly censuring or endorsing either of them by the end. She's both sympathetic AND critical of both women, showing a conflict between the two sides of her own self.

She makes another great point, that despite this being the narrator's story, we leave with Rebecca's name on our lips and our memory. 'Well behaved women rarely make history' and all that.

ytbt3j_3,ytbt3j,"Yes! I love Rebecca, and I’m always happy when other readers discuss the really fascinating gender dynamics that Du Maurier was exploring. I 100% agree with basically everything Beauman explores in her excellent afterword - including her theory that Rebecca as a character represents a threat/alternative to Maxim’s patriarchal and class power. The last straw that causes him to murder her is when Rebecca threatens to bring up an illegitimate son as Maxim’s heir and inheritor of Manderley, breaking his line by doing so. Maxim’s entire identity lies in his gender and class power (and passing down this power to his sons), and what he truly hates so much about Rebecca is not that she’s cruel, but that she doesn’t play by his rules, or societal rules. 

Rebecca, although not entirely an innocent victim by all accounts, nonetheless represents a powerful foil to Maxim’s patriarchal world. Our unnamed narrator, on the other hand, is desperate to submit to Maxim in order to gain his approval, despite how unhappy this makes her. The scene where she realizes that Maxim pets her the same way he pets the family dog is so incredible and darkly funny! 

My favorite scene is the the last few pages of the novel, where the narrator dreams that she and Rebecca are merging into one person, and that they use their long hair to hang Maxim. She then wakes up to discover that Manderley, that long-standing symbol of Maxim’s power, is in flames. So powerful!!",_gothicghost_,2022-11-13T06:49:10Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,3
ytbt3j_4,ytbt3j,"Reading the comments also made me realise something else too. Maxim inadvertantly drew attention to his guilt via the complete 180 in how he treated his 2nd wife after Rebecca's boat was found. Everyone at the fancy dress ball would have noticed the distance between the newlyweds. The servants would have heard and gossiped about how Maxim yelled at her evening of the ball. How he didn't even ask to speak to his wife when he was away. Bea is shocked Maxim didn't buy her a bridal wardrobe or any wedding gifts outside of the hairbrushes, she implies he was very conscientious with Rebecca. This is echoed by the many peers/tennats who use the lack of newlywed treatment to petition another ball. 

For Colonel Julyan, likely to have heard these rumours/whisperings and seen for himself the distance between the newlyweds at the ball 3 days before he's called to assist in confronting Favells blackmail, arriving and seeing Maxim thick as thieves with the wife he previously disdained must have been the 1st 🚩",excel_pager_420,2022-11-13T00:52:04Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,4
ytbt3j_5,ytbt3j,"I disagree that their sexual relationship started with the confession. She says that their honeymoon was carefree, and that he was attentive and ardent, her friend and lover. It wasn’t until they returned to Manderley that he resumed being distant and cold, now realizing that the specter of Rebecca and his personal demons haven’t dissipated. 

I always found it weird that they had separate bedrooms, but apparently that wasn’t at all unusual for the wealthy. Plus it does lend to her loneliness and isolation. 

I agree that he set her up to fail by sending her into this incredibly new situation and social status absolutely blind. I don’t think he purposefully set her up to fail. He wasn’t considerate. But I’m not sure, really. I also don’t believe he was grooming her with malicious intent. More so, he was attracted to her because she was so guileless and opposite Rebecca in every aspect. But it comes down to whether you believe his account of her murder or not, and I do. 

I think Manderley had to burn to set them free. As much as they loved Manderley, Rebecca’s presence there was too overbearing. The ending is so open ended. Who is to say that they remain unhappy and homeless forever? I think they will eventually settle down somewhere. And probably be happy enough - surely not more unhappy than any other mediocre marriage out there.

I do think that he wanted her companionship, at the very least. One thing that struck me was the way he listened to her prattle on when they would meet up in Monte Carlo. Of course, he was reserved and keeping his big secret. But still. In my experience, at least, abusive oppressive men don NOT want to listen to you talk about yourself. That’s one thing I’ll give to Maxim - he seemed genuinely interested in her life, at least at that point.",doingtheunstuckk,2022-11-22T16:49:59Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,5
ytbt3j_6,ytbt3j,"This is what I think:

1. Rebecca is the main character of the book.  Even though she is dead as the book takes place, she is still the center of what takes place.
2. Maxim loved Rebecca until she confronted him with who she really was. Up until that point she had played a role. He cared enough about his family name to put-up with her actions and I think he may have still cared enough about her to try to make it work until her actions became too flagrant. This is England in the 1930's.
3. The attraction of the 2nd Mrs DeWinter had for Maxim is her innocence. She is very different from Rebecca. I believe that he fell in love with her but held back because he was afraid that Rebecca's body would be found.
4. You comment that Maxim enjoyed treating his second wife  badly but I think a lot of that was to keep the reader in the dark as to what is really going on. Mrs. Danvers manipulates situations to cause trouble. Such as advising the 2nd wife on her outfit for the masquerade party, knowing full well Max will be shocked. 
5. Rebecca's greatest fear was dying a painful death in bed. We know this because Mrs. Danvers tells the second Mrs. DeWinters this. When Rebecca got her diagnosis from a doctor in London she called her cousin Mr. Favell and left a message for him to meet her in the cottage on the beach. I don't know exactly what she planned to tell him if she got through to him, but he was her back-up.  If she couldn't lie to Max and have him kill her, she wanted Favell to do so.
6. Max shoots Rebecca.  It is planned by her.  She planned to ruin his life to secure a release for her. She damaged his life but not completely because of the woman he married the second time.",,2022-11-13T05:17:08Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,6
ytbt3j_7,ytbt3j,I know this is an older thread but I would like to suggest reading Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman. The book is a sequel to the Daphne du Maurier novel Rebecca and is officially approved by the Du Maurier estate,Existing_Ad866,2024-02-23T20:58:02Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,7
ytbt3j_8,ytbt3j,"Rebecca is a story that depicts the 'imprisonment' of its characters in terms of their gender roles, class levels, and social expectations during the 1930's. Most of the story takes place at a fictionalized estate in Cornwall named Manderlay; largely based on a property that Du Maurier herself had refurbished.  The fictionalized story unfolds between the period of the great wars and does not include other world events such as the Depression etc.. These events are not shown in the story to have a bearing on the characters overall.  The narrator of the story is the protagonist, the newly married 2nd wife of Maxim DeWinter. Du Maurier once suggested that her name was Daphne also. Regardless, the unnamed narrator in the story of Rebecca does not allude to her name because the narrator's reflections structure the tale. Maxim De Winter was taunted into murdering his 1st wife Rebecca when Rebecca lied to Maxim that she was pregnant by one of her lovers. Rebecca is initially depicted in the story as a successful and accomplished wife but is later shown to be a sociopath and a serial cheater. In the story, the underlying inference is that rather than being pregnant, Rebecca would instead soon die of a debilitating disease and that is not something she could tolerate. Hence the taunting of Max De Winter, her then husband, to shoot her, place her body in her sailboat and then to scuttle the boat.",retread2017,2022-11-12T20:33:25Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,8
ytbt3j_9,ytbt3j,"y'all are reading way too much in imo.   i mean, fill your boots if it's fun, but it's funny to me to read this and see what a difference generational awareness can make.  

i wasn't born until 1965, but even in those days and among my (atypically older) parents' generation, i have seen TONS of long-standing marriages that were 'comfortably' on a very formal standing.  yes, even after 50 years together.   in the 70's i had a piano teacher who was probably born around the turn of the century, who never called her late husband anything but 'mr x'.   yet she was entirely content with her marriage and how her life had worked out; and she was not an oppressed nitwit either.    

many of my parents' age-peers were the same.  it wouldn't have worked for me, doesn't probably work for anyone alive now.  but that's no reason to presume it did not work for folks from the time when it was a norm.

rebecca is a really well-written book.  i like the sinister atmosphere and the suspense part that relates to the murder, but to me it's also an emotional thriller.   the payoff feels too imbalanced to ever work for me, but i'm happy to take it at the face value of what du maurier wrote.",Dazzling-Ad4701,2022-11-13T04:49:37Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,9
ytbt3j_10,ytbt3j,I have that in my novel too!! I haven't read all of it but the parts I read blew my mind.

ytbt3j_11,ytbt3j,"You know, I thought about this. But the marriage to Rebecca seemed to have lasted over a decade. It's implied they were married in their 20's. So I thought maybe Maxim was young enough/rich enough to avoid being drafted, as the novel avoided any particular dates. Especially as they never make any reference to Maxim being in the military. Compared with all the military related jabs Favell manages to get in about Colonel Julyan, whose in the book for like 10 mins. And the war was presumably before the narrator was born.

Although maybe everyone was doing that thing we're doing with COVID, where we don't explicitly mention it because the trauma is ongoing and we all want to move on? And we understand when we read something where the person references 2020 or 2021 and says, *due to circumstances* they mean the pandemic. But in a 100 years time people might be like wait, why is everyone in this novel excusing that snappy short-tempered character just because they work in medicine/as a delivery driver/postal worker/insert other essential job? 

A contemporary reading sees it as Maxim referencing his time in war. A modern reading reads it as an reference to Maxim not being new to murder 🧐",excel_pager_420,2022-11-12T18:26:14Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,11

ytbt3j_15,ytbt3j,"Oooh interesting!! So how I came to my conclusion and why it's so different to this is that I don't believe Maxim told the truth. Sometimes reading the book I was wondering if the narrator was telling us everything, you can tell she's unhappy but she keeps lying to herself until after the ball. So because of this,

1) Agreed, the book is named after Rebecca
2.)I don't believe this happened exactly the way Maxim says it did. As much as he says he hated Rebecca even before they moved into Manderly together & claims he was lying throughout, it's odd that so many characters that knew Maxim+ Rebecca very well only noticed their unhappiness in the years before Rebecca's death. Or in the case of Danvers knew the marriage was a sham but believed Maxim had genuine love those 1st few years.

3.)I don't believe Maxim ever loved the narrator. I think he wanted someone compliant, no family or friends, the opposite of Rebecca. He claims he loved her innocence but before the confession he gets irritated every time she displays it.

4.)Mrs Danvers manipulates 2 situations max. And even with the ornament situation, Mrs Danvers doesn't force Maxim to engage in a conversation with her about how stupid it was that his wife hid the pieces like a child in front of his wife. Very unusual behaviour for the master of the house to publicly scald the mistress of the house with a servant. Throughout the novel they wait to have important conversations when the servants aren't present. That's the world they live in. And Danvers isn't there when Maxim is awful to his wife after their first day at Happy Valley and then the beach. Or when he gets annoyed in Monte Carlo and stops the car and opens the door and tells her to hop out in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country if she doesn't like what she hears and then drives her back to the hotel knowing she's in tears. Or when his marriage proposal involves calling her a fool and admitting he's being a brute to her. It's one thing for the author to give us misdirection. It's another to make one character treat the other so badly, that Mrs Van Hooper warning this marriage isn't a great idea sounds like the most sensible thing she says as you're reading it.

5.) We can't know this exactly. Don't forget Rebecca often spent nights on the cottage alone. So there was nothing about that particular night which meant she could have predicted Max would follow her down to the cottage with a gun. She'd been there having midnight picnics & allegedly banging her cousin for years with his knowledge and he'd never done such a thing. Maxim doesn't mention anything in particular Rebecca left out to taunt him.

6.) We simply can't know this. This is what Maxim tells us. Could that be his way of easing his conscience? Killing a women who's told you she's pregnant would feel less evil if you believed you were used as a tool in her final master plan. It comes down to whether you trust and believe Maxim is an honest, reliable character. If you do, than this is what happens. If you don't, it's all part of the novel, wondering what Rebecca would have told Favell had he seen the note and followed her down, and who Rebecca really was.",excel_pager_420,2022-11-13T11:59:24Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,15

ytbt3j_17,ytbt3j,"I don't really understand the point of your comment tbh. It's ok if you perceive it as portraying a normal romance, similar to the many relationships you witnessed growing up, so you read it as a tame emotion thriller and leave it at that.

But to say I'm reading into it with modern sensibilities because the discovery that the husband murdered his 1st wife believing she was pregnant was less shocking in the 1930s than it is today is untrue. The 1940 Hitchcock film of Rebecca, released 2 years after the book was 1st published, turned Rebecca's death into an accident because people felt so strongly that Maxim shouldn't get away with murdering a women he believed to be pregnant.

I'm sorry that you witnessed and normalised so many cold marriages, but in the world of *Rebecca* it's established from the moment Mrs Van Hooper spots Maxim that everyone believed Maxim to be devoted to Rebecca, everyone believed they had this unbelievably loving marriage and that was part of what made Manderly so popular. Spending time with this glamorous larger than life couple. Most people the narrator meets are shocked at how different Maxim is with her and it's one of the things that convinces her Maxim is still in love with Rebecca.

And the narrator acknowledges it too, she comments thank god Favell was drunk and yelled and didn't communicate the way people of Maxim & Colonel Julyan class communicated. You can even tell that Colonel Julyan realised Maxim was guilty & Frank & the narrator accomplishes. He couldn't look any of them in the eye. But because of Maxim's position in society he advises them to move abroad and promises to get the word out that Rebecca was ill to clear their name.

Narrators obsession with Manderley is of cause a mirror of Miss Denvers love for Rebecca. And it mirrors the rising difficulties of English country estate owners to keep their properties which grew harder and harder after WW1.

pzmiwt_1,pzmiwt,"Many Gothic romances really build upon the helplessness of the woman involved, the rather pitiful array of virtues of the ""hero,"" and the subtle horror of the situation (and by extension, women's lives in general.) Rebecca just took those elements and turned them into an unreliable narrative in a way. If you re-read it, it is more obvious that good old Mr. DeWinter was a douche and Rebecca herself had severe problems that were definitely not just being a bitch (her relationship with her nanny? Seriously screwed up.) The unnamed heroine is supposedly liberated at the end, but is she really? No, because she's still married to a murderer and now bonus ptsd. It's a freaking tragedy-- oddly enough my daughter and I were just discussing it in regards to an unreliable narrator. The unnamed heroine is misinformed, not lying, but it's an interesting read the second time when you know the ""secret.""",Swerve_Up,2021-10-02T03:39:16Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1
pzmiwt_2,pzmiwt,"I think the true horror of the novel is the corruption of the main character. At the start she is presented as something of a blank slate. DuMaurier makes a big point of her youth & naivete & it kind of feels like her character arc will be something of a hero's journey. She will emerge from the book's events stronger, more sympathetic, less gullible, etc. Instead, we see her:

*Rejoice in the murder of her 'rival'.
*Take no thought or care for whether Rebecca really was pregnant at the time or the fate of the baby.
*Find her big moment of 'strength' in being a little ruder to the staff.
* Help cover up a murder.

Because it's written in such a tight 1st person POV, the horror of what she's doing & the woman she is becoming is written as being good & empowering. The ending is written as something of a happily ever after. But, that is simply more unreliable narration. Of course the narrator will portray her actions as justified, even if, reading between the lines, we know they were deeply wrong. Of course she will claim it was all worth while even if we get a glimpse of the misery it's caused. We are only getting her side of the story.",,2021-10-02T14:14:36Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,2
pzmiwt_3,pzmiwt,"I'm not sure there's supposed to be a lot of character growth. It's the inherently unhealthy story of two emotionally downtrodden people who fall into a codependent relationship.

---

Maxim comes off as a man with a weak-willed streak who was trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage, with a manipulative wife who didn't love him and had open affairs in front of him -- including sleeping with her brother-in-law. When Maxim threatened to divorce her, she told him it'd never happen. Then Maxim lashed out with the ultimate violence because Rebecca claimed she was going to give birth to her lover's child -- a child that would have legally been considered his and legally entitled to all that was his.

Then even after she's dead, he can't be rid of her. His house becomes a shrine to the angel that never was and all the while he's pretending that he mourns the hateful woman he killed.

Rebecca, by all descriptions, seemed a savvy enough woman to know exactly what she was doing by telling him she was pregnant. It was suicide by another hand ... and if she thought she could take him down with her, that was probably a bonus. She seemed to have had zero remorse for any of her actions, a red flag if there ever was one. Little fear either, except for the fear of a lingering death.

The only sympathetic descriptions of Rebecca come from her lover and Mrs. Danvers, neither of whom are impartial. And Mrs. Danvers kept bullying and humiliating the narrator, not to mention trying to drive her to suicide, so her version of Rebecca is incredibly suspect in a book full of unreliable impressions.

So I can feel *some* sympathy for Maxim when it comes to such a marriage. And his lack of remorse about her murder makes sense in the context of an abuse victim killing an abuser -- I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep if my own abuser shuffled off the mortal coil.

---

As for the second Mrs. de Winter, she comes off as an incredibly lonely person who is happy even with the smallest scraps of affection , even when they're delivered with put-downs/verbal abuse from her husband (who may have very well learned to have mistake cruel terms for affectionate ones). She has an inferiority complex and constantly compares herself with and is compared to the false front of Rebecca. She thinks she is plain, foolish, and emotionally weak, even when other characters contradict those thoughts.

The narrator ends up having no choice really about being tough on the staff. Mrs. Danvers was insubordinate about the narrator from the start, going against Maxim's orders to have the staff come out to greet the narrator for the first time. When she finally started giving reasonable orders to the staff, Mrs. Danvers complained that it wasn't what Rebecca would've done. Staff intimidating the mistress of the household wasn't really something that would've been all that sympathetic in the time period.

When it turns out that her fears were based on lies and that her husband actually loves her, she protects him. His innocence is false, but it's fitting given the falseness Rebecca showed the world.

---

By the end, the narrator and Maxim have each other without any lies in the way, but his beloved house is burned down, the specter of Rebecca's murder will always hover over them, and Mrs. Danvers helped Rebecca triumph one last time over those tormented by her in life and death.",i_bite_right,2021-10-02T18:25:54Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,3

Maxim is so insecure that he feels compelled to murder his wife rather than let his reputation be damaged and then spends the rest of his life wallowing in fear. Mrs. De Winter is so self conscious and timid that she literally cannot explain to her husband that her own servants are bullying her.

That’s why, after the murder is revealed, they can resume loving each other — they’re a perfect match! They complement each other’s insecurities and can be paranoid together. The fantasy that kicked off the book — Maxim pretending to be a worldly, confident man who swoops young women off their feet, and Mrs. DeWinter as the careless young thing that can devote her feelings to him — is shattered. Now they are exposed to each other, which leads to a codependent kind of equal and honest relationship.

pzmiwt_8,pzmiwt,"I just finished reading the book not too long back and the ending felt rather abrupt to me :( _x000D_  
_x000D_  
While reading, I got carried away with the twists, rooting for Maxim to escape the accusations (only for the sake of the narrator). I felt terribly sorry for her. But the sympathy quickly led me to realise what a horrible man Maxim was.  _x000D_  
_x000D_  
I was angry with not just the murder, but also the fact that he might have been manipulative with her - confessing his love only after admitting to the murder. From the details the narrator expressed earlier, there was no inkling of intimacy nor was there a spark of love after she moved. Furthermore, Maxim was very much older than her and knew very well how he could toy with a young, naive girl’s emotions who was inarguably so besotted with him. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
This then brings me to question if Rebecca was truly as horrible as he described her to be. She was the sort of person who travels and sails independently and was greatly admired by Mrs. Danvers who equates Rebecca to being intelligent, confident, beautiful, and a woman who can’t be stopped. Such unconventional qualities might have irked Maxim, especially after I learned about the social construct of the period this book was written. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
Also, I don’t accept adultery; just laying out possibilities here. Rebecca might have cheated on Maxim because there were already problems in the marriage (just like the second one) and she was exploring her sexual needs. Maybe this might have been the darker side of Rebecca, but IMO it’s Maxim that I’m more skeptical of",thi0092,2022-05-17T03:32:09Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,8

pzmiwt_18,pzmiwt,"This is a very old post but I'm seeing this take so often and it's really baffling me that people are saying Rebecca was actually being misrepresented by Maxim. 

Other characters in the story admit that she's awful, Beatrice got the sense that she wasn't as nice as she pretended to be, Frank gets incredibly uncomfortable talking about her because he can't exactly say ""the previous woman was a bitch"", we have no real textual evidence to suggest that Max is lying or misrepresenting the truth.

 Danvers is obsessed with her and very openly says that Rebecca was a cruel, scheming and conniving person that openly mocked people behind their backs after pretending to be nice to them. That she treated people like toys to play with and enjoyed playing games specifically designed to hurt them. 

Heck, she even bullied the disabled bloke and threatened to send him away to the asylum often enough that he's terrified anytime he talks to people from Manderley that they're going to institutionalise him. If that's not meant to be a reflection of her character then idk what else could convince people.

I find it so bizarre with all of the very clear textual evidence to support Max's description of Rebecca, that people pretend she was a victim of Max's controlling behaviour. By all accounts, she was awful and no doubt would fit the profile for some pretty disturbing levels of traits highly associated with personality disorders. 

I like applying a feminist lense to literature whenever I can, but this instance seems incredibly misplaced. Does the book frame the system in which the story takes place as oppressive? Obviously.

She and Max may have had an open marriage arrangement, but her behavior still went far beyond any acceptable behavior. Being discreet about her affairs was supposed to be part of the deal, not sleeping with her brother in law, trying it on with the Manderley staff, and getting pregnant by her alcoholic cousin. There isn't one sympathetic character in the whole book as far as I'm concerned, other than some side characters like Frank or Ben. 

I started reading My Cousin Rachel right after I finished Rebecca and I actually am enjoying it a lot more.

When I saw the year that Daphne Du Maurier wrote the book and the difference between this and My Cousin Rachel in terms of writing quality, it begins to make a lot more sense.

This blog post was very comprehensive: [https://theblankgarden.com/2021/01/13/a-trail-of-books-on-carolina-nabucos-a-sucessora-the-sucessor-1934-and-the-plagiarism-charges-against-daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca-1938/](https://theblankgarden.com/2021/01/13/a-trail-of-books-on-carolina-nabucos-a-sucessora-the-sucessor-1934-and-the-plagiarism-charges-against-daphne-du-mauriers-rebecca-1938/)  (Amazingly detailed post, btw - impressive amount of work.)

The blog's author quotes a couple of passages that use some very similar imagery, but nothing that is identical or ""the same.""  

If there are identical passages, it should be easy to show that, but I can't find anything that says, ""Here is a sentence from A Sucessora (translated to English), and here is a sentence from Rebecca.  Look, these are all the same words.""

The most compelling thing that I found (from that blog post) is that there are two passages that both reference the first wife arranging flowers (""flowers"" in one, ""lilacs"" in the other) and the first wife's body leaving imprints in the couch cushions.  That's definitely a highly suspicious similarity, but what I was asking about is if there is proof of passages that are identical, and I can't find any.",Tony_Bicycle,2021-10-02T21:01:54Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,30

wc5xuq_1,wc5xuq,"Mrs. Danvers burned Manderley, in revenge. She realized Maxim must have killed Rebecca, even though he got off legally. It's poetic irony because everything he did originally, in marrying Rebecca and putting up her infidelity all those years was for the sake of Manderley, to promote its beauty and reputation. He killed her to keep someone else's child from inheriting it. He sold his soul for Manderley, so to speak, but then Manderley has become so linked to Rebecca that he can't get away from her while he's there. Manderley burning is both his punishment and the thing needed to let them finally put Rebecca away completely.

Daphne du Maurier considered it a study in jealousy. The protagonists lack of a name is indicative of how she feels invisible and overlooked the whole time.",Far-Adagio4032,2022-07-30T20:13:05Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1

Mrs. Danvers burned down Manderly because she was super protective of Rebecca, and felt that the second Mrs. de Winter was a disgrace and disapproved of their love.

Nooo! The whole point of the novel is that the protagonist always lives under the shadow of Rebecca.

It's not completely unambiguous, but I definitely read that as being the author's way of letting us know that they did have a complete marriage in the beginning. It's true when he first asks her he describes the proposed relationship in very non-sexual terms--her duties will be almost the same as they are with her current employer. But then in that paragraph later she indicates that he was very different during those weeks of their honeymoon.

rpee8s_1,rpee8s,">The main character not having a name

Ahhh I loved that personally. It just furthers how much of a replacement she is for the ghostly and overly-mentioned Rebecca.

>supposedly we're supposed to hope he gets away with it?

We're not supposed to root for him

>reeked of her insecurity

That's the point, her reaction to finding out her husband is a murderer is supposed to horrify you

It's not a romance, at least not in the positive sense. It's more horror than anything. In her day, the author was distraught to find out that people thought it was supposed to be empowering for the main character or that it was supposed to be some great romance.

Like all good psychological horror, it plays tricks on your mind. Just because the main character believes these things doesn't mean the audience is supposed to agree with her. It's very much an abusive relationship and the main character doesn't realize it.",,2021-12-27T05:11:10Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1
rpee8s_2,rpee8s,"This is my favorite book of all time so I'm ready to fight you! (Mostly kidding, different strokes for different folks and all that.)

I will say that I strongly disagree that we're ""supposed"" to root for Maxim and his second wife. Our narrator certainly wants us to, but ultimately I think du Maurier created a ""heroine"" who we're supposed to empathize with but be *very* critical of. *Rebecca* is, to me, a psychological examination of the pitfalls of insecurity, codependence, and relationships with an imbalanced power dynamic.

I also disagree that the de Winters ""came out on top."" Again, this is something the narrator is trying to convince us of, but in my opinion that's because she's too insecure to admit that she's miserable. And she and Maxim do seem miserable: she's as in love with him as ever, but he doesn't seem to care about her any more than he did in the beginning. They have no home but roam from city to city, constantly on the run, with Manderley haunting our narrator's dreams. (However, I do agree that I wish they hadn't have gotten away with it—well, what I *most* wish is that the narrator would have had the strength of character to turn her husband in, but this would have been the next best thing.)

Finally, a note on the Jane Eyre comparisons: I do think du Maurier wrote it as a response to Jane Eyre, but I don't think she wrote it as a retelling. Instead, I think she's commenting on a number of elements that she sees as dangerous. In both novels, there's a massive power imbalance between the hero and heroine: the hero is significantly older, more romantically experienced, and well-situated financially and socially, while the heroine is young, naïve, friendless, and penniless. Jane Eyre has a strong enough character, and Rochester a willingness to show humility and treat her as an equal, that their relationship is able to overcome these challenges. But the narrator of *Rebecca* is insecure and lonely, and Maxim apparently is only interested in keeping her around because he likes being adored, and so their relationship is an unhappy and corrupting one.

>The main character only becomes empowered AFTER HER HUSBAND CONFESSES HE MURDERED REBECCA. WTF. It was so quick and sudden and reeked of her insecurity

I definitely agree with this. For me, this was the big ""twist"": not that Maxim murdered Rebecca (which I saw coming fairly early on), but the narrator's reaction.

All told, I love this novel not despite, but because of the narrator. I identify strongly with many of her personality traits, and seeing that recognized and explored on the page is incredibly cathartic and freeing…and also gave me a lot to think about. I also really love du Maurier's prose and very atmospheric writing style—gothic settings are my favorite, and nothing has ever topped Manderley.

rpee8s_4,rpee8s,"I feel like you are annoyed that the book tells a story about people who behave in this or that way rather than moralizing? Yes this man murders his wife. Yes his new young wife's entire identity is wrapped up in her relationship to him. Yes he gets away with it. Yes his vulnerability in his secret crime being exposed gives his wife an opportunity to feel some equality in their relationship between each other. Daphne DuMaurier wrote psychological thrillers about really complicated people. The fact that she's not interested in telling a moral tale doesn't mean she's unaware of the unethical behavior of her characters.  


There's another thread here about In True Blood. Capote is capable of letting you get wrapped up in the protagonist's perspective and see things through his eyes despite the fact that he murdered a family. There's no way you are supposed to be ""rooting"" for the murdered, but absolutely you see what it's like to be in his mind. And that's real.   


Can you get caught up in Macbeth's marriage dynamics and their drama, goals, etc? Why not with Rebecca?   


Yes there is more moralizing in Bronte. She was a true god-fearing Christian, so naturally her story was about redemption and the very real threat (to her and all the characters in her books) threat of eternal damnation.

We may have a biased narrator, but there's little to show we shouldn't root for the de Winters. Mrs. Danvers is unpleasant, as well as Favell and his incestuous relationship with Rebecca. And in the end, Rebecca wanted him to kill her, which I interpreted as the author further giving Maxim the okay in killing her while also making Rebecca into this genius mastermind who had to have nature step in to destroy her for being so wicked. And her inability to have children reminded me of Lady Macbeth and I sort of took her to be a type of glamorous Lady Macbeth. Even Julyan seems to have suspected Maxim killed her in the end, but didn't push the investigation further, giving the law's dismissal of the whole thing. I think the book had a lot of potential, and maybe the intended horror could have come across, but it got lost with the first 3/4 of it dedicated to her insecurity and the rest of it being rushed. DuMaurier might not have intended people to think it was supposed to be empowering, but to me, it came across that way because the book doesn't do anything to counteract that narrative, at least not at an initial reading.",KSAFD,2021-12-27T05:41:32Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,6

I do think ""romantic suspense"" is an appropriate characterization of the novel, but ""romantic"" in the classic sense of it being about a relationship—not in the modern sense of ""here are two flawed but fundamentally good characters we're going to watch fall in love and find their happily ever aver."" Think *Wuthering Heights*, not Danielle Steele.

It also wouldn't surprise me if du Maurier did draw from her own personality and experiences when writing the novel because it all rings very true to me. However, I think it would be a mistake to conclude that therefore du Maurier must have intended to portray herself in a good light—on the contrary, I think a significant chunk of the novel is du Maurier doing some hard self-examination.

Finally, I am convinced that Rebecca *was* wicked (and Maxim absolutely should have gotten a divorce), but Maxim was still a monster for killing her and should have been punished.

(Hope this doesn't come across as me ""piling on"" or something—I just love talking about this novel!)",jefrye,2021-12-27T09:34:56Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,10
rpee8s_11,rpee8s,"No sweat, you're rich in the Internet age, and answers are right there for the asking.  I love Reddit for that!

There was a great deal of experimenting going on in the novel in the era of *Rebecca.*  Novels themselves, as a *mass* mass means of entertainment, were about a hundred years old when *Rebecca* came out.  The pace of experimentation accelerated in the 20th century, and you do occasionally get these little oddballs popping up and becoming popular, like *Rebecca*, *Catch-22,* *One Hundred Years of Solitude,* *Orlando, Gravity's Rainbow*, and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*.  Kind of trying to push this exceptionally rich method of storytelling in new directions.  Unreliable narrators, antiheroes, unsympathetic protagonists, magical realism, genre-mixing, improbable plots.

Not every experiment is going to succeed.  People get used to a certain method of storytelling, and violating the rules can confuse or anger readers.  Make it too convoluted, and readers can't follow you.  Cluing the reader in to an important point the narrator doesn't catch is an art form (see *To Kill a Mockingbird* for masterful handling of this).

Part of the reaction to *Rebecca* is specifically how it's marketed; it's considered either a mystery or a horror novel, and neither of those is designed for re-reading.  If you regard *Rebecca* as literary fiction, however, re-reading becomes a possibility to pick up subtleties you didn't get the first (second, third, nth) time through.  That can be its own pleasure, and in a post-Hemingway literary environment, where books are abundant and the single-read format (mystery, horror, romance) dominates publishing, we've kind of lost the knack of going through a book more than once to pick up any dropped stitches.",McJohn_WT_Net,2021-12-27T20:37:10Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,11
kl82uo_1,kl82uo,"Of course I don't feel sorry for Maxim. He wanted to possess Rebecca but couldn't so he murdered her. He replaced her with our narrator only a few months later. And lo and behold, she's young, isolated, and so very, very manipulatable. Maxim grooms her easily. 

As the whole book are her recollections, you can even see how she knows this. Though her self-esteem is necessarily low, there are moments of true clarity.  She compares herself to the dogs, a pet of Maxim's; she mentions that it is her youth and naivete that make her so appealing to him . She even withholds her own name, so absorbed has she been into Maxim's web. She is willing to be the possession that Rebecca refused to be.

*Rebecca* takes on an added brilliance in this day and age because we have so much more knowledge of male violence. More than 50,000 women a year are murdered by their current or former male partners. If you've ever watched true crime, the confessions mirror Maxim's almost exactly. The women cheated, they lied, it was all an act, she practically *forced* him to murder her!  There's always an excuse. And they often manage to convince another woman to marry them very soon afterwards.",,2020-12-29T02:01:44Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1
kl82uo_2,kl82uo,"I just finished reading it this evening and was so affected by the novel, especially that rollicking third act. Loved the neuroses of the narrator, the complexity of Danvers evil, and that ENDING. Like hitting a brick wall - I'd forgotten all the destruction outlined in the first two chapters by that point.

I do not side with De Winter, as he committed out-and-out murder and our insight to the crime is all through the sympathetic POV of his wife. Rebecca seems to have been a fairly cruel person (threatening Ben with the asylum, whipping the horse until it bleeds, constant cheating, mocking servants, hanging/banging with her gross cousin, etc.)  If the narrator is a masochist, then Rebecca seems to be a sadist. But while she may have been an abusive spouse, but it doesn't justify the crime of murder.

Especially since De Winter knew what she was. She told him all these ""awful things"" (to his sensibilities at least)  she had done five days into their marriage and he chose to stay with her because she would be a good manager for his beloved Manderley. That and he doesn't want to go through a divorce, for social reasons. He made his bed on this one.

And the fact that De Winter doesn't tell his wife he loves her UNTIL he confesses to Rebecca's murder could be read as their relationship not really starting until each has been truly honest with the other (also it seems to be the first time they bone?) But given the passionless relationship described in the opening chapters, it seems more like a desperate manipulative ploy to keep the new Mrs. De Winter in his corner. The narrator's POV wants to make us love him, but once you get to the end and look back... it's hard to see anything but a criminal (and accessory after the fact) on the run. 

Curious about other people's thoughts on one detail: I read Rebecca as provoking Maxim into assisted suicide. We are told she wasn't the type to go down slowly via lingering disease, and that does fit with her combative personality. 

I don't think she expected Maxim to come down and confront her, but she saw an opportunity to take advantage of. She lied about her adulterous pregnancy to suggest she'd be giving Manderley to an heir outside the family. Essentially destroying Manderley, the sole reason he brought her into his life to begin with. The only betrayal sure to provoke him into an attack, as he had weathered all her other betrayals up to this point.

BUT if that's the case - what was she going to discuss with her cousin Favell, as suggested in her note to him? Was he another option for a man to enrage into killing her? He certainly seems the type (I assume he and Danvers orchestrated the destruction of Manderley together.)",ACoolWizard,2021-04-23T05:20:46Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,2
kl82uo_3,kl82uo,"I think Maxim was gay and a bit feminine not too different from Laurence Olivier. Rebecca being shrewd knew this and told some things about her. He could have actually wanted to kill her not because of her secrets but because she caught up to his. Same goes about divorcing her and facing disgrace. In line with Rebecca's personality, I believe she was the kind to keep her word so she kept her side of the bargain and didn't disclose that she and Maxim were not together. Mrs. Danvers in the book repeats that all the men including Maxim loved her and gave her expensive gifts. This is what suggests that there is a possibility he could have had feminine traits like Olivier. He wanted an adorned wife who was already beautiful to glow things further. I read elsewhere here that Maxim and the second wife first bone after his confession.

Him reserving affection through their marriage until he reveals the murder seems manipulative and he just came off as sexist (his rants on women over and over, and him proclaiming he would kill Rebecca when they talked a few days after their wedding and seemingly charitably didn't) and cruel. Also, saying that h preferred his new wife to be naïve, innocent, to be left without understanding on certain things is gross.

When I finished the book, I felt disgusted that I was supposed to find it as romantic. Reading up on the backstory made me realize that I may have been reading it 'correctly' all along. Dapne du Maurier had intended the book to be about jealousy and was horrified that people viewed it as a romance. 

I do wonder, beyond marketing, how one could read it as a romance. There are few, very few, romantic scenes overall and when you take those scenes and combine them with everything out they cancel out the romantic aspects, leaving you with an abuser who finds a poor young girl to marry, manipulate, and mold.",seizonnokamen,2021-01-16T16:34:15Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,4

It seems like it was a team effort, but at times you notice that Favel doesn’t seem to care for Rebecca as much as Mrs Danvers does. The blackmail in itself shows that his interests existed in other areas, whereas Mrs Danvers would never accept blackmail, for her love for Rebecca was stronger than that.

He didn't sleep with his wife before his confession because he was so bottled up, afraid of losing the composure he worked so hard to build after murdering Rebecca that he might break down, confess to his wife and lose the only woman he's ever truly loved. Just because a man has feminine qualities, doesn't mean he's gay. Olivier was feminine and a huge ladies man. He had all consuming passion for Vivien Leigh until her illness tore them both apart. Rebecca was a cruel personality; imagine you get married to a beautiful woman, she's charming and lovely towards you and you're the envy of everyone but in reality, she's mean, cruel and thinks its hilarious because in private she refuses to touch you and laughs because the life she really has with you is the opposite and you can't tell anyone or leave no matter what you do.

However she was now gone, but at least he could crush Maxim with the truth of her death, getting the last word on all the disgust Maxim had for him. Maxim would rot in prison and be seen as just as lowly of a person as Favel felt himself to be. But he couldn't even see that through because Maxim found coincidence to be on his side & as such, was still winning...but didn't deserve to.

The book constantly describes her with a skull's face.

They looked for no less clues to bring up this theory than I have about Maxim. It's misogynistic to weigh one over the other. The real life Laurence Olivier was no Maxim de Winter. He made it quite apparent that he was jealous of women. Marilyn Monroe, Vivien Leigh, Jill Esmond (his first wife) and countless others. His homosexual pursuits are well-backed by people like David Niven and reporters. They all can't be lying. But the world denies it. Just like they deny Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great and Achilles had homosexual relationships. If they don't deny it, they pretend like it never happened. Danny had no clue about Rebecca's true relationship with Maxim. Rebecca falsely led her believe that both Maxim and Frank Crawley were also madly in love with her.

That being said, one of the big underlying issues in *Rebecca* is that of social class -- the middle-class American narrator has married into an upper-middle-class British setting and has absolutely no idea how to deal with the expectations around her new role.  The book focuses all of this through her obsession with Rebecca as the perfect first wife, so I think it can be hard to see, but there are actual skills & experiences that she's lacking due to the difference in their social backgrounds, and I think the reader is meant to understand that she doesn't want to ask Maxim for help because she doesn't want to remind him of where she came from.  

In the real world, some wealthy American women who wanted to succeed in upper-class British society in this time period (between the two world wars) would hire aristocratic-but-poor British women to teach them how to throw parties, decorate their homes, wear the proper clothes, answer their letters, etc etc -- all the stuff our narrator needs to figure out how to do that gets turned into 'I'm not as good as Rebecca'.",changeableLandscape,2021-01-14T23:51:58Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1

To me, the best/creepiest moment was when >!Maxim reveals that he killed Rebecca and starts tryin' to get all frisky with our narrator--GROSS. Even worse? She is basically thrilled. :O :O :O!<

But truly there is a lot to unpack with the novel.

I mean, it could be described as a psychological thriller for sure, and it does have great twists, but it is so much more than that and one of my favorite works of literature.

ETA: One way to go into more depth with the novel is to consider how the only things we ever hear about Rebecca are filtered; we have no direct experience of her. It's all, Mrs. Danvers-said, Maxim-said, narrator-feels-like. And then considering the narrator is never named. She's telling us her story, but what do you call her? The second Mrs. DeWinter?

I think that's because I identify quite a bit with the main character (in terms of psychology, not circumstance), and found her stream-of-conscious narration very moving and impactful. I've never read another character like her. Also, I really value beautiful prose and atmospheric settings, and *Rebecca* has that in spades. 

I thought the general outline of the two big twists—that >!Maxim hadn't loved Rebecca but had killed her!<—was fairly easy to see coming (then again, I went in knowing it had been adapted by Hitchcock and so was expecting something crazy). 

However, once Maxim admits this to Mrs. de Winters...the rest of the novel is like watching a car crash in slow motion. >!She finds out he murdered his *pregnant wife*, and she's happy because that means he ""loves"" her??! (""Loves"" being in the biggest scare quotes possible, because the giant red flags present since the beginning of their relationship should have turned into a giant, flashing, Vegas-style sign at this point. He doesn't love her; he's just glad he can control her thanks to the massive power imbalance in their relationship.) Truly, it's like a horror movie: I kept wanting her to run, and she just didn't. She never even *thinks* about leaving. And so, even though things turned out technically all right in the end, she's left stuck in a miserable marriage traveling from hotel to hotel trying to pretend she's happy.

l7yynk_1,l7yynk,"I think Rebecca has the last laugh. In destroying the home (through her henchwoman, acting out of her memory) she’s taken away the most integral part of Max’s identity. Taking Manderlay stops max from moving forward with his new wife, love notwithstanding. Rebecca made herself immortal by taking Manderlay with her. This is why I think Daphne gives Rebecca a name, and makes it so iconic, while the protagonist is left nameless. She’s the new Mrs. de Winter but eternally she’ll never be Rebecca. IDK if you watched the new Netflix adaptation but I think the little blip they added on the end highlights that both max and wife are cursed to roaming and using each other to try to forget but they’ll forever be haunted by what they lost, and that’s Rebecca’s doing.

Rochester didn't murder his wife, he just hid her away so that he could move on to the much younger, isolated Jane.

I would say that the similarity is more that these men targeted girls who were very quite alike. Totally isolated, mild, without family, and very manipulatable. So sure enough, their manipulations work at the end, the girls belong to them in the way their previous wives didn't.

kuyxfx_6,kuyxfx,"That's a... pretty different interpretation than the ones I've heard. Yes, neither Rochester nor Maxim were perfect, they're both typical Byronic grey characters, but they're also very different characters, and so are Jane and Rebecca's protagonist. But describing them as nothing more than manipulated victims does them disservice. And I wouldn't call either Rochester or Maxim ""evil"", they were both victims of their circumstances too.

Well, Rochester a lot more. He was deceived by his wife's family who apparently wanted to profit from a good marriage with a wealthy man by pretty much selling their mentally ill daughter away, who was apparently very aggressive and abusive too, even if she couldn't help it. Rochester could have sent her to some asylum (where she'd have been treated horribly, since proper mental health treatment wasn't a thing in 19th century) but he chose instead to take care of her. He also took in that girl his ex-lover sent her, even though he doubted she was his. I don't think he can be called a bad person relative to the time he lived in. He didn't plan on seducing his governess, on the contrary, he wasn't exactly nice to her at first. I'm not defending him lying about having a wife, but like I said, in those circumstances it's a bit different.

And Jane was no vicrim, she was very intelligent, and chose what in her mind was the right thing and left him. She only returned to him years later, out of her own will.

In Maxim's case, of course murdering your wife isn't defensible, and his new wife really was a naive girl who had no prospects in life so she married the first man who could give her a good name and some status. But she did grow up a lot. Maxim's case was being trapped in a fucked up marriage with an abusive wife who gaslit the fuck out of him, and in her final moments she practically goaded him into killing her. She knew she has cancer, and she wanted to die, so she told Maxim what became the final straw - implied she was pregnant with a child that wasn't his and that this child will one day inherit Manderley and ""ruin it"".",lynx_and_nutmeg,2021-01-12T21:37:21Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,6
kuyxfx_7,kuyxfx,"I agree with you. I never thought of either Rochester Or Maxim de Winter as abusive. and truth is they never treated anyone badly, I mean yes they are both moody and abrupt some times, but have no intention of hurting people. and I'm pretty sure they were both truly taken by their young brides, being fresh and maybe naïve yes, because there is probably no evil in being naïve.

Jane in particular is a very clever girl, able to answer Rochester back and contradict him in many occasions, and that's why he falls for her and in reality Jane never went easy on him, she could have stayed there as a mistress if he was that much of a manipulative man, but she didn't, she had a strong will that one. and Rochester did try a lot and he was a mess after she left him. and I think Rochester was always kind to her, except maybe their first meeting when his horse fell, but still I would never call him abusive, maybe sarcastic.

as for the girl in Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter, she may not be as strong as Jane, but she is fun to be with and Maxim wants her in his life, and he is fascinated with her, and takes her with him to Manderley and marries her when he could have just left her to go to America. I understand that it takes more time for him to express his feelings to her, and she is not sure that he loves her for a long time, but I don't know If I can blame him, he's been through hell. and I would never thought of that girl as pathetic, she claims what's hers and in a very strong way.",upside_down1983,2021-01-13T07:20:21Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,7

A reading of Rebecca as the villain plays into the sexism that was present in the time of du Maurier’s writing. I agree that from Maxim’s account it appears that Rebecca was a vile creature, but that’s just the point. It was Maxim’s account that painted Rebecca in that way.

And the scraps she told Maxim's new wife about Rebecca certainly didn't paint her in a good light either - torturing a horse into submission and revelling in it being injured, something she said about hating all men, etc. That mentally challenged guy in the beach shed seemed terrified of her. And Frank too seemed very uncomfortable and scared at the very mention of her, because she apparently harassed him. I really don't think not wanting your wife to cheat with multiple men, including your own staff, equals ""controlling her"". In his own words, Maxim sort of tolerated it as long as she kept her affairs discreet, he only confronted her when she grew careless and brought them closer to home.

Seemed to me like this was a classic case of gaslighting - Rebecca was a talented socopath who was very good at pretending to be charming and making people love her, but a completely different person in reality.",lynx_and_nutmeg,2021-01-13T11:47:31Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,9

jgxl7f_1,jgxl7f,"I would argue that u/LorenzoApophis has a point - however, one would need to add some information.

If I remember correctly -

1. Rebecca and Maxim had a ""deal"" - she would be the charming wife and he'd turn an eye to her affairs as long as she didn't bring them to Manderley. She broke this promise (brought men to Manderley) and rubbed salt in his wound that their marriage was a sham. What was her incentive to do that except to hurt Maxim? 
2. She went after Frank, his house keeper and, if I remember correctly, after her sister-in-law's husband Giles to the point that Frank wanted to quit and Beatrice & Giles never came to Manderley while she was alive. As far as I understood, we never see hints that she was seriously interested in either men, e.g. in love. 
3. She taunted Max into killing her - I don't defend him killing her. I'd just like to point out that she could have committed suicide in a thousand different ways. Instead, she intentionally taunted Max by saying that Manderley (his pride) would be inherited by another man's child. She knew how to hit and how to hurt.

I agree with ""living her best live."" I can agree with ""playing the game and taking control of her life at a time when it was difficult for women to do so"". I don't agree with hurting others (see list above) as Rebecca was doing. I might feel more sympathy towards her, if I could see inside her head and find out her motivations - e.g. in ""Les liasons dangereuses"", t>!he villainess describes that she started to jab herself with a fork during meals while smiling because of the strict conditions women had to live under. I applauded her for having lovers and letting them know that she had blackmail material so that they could never boast of having slept with her. However, all this went out of the window when she went after the 17-year old, naive Cecile who had done nothing at all to harm her and who literally posed no threat.

jgxl7f_3,jgxl7f,"Dusting off this older thread now that the movie is out on Netflix and I just watched it. 

What I have always found befuddling (and fascinating) about the novel is that du Maurier could have been making a feminist point, or the exact opposite. No one really knows, but the fact that it was written in 1938 means it was likely deliberately one or the other.

The two women in the story perfectly embody the angel and whore archetypes that have pervaded every story ever told about women. Rebecca is accomplished and lives life on her own terms; because of that she must also be promiscuous, subversive, manipulative, deeply disrespectful to her husband, somewhat mentally unstable… all the things men despise and women warn other women not to be. Our protagonist is the angel. She follows traditional gender rules, yet we are expected to side with her as she breaks legal ones (aiding a murderer) and stands by an objectively violent man who murdered a woman he couldn’t control. Like all angel archetypes, she is kind and optimistic and naïve, but controllable and almost stupid in her willingness to shape her life and identity around a man. Not just any man, but a wealthy and influential one who overpowers her in every way that mattered in 1938. She needs him, and is a “good” woman. Rebecca didn’t, and is a “bad” one.

What I’ve never understood is, is the author laying these archetypes out as a commentary, or is she telling a gothic romance story the way most people in 1938 would have told it? The mystery is what makes the story so compelling, and valid today. Women’s power and place have been sources of controversy forever, her value to society subjective in a way that a man’s is not. The story ultimately asks what it means to be a “good” woman, and does it come at the cost of brilliance? Many women today would say yes… but then we’re not out there cheating on our husbands :)",kaelidoscoped,2023-08-12T01:00:37Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,3
jgxl7f_4,jgxl7f,"You’re totally right, Rebecca was definitely all too prepared to sacrifice everything and everyone to get what she wanted. She was a master manipulator and it’s safe to say she was shrewd and selfish. 

However I also can’t look past the fact that she possesses many qualities which men in that time might have possessed, and did many things that men of that time and status might have done without exactly the same consequences (selfish, controlling, extremely intelligent, kept lovers, arguably open about her own sexuality). So I can’t help but think that the author may have flipped these gender stereotypes on their head by associating them with Rebecca and juxtaposing them with the traditional, subdued version of femininity as represented by wife 2 (which the reader is arguably led to prefer). And if that’s true, is the author saying that these types of qualities will always be abhorrent in a woman? Or is it simply a criticism of her nonexistent morals?

I guess what I’m trying to say is that when I read Rebecca for the first time I hated her because I read the book whilst scrutinising her as a person. But the second time, I find myself sympathising with her because of what she represents. But at the same time, I totally get your point!

nw3jn4_1,nw3jn4,"I agree with what everyone else has said here, plus you have to talk about Manderley. This is Maxim's ancestral estate, that he loves, and his identity is tied up in it. It was for Manderley that he kept silent through his marriage to Rebecca, and all of her affairs, and didn't try to divorce her--because that would have caused a scandal, which would have brought disrepute on both his family name and also the estate itself, which is a physical embodiment of that name and family heritage. Rebecca simultaneously brings Manderley into a greater state of beauty and repute than ever before, and she pollutes it. Because Manderley is Maxim, in a real way, he has also been polluted, sold his soul for the sake of reputation and pride. Until he ends up killing her, which was the only way he could both keep his reputation and get rid of Rebecca.

When Maxim meets the girl, they are in Europe. They're away from Manderley, he probably feels free, and he falls in love with this girl who is in every way the opposite of his psychotic wife. He thinks that by marrying her he can begin again, he can make his life pure and fresh and innocent, and wipe away the stain of his marriage to Rebecca and everything that it entails. But, of course, he can't--because as long as they stay in Europe, they're just sort of playing house, pretending. Once he actually takes her back, then he finds that Rebecca is not really gone. She is everywhere at Manderley, and now the beautiful estate that used to be his home and his pride and refuge is instead a constant reminder of his own guilt, of all the awful things that took place there. He thought by killing Rebecca, he could keep everything good about Manderley and get rid of the bad, but that's just not the case. This is why Manderley has to burn down at the end. As long as it existed, it would continue to be the reminder of Maxim's terrible marriage to Rebecca, just as Maxim himself has been seared and forever changed. There is no Manderley without Rebecca anymore, just as there is no Maxim without Rebecca. The only way forward is through destruction--a total destruction of the house, but also of Maxim's existing life, his sense of identity and his place in the world. That's the way they're able to make a real marriage and relationship, too, not as the girl coming into his life and trying to fit into it, but as both of them making a new life together, from scratch.",Far-Adagio4032,2021-06-09T20:34:02Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1

nw3jn4_3,nw3jn4,"Yes he's a good character, and as such he acts like a real person, and real people are often deeply troubled and flawed, especially if they have had miserable trauma in their lives. Let's keep in mind that we are talking about someone who murdered his first wife. Regardless of the fact that she was abusive and toyed with him, she was a terrible manipulative person. But still, he suffered through that abuse and manipulation, then killed her, then hid her body, then spent years covering up this fact, hiding it. That's gonna mess you up!

Yes he likes our unnamed protagonist because she represents, to him, an option for redemption. She's innocent and open-hearted, and he finds that refreshing, wishes to feel real love again. But as we've already seen, he's a messed up guy. The great tragedy of their personal romance is that she is able to redeem him, give him a second chance in life, but it requires her to lose that innocence and go through heartbreak of her own. By the end, they are more equal and his past is burned away.

As for him not behaving rationally, yes of course not. He's a person. But what he's thinking- like many controling people, he's afraid of losing something (his innocent sweet wife) and so he controls her to try to prevent that loss. He's also defending himself against his own trauma- remember he's an abuse survivor who is hiding the fact that he killed his wife. Obviously he's going to have all sorts of maladaptive ways to defend himself against that.

The confession is the first step towards his redemption and her maturity. You can't have experience without loss of innocence, and you can't have redemption without confession. They dovetail and it changes their marriage. She becomes his partner and confidant at that point. Before it, yes he was the authority and she was basically childlike. Before that, their relationship was on the terms of him saving her from poverty, him bringing her like a princess to his castle, him controling her. Afterwards, they are partners and depend on one another. She helps him with the trial and shares his burden, but it means he has to face who he is and lose his little pet.

I love Rebecca, but it's basically a rip-off and modern version of Bronte's Jane Eyre (which I also love), and the story-lines are in some ways exactly the same.

And she's more concerned with the relief that Maxim didn't love Rebecca than she is with the fact that he killed her! Jealousy and insecurity can really warp your mind. I love this book, but those two are made for each other!  


That's why I think it would be cool to see the story told in a new version. The obvious thing to do would be to make Rebecca and Danvers lovers, make Maxim really pissed off that his wife is a lesbian. But that's too obvious and melodramatic. I'm sure some clever imaginative person could really put a better spin on it. The source material is there- the relationship with the cousin is left open enough that anything could've happened, we know little about Rebecca except what a seemingly perfect socialite she was.",,2021-06-09T19:57:05Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,11
nw3jn4_12,nw3jn4,"Yes some people compare them as a criticism, but I think they are both brilliant books, even if Jane Eyre came first. I love DuMaurier- Don't Look Now is one of my faves, short story not novel though. There's also a great film version of that too. Hitchcock's The Birds was also loosely based on one of her stories. She's really good at that freaky dreamy somethings-going-on atmosphere.

If you want to stay generally in the Jane Eyre world, Wide Sargasso Sea is a good spin on it, a prequel that tells the story of Rochester's first wife, Bertha, written by Jean Rhys who is a brilliant novelist in her own right. I don't know if anyone has done the same with Rebecca, but I'd love to read a novel that tells her story from her point of view!",,2021-06-09T19:42:23Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,12

I’d read passages of her overthinking things or having what are basically anxiety attacks and I’d think to myself “Hey, I do the exact same things”. When I got to the part where she finally broke out of her shell and became a strong and confident woman in her own right I thought “Things are going to get better in my life. I just need to do what she did and embrace my true self”. The scene where Mrs. Danvers tries to coerce her into committing suicide brought back a lot of unpleasant memories and the whole time I kept yelling at the book telling the poor narrator to run out of that room before she did something she’d regret. Hell, even the time in a bottle concept was something I’d fantasize about when I was younger. There were so many moments where I joked to myself about how Daphne du Maurier knew I was going to be born 60 or so years after ‘Rebecca’ was written and wrote it because time travel.

Too often, writing advice leads to the concept that your lead character must be strong. They can be terribly flawed, but if they're a weak person, they won't grab a reader's interest. 

I think of Rebecca when I see that sort of advice. Because, done correctly, a weak character as a lead can still create compelling literature. It is the care of the craft that leads it to being such a good book.

6e7lh0_8,6e7lh0,"Hi Rebecca,

I loved your account of Henrietta Lacks, and the way you covered both the science and the human aspects of Henrietta and the Lacks family.

Most science reporting today glorifies advances in medical technology. The dark side of institutional medical practice, such as the enormous number of injuries and deaths resulting from medical care, or how tremendous pressures from the commercialization of care have led to emphasis on numbers from lab tests (in practice and in medical education) over the traditional healing relationship in which a doctor appreciates the patient in front of her as a person.

Also, there seems little acknowledgment among science writers and press of the remarkable healing abilities within the human beings.

Norman Doidge has broken the ice with his best selling books on neuroplasticity and healing in *The Brain that Changes Itself* and *The Brain's Way of Healing*.

Stephen Porges begins to address how healing grows out of a social context, and the brain's social engagement mechanisms in his book *The Polyvagal Theory*.

What is your vision of the future of the way we care for people in need? Do you see a role for complementary medicine? Will modern medicine recognize the role of the human element in a way that is more than lip service? ",,2017-05-30T16:30:07Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,8

6e7lh0_12,6e7lh0,"Thanks for this question -- this is something that comes up often, and I feel it's very important to clarify.  Students often assume that since they can't imagine how I got the facts in that scene (or others I didn't witness first hand) that I must have made them up.  The short answer is yes, this reporting for this scene started with something that was documented in her medical records.  

I've answered this broad question, and also walked through how I reported that  scene above specifically on the FAQ page of my website here: http://rebeccaskloot.com/faq/#questions-writingimmortal (it's the first question under the heading of ""Questions On Writing The Immortal Life..."").  

As for whether I hesitated to include this in the book, absolutely not.  As I said in response to a question below, Deborah always said she felt very strongly that it was important to tell what she called “the good and the bad” of the family story — the violence, the sexually transmitted diseases, the abuse, and everything else — because it’s all part of the story of what happened when the world got Henrietta’s cells and her family lost Henrietta as a mother. And of course, Henrietta’s cancer was caused by one sexually transmitted disease (HPV), and made more aggressive by another (syphilis) — those details are an essential part of any story about the HeLa cells. And the story of Henrietta finding the tumor herself is an essential part of her story:  It really shows what a strong and wise woman she was. She knew something was wrong, and she did a self examination to find it, then demanded medical care for it.  That's an important lesson for every woman to learn from. 

As a side note, a mother in Tennessee tried to get the book banned from local high schools by saying that scene was pornographic.

So my list of other titles in my proposal was more about explaining how I was going to do all of that.  Saying things like, Content-wise it's like X book, but style wise more like X book.  The only ""competitive"" title I had to list for my proposal was A Conspiracy of Cells, which was written decades earlier and was a totally different book (and was, in fact, something I wrote about in my book as part of the family's story). So I simply explained that briefly and that was it.  I didn't have to make much of an argument about competitive books because there weren't any.  

I read a lot of proposals by other writers to understand what the form was supposed to look like.  Good luck!",RebeccaSkloot,2017-05-30T15:14:39Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,13
6e7lh0_14,6e7lh0,"Thanks!  So glad you've been following me on Twitter -- it was so incredible to watch the way social media embraced the story of Henrietta and the book and helped me get it out to the world. I'm forever grateful for that.  As for what it's like to see someone play you on screen.  Surreal, for sure!  I've talked quite a bit about that in interviews - you can read a bit about that here: http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a44697/rose-byrne-rebecca-skloot-immortal-life-henrietta-lacks/ 

You can also listen to me and Rose Byrne talk about it in this podcast called: “What It’s Like to Have Someone Play You on TV” (my conversation with Rose starts at time stamp 19:58) https://megaphone.link/PP6117624459 ",RebeccaSkloot,2017-05-30T15:19:48Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,14
6e7lh0_15,6e7lh0,"Thanks!  Henrietta's daughter Deborah struggled a lot with questions about what it meant for Henrietta's cells to be immortal when the rest of her had died, whether that had any impact on her and her ability to rest in peace in the afterlife.  But she really came to terms with a lot of that through learning about the cells.  Today the Lacks family spends a lot of time talking about how proud they are of the cells and all the good they've done for the world; their issues are more with the ethics of how the story unfolded -- the lack of consent, the fact that her children, and then grand children, were repeatedly used in research without their consent as well.

About undiagnosed autism/autism spectrum disorder/aspergers, if you haven't read Neurotribes by Steve Silberman yet, it sounds like something you might like to know about: http://stevesilberman.com/book/neurotribes/ ... I'm deep into working on my next book now, which in some ways touches on similar questions about science raised in The Immortal Life -- what's the cost of science, and the benefit, and where do you draw the line between the two. For this next book I'm going back to an early passion of mine (which I alluded to in a few answers above) about animals and science. I'm in a part of the process where it's still hard to fully explain it, but it will be a similar book in terms of reading like a story with characters and scenes and such, and being about a complex are of science filled with ethical questions that many don't understand or know about.

6e7lh0_18,6e7lh0,"Thanks for the kind words and for teaching Henrietta's story!  So glad to hear this.  And congratulations on the new job.  The one thing I like teachers to know is that I've put together a detailed page of my website with info and special features for students (I strongly recommend all students listen to the RadioLab episode linked there).  I put this together in part because I get so many requests to talk to classrooms, I can't do them all.  So this page answers a lot of the frequently asked questions, and also provides lots of added resources:  http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/teaching/

As for the book's takeaway, I don't have just one. Here's a bit on that from the FAQ page of my site, where you can find lots more info:  What people take away depends in part on each individual reader, because there are a lot of potential messages from the book: it’s about trust, race and medicine, class, access to education and health care, it’s also the story of a family and the impact that losing a mother can have on her children, and much more.  It’s also about the fact that there are people behind every one of the billions of biological samples that are used in research every day. I can’t count the number of e-mails I’ve gotten from researchers who say that they heard me talking on the radio or read the book and had this very powerful reaction of saying “Oh wow, I had no idea. I did my dissertation on HeLa cells, I work with them every day in my lab—I owe a lot of my career to Henrietta’s cells, and I never once stopped to think about where they came from, whether she had given consent, or whether her family might care about that.” These are questions that scientists don’t often think about. I also hear researchers saying that after learning the story of the HeLa cells, they no longer complain about the regulation of science and the mountains of forms they have to fill out for every study they want to do. In the book, you find out the history behind those forms, why they’re now required, and why it is important. Those are crucial take-home messages.

But this is also a story about the fact that there are human beings behind every biological sample in a laboratory, and behind every scientist as well. The scientists in the HeLa story have long been demonized in ways that weren’t factually accurate, so I hoped to set that record straight.",RebeccaSkloot,2017-05-30T15:42:53Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,18
6e7lh0_19,6e7lh0,"Well, the best advice is just to start writing in some ways.  But for me, I have to have a road map, which is what keeps me on track. I'm a big believer in really planning out the structure of my stories (I use index cards), which helps me stay focused.  But you do have to let yourself follow tangents to some degree, because they can often lead to important parts of the story that need to be included.  When I find myself ""drifting"" into a tangent that's not part of what I intended to write about, I will stop myself and write a note saying SHOULD I TELL THE STORY OF X HERE? Then I will stop and leave that as a note to myself and go back to where I was planning to go.  Then in reading it later, I will often see that note and be like, Nope, you definitely didn't need to do that here. Or sometimes, yes, you do.  If I really feel like I need to write that tangent out, I'd do it in a separate document titled X TANGENT or whatever, so I have it to use if it ends up being necessary (in part because those tangents can often just lead to whole other new stories for the future rather than being needed for the current project).  But I don't let myself go too far down those paths until I know it's something that might be useful.

6e7lh0_20,6e7lh0,"""How do you kind of navigate that line to do good for science (and all of us, since we all benefit) while causing the least harm possible?""

Thank you Rebecca for penning down this thought which I had as well in my mind. I am a budding molecular biologist in training, and I struggle with many issues knowing that me and my colleagues are culturing cells harvested from unknown patients in the lab, and extracting DNA information from those cells, adding drugs to them and gather data for our experiments, without paying patients anything in return and no interaction whatsoever. There are even larger database project going on to recruit ""volunteers"" to collect more biological data, especially in this big data industry. The scale is larger than HeLa (just originated from a person). It is unstoppable. What is your opinion on this ?

Also, how long did it take for you to go from that initial 16 years old thought to start researching for writing and eventually publish your book on HeLa?",zingpompom,2017-05-30T15:31:43Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,20

rehz1l_1,rehz1l,"You speed read *Rebecca* so much that you thought the narrator, who doesn't enter the story until a year or so after Rebecca's death, was her murderer?

Maybe slow down and read some of the words next time?",HugoNebula,2021-12-12T11:24:16Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,1
rehz1l_2,rehz1l,"*Rebecca* is my favorite novel!

>!I have a lot of both sympathy and empathy for the narrator (and ever so slightly for Maxim too, albeit to a *much* lesser extent), but they're both terrible people. Maxim is an unrepentant murderer who deserved to be penalized for what he did, and the narrator is essentially an after-the-fact accomplice who showed herself to be morally bankrupt. Rebecca was awful, yes, (well, at least as Maxim tells it—I'm inclined to believe him, but to say he's not entirely reliable in the subject is an understatement) but she didn't deserve to be murdered.!<

>!In short, I was rooting for the narrator the entire time but was ultimately disappointed in her that she never did the right thing and turned her husband in. As it turns out, it seems like they're both miserable in the end, anyway, so Rebecca got her way after all—a bit of poetic justice.!<",jefrye,2021-12-12T11:22:18Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Rebecca,2

rehz1l_4,rehz1l,"Haha no. I knew there was a murder in the story, didn't know it was Rebecca that was murdered. I thought the narrator would kill someone like Maxim or Mrs. Darvis. I really believed Rebecca had drowned.

rehz1l_5,rehz1l,"Well, turning Maxim in would have given Rebecca victory, as that was her intention all along i.e. to frame him for her death. It would also have destroyed the narrator's life.

rehz1l_6,rehz1l,"The more I think about the whole story, after finishing it, the more I realize how well it was thought out and executed. Someone from an older discussion thread I read had said how usually the narrator in books tend to be our protagonist  and are written as strong characters. But here we (me, personally speaking) attributed the narrator as the protagonist as a force of habjt and didn't even realize how weak or unhealthy her personality was until I heard a third party point it out.

I was also thinking after the fact how there is no sound morally and ethically speaking main/supporting characters in the story. The narrator, Maxim, and Rebecca all have huge flaws. Even Mrs. Danvers or Frank weren't there without questionable personalities. I think I will have to go with team Jasper next time I read it I have to pick sides.
