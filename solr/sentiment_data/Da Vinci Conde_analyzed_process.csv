>Brown prefaces his novel with a page titled ""Fact"" asserting that certain elements in the novel are true in reality, and a page at his website repeats these ideas and others.[5] In the early publicity for the novel, Dan Brown made repeated assertions that, while the novel is a work of fiction, the historical information in it is all accurate and well-researched. For example:

>**Martin Savidge: When we talk about da Vinci and your book, how much is true and how much is fabricated in your storyline?**

>**Dan Brown: 99 percent of it is true. All of the architecture, the art, the secret rituals, the history, all of that is true, the Gnostic gospels. All of that is … all that is fiction, of course, is that there's a Harvard symbologist named Robert Langdon, and all of his action is fictionalized. But the background is all true.[6]**

>**Matt Lauer: How much of this is based on reality in terms of things that actually occurred?**

>**Dan Brown: Absolutely all of it. Obviously, there are—Robert Langdon is fictional, but all of the art, architecture, secret rituals, secret societies, all of that is historical fact.[7]**

There never would have been much of an uproar about his work if he hadn't gone and claimed his conspiracy theories were all totally rooted in fact. It was so bad that we now have the term ""[Dan Browned](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned)"" named after him.

pnzopm_1,pnzopm,"When ""The Da Vinci Code"" came out, much of its notoriety arose from its repeated claims of ""truth"". Brown was asked in various media about this, and he always affirmed the ridiculous, religious conspiracy theories that form the backbone of this otherwise routine airport thriller (the hero runs breathlessly from crime to crime uncovering mystery after mystery, etc.). At my job, the only question co-workers asked me about this book (because I'm familiar with actual history, religion and art) was, "" Is this stuff really true??!!??""  Really, it's all bogus. And from what I understand, even the real-world geography is wrong. Even the the word ""symbology"" (Langdon's alleged academic field) is a dumbed-down rendition of the actual field of ""semiotics"" (see Eco''s 'Foucault's Pendulum' for a much better-informed conspiracy thriller).

Firstly, it's very badly written. The language isn't expressive or interesting, neither is it punchy and impactful.

Secondly, the characters are pretty non existent: each character is difficult to describe except by their job and some base elements of physical description. No-one has a personality.

Thirdly, the book reads like a travelogue. Every location is introduced with what reads like text lifted from a tourist brochure.

Fourthly, events happen which stretch credibility far too far. I have known since I was a kid about Da Vinci's mirror writing. I am not the world's foremost Da Vinci expert. Yet, it takes the experts in the book ages to think of it when it should be instantly recognisable to them. This is an example - there are many others.

Fifthly, the framing device (claiming the book tells only the truth) is obvious bollocks and very insulting to the reader as well as potentially misleading to the most naïve.

Sixthly, the conspiracy theory at the heart of the book waa stolen from Holy Blood, Holy Grail. I don't mind a little theft in a good book, but this isn't a good book, so it's another negative.

Ron Howard, Felicity Jones, Tom Hanks and Dan Brown pose at the Inferno photocall CREDIT: Action Press/REX/Shutterstock  
As the film adaptation of Dan Brown's fourth Robert Langdon novel, Inferno, is released, we present this appreciation of the author by Michael Deacon from 2013.  
Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house – and immediately he felt angry. Most people would have thought that the 48-year-old man had no reason to be angry. After all, the famous writer had a new book coming out. But that was the problem. A new book meant an inevitable attack on the rich novelist by the wealthy wordsmith’s fiercest foes. The critics.  
Renowned author Dan Brown hated the critics. Ever since he had become one of the world’s top renowned authors they had made fun of him. They had mocked bestselling book The Da Vinci Code, successful novel Digital Fortress, popular tome Deception Point, money-spinning volume Angels & Demons and chart-topping work of narrative fiction The Lost Symbol.  
The critics said his writing was clumsy, ungrammatical, repetitive and repetitive. They said it was full of unnecessary tautology. They said his prose was mired in a sea of mixed metaphors. For some reason they found something funny in sentences such as “His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack.” They even say my books are packed with banal and superfluous description, thought the 5ft 9in man. He particularly hated it when they said his imagery was nonsensical. It made his insect eyes flash like a rocket.  
Dan Brown's 20 worst sentences  
Renowned author Dan Brown got out of his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house and paced the bedroom, using the feet located at the ends of his two legs to propel him forwards. He knew he shouldn’t care what a few jealous critics thought. His new book Inferno was coming out on Tuesday, and the 480-page hardback published by Doubleday with a recommended US retail price of $29.95 was sure to be a hit. Wasn’t it?  
I’ll call my agent, pondered the prosperous scribe. He reached for the telephone using one of his two hands. “Hello, this is renowned author Dan Brown,” spoke renowned author Dan Brown. “I want to talk to literary agent John Unconvincingname.”  
“Mr Unconvincingname, it’s renowned author Dan Brown,” told the voice at the other end of the line. Instantly the voice at the other end of the line was replaced by a different voice at the other end of the line. “Hello, it’s literary agent John Unconvincingname,” informed the new voice at the other end of the line.  
“Hello agent John, it’s client Dan,” commented the pecunious scribbler. “I’m worried about new book Inferno. I think critics are going to say it’s badly written.""  
The voice at the other end of the line gave a sigh, like a mighty oak toppling into a great river, or something else that didn’t sound like a sigh if you gave it a moment’s thought. “Who cares what the stupid critics say?” advised the literary agent. “They’re just snobs. You have millions of fans.”  
That’s true, mused the accomplished composer of thrillers that combined religion, high culture and conspiracy theories. His books were read by everyone from renowned politician President Obama to renowned musician Britney Spears. It was said that a copy of The Da Vinci Code had even found its way into the hands of renowned monarch the Queen. He was grateful for his good fortune, and gave thanks every night in his prayers to renowned deity God.  
“Think of all the money you’ve made,” recommended the literary agent. That was true too. The thriving ink-slinger’s wealth had allowed him to indulge his passion for great art. Among his proudest purchases were a specially commissioned landscape by acclaimed painter Vincent van Gogh and a signed first edition by revered scriptwriter William Shakespeare.  
Renowned author Dan Brown smiled, the ends of his mouth curving upwards in a physical expression of pleasure. He felt much better. If your books brought innocent delight to millions of readers, what did it matter whether you knew the difference between a transitive and an intransitive verb?  
“Thanks, John,” he thanked. Then he put down the telephone and perambulated on foot to the desk behind which he habitually sat on a chair to write his famous books on an Apple iMac MD093B/A computer. New book Inferno, the latest in his celebrated series about fictional Harvard professor Robert Langdon, was inspired by top Italian poet Dante. It wouldn’t be the last in the lucrative sequence, either. He had all the sequels mapped out. The Mozart Acrostic. The Michelangelo Wordsearch. The Newton Sudoku.  
The 190lb adult male human being nodded his head to indicate satisfaction and returned to his bedroom by walking there. Still asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was beautiful wife Mrs Brown. Renowned author Dan Brown gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette’s blonde tresses, flowing from her head like a stream but made from hair instead of water and without any fish in. She was as majestic as the finest sculpture by Caravaggio or the most coveted portrait by Rodin. I like the attractive woman, thought the successful man.  
Perhaps one day, inspired by beautiful wife Mrs Brown, he would move into romantic poetry, like market-leading British rhymester John Keats.That would be good, opined the talented person, and got back into the luxurious four-poster bed.

2. Brown was heavily ""inspired"" by (ie, he stole ideas from) ""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"" by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh and ""Foucault's Pendulum"" by Umberto Eco. He even went so far as to name the character Leigh Teabing as an anagram of ""Baigent Leigh.""

3. As others have mentioned in other comments, the book got WAY too much praise for being mediocre at best. While that's not Brown's fault, it still rubs me the wrong way that better books got less attention because The Da Vinci Code sucked all the air out of the room at the time.

That novel seems like a bizarre little offshoot of Foucault’s Pendulum.

The author, Dan Brown, is a character from Foucault’s Pendulum! I invented him. He shares my characters’ fascinations—the world conspiracy of Rosicrucians, Masons, and Jesuits. The role of the Knights Templar. The hermetic secret. The principle that everything is connected. I suspect Dan Brown might not even exist.

I am so *not* the intended audience for thrillers, but, let me tell you, I must only be attracted to women who like thrillers.  So, I’ve read and watched more than my fair share of this shit.  If you think you’ve found a book with an artful command of language, you’ve accidentally found your way right out of the genre.

I’m convinced that one famous parody isn’t really a Dan Brown parody - it’s a parody of the way the entire thriller audience understands the world.  You really can’t use more artful language in a thriller because a thriller is an utterly artless portrayal of humans from beginning to end.  That just doesn’t suit me, but I guess it does suit forward, hard working, athletic, super foxy women with enormous smiles, flashes of cold anger, and always erect nipples.

Back to Dan Brown, in interviews he’s actually super generous with insight about his own work.  One thing he commits to, and it shows, is a steadfast pledge to honor all the “promises” he makes to the audience throughout the story.  All that suspense is what brings the thriller readers to the books in the first place, and it’s shocking how egregiously most authors trample on their trust.  Dan Brown always delivers, and he always delivers on time.  His pacing is flawless.  He never tortures you for buying into one of his hooks.

I had an absolute blast reading the Da Vinci Code.  I could never really stomach another one, because they just aren’t meant for me, and that’s that.  But, I really appreciated how much he respected his reader, and how much fun he wanted the reader to have.",Monnok,2021-09-14T23:26:43Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,22

But one of the puzzles in the book is solved when the protagonists (ostensibly art and da Vinci experts) discover that what seems like a strange, alien script is actually (gasp!) *mirror writing*. 

Even much younger me knew that da Vinci routinely wrote in mirror writing.

1r8em8_7,1r8em8,"Hello Mr. Brown.

I have read several of your books, including the Da Vinci Code, which I enjoyed for the post part.  My only problem is that I have albinism and reading about your character Silas was very upsetting for me.  Portraying people with albinism as evil, unstable murderers is playing right into a negative stereotype, and some of Silas's abilities in particular are inaccurate.  Because of my albinism I'm legally blind, I can't drive a car or read regular print, I actually use a guide dog to get around, and it would be almost impossible to have a person with albinism be an assassin like his character.  Especially in the case of individuals with red/pink pigmented eyes (not all people with albinism have this eye color, though this form is more severe), it's even more likely that his vision would be greatly impaired.

What I don't understand is--if you do so much research about your books beforehand, how did you not realize this?  Your novels are definitely well-written but I haven't been able to enjoy a single one since I read The Da Vinci Code.  In countries like Tanzania people with albinism are being murdered so their body parts can be used in superstitious remedies--why contribute to the negative stereotype?

1r8em8_16,1r8em8,"Dan,

I just wanted to let you know that The Da Vinci Code was truly incredible for me. Not just because of the story, but because of my experiences caused by the novel. 

I was 14 when your book came out. It was  only after a couple of days that it was released that my family and I took a vacation to England and then Paris. I picked up your book in the airport before the flight. I read the book at every opportunity. 

By the time we got to Paris, I was nearly done with it. My family and I went to the Louvre. I had the book in my backpack with no intention of reading it in the museum. We were seeing many exhibits, but I unintentionally got separated from the rest of my family at the Venus exhibit (we were staying in a hotel a block away, so no big deal.) I decided to seize this opportunity to explore the museum and try to see as much as possible. 

After I got my fill of the museum, I finally went to the information booth and notified the curator that I was lost from my family. She sat me in a chair and let me wait there. Remembering the book, I started reading The Da Vinci Code. 

I managed to finish the book looking at the inverted pyramid. I couldn't believe it. I kept looking up in disbelief. Was I really there? Did I seriously finish the book at the location of the ending? I almost screamed I was so excited. I still believe that I am the first person to unintentionally do that with your book. 

I eventually close the book after rereading the ending a bunch of times and gazing in aww at my surroundings. The curator comes over to tell me the museum is closing soon and notices that I'm holding the book. She was shocked to see it. I told her I just finished it.  She told me that the book was actually banned in France due to its scathing views of Interpol and that you couldn't find it anywhere. I offered for her to have it and she couldn't believe it. She offered to make it up to me and told me to follow her. 

So I, a 14 kid, follow this random French Louvre curator, to an employee area, and she gives me a behind-the-scenes tour of the Louvre. She introduced me to a jeweler who was restoring the French Crown Jewels (which the exhibit was closed for that reason. ) He showed me a crown and scepter.  The curator introduced me to some historians who showed me some pieces that weren't on display. And other inter-workings of the museum.  I couldn't believe how nice everyone was (mind you this was at a time when Freedom Fries were a thing.)

She then took me to the Louvre gift shop and bought me a photo book of the Louvre and a Coke. 

She walked me halfway to my hotel and we parted ways. I didn't even know her name, but she kept thanking me for the book. 

Also, I was stopped by two street artists who did my portrait (at the same time) for free. They said they were having a contest and who did a better job. I chose the one that had the Eiffel Tower in the background, even though you can't see the Eiffel Tower from the view that he drew me. Haha. 

When I got to the hotel, my family wasn't there. I waited for them and when they got to the room, I told them what just happened to me and their jaws practically hit the floor. 

So...thank you Dan Brown. Thank you for writing a novel that lead me to have one of the best times of my life. I will never ever forget that day. I own all of your books and am currently reading Inferno. I will forever be a fan of your work.  ",fosh1zzle,2013-11-23T06:55:42Z,1,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,16

It's perfectly competent, historical conspiracy oriented adventure fiction. I liked reading it, I want it to be successful, but it feels weird when it feels like there are other, much better versions of it, yet for whatever reason here it was.

Hell, I loved [The Sign and the Seal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53326.The_Sign_and_the_Seal) and the other sort of ancient conspiracy stuff from which Brown gets most of his material, where you can get all this and more without somewhat squint-worthy takes on people with albinism. 

The second thing I don't like about it is, perhaps, unintentionally encapsulated in your post:

>This book made me do some research about plenty of the information that it contains and I must admit that I appreciate Dan Brown's research on historical facts and information.

I know people, legit smart and successful people, who believe that Brown blew open legit secrets and was persecuted (?) for it. Yeah, there's interesting history in there, but there's a lot of bad history too, and parceled in fiction where Brown can take whatever liberties he likes, it doesn't have the sort of layer of differentiation that the stuff from Graham Hancock et al does where you can visually look at evidence and go, yeah, right. 

There's some future history out there that tells the story of the downfall of the U.S. where the intense popularity of The Da Vinci Code is a step on the route to Qanon and the need for believe in not only unreasonable conspiracies but ones that encode their facts contemptuously and publicly - none of which, again, was invented by Brown (and that Chris Carter needs some of the shoulder) - that is at this phase of degrading civic life.

tibyd4_1,tibyd4,The Da Vinci Code is an entertaining thriller with fictional ideas vaguely based but not grounded on history. Dan Brown is a type of author who specializes in such stories. His books are supposed to be read for fun and nothing else by the readers who are into these stuffs and be forgotten.

tibyd4_2,tibyd4,"Dan Brown can create a compelling story - even if his writing is...not good, his characters are shallow, and the plot is ridiculous if you sit back and really look at it. But if you get caught up in the story at the start, it just keeps going and going and you are pulled along by the pacing and constant tension because it's a countdown chase thriller.

Now, the Da Vinci Code is one of those cases where it initially got some interest partly because the subject matter was controversial and once it started gaining notoriety, more and more people felt like they had to try it - if it's so ""popular"" it must be really good, right?

Popular has nothing to do with ""good"" though. And if it isn't your type of story, then you're not going to enjoy it, no matter how well it's written. And if you go into it looking for issues...well, you're going to find them, fixate on them, notice more.

17gmukm_1,17gmukm,"[DON’T MAKE FUN OF RENOWNED DAN BROWN](https://onehundredpages.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/dont-make-fun-of-renowned-dan-brown/) - 12 June 2013


Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house – and immediately he felt angry. Most people would have thought that the 48-year-old man had no reason to be angry. After all, the famous writer had a new book coming out. But that was the problem. A new book meant an inevitable attack on the rich novelist by the wealthy wordsmith’s fiercest foes. The critics.


Renowned author Dan Brown hated the critics. Ever since he had become one of the world’s top renowned authors they had made fun of him. They had mocked bestselling book *The Da Vinci Code*, successful novel *Digital Fortress*, popular tome *Deception Point*, money-spinning volume *Angels & Demons* and chart-topping work of narrative fiction *The Lost Symbol*.
  

The critics said his writing was clumsy, ungrammatical, repetitive and repetitive. They said it was full of unnecessary tautology. They said his prose was swamped in a sea of mixed metaphors. For some reason they found something funny in sentences such as “His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack.” *They even say my books are packed with banal and superfluous description*, thought the 5ft 9in man. He particularly hated it when they said his imagery was nonsensical. It made his insect eyes flash like a rocket.
  

Renowned author Dan Brown got out of his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house and paced the bedroom, using the feet located at the ends of his two legs to propel him forwards. He knew he shouldn’t care what a few jealous critics thought. His new book Inferno was coming out on Tuesday, and the 480-page hardback published by Doubleday with a recommended US retail price of $29.95 was sure to be a hit. Wasn’t it?
  

*I’ll call my agent*, pondered the prosperous scribe. He reached for the telephone using one of his two hands. “Hello, this is renowned author Dan Brown,” spoke renowned author Dan Brown. “I want to talk to literary agent John Unconvincingname.”
 
  
“Mr Unconvincingname, it’s renowned author Dan Brown,” told the voice at the other end of the line. Instantly the voice at the other end of the line was replaced by a different voice at the other end of the line. “Hello, it’s literary agent John Unconvincingname,” informed the new voice at the other end of the line.
  
  
“Hello agent John, it’s client Dan,” commented the pecunious scribbler. “I’m worried about new book Inferno. I think critics are going to say it’s badly written.”
  
  
The voice at the other end of the line gave a sigh, like a mighty oak toppling into a great river, or something else that didn’t sound like a sigh if you gave it a moment’s thought. “Who cares what the stupid critics say?” advised the literary agent. “They’re just snobs. You have millions of fans.”
  
  
*That’s true*, mused the accomplished composer of thrillers that combined religion, high culture and conspiracy theories. His books were read by everyone from renowned politician President Obama to renowned musician Britney Spears. It was said that a copy of *The Da Vinci Code* had even found its way into the hands of renowned monarch the Queen. He was grateful for his good fortune, and gave thanks every night in his prayers to renowned deity God.
  
  
“Think of all the money you’ve made,” recommended the literary agent. That was true too. The thriving ink-slinger’s wealth had allowed him to indulge his passion for great art. Among his proudest purchases were a specially commissioned landscape by acclaimed painter Vincent van Gogh and a signed first edition by revered scriptwriter William Shakespeare.
  
  
Renowned author Dan Brown smiled, the ends of his mouth curving upwards in a physical expression of pleasure. He felt much better. If your books brought innocent delight to millions of readers, what did it matter whether you knew the difference between a transitive and an intransitive verb?
  
  
“Thanks, John,” he thanked. Then he put down the telephone and perambulated on foot to the desk behind which he habitually sat on a chair to write his famous books on an Apple iMac MD093B/A computer. New book Inferno, the latest in his celebrated series about fictional Harvard professor Robert Langdon, was inspired by top Italian poet Dante. It wouldn’t be the last in the lucrative sequence, either. He had all the sequels mapped out. The Mozart Acrostic. The Michelangelo Wordsearch. The Newton Sudoku.
  
  
The 190lb adult male human being nodded his head to indicate satisfaction and returned to his bedroom by walking there. Still asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was beautiful wife Mrs Brown. Renowned author Dan Brown gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette’s blonde tresses, flowing from her head like a stream but made from hair instead of water and without any fish in. She was as majestic as the finest sculpture by Caravaggio or the most coveted portrait by Rodin. *I like the attractive woman*, thought the successful man.
  
  
Perhaps one day, inspired by beautiful wife Mrs Brown, he would move into romantic poetry, like market-leading British rhymester John Keats.That would be good, opined the talented person, and got back into the luxurious four-poster bed. He felt as happy as a man who has something to be happy about and is suitably happy about it.",awaiko,2023-10-26T03:51:00Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,1

Not really on topic, but I feel like this is a weird stance on writing that I see a lot, that symbolism is big, serious, binary idea. Either it's some huge bold metaphor that covers the central idea of the book, or it's not there. 


But symbolism is an almost inescapable part of writing in an interesting or evocative way. Dan Brown is a pretty straightforward writer, but there's a *ton* of symbolism in The Da Vinci Code (ignoring the literal ""symbology"" part of the plot, obviously!). Symbolism doesn't even *need* to be totally explicit & intentional (although I am very confident that at times, it would be in Da Vinci Code), if you just try and write an interesting story, it will pop up naturally as you go. That's just how our mind works, when we lay out compelling stories, symbolic elements pop up.

I put the book down after the first chapter for that reason alone.

The book and the movie became such a big hit because it's interesting and an easy subject to digest or watch. It doesn't take a rocket scientist. Meanwhile if you take a piece of work like Catch 22 then you have some serious adaptation to do before it's ready for the screen.

My take is if you're going to write a book then write a book. If you're going to write a screenplay then write one. Just don't bind it like a book and then tell me it's not a screenplay.",ATX_rider,2019-09-05T21:32:41Z,0,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,7

Dan Brown subscribes to some antiquated notions of history that have been thoroughly debunked in the last century, especially the so called ‘Conflict Thesis’ - that religion and science have always been at odds with each other and that the Church wilfully held back human progress in order to control the masses.

The intro: “Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house – and immediately he felt angry. Most people would have thought that the 48-year-old man had no reason to be angry. After all, the famous writer had a new book coming out. But that was the problem. A new book meant an inevitable attack on the rich novelist by the wealthy wordsmith’s fiercest foes. The critics.”
  
“His books were read by everyone from renowned politician President Obama to renowned musician Britney Spears. It was said that a copy of The Da Vinci Code had even found its way into the hands of renowned monarch the Queen.”  
  
“The thriving ink-slinger’s wealth had allowed him to indulge his passion for great art. Among his proudest purchases were a specially commissioned landscape by acclaimed painter Vincent van Gogh and a signed first edition by revered scriptwriter William Shakespeare.”  
  
“Still asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was beautiful wife Mrs Brown.

6ovug2_2,6ovug2,"And yet it's the top voted comment in the thread.  Could it be that most people agree Dan Brown is complete shit and doesn't belong in a sub for people who enjoy reading?

Edit:
Here's a beautiful parody of Brown's writing which nicely sums up why he's so terrible:

>Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house – and immediately he felt angry. Most people would have thought that the 48-year-old man had no reason to be angry. After all, the famous writer had a new book coming out. But that was the problem. A new book meant an inevitable attack on the rich novelist by the wealthy wordsmith’s fiercest foes. The critics.

>Renowned author Dan Brown hated the critics. Ever since he had become one of the world’s top renowned authors they had made fun of him. They had mocked bestselling book The Da Vinci Code, successful novel Digital Fortress, popular tome Deception Point, money-spinning volume Angels & Demons and chart-topping work of narrative fiction The Lost Symbol.

>The critics said his writing was clumsy, ungrammatical, repetitive and repetitive. They said it was full of unnecessary tautology. They said his prose was mired in a sea of mixed metaphors. For some reason they found something funny in sentences such as “His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack.” They even say my books are packed with banal and superfluous description, thought the 5ft 9in man. He particularly hated it when they said his imagery was nonsensical. It made his insect eyes flash like a rocket.

>Renowned author Dan Brown got out of his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10 million house and paced the bedroom, using the feet located at the ends of his two legs to propel him forwards. He knew he shouldn’t care what a few jealous critics thought. His new book Inferno was coming out on Tuesday, and the 480-page hardback published by Doubleday with a recommended US retail price of $29.95 was sure to be a hit. Wasn’t it?

>I’ll call my agent, pondered the prosperous scribe. He reached for the telephone using one of his two hands. “Hello, this is renowned author Dan Brown,” spoke renowned author Dan Brown. “I want to talk to literary agent John Unconvincingname.”

>“Mr Unconvincingname, it’s renowned author Dan Brown,” told the voice at the other end of the line. Instantly the voice at the other end of the line was replaced by a different voice at the other end of the line. “Hello, it’s literary agent John Unconvincingname,” informed the new voice at the other end of the line.

>“Hello agent John, it’s client Dan,” commented the pecunious scribbler. “I’m worried about new book Inferno. I think critics are going to say it’s badly written.”

>The voice at the other end of the line gave a sigh, like a mighty oak toppling into a great river, or something else that didn’t sound like a sigh if you gave it a moment’s thought. “Who cares what the stupid critics say?” advised the literary agent. “They’re just snobs. You have millions of fans.”

>That’s true, mused the accomplished composer of thrillers that combined religion, high culture and conspiracy theories. His books were read by everyone from renowned politician President Obama to renowned musician Britney Spears. It was said that a copy of The Da Vinci Code had even found its way into the hands of renowned monarch the Queen. He was grateful for his good fortune, and gave thanks every night in his prayers to renowned deity God.

>“Think of all the money you’ve made,” recommended the literary agent. That was true too. The thriving ink-slinger’s wealth had allowed him to indulge his passion for great art. Among his proudest purchases were a specially commissioned landscape by acclaimed painter Vincent van Gogh and a signed first edition by revered scriptwriter William Shakespeare.

>Renowned author Dan Brown smiled, the ends of his mouth curving upwards in a physical expression of pleasure. He felt much better. If your books brought innocent delight to millions of readers, what did it matter whether you knew the difference between a transitive and an intransitive verb?

>“Thanks, John,” he thanked. Then he put down the telephone and perambulated on foot to the desk behind which he habitually sat on a chair to write his famous books on an Apple iMac MD093B/A computer. New book Inferno, the latest in his celebrated series about fictional Harvard professor Robert Langdon, was inspired by top Italian poet Dante. It wouldn’t be the last in the lucrative sequence, either. He had all the sequels mapped out. The Mozart Acrostic. The Michelangelo Wordsearch. The Newton Sudoku.

>The 190lb adult male human being nodded his head to indicate satisfaction and returned to his bedroom by walking there. Still asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was beautiful wife Mrs Brown. Renowned author Dan Brown gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette’s blonde tresses, flowing from her head like a stream but made from hair instead of water and without any fish in. She was as majestic as the finest sculpture by Caravaggio or the most coveted portrait by Rodin. I like the attractive woman, thought the successful man.

>Perhaps one day, inspired by beautiful wife Mrs Brown, he would move into romantic poetry, like market-leading British rhymester John Keats.That would be good, opined the talented person, and got back into the luxurious four-poster bed. He felt as happy as a man who has something to be happy about and is suitably happy about it.

3cco9k_2,3cco9k,"OK Snatch_Pastry, let's see if I can convince you.

(First of all, cool screen name.)

OK, here goes. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!

>Is the Florentine the diamond or an adversary group?

It is neither.  In fact the Florentine is a cyber-weapon. Alex Fife, the book's protagonist thinks that the Florentine is a diamond based on some initial sleuthing, but eventually finds out its true nature.  The book is about his quest to determine the nature of the Florentine, and then to stop it from getting in the wrong hands, where it will be used to cause an immense amount of damage.

>It's geek/tech, so is it closer to: Michael Crichton, Neal Stephenson, William Gibson, or Tom Clancy? Or to go way out on a limb, Larry Niven's ""Dream Park""? Can you draw parallels to one or more of these authors?

Hmmm.. I'd say it's closest to Chricton's works.  It It can best be described as a plausible, easy-to-read technology-flavored adventure.  However, unlike Chricton's novels, there are no elements of the story that couldn't actually happen in real life.  It's more like science fact-fiction than science fiction.

>You already mentioned the da Vinci Code. I loathed the ending of that book, because after a fun read through the art/architectural/historical sites of Europe and a huge build up, it ended with a total cop-out whimper. Can you categorically state that your novel has a real ending, with cool reveals and a satisfying sense of conclusion? A cliff-hanger/lead in to a sequel is also acceptable.

Yes - I can definitely promise that the end of the book has an exciting, realistic conclusion. It's not a cliff-hanger, but a  technological duel between Alex and some very bad folks who want to use the Florentine for ill ends. You, the reader, will likely wonder how you'd stop the attack. Can you come up with a clever solution that won't do more harm than good? The technological premise of the book is actually feasible, and at the end of the book, the main character is faced with saving the U.S. computing infrastructure from a realistic cyber-attack. If you don't think that attackers could decimate our computing base (permanently), think again. It's eminently possible. And in fact Eugene Spafford (PhD @ Purdue, he wrote the book's foreword) previously warned the U.S. Government of this exact style of attack.

>How about a bit more about Alex. What's some background on him, and why should we like him?

Alex Fife is a 25-year old recent college grad who founded a startup in his UCLA dorm room and sold it for nearly $300M. Now he has more money than he can spend, and yet he's bored. What do you do with your life when you've achieved your life's ambition and made it. He's a success by every definition of the word. Yet he's lost and looking for something to bring his life meaning.  And he finds it in an old computer.

1h3kyo_1,1h3kyo,"Well, when it comes to fast-paced thrillers, such as your aforementioned *The Da Vinci Code,* the genre is far from dead. In fact, Dan Brown recently released his fourth installment in the Robert Langdon series, titled *Inferno,* and it's already a New York Times Bestseller. James Patterson and Dean Koontz are still going strong, as well. As far as vamp books and 50 Shades nonsense, that's all aimed at a particular audience, namely 14 year-old girls. I'm not sure an intellectual would consider either of those two to be quality reads. Basically, the genres still stand in popularity, I think. Christians still buy self-help books from Joel Osteen and Joyce Meyer. Sci-fi nerds still buy the classics (I, myself, have an extremely difficult time finding new, exceptional modern sci-fi). And typical readers buy whatever is on the bestseller lists. If any genre is going to take the cake and top all others, it's fantasy. The Game of Thrones TV series sort of re-sparked, if you will, the fantasy interest left void after Lord of the Rings waned in popularity. After reading the first two books of *A Song of Ice and Fire,* I can confirm that George R. R. Martin truly has penned a masterpiece of works with this quintessential series. Fantasy is no longer confined to the realm of fairies and goblins and such; it has progressed, largely, if not solely, due to Martin's presence, to a point where reality and fantasy collide. We are taken to a time without science, knowledge of medicine, or much knowledge of anything really. There are dark times, yet Martin accurately portrays the ways in which people, in this case the charcters of *A Song of Ice and Fire,* handle situations such as true life-and-death. There is romance, passion, and sex. There is violence, fear, and death. This is no different from today's reality in the sense that there is ongoing war and suffering that can never quite be relinquished. Martin has redefined the fantasy genre, and I'm sure many more authors will follow suit and pen works unlike others beforehand.

**TL;DR** Da Vicni Code-type books (i.e. action thrillers) are far from losing popularity. Twilight and 50 Shades are only popular because they are marketed for and read by tweenage girls, and there are millions of that demographic. Fantasy is swiftly regaining mainstream popularity, largely due to the success of HBO's Game of Thrones and the work it was adapted from, George R. R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire.*",spain-train,2013-06-26T10:16:52Z,3,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,1

ao695q_1,ao695q,"I have never read Dan Brown- I read a few pages of Da Vinci Code and soon put it down; the quality of the writing just wasn't there for me. Plus I like a degree of  intellectual challenge. The Da Vinci Code relied on sensationalism and absurd premises to hook the reader, so I suspect it satisfied the page turning urge and in the end was a good yarn.

Good yarns though, do not make great, or even good, literature.

What they do make is lots of cash- and this is the issue with modern publishing. It is about the formulae that has worked once, so let's stick to it and produce more of the same because it sells.

Popular fiction is not only formulaic and hackneyed, but it has to have plenty of sequels lined up. In any bookshop or library you see this all the time: Part Two of the Hand of Darkness trilogy, Another Inspector Wobble mystery. People like to feel at home with their books, so will read the same author over and over because they trust the writer to produce more of the same.

I think you are learning valuable lessons about what makes good writing, as opposed to the mediocre stuff.

Once you have expanded away from this type of thing and into real quality literature you will not turn back.

This isn't really a criticism of any writer, often they are under immense pressures to produce more of the same by the publishing houses, just as with artists in the music industry who get tied into contacts which stultifies and does not develop, their creativity. It is very sad.

bvxt1_1,bvxt1,"may i re-frame the question?  because the answer depends a lot on how you're defining ""culture"" and ""significance"".  based on your post, you seem to be defining those as ""American"" and ""popularity"", respectively.  and yes, in those terms, the da vinci code & harry potter series probably do win.

but i don't personally think they're *significant*.  they were *popular*, but i would define the significance of a book as the power & influence it has on changing cultural beliefs/perceptions in lasting ways.  ""game changers"", so to speak.  will anyone care about da vinci code or even harry potter in a hundred years?  i'm guessing probably not, at least nowhere near as much as today.  but which books *will* be remembered that far ahead, and perhaps even *grow* in readership in the future? that's the question, and it's also extremely difficult to make judgments like this so soon.

there's also a difficulty in that things have become so sub-categorized and specialized that it becomes difficult for any one book to have an impact across the entire culture.  there are probably scientific books that are making huge waves through their respective disciplines, but have zero recognition from people outside of those disciplines.  fiction, too, is split up into many genres, so that it's rare for one fiction book to be read by a wide variety of readers.  or if it does, it doesn't happen right away--the reputation builds first within the genre as being a masterpiece, and then slowly begins spreading to other types of readers who give it a try.  but still that takes a lot of time, more than a decade i think.

that said, i have no idea what to suggest as a book that spreads across genres and probably will have an even bigger readership as time goes on.  sorry if all this was ultimately unhelpful. :P",aginorfled,2010-04-25T22:37:46Z,2,COMMENT,Action,Da Vinci Conde,1

>The critics said his writing was clumsy, ungrammatical, repetitive and repetitive. They said it was full of unnecessary tautology. They said his prose was swamped in a sea of mixed metaphors.
