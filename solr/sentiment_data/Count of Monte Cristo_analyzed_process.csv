Can you imagine being in France in 1844 and then reading parts of The Count of Monte Cristo released basically every two weeks over the next 18 months? That would be so amazing, kind of like serial television today. Sitting around the ""water cooler"" talking about Dantes and what would happen next...",Kilroi,2022-08-27T22:37:04Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1
wzcofb_2,wzcofb,"I agree.

It was even sweeter for me because the book I read right before it was Ayn Rand's god-awful *Atlas Shrugged*. To go from a book where every single page was brain-numbing boredom (waiting for it to get 'good'... *it doesn't*, despite some people claiming *A.S.* is their favourite book) to this one where every page and every chapter had me eagerly wanting to continue - what a contrast!

Both books are epics but *The Count of Monte Cristo* is actually longer than *A.S.*, both in page and word count. I concluded I would rather read 1276 pages of any other Dumas' work rather than 1 of Rand's.",DanielB_CANADA,2022-08-28T02:11:11Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,2

wzcofb_9,wzcofb,"It is my favourite book, ever since I was lucky enough to read it as a child decades ago.

True, since then I read more complex, serious, thought-provoking works. Heck, even from literary point of view there's any number of stronger creations. 

And yet, still, nothing has quite touched me in the same way as this epic tale. I reread it every year or a few, and my interpretation changes with time. 

As a kid, I was hooked on the adventure side of the story, and it's colorful characters. 

As a late teen, I was mesmerized by the sheer magnificence of the Count. He above being a role model or a goal, why, for even a mere thought of striving for such excellency is futile. 

As an adult, I now see Count as a very lonely and solitary being, a broken, yet unbroken man, delusional, yet at the same time prophetic. I think at this point I see him more as an idea than an actual human being. 

What a truly, undoubtedly magnificent work of art, this novel is. 

I am sure, I will keep it close to heart for my whole life. 

P.S. Dumas is a strange case, at least for me. While I absolutely love The Count of Monte Cristo, I felt quite lukewarm about the author's supposedly 'best' work, meaning The Three Musketeers. Granted, I never read it as a child, which is the point where, from what I know, most people fall in love with the work, so maybe that's why.

wzcofb_12,wzcofb,"I lived in France for just over a year when I was a kid, in the late 1980s. Our big school trip in Grade 6  was a week touring Provence. We took the high-speed TGV train from Paris to Marseille, and on our first full day there, we took a boat across to the Château d'If.

I remember the (fake attribution, obviously) 'Edmond Dantès' cell and the tour guide telling all of us blank-faced kids ""You know, from *The Count of Monte Cristo*. No? Oh well, it's a very famous book!""

I might have been 11 but I'd recently read Stephen King's *Different Seasons*, which contained four novellas including 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', a prison and prison-escape story. The main character, Andy Dufresne, had a somewhat French-sounding name, so for some reason I pictured him imprisoned in the cell we were standing in and was puzzled how this *Count* guy had a bunk bed tall enough  to reach the ceiling (Dufresne tunnelled vertically, covering the hole above his bunk with a pin-up girl poster). There *was* a square-ish hole in the ceiling of the 'Dantès' cell, but it must have been 12 feet up!

**P. S**. This will probably blow most people's minds but although we did the Château d'If as an entire class group, the rest of the morning, we'd been split up into groups of 4 or 5 and told to explore the old port and adjacent area and find and check off as many items on a scavenger hunt list as we could, then meet at the ferry dock (as shown on our map) at 10:30am or something. No chaperones, no cell phones (it was 1988), just 2 hours of a bunch of 11 year-olds exploring an unfamiliar city 500 miles (800km) from home, on their own. Totally normal, no reason for concern. And oh yeah, none of us were French, and our French-language skills were extremely basic. Can you imagine that today?!",DanielB_CANADA,2022-08-28T02:50:50Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,12

wzcofb_15,wzcofb,"Yes! There’s so many other books that may go way in depth in thought or philosophies, but what I love about the Count of Monte Cristo is that its characters are so unapologetically human… Every character represents some sort of emotion, or motivation and its a realistic portrayal of society. Edmond then takes advantage of their humanity when he plots their revenge, knowing the weaknesses of his enemies and exploiting it. 

I hope to read this again in a few years and find new things to love about it. And I’ll have to check Three Musketeers out, I owe Dumas at least that!",prodigy747,2022-08-28T13:29:15Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,15

Some of them are pretty darn accurate- *Ivanhoe*, *Dr.Jekyll & Mr. Hyde*, *The Three Musketeers* come to mind. Just small omissions and deviations. Someone left *The Swiss Family Robinson* by Great Illustrated Classics out on a sidewalk curb drop, so it's mine now. I wish that they included the part where Fritz plans to marry Emily/Jenny in the end! How can that be omitted???

*The Count of Monte Cristo* is one of their least accurate books! So many re-writes, and the loss of Valentine/Maximilian's love story, the Count's redemption, and Haydee's significance at the end is sorely missed.

And... *the Time Machine*... a must-read, if only for the chapter ""The Golden Age Of Science""! That was not present in the original. And it's ROTFL and makes the whole book so much fun!

I wish they'd done *Les Miserables*, but, alas, no. So I had to dig around and find other *Les Miz* children's books. My research on *Les Miz* for Kids is here:

[Les Miserables for Kids](https://abbreviatedlesmiserables.blogspot.com/2022/05/les-miz-for-kids.html)

Something that I noticed is that Classics books written/adapted in the 1940's- through the 70's for kids have a tendency to be more accurate. These days, I think children's book authors are way too PC. Worried about controversy, and how things need to be sanitized and sunshine and rainbows for sensitive kiddos, even if the source had some... ugliness. 

I flipped through a modern *The Three Musketeers* at a B&N store and I was... flabbergasted to see half the book missing! It ends at the conclusion of the Diamond Stud Affair, and then the Musketeers go ""all for one and one for all!"" and missing the whole Milady deWinter part and Athos being a d-bag hubby.

If you liked the 2002 version of the count of monte cristo, you'll love the French movie Le Bossu/On Guard.

On Guard (Le Bossu) is a 1997 French swashbuckler film directed by Philippe de Broca and starring Daniel Auteuil, Fabrice Luchini, Vincent Perez, and Marie Gillain. Adapted from the 1858 historical novel Le Bossu by Paul Féval.

>!!In 1700 in Nevers, France, a skilled swordsman named Lagardère (Daniel Auteuil) challenges Duke Philippe de Nevers (Vincent Pérez) to a friendly duel in order to learn his secret lethal maneuver known as the ""Nevers Attack"". Nevers agrees and quickly dispatches the upstart whom he soon befriends. Nevers learns that he has a ""son"" by Blanche de Caylus—a fact previously concealed by his cousin and would-be heir, the wicked Comte de Gonzague (Fabrice Luchini). That night Nevers escapes an assassination attempt by Gonzague's men.!<

>!Determined to claim his bride, Nevers leaves for Caylus with Lagardère along as his escort. They are followed by Gonzague and his men who plan to murder Nevers before he can marry Blanche and claim his son and heir. Along the way Nevers teaches Lagardère the ""Nevers Attack""—an acrobatic sleight of hand that ends with a blade between the opponent's eyes. Soon after, they spot the assassins, and Lagardère is able to delay the attackers long enough to allow Nevers to reach Caylus and marry Blanche. The newlyweds' happiness, however, is short-lived.!<

>!When Gonzague and his men arrive at Caylus, they murder the entire wedding party. Lagardère arrives, and after a lengthy sword fight, Nevers is fatally stabbed by a masked Gonzague, who is ""branded"" by a sword thrust on the hand by Lagardère. Lagardère threatens the unseen killer: ""If you do not come to Lagardère,"" he states, ""Lagardère will come to you!"" With his dying breath, Nevers implores Lagardère to avenge him and his wife (who he believes was killed) and to look after their infant child. Lagardère flees Caylus with the infant and finds refuge in the mountains in an abandoned farmhouse, where he discovers that the ""son"" is in fact a girl, who carries a locket naming her as Aurore.!<

>!Gonzague's men track Lagardère to his mountain hideaway looking to kill Nevers' rightful heir. Lagardère and Aurore escape with the help of a band of strolling players who convince the pursuing killers that Lagardère and Aurore have plunged to their deaths in a mountain torrent. After Gonzague's men leave, Lagardère and Aurore join up with the strolling players. Back in Nevers, after attending the funeral of her daughter — the coffin actually contains a wax doll — Blanche retires to a convent, and  Gonzague is named executor of her estate.!<

>!Sixteen years later, Lagardère and Aurore (Marie Gillain) are still with the players. After witnessing Lagardère defend her against three outlaws using sophisticated swordplay with a stick, Aurore asks about his past. Lagardère keeps his past hidden, but he teaches her the ""Nevers Attack"". One night after a performance, Aurore is taken to a party given by one of Gonzague's men, Louis-Joseph, and is soon assaulted by the host. Using fencing skills she learned from Lagardère, Aurore escapes her attacker, killing him using the ""Nevers Attack"". When Gonzague learns how his ""finest blade"" was killed, he suspects that Aurore is still alive; his suspicions are confirmed when Aurore's tomb is opened revealing a decayed wax doll. Gonzague then orders his men to find and kill her!<.

>!Lagardère sets out to plan his revenge on Gonzague. After revealing to Aurore that she is the daughter of the late Duke of Nevers, and that her mother is still alive, he gains employment as Gonzague's secretary disguised as a hunchback, makes contact with Blanche revealing that her daughter is alive, and then engineers a stock market raid on shares in the Mississippi Company supposedly on behalf of Gonzague — in fact he purchases the stock using gold provided by Blanche for her daughter's benefit.!<

>!When Aurore is captured by Gonzague's men, Lagardère executes a daring rescue. That night, the Regent Philippe d'Orléans arrives prepared to name Gonzague a royal agent to Louisiana. The ceremony is interrupted, however, by Lagardère who escorts Aurore into the hall, introducing her as the majority holder of the Mississippi Company stock. Blanche confirms Aurore is her daughter. Lagardère then discards his disguise and accuses Gonzague of murdering Duke Philippe de Nevers. As proof he exposes Gonzague's hand — the one he branded at the scene of the murder. In the swordfight that follows, Lagardère kills Gonzague using the ""Nevers Attack"". Aurore then instructs Lagardère to kiss her, and the two embrace each other. !<",atreus2023,2023-07-20T05:52:18Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,16

The Count of Moret, or The Red Sphinx. Is another. I tried to find a copy, but was unable for the longest time. The tale had originally appeared in newspaper serial form from 1865 to ’66, but remained unfinished. It was properly published for the first time in 1946, after a copy of the original manuscript in Dumas’s own handwriting had turned up in someone's French attic. It's a riveting read—the tale was classic Dumas,  and picks up right where The Three Musketeers left off, but from the point of view of their worthy opponent Cardinal Richelieu and of the Comte de Moret, King Louis’s daring young half-brother.

11fkja7_4,11fkja7,"So I have a kind of funny story about this. I found out at some point a while ago that many classic novels could be downloaded as free ebooks on the Google Play store (since they are out of copyright), so I took that as a convenient opportunity to start reading some more, which was great. One of the books I decided to read was the Count of Monte Cristo, and indeed I looked it up and there was a free version.

Now, I started reading, and was immediately somewhat confused, as it seemed to just throw me into a conversation between some completely unintroduced characters. I had seen a movie version years and years ago, and had some vague recollection of that starting with something about a prison, so I wasn't sure why it was so different. I figured it must just be a book-movie difference, and maybe this book was taking a very ""show-don't-tell"" type of stance to the setting and characters (though I was surprised to see this, especially in an older novel). So I went ahead and kept going.

Long story short, I read it and it was very good, but after finishing, I finally figured out why it had started in such a way - the ebook was, for some reason, split into two sections, and I had just jumped right into the second half of the book! Strangely enough, I actually think it worked quite well this way - his whole backstory was as much a mystery to me as to most of the characters, and thus the reveals at the end were particularly impactful. Probably the beginning could have been slightly smoother, but the basic structure of starting with him as apparently just some rich guy worked pretty well.",Ieatyourhead,2023-03-02T04:06:59Z,2,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,4

11fkja7_6,11fkja7,"Book ends with the phrase: “Until the day when God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words,—‘Wait and hope”. 

Hearing those words from a man who suffered so much in life and was only motivated by revenge was not what I expected. I wanted his enemies to suffer more than he did, I wanted them to be crushed by the Count so that he could have had his victory as a person who managed to get justice when nothing or nobody in this world was responsible for its execution. And he did, of course, but not the way I expected (it wasn’t enough for me). It was only after some time that I realized what those words meant for a man who did everything in his power but still ended up saying that we should WAIT and HOPE. It is strange, and it might seem unfair, but life, in the end, punished everyone in a cruel way ( even though it was late, and even though Edmond Dantes suffered so much). Him saying those words makes him a character who is not only eager to punish but also is able to be empathic, merciful, and considerate. 

In the end, The Count of Monte Cristo hasn't lost the side of Edmon Dantes. He was the same person, but just with much bigger pain. 


I should also mention how great Dumas is. His work just screams I write the best adventures stories and that is correct. I was fascinated, excited, and emotional, was cheering for characters, was thrilled, and hurt by everything that was going on. In my opinion, he is the best in the genre that he writes.

I wish I was fluent in English, that way I would have definitely written the whole analysis of this book. It is more than a story to me. It is a book that is a classic, with great ideas, characters, writing technique, and execution.",,2023-03-02T20:56:02Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,6

The Count of Monte Cristo would be a reinterpretation of how Ulysses would act if Penelope had married one of the suitors. he would marry princess Nausicaa, personified by Haydee._x000D_  
If Nausicaaa saved Ulysses, it was Edmond who saved Haydee, instead of Nausicaa being a maternal figure for Ulysses, Edmond would be a somewhat paternal figure for Haydee. Ulysses ignores Nausicaa's love for him, Edmond ignores Haydee's love for him until she confesses. Nausicaa's father offers her in marriage to Ulysses, Haydee as she doesn't have a father who offers her in marriage, she has to say that she loves him._x000D_  
In Book Six of the Odyssey, Ulysses is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Scheria (Phaeacia in some translations). Nausicaä and her handmaidens go to the seashore to wash clothes. Awakened by their games, Ulysses emerges from the forest completely naked, scaring the servants away, and begs Nausicaä for aid. She gives Ulysses some of the laundry to wear and takes him to the edge of the town. Realizing that rumors might arise if Ulysses is seen with her, she and the servants go into town ahead of him, but first she advises him to go directly to Alcinous's house and make his case to Nausicaä's mother, Arete. Arete is known as wiser even than Alcinous, and Alcinous trusts her judgment. Ulysses follows this advice, approaching Arete and winning her approval, and is received as a guest by Alcinous._x000D_

During his stay, Ulysses recounts his adventures to Alcinous and his court. This recounting forms a substantial portion of the Odyssey. Alcinous then generously provides Ulysses with the ships that finally bring him home to Ithaca._x000D_  
Nausicaä is young and very pretty; Ulysses says she resembles a goddess, particularly Artemis. _x000D_  
Homer gives a literary account of love never expressed (possibly one of the earliest examples of unrequited love in literature). **Nausicaä is presented as a potential love interest for Ulysses: she tells her friend that she would like her husband to be like him, and her father tells Ulysses that he would let him marry her. The two do not have a romantic relationship,. Nausicaä is also a mother figure for Ulysses; she ensures his return home, and says ""Never forget me, for I gave you life"".** Ulysses never tells Penelope about his encounter with Nausicaä, out of all the women he met on his long journey home.

I cried a lot. I think the ending is sadder than the end of the musical movie (I haven't seen it live), but all the sadness is spread out, while the movie is just a few solid hours of concentrated sadness.

After The three MusketeersMatthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patellière tackle another masterpiece by Alexandre Dumas._x000D_  
_x000D_  
the count of Monte Cristo , mythical figure of literature and cinema, will make a new appearance on the big screen. Adapted from Alexandre Dumas’ masterpiece, the film “will follow the point of view of Edmond Dantès, the first French superhero“, explain the two men, in a press release. After adapting The three Musketeers (in two episodes, scheduled for release in April and December), Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patellière tackle what they consider to be “one of the greatest stories ever told». As for the adventures of d’Artagnan, they will sign the adaptation and the screenplay. But also the realization – it was Martin Bourboulon who was in charge for the Musketeers. Everything is produced by Chapter 2 and Pathé.

The main role of this feature film made in France has been entrusted to Pierre Niney, “which will be a Monte-Cristo like you’ve never seen it before” directors hope. The 33-year-old actor will be the 17th to play Edmond de Dantès, after Gérard Depardieu, Jean Marais or Pierre-Richard. “As millions of readers around the world, I was marked and transported by the great novel that is Monte-Cristo he wrote on his Twitter account. We want to create a great film of adventures, characters but above all… revenge“._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Shooting for the film, which is scheduled for release in October 2024, is due to begin in July in France and represents “a huge challenge” for production. But Dimitri Rassam and the Pathé company are happy to once again accompany Matthieu and Alexandre who have managed to find the balance to respect what makes the strength of this masterpiece while offering a modern and fully cinematographic vision“._x000D_

(this is a smaller version of my Monte Cristo movie reviews)

I think it's only barely related to The Count of Monte Cristo. It misses every plot point that even cartoons and children's books have. Even when it's not compared to the book, it has several dozen plot holes and logic gaps so big you can sail a ship through them. The movie doesn't even make sense within its own internal universe! Here's just a few examples of movie-nonsense:

* Why is Viscount Fernand Mondego working on a ship, and ""best buds"" with Dantes ""since childhood""? Why can he so easily marry commoner girl Mercedes? As if France wasn't concerned with class differences between the aristocracy and the hoi polloi?
* All of the Extraneous Swordfights (9 of them).
* Dantes visits Morrel too early (before finding the treasure), and leaves a little sack of money (his sailor's wages). This is obviously not enough to save Morrel's business, and further on, we will learn that Danglars has claimed ownership of the business AND the Pharaon! Why didn't Dantes visit later, when he was dripping in money???
* How can two men pull a dozen chests of gold from underwater, carry them on a long trek across rocky terrain and overload a little rowboat with them?
* How the Count's ""revenge"" on all of his enemies consists of dangling the Spada treasure in front of them and they all fall for it, lured like moths to a flame? How was Dantes privy to details of ~~Noirtier's~~ Clarion's murder, since he wasn't a witness to it and neither of the 2 culprits told him about it?
* When Mercedes visits the Count in a darkened room, he bellows at her, ""Why did you not wait?"" What a dumbass! Wait for what? He already knows she was told he was dead! Did he expect her to throw some voodoo ceremony to bring him ""back from the dead""? It turns out that Dantes is Albert's biological dad!

(TBH there's like 4 dozen differences and new plot holes in the movie)

* Caderousse: >!Adapted out!<.
* Fernand: >!After shooting Mercedes (!) (⮜non-fatal, just a flesh wound, ha!) he's killed by the Count in a long, dragged-out swordfight.!<

An absolute gent too in how he found out the full story after escape and before getting revenge/justice.

>WINNER OF THE 2013 PULITZER PRIZE FOR BIOGRAPHY

General Alex Dumas, is a man almost unknown today, yet his story is strikingly familiar—because his son, the novelist Alexandre Dumas, used his larger-than-life feats as inspiration for such classics as The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers.
     But, hidden behind General Dumas's swashbuckling adventures was an even more incredible secret: he was the son of a black slave—who rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our own time. 
     Born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), Alex Dumas made his way to Paris, where he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution—until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat.
     TIME magazine called The Black Count ""one of those quintessentially human stories of strength and courage that sheds light on the historical moment that made it possible."" It is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son.

2t8rdh_2,2t8rdh,"It's been said already, but if you like that, try reading Les Miserables.  It is also an incredible piece of epic prose.  None of the adaptations truly captured the suffering that was in the book.

Also, try reading some Tolstoy.  Anna Karenina is another near flawless work about various people's journey of finding and losing themselves.  Both, akin to The Count, do talk a fair amount about politics.  It always amazes me that the things they say still completely apply to our modern systems.

If you need a break from reading epics, read 'The Black Count'.  It is the completely true story of Dumas' father.  He was an absolutely fascinating man, and from whom parts of the Count of Monte Cristo were drawn from.

It is... well, an original interpretation. ""Aladdin"" is a far older story than ""Monte Cristo"", but Disney does what they usually do- take old folktales and modify them for child-friendly movies. It means profit, and people's kids and grandkids are always discovering the Disney-fied versions.

A lot of the similarities listed in this article are a bit of a stretch. Sometimes a LOT of a stretch.

1. Aladdin was a street rat, stealing food to get by. He was considered the lowest of the low. Edmond was a talented, capable sailor, with the promise of captaincy of his very own ship, and a very promising future.
2. Aladdin meets Princess Jasmine by chance, as she's in disguise to get out of the palace. They didn't even know each other and there was no way that Aladdin could ever court the Princess. Dantes loved Mercedes, a girl he knew very well, and they were about to be married. Mercedes was in no way ""above"" either Dantes or Fernand in the social pecking order. If anything, she was below them, and needed to marry one of them for simple survival.
3. Jafar was a vizier, and wanted to force Jasmine to marry him so he'd eventually become Sultan. Jafar depended on magic, threats and force to try to get Jasmine to say ""yes"". Fernand was a fisherman, courting a poor peasant girl (his cousin) and the village customs condoned this. And Mercedes married Fernand voluntarily. She even had a son by Fernand.
4. Aladdin didn't lose the best 14 years of his life rotting away in either a jail or a cave. Dantes, OTOH, had it hard. He almost went mad, and considered suicide. His life was pure misery. No comparison.
5. OK, the comparison between Genie and Abbe Faria granting their young friend incredible wealth is valid. And so are uses of alter-identities that both Aladdin and Dantes take on. HOWEVER, ""Prince Ali"" is only a ruse. Underneath the disguise, poor boy Aladdin with a good heart is still there. With Dantes, his new persona, The Count of Monte Cristo, had taken over his psyche, doing things that young Dantes would have never considered. He truly became a whole different person. Ruthless, conniving, the end justifies the means, etc.
6. Aladdin's revenge wasn't brutal enough. I'm not even sure if it even counts as revenge. Aladdin was motivated to save Jasmine and save the kingdom. He wasn't pissed at an injustice that Jafar dished out years ago to ruin his life. He didn't weave an elaborate trap that hurt innocent family members of Jafar. Dantes, OTOH became a revenge-machine and for a while, didn't know when to stop.
7. Aladdin gets the girl- Princess Jasmine, the one he wanted. The Sultan is a-OK with his daughter marrying a former street rat. Uh huh. Dantes gets *a* girl, >!a Princess to boot, but it sure wasn't Mercedes. Mercedes is on her own, her son sailing away to fight in Algeria and all that's left for her is a lifetime of weeping and praying and looking out the window, calling, ""Edmond, Edmond."" Meanwhile, Dantes sails away on his luxury yacht with a real Princess.!<",ZeMastor,2023-03-27T03:32:07Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,10
121qyim_11,121qyim,"Of course translations are different and people might like one over another. Forgetting about actual POOR translations, which probably exist, there are also simply old-fashioned ones.

Even given two equally ""good"" translations, they're going to be different, and appeal to different tastes.

Here are two translations of an early sentence of The Count of Monte Cristo:

First the free translation that I found online:

>The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.

And here's the Robin Buss translation:

>Meanwhile the ship was drawing near, and had successfully negotiated the narrows created by some volcanic upheaval between the islands of Calseraigne and Jarre; it had rounded Pomègue and was proceeding under its three topsails, its outer jib and its spanker, but so slowly and with such melancholy progress that the bystanders, instinctively sensing some misfortune, wondered what accident could have occurred on board.

Now, personally, I like the second one. I totally understand wanting to get that version when I'm planning to read 800+ pages.

""I see you are a philosopher,"" said Villefort, after a momentary silence in which he had been gathering strength like a wrestler meeting a powerful opponent. ""Well, Monsieur, I do declare, if, like you, I had nothing to do, I should look for a less melancholy pastime.""

""Very true, Monsieur,"" said Monte Cristo. ""Mankind is an ugly worm when you look at it through a solar microscope. But I think you said I have nothing to do. Now, Monsieur, I ask you, do you imagine you have anything to do? Or, to put it more clearly, do you believe that what you do deserves to be called something?""

Revenge, ostracization,  and adultery, along with the more grandiose—albeit often seen—themes of wealth, knowledge, and power. You get to witness a man, wronged by nearly all of those he trusted, grow from a naive simpleton to a man with awe inspiring power and intelligence. We all, in a way, can relate to at least one theme in the book, and given that these themes inspire such strong emotional responses, it does a great job of getting us involved.

4u6mg8_7,4u6mg8,"I wouldn't say he's unhappy.  He ends up extremely wealthy with significant political influence, a huge number of friends, and young, beautiful, exotic wife who was completely devoted to him.

I would rather say -- as I think they do in the book -- that Edmund Dantes died in the Chateau d'If.  It was only Monte Cristo who returned to France.  The sadness is when Mercedes tells Monte Cristo that it didn't have to be that way and she never stopped loving Edmund, and Monte Cristo realizes just how high price that the Abbe Faria warned him about truly is.  He always knew it would be high, but he loses Mercedes a second time because of it.  You could say that the last man to betray Edmund Dantes is Monte Cristo himself.

Also, absolutely, *absolutely* do not watch the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo.  That movie ends with Monte Cristo kissing Mercedes and walking into the sunset arm-in-arm with her and Albert.  The 1975 made-for-TV movie with Richard Chamberlain is still my favorite movie adaptation.

4u6mg8_9,4u6mg8,"Well without going into to much detail and withholding a lot of names, my story is by no means an uncommon one. In fact it's much more prevalent than you would think.

I was raised within a relatively normal family. At 8 my mother was a victim of severe domestic abuse due to drug related problems. My parents had a falling out and my father was arrested. At 10 my mother was arrested for bad checks and DUI's. I was placed in a foster care facility and my siblings were taken away.

At 11, I moved into a church run orphanage and was sheltered by them from the world. I was shown off like some kind of bizarre trophy and constantly had random strangers enter my room and take my belongings as ""souvenirs"". I ran away at 13 and was promptly given up to go into a regular facility.

At 16, I had all but given up on myself. Faced with the reality that I would be homeless at 18, I dropped out of school and started trying to work full-time. I ended up having half my paycheck stolen by my job who told me I would go to jail for ""working a hazardous job as a minor"" (which is against the law in the usa).

At 17, the foster facility decided to kick me out a year early for failure to attend school. I left with a bag of clothes that didnt fit and slept outside my job. The book, The Count of Monte Cristo was the only belonging I had besides an old worn down bible. I read them both rather religiously. My job fired me when they found out I was sleeping outside of work.

At 18, I got my GED and was sponsored to go to college through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (which allows foster children the ability to go to college for free until they are 28). So I took some classes and worked full-time. I slept under an overpass by a highway. I would take ""showers"" at my new job in the sink. I was constantly being fired for ""failure to meet employee hygiene and health standards"".

At 20, I had failed out of college due to focusing on my finances instead. At 22, I got my drivers license and started working for an NFP. At 24, I found my relatives (whom I had never known). At 28, I now have my own place, I own a used car (2010), and I am attending college while having a full-time job.

There's a lot of things I skipped, but that's mostly the gist of it. Throughout all of that, my copy of The Count of Monte Cristo is still in one piece. It is my most prized possession. I carry it with me wherever I go and when I feel heartbroken I read a few pages to calm down. I probably owe my life to this amazing piece of literature.

Remember Fernand, yeah he went to the army and things just kept falling in his favor so now he’s rich and also a count and by the way he married Mercedes who still doesn’t love him and is sad and through herself into an education to distract herself from the sadness.

Hope is a motivating factor, but at the same time work! 

Monsieur Villifort is a character I dislike because he's a chameleon, not his fault though, because he exemplifies the character of the average human. Ditto for his second wife, madame vilifort.

1amzuvf_3,1amzuvf,"The 2002 film (fortunately there are other adaptations and this year we will have a film and a miniseries of the book) was very wrong in changing the Count. He's just a nice guy in the film, he doesn't seem like the man who lived in the dungeon for years and was overcome by deep bitterness. He remained for thirteen years in a cell at the Château D'If, during which young Edmond's frankness and generosity will slowly erode to give way to a fierce hatred against the infamous people who condemned him to the slow agony of prison._x000D_  
And the ending of the film was very clueless. The ending of the book was very appropriate. Edmond had transformed from the gentle sailor to the cruel Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of Château D’If. Edmond Haia remained there, the one who escaped was the Count of Monte Cristo. Mercedes does not love that bitter and vengeful man who is very different from her loving Edmond with whom she fell in love. And he cannot love the woman who was married to his enemy. The power of love has its limits, it can help her financially, it can spare the life of her son, but it cannot marry the one who for years was together with one of those responsible for his incarceration in Château D’if. No confession of love would make him forget that. Haydée is suitable for the Count, because she is his mirror, her father was betrayed and killed by Fernand Mondego, she was sold into slavery, until she was rescued by the Count. The same man who was responsible for Haydee losing her family and being sold into slavery, was one of those responsible for Edmond's incarceration, one of those responsible for his father's death and kidnapping his bride. The two had a similar fate and each understands well what the other went through and both have the same motivation, seeking revenge against those responsible for their suffering. Haydée is the Count's mirror, it is much easier for one to understand what the other is facing and to offer the support and love that the other needs._x000D_  
I don't know if it was the writer's philosophy or if it was some studio directive. but the ending should be bittersweet. With Edmond and Mercedes growing apart.",fernadsilv82,2024-02-16T06:50:48Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,3

In War and Peace we have the nucleus of the Kuraguins, the Rostovs, the Bezhukovs and the Bolkonskys.

Like The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, the book is not suitable for a 2-hour film adaptation. If you watch the 1958 adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov with Yul Brynner, who is a talented actor, much of the depth of the story is lost. Just like The Count, Monte Cristo, much of the content was also lost in the 2002 version. These are books that are more reminiscent of series than films and that is why their best adaptations are those with a longer duration._x000D_  
_x000D_  
All the cores of the story of Monte Cristo may seem to be loose and disconnected, but in the end everything is interconnected and has its function. It may seem that Maxmilien, valetine, Haydée, Andrea Calvacantti, Bertuccio have no importance to the story and could be discarded, but they have a function in the story._x000D_

ty3c0n_7,ty3c0n,">It really is excellent and I believe it was written in chapbook style the same way that Dickens did various other authors and in recent years Stephen King in The Green Mile.  I don't know why but I have grown to despise most of Charles Dickens books I can't remember which one it was but it was one of the ones written in chat book style where there's a great opening and a great ending and then a whole bunch of filler in the middle.  The count of Monte Cristo started to feel that way to me but I felt that even though I was being strung along a little bit there were still wonderful pearls to be found all throughout and I absolutely loved it and was also surprised that I liked it so much for what seemed to be such an overly long book.  Not that I mind long books they just have to be going somewhere and they often don't.

Is the end of the book dated? Dated ending is from the 2002 movie, because thank God there are 18 adaptations._x000D_  
The end of the movie would never happen in real life._x000D_  
The writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in a history in real life like Edmond, after leaving prison, he abandoned his mercedes to marry his haydee, Natala Dmiterievna Svetlova.

The end of the movie is very simple in making us believe that Edmond would never contain other women and forget about Mercedes._x000D_

Alexanre Dumas read Homer (Dumas A., Mes Mémoires, Paris, Bouquins, 2003, p. 590.) and was influenced by The Od.yssey. And a French article written by Tiphaine Martins says that The count of mOnte Cristo is a rewrite of the odysseyy. Edmond is inspired by Ulysses and Haydee would be Penelope._x000D_

Books on a similar level as the Count of Monte Cristo, in terms of development, story telling, and plot, would be 'War and Peace' and 'Les Misérables'. Both stories are intricately woven, character development is profound, and both writers mastered the ability to use subplots for building an amazing main plot that is fleshed out in the end. Both being translated, you'll have to choose your translation. However, I suggest finding one that doesn't abridge the stories. The historical details cut out by certain translators in each cause the stories to lose understanding behind characters' actions.

Reading 'The House of Mirth' quickly followed by 'A Room of One's Own' had a similar impact on me with a realization of the plight of women in the recent centuries, for developed nations, and currently, in developing nations. It wasn't so much of a questioning the way I live my life as opening a much greater understanding to the dynamics of society in relation to a person's sex.

One of the crappy things about reading The Count is that every book afterwards doesn't hold up. You can still find things you like about each story, and meet characters that you can relate to, or you really enjoy, but as a whole, there is no comparison. I read a lot, and I've had to relinquish the fact that I am never going to read something as magnificent as that again, but that is the price you pay for experiencing perfection. 
As far as my life went, I studied English and Film in college and now work on movies, so not too far off. 
Also, The Count was technically written by Dumas, but he was more involved in the descriptions and dialog.

The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo 
by Tom Reiss 

""WINNER OF THE 2013 PULITZER PRIZE FOR BIOGRAPHY

General Alex Dumas, is a man almost unknown today, yet his story is strikingly familiar—because his son, the novelist Alexandre Dumas, used his larger-than-life feats as inspiration for such classics as The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers.
     But, hidden behind General Dumas's swashbuckling adventures was an even more incredible secret: he was the son of a black slave—who rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our own time. 
     Born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), Alex Dumas made his way to Paris, where he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution—until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat.
     TIME magazine called The Black Count ""one of those quintessentially human stories of strength and courage that sheds light on the historical moment that made it possible."" It is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son.""

Count benefits from a good abridgment because it was serialized and a lot was ”rewritten” or “previously in the Count of Monte Cristo” to keep the reader up on the story. I started reading this book and read it straight through the night putting off studying for a test the next day I liked it so much. My dog is named after a character.

ybuprh_1,ybuprh,"It's worth noting that Dumas was paid by the line, giving him a reason to expand his dialogue a bit.

A lovely set of fantasy novels done as a Dumas pastiche are the Khaavren romances by Steven Brust.  *The Phoenix Guards* corresponds to *The Three Musketeers*, *Five Hundred Years After* corresponds to *Twenty Years After*, etc.  I haven't found *The Baron of Magister Valley* yet, but I'm told it corresponds to *The Count of Monte Cristo*.

One of the interesting things here is that these books are set in the world of the Dragaeran Empire, a setting where Brust has been writing his long-running Vladimir Taltos series for decades and which, um, do \*not\* share that writing style (these books have been described as being written in ""first person smartass"").  The Khaavren romances are supposed to be historical novels which exist in the world (and approximate time) of the Taltos books.

Brust \*loves\* playing around with structure and voice and the like.  One book in the Taltos series, which revolves around characters from the two series interacting, is divided into three parts, with the first part written in the Taltos voice and the third part written in the Khaavren voice.

I distinctly recall reading the letter at the end of the book and crying in a Starbucks trying not to cause a scene. The line that particularly got me was:

“It is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to be alive.”

2z4rfb_1,2z4rfb,"Yes the book is incredible. A classic with incredible plot and depth. It is truly one of the best.  That being said I would make three suggestions.  First, keep in mind that most stories have something to appreciate, some more than others.  You can appreciate the characters struggle (Crime and Punishment), the stories environment (the world of Xanth), the shocking twist and character's discovery of betrayal (Ender's Game), classic tale of good vs evil with an honorable and selfless character (Swan Song), the list of possibilities is truly endless.  So open your mind further to what great treasures lay waiting between the covers. Books are like people, you may have a best friend that you hold near and dear to your heart, but there are so many others out there with amazing qualities to be appreciated.  Spread the love around and enjoy each book for the time you have with it and discover what makes it different, unique and special.  You'll only read that book once for the first time, just like you'll only have one life time to appreciate the good and great people that surround you everyday. You may not even know what's great about them until you give them a chance. 
 
Second, I would suggest clearing your pallette with a historical nonfiction (Patton) or a life inspiring book (Mastery) for example.  Keep in mind all the titles in parenthesis are just suggestions. There are many others that may better suit your individual style / personality. 

And Third, like your obviously astute girlfriend suggested, maybe you need a break, go play a video game, or volunteer for the Red Cross, write personal review of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" or take tango lessons with your girlfriend. Your options are endless, but I will say one final thing. Kudos to you for reading! Far too few people still read and / or read consistently. 

Obviously you have good taste and you will figure it out. If you have read the books in parentheses, fret not the list could go on for a very long time.  Best wishes with your reading future.

2z4rfb_2,2z4rfb,"Genuine question, not a hipster-ish criticism of everything that's popular, why do you all like that book so much?

I **hated** the Count of Monte Cristo, absolutely hated it. I'm seriously wondering whether I read a different translation to you lot. Is that possible? Are there multiple ones floating around?

Edit: I can't find the name of the translator, but I'm going to include a piece of sample text that sums up why reading it was such an unpleasant experience, in my opinion.

>Albert had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum, while his less favoured companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian; and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of his guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed saved by such as have visited them, and more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of an eastern clime.

That monstrosity of a sentence would have got me hung drawn and quartered if I'd handed it to my English teacher. What's more is that it takes place during a frankly tedious description of two Frenchmen's holiday in Italy. I know they eventually run into the eponymous count and that one of them eventually turns out to be the son of his betrayer, but the reader doesn't know that. You have to just slog through page after page about two people you've been given no reason to care about and it's made worse by prose like the above.",delta_baryon,2015-03-15T18:44:28Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,2

svzcj4_3,svzcj4,When I can’t get into reading a book I’ve had success with the audiobook.  I’m actually listening to The Count of Monte Cristo after having read it years ago and listening has helped me keep all the characters straight.,SweetMeta,2022-02-19T04:24:09Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,3
svzcj4_4,svzcj4,"> I could easily cut about 400 pages out of the book and not feel like I’d missed much.

I honestly don't know how this would be possible. It's a very plot-heavy book—Dumas, unlike some authors like Victor Hugo, doesn't go off on random political or historical tangents. Cutting anything of length would require removing entire subplots and major plot beats (and it seems like [that's what all abridgements end up doing](https://abbreviatedmontecristo.blogspot.com/2021/08/section-one-text-abridgements-meant-for.html?m=1), with varying levels of success).

For that reason, this is a book I'd strongly recommend be read unabridged the first time. The Harry Potter series is over 4,000 pages—if you can get through that, you can get through The Count of Monte Cristo, especially since the book moves so quickly.

Oh, and get the Robin Buss translation. Translation can make a huge difference—the ones in the public domain might very well be a slog.

If someone has their heart set on an abridgement, though, the Blair is supposedly the best.",jefrye,2022-02-19T06:17:07Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,4

44vfyy_6,44vfyy,"I always say the Count of Monte Cristo is best viewed as a collection of short stories with a unifying narrative, like *Tales of the Arabian Nights*. Dumas constantly invites this comparison, with about a dozen different characters saying ""Wow, this is like something out of Arabian Nights"" at various points in the book. 

These little digressions aren't meant to be viewed as a distraction from the main story; they're fun vignettes in their own right. It's *fun* to watch the Count flash money around like a rap star in pantaloons (or whatever they wear, I don't remember), just like it's fun to hear about a papal assassination plot, or a Napoleonic conspiracy headed by a quadrepligic, or a guy escaping a dungeon. And so the book tries to do each one justice, lingering on them much longer than ""necessary"" from the perspective of the overall plot. Of course your mileage may vary as to which of these stories are fun and which aren't; myself, I'll admit the chapter about the miraculous invention of the telegraph hasn't aged so well. But you lose a lot by systematically cutting that stuff out just to focus on the main revenge plot.",WheresMyElephant,2016-02-09T19:49:51Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,6
qznano_1,qznano,"""The Haydee thing is horrible cringe and definitely diminished my enthusiasm for the book. Write that off as some gross grooming fantasy of Dumas's time I guess... ""

In the Soviet film adaptation of the novel The Prisoner of Château d'If (Узник замка Иф) in 1988, we see the charming actress Nadira Mirzaeva as Haydee.

This is exactly how I pictured Haydee when I read the novel. And she really does look like a concubine in her revealing, translucent outfit.   And immediately you can easily understand the count: is it possible to refuse such a woman if she asks for your love?   It is known that the film's director, Georgy Yungvald-Khilkevich, did not resist Nadira. He left his family and married her.

Edmond always remembered and loved exactly TWO MERCEDES, whom he met in his youth, not the Countess of Morcerf. Likewise, Mercedes loved the sailor EDMOND DANTES, not the Count of Monte Cristo. Time and distance have changed them a lot, they will never be the same as they knew each other in the past. I believe that renewing Edmond's relationship with Mercedes would be simply impossible.

uc99zn_1,uc99zn,"Alexandre Dumas is awesome. I read *The Count of Monte Cristo* many times when much younger. 

I grew up with his books included in our family's library of classics, so I first read it when much too young to really understand it. 

So, like many of those books written by authors from earlier centuries, I didn't quite get the scope of what he was writing about until I was much older. My tendency back then was to just skim past the ""boring"" (i.e., just didn't understand the context) parts and follow the main story.

The fact that I could do that, and still keep coming back to re-read and garner new aspects of the story that I'd missed when younger, says a lot about his ability for storytelling. It was the same thing with the Musketeers books.

Dumas, like his fellow classic authors (Jane Austen, Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, et al) give us modern readers a unique view of the times they lived in, as long as we remember they are writing fiction from *their* world view, not ours. 

Dumas was writing 'historical' fiction for his own contemporaries, and a lot can be gleaned about how *he* viewed his own times from how he presented his characters.

I have thought much about Haydee and I have concluded that she is a better fit for the Count of Monte Cristo as a partner than Mercedes. Mercedes was a lovely girl for Eduard Dantes but Haydee knew the pain of imprisonment, the despair of not having freedom, the helplessness that consumes a person when they are trapped by others' wills and wants. Haydee could understand who Dantes had become as a result of his unfair imprisonment; Mercedes had no reference for this level of pain in her cushioned life.

p8ahyn_1,p8ahyn,"I found de Villefort's punishment to be the harshest of them all. Death is better than seeing 5 family members die and then be driven to insanity due to the psychological pressure, especially since de Villefort seemed to be a sort of counterpart to the Count of Monte Cristo in a lot of respects, namely;

▪︎They both come across each other on the day of their respective betrothals. 

▪︎Even the fact that Caderousse seems to know the stories of the other conspirators (and even Mercédès!), but not that of de Villefort echoes the whole Edmond Dantés's disappearance. They both seemed to have vanished during that time frame.

▪︎There is also the fact that they both are misanthropic narcissists, who believe themselves to be Providence in their own ways, one working with the law and one outside of it, both seeking to punish the wrongdoers. 

▪︎They both a persuasive and fascinating orators.

▪︎The fact that there was always an affinity/fascination that they had for each other. Both as de Villefort- Dantès and de Villefort- Count of Monte Cristo. Their conversations prove that. 

The punishment meted out to de Villefort is too hard, even for the crime of having unfairly sentenced him to prison for 14 years. If one were to compare that to all the people who go to prison nowadays and turn out to be innocent after decades...we would be aghast if such a punishment was given to the judges/lawyers who put those innocent people away.

De Villefort for me was an amazing character. He had plenty of redeeming qualities alongside his flaws, which made him a very fascinating **Anti-Villain** to Count of Monte Cristo's **Anti-Hero**. 

Danglars was let go too easily in my opinion and that portion felt a bit hurried. He was the orchestrator of the entire plan, he was a cold and indifferent father/husband, he was an asshole. Not a single redeeming quality was demonstrated by him. Not one. If Caderousse and Fernand had to die, if Mercédès and Albert had to start over (just guilty by association?!), if de Villefort had to suffer for eternity, why did Danglars get away with paying so little?

Well, the de Villefort situation cleary shook Dantès up. He was starting to realise just how wrong he had been for going on this path, however, he was not strong enough to face that idea head on. It would have devastated him to have been this wrong for this long. Instead, he chose to visit Château d'If and revisit his cell to remind himself of his determination. To remind himself of his suffering. He looked for a sign and found it in the epigraph of Abbé Faria's book. But still, his belief in his righteous anger, in his righteous vengeance, had suffered a big blow. 

Maybe it was present in his mind that he had done to de Villefort, what de Villefort had done to his father, namely, caused him to believe that his child was dead, when it wasn't.  He had exacted more blood from de Villefort than was his due.

Similarly, due to his actions, Albert, a brave, friendly, warm, loving man, had to go out and make his fortune. For committing no other crime than to be Fernand's son. Same for Mercédès, who ought not to have suffered the way she did. She lost her lover and then her loving husband, through no fault of hers.

No matter how much Dantès would have tried, there is no way he could have assuaged his guilt, which is why, by going easy on the least redeemable, least worthy,  least innocent of the original 4, he manages to at least feel a bit better about himself.

Later, by the ridiculously selfish act of bringing his friend Maximilien to the point of suicide, just to be able to save him at the last moment, he convinces himself that the scales were a little more balanced. It was dangerously childish to have done that. Just as it was his hubris and need to act the saviour which makes him wait till the last minute with Monsieur Morrell on that fateful September 5th. 

But Dantès's thoughts/words/actions in some ways feel always a bit anachronistic to me. He is wise beyond his years when he is a young lad, and childishly naive, impulsive and cruel when he is almost a middle-aged man. 

So, to me it definitely seems as if the laceration to drain the pus of revenge went too deep during de Villefort's turn. Dantès bled and finally decided to let that wound scab over and start to heal. He finally wanted to look towards the future, not at the past.",sekhmet0108,2021-08-21T23:06:19Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1

21t4qs_10,21t4qs,"Hey, I actually just finished writing a book inspired by *The Count of Monte Cristo*!  Dumas' masterwork is, in my opinion, one of the finest literary works every created.

The problem with *The Three Musketeers*(only when directly compared to *The Count*) is that it tends to focus less on the building of tension. It's a less personal novel, more concerned with male camaraderie than personal satisfaction. So, though seemingly similar, *The Three Musketeers* is an entirely different sort of book.  To be honest, I've always found it strange how often the two are mentioned in the same breath(though understandable).

 While *The Three Musketeers* is about shared adventure and fellowship, *The Count of Monte Cristo* is deeply personal, focusing primarily on the titular Count.  For myself, the subtle building of tension in *The Count* is what makes the ending so satisfying.

The Dumas arc typically places a protagonist at a level of reasonable happiness in the beginning of the story before plunging them into the depths of sorrow and misery(typically this is a very lonely place).  Then, our hero claws his way out(with no small amount of romance and swashing of buckles) and arrives at a level of happiness slightly higher than before his fall.  A result of the difference between the lowest point and the highest point of happiness is that our hero seems incredibly happy at the end(and we, as readers, feel incredibly satisfied).

In essence, *The Count of Monte Cristo* is much more focused on this arc than *The The Three Musketeers*.  This is why it seems so much more satisfying.  The tension built during Edmond Dantès lonely imprisonment and mysterious return to society is released in small( relatively) climaxes that, while satisfying, do not end the readers singular preoccupation with the central protagonist. We are still very much interested in the fate of Edmond Dantès until the last page. The tension that I previously mentioned is contained in this.  It starts building during Edmond's fall, builds tighter and tighter through his imprisonment, and is finally released in his vengeance and confrontation with the antagonists.  Multiple protagonists merely dilute this.

HOWEVER, *The Three Musketeers* is still an amazing novel and absolutely deserves to be read.  While it lacks the focus of *The Count*, it makes up for it with the sense of camaraderie and fellowship the story imparts.

tl;dr *The Count of Monte Cristo* is practically in a different genre than *The Three Musketeers*, but both are very good.",CalParmainII,2014-03-31T15:59:38Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,10

But if your edition was unabridged, then The Three Musketeers is a noticeable step in another direction. Where Edmond Dantes took center stage for most of The Count of Monte Cristo in his pursuit of complete and utter revenge, the story of the three musketeers covers 4 men in their pursuit of friendship, country and honor. Different overtones to say the least. You will still see, for the most part, Dumas' style in the writing, but to say that lives will utterly collapse like the Danglar's or Villefort is incorrect.

mmp5jb_1,mmp5jb,"Oh, yeah, this is a really great point.

In the time in which Dumas' first massive success was published, everyone in his potential audience would have known of the relatively recent history of Napoleon.  You could define that period of French history in four parts:

1.) Revolution, revolution, revolution

2.) Napoleon takes over, starts many wars.

3.) Napoleon defeated and exiled.

4.) Napoleon comes back for about three months, is re-defeated and re-exiled.

In between all the Napoleon-ing, the French kings come back, and are they ever mad about this whole not-having-a-king thing.  Meanwhile, the people go from having to say ""Yay, Napoleon, our hero!"" to ""I am so glad that warmongering monster is gone"" to ""Yay, Napoleon is back, our hero!"" to ""Can we just put barbed wire around the island he's on, already?""  It's a tense time, and partisans on one side or the other go from being heroes to fleeing for their lives.  This bouncing back and forth is an enormous, integral part of the plot of *The Count of Monte Cristo.*

There was a time (generally, when kings were in charge of everything) when it wasn't of much use for ordinary people to involve themselves in politics; you could get out of any discussion of the fate of nations by saying, with a shy smile, ""I am not political.""  (That attitude pretty much died with World War II, incidentally.)  Dantes is one of those apolitical folks; when de Villefort asks about his political opinions, Dantes artlessly replies that he respects his boss Morrel, he loves his father, and he adores his fiancee.

During the specific period covered by the early part of the book, Napoleon has been defeated and exiled for the first time, and because the captain of the *Pharaon* is a secret Bonapartist, he is carrying a secret letter for the exiled Emperor.  When the captain is taken fatally ill, he asks Dantes to deliver the letter to the island on which Napoleon is exiled.  Being a dutiful and honorable fellow, Dantes agrees.

Danglars, who just despises Dantes, sees an opportunity to mess him up.  When he and some friends get to drankin' and cussin', it turns out that all of them have grievances against Dantes.  So Danglars writes a letter to the authorities, anonymously denouncing Dantes as a damn *Bonapartist!*  The letter suggests that the cops pick Dantes up and ask about a message he delivered to the exiled Emperor and then they'll see, you betcha, what a damn traitor.

The prosecutors, of course, deal with endless vendettas and denunciations, and they're smart enough to be suspicious of these anonymous letters trying to get rivals in trouble.  Watch what de Villefort does when he deals wth the denunciation, though; it turns out that being the King's Prosecutor, at that time, is not an unalloyed, apolitical thing.  De Villefort's connections will influence the rest of the story.

As novels go, *The Count of Monte Cristo* is indeed something of a doorstop.  It's a product of a particular time and place, and part of the pleasure of the story is a long, leisurely ramble through Europe, the judicial system, kings and emperors, romance, injustice, triumph, wealth, and vengeance.  It is an *enormously* satisfying ride; every stitch is gathered, every plot point resolved, every injustice addressed.  I re-read it from time to time, and it always takes me weeks to finish.  It's a classic because the human soul longs for justice, even if it has to be engineered in opposition to society itself.",McJohn_WT_Net,2021-04-08T13:05:40Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1

mmp5jb_4,mmp5jb,"You're very welcome!  I hope you're gathering from the replies of the others that this is a favorite book for many of us, and with excellent reason.  You might keep an eye open for things like casual racism, the occasional note of anti-Semitism, and the general helplessness of the women characters, but the story is a reflection of the time in which it was written, Dumas goes out of his way to emphasize the nobility of people the French were known to hate, and narrative expediency requires that someone has to get tied up from time to time, no matter how easy it might be for them to saw off the ropes and escape.

Yeah, about those women characters.  Astonishingly, *The Count of Monte Cristo* contains one of the very first depictions in a Western novel of a lesbian couple, and although they aren't entirely successful in sawing off the ropes, so to speak, it's nonetheless true that the Count gives them material support without judging, and that the only person who criticizes them is a complete jerk for more reasons than homophobia.  They get closer to a happily-ever-after than most of the other couples in the book, that's for sure!

Dumas also offers a rare portrait of admirable courage, nobility, and tragedy from a society Frenchmen of his time tended to scorn: the Ottoman Empire and one of its ill-fated rulers, Ali Pasha.  That part of the book really is based on a historical event, and two characters in the book are marked by it for the rest of their lives, a Frenchman committing a foul betrayal that makes his fortune, and an Ottoman noblewoman staggering through life traumatized by the violent deaths of everyone she's ever loved. 

Oh, while we're at it, you might enjoy going from *The Count of Monte Cristo* (Dumas's first giant hit) to *The Three Musketeers*, which features a hair-raising villain referred to as ""Milady"".

The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo Paperback
by Tom Reiss (Author)

Amazon.com Review

Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012: Generations have been enthralled by Alexandre Dumas' characters, especially the wronged hero in The Count of Monte Cristo and the daring swordsmen in The Three Musketeers. Yet few realize that these memorable characters were inspired by Dumas' father, General Alex Dumas, the son of a French count and a black Haitian slave. Tom Reiss brings the elder Dumas alive with previously unpublished correspondence and meticulous research, providing the context necessary to understand how exceptional his life as a mulatto general in a slave-owning empire truly was. From single-handedly holding a bridge in the Alps against 20 enemies to spending years held captive in a fortress, Alex Dumas is a fascinating character that not even his son's vivid imagination could have dreamed up. --Malissa Kent> ",,2013-09-14T19:03:23Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,3

qjfu8u_1,qjfu8u,"The film The Prisoner of Château d'If is a much better adaptation than The count of Monnte Cristo (2002)._x000D_  
In the film adaptation The Prisoner of Château d'If (Узник замка Иф) we see the amazing actress Nadira Mirzaeva as Haydee. This is exactly how I pictured Haydee when I read the novel. And she really does look like a concubine in her revealing translucent clothes. It was this actress who, it seems to me, managed to accurately convey the image of the ardent and faithful Haydee. And immediately you can easily understand the count: is it possible to refuse such a woman if she asks for your love?_x000D_  
The director of the film, Georgy Yungvald-Khilkevich could not resist Nadira. He left the family and married her.The 2002 version was a mess. The movie altered Danglars and Mondego. The film changed the tripartite division of Dantes' enemies that were the mainstay of the Modern State: financial power, military might and justice. They symbolize all the gears of the French State that brought about the downfall of Dantes_x000D_  
And Mondego shows dishonorable actions of French military who would go to help and were bribed, Danglars who is a banker who uses dishonest means to enrich himself. Corruption among the military and the financial system. France's bases were rotten._x000D_  
For anyone who has read the book (or watch any reasonable adaptation), Monte Cristo is the symbol of the sublime being, someone who believed to be guided by God. Umberto Eco explained it by saying he was one of the first portraits of Nietzsche's Overman. Well, in this movie all this magnificence has been converted to a middle American super-hero, with middle American values. I'm sorry, but there are so many American topics in this movie, and so little from Alexandre Dumas' Count, apart from the name, that it just hurts to see it. Not only because it is a hardly an ""adaptation"", but also because it represents the contrary of the original meaning of the story._x000D_  
2 hours is certainly not enough to adapt a 1400 page novel, especially one as dense as the Count of Monte Cristo. Leaving out the incredibly complex revenge plot in the books can certainly be forgiven, even if it leaves the revenge part of the plot lazy and cheesy at best. But not understanding the core message of the film - that revenge can backfire and cause you to become a monster - is unforgivable. The Count of Monte Cristo is not a revenge story, quite the opposite. In the penultimate chapter of the book, the Count meditates on the distinction of justice and revenge. Justice is impersonal, it is not about deriving pleasure. It is through the regret of the consequences of his revenge, and his embrace of forgiveness after justice has been given._x000D_  
Just a few examples of these ""incorporated"" values/topics:here, as in any other Hollywood movie, the good guys are good and the bad guys are very bad. So, they thought necessary to add some battering in the prison. Besides, Fernand is not a common man taking profit of the situation, as in the book, here he has a wicked soul, and so the ""adapters"" decide to show it by making him committing murder and being an unfaithful husband. There is a scene, where Fernand and Monte Cristo fight with their fists, that is ridiculous: where is the gentlemanliness that not only the book, but also the place and time of the story demands? Even the_x000D_  
movements of the camera in that moment are offensive: you don't know what movie you're watching, Monte cristo or Rambo 6._x000D_  
It's Americanized in a way that class differences and nobility vs. Common folk are completely ignored. Yet the story is set in France. In America, (at least in fiction, like North and South by John Jakes, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, etc.), one's origins didn't matter. You could come to America as an indentured servant or dirt poor, but through talent and ambition, you can elevate your family into the upper and respectable classes in a few generations. And marry into established old-money families._x000D_  
In France, it wasn't like that, not in 1815. The scriptwriters in the movie didn't HAVE to make Fernand an aristocrat from the start, but they did, opening up a huge can of worms and plot holes galore. Dumas did it right... Fernand as a humble fisherman, drafted into the army, made a name for himself and switched allegiances at just the right time, and enriched himself by betraying Ali Pasha, and coming home rich, and hailed as a hero by the Royalist faction that came to power. Dumas knew and understood France. The screenwriters of the 2002 movie did not._x000D_  
In France, there was a great formality in the relationship between a Count and his servants. Only certain servants of very high rank (Baptistin, Bertuccio) could speak directly to the Count, and not in crude slang. Others had to ask Baptistin or Bertuccio to speak for them._x000D_  
In the book, Edmond Dantes takes years to plan his revenge, not weeks or months, and does it in a very calculated, cold-blooded way, weaving an intricate, multi-faceted web in which to snare his enemies. In the movie, Edmond is still a hot-head, even after all those years in the Chateau d'If, and I could not help but feel cheated by his rather slap-dash methods._x000D_  
But the movie... has Fernand (a Viscount) being best friends from childhood with a common boy, and he wants to marry a common girl. Fernand's boss is Morrel, and he has to wait for Morell to dismiss him before he can go. Danglars (looking very dirty and grungy) casually invites Viscount Fernand to drink with him and speaks to him very informally._x000D_  
The Count's ""revenge"" on all of his enemies consists of dangling the Spada treasure in front of them and they all fall for it, lured like moths to a flame? How was Dantes privy to details of Clarion's murder, since he wasn't a witness to it and neither of the 2 culprits told him about it? Villefort was too experienced to fall into that primitive trap of the count and confess the crime that way._x000D_  
Edmond and Mercedes starting from scratch would be implausible. Both Mercedes and Monte Cristo ""burned out"" have a common sadness, but different memories. And Mercedes could hardly love Monte Cristo. Her heart belonged to the young, cheerful, confident, open, and noble Dantes, not the vengeful, dark Monte Cristo intriguing. She did not even love him anymore, but his memory of him was bright, joyful. Too deadly contrast Is it possible to go back, go back 20 years and intend to be happy? Years have passed and this is not the same Edmond, and Mercedes is already different. The past must remain in the past._x000D_  
Count and Mercedes wouldn't work in the end. Over 20 years have gone by, and both of them had irreversibly changed. They can't live in the past, and that's all they have in-common. If they_x000D_  
got together, Mercedes would be upset with the Count and his ways- she wouldn't understand him, and she'd constantly tell him ""You weren't like this before"" and she'd tell her ""I'm not 19 years old anymore"". Both would be unhappy._x000D_  
Haydee is a better fit for the Count of Monte Cristo as a partner than Mercedes. Mercedes was a lovely girl for Edmond Dantes but Haydee knew the pain of imprisonment, the despair of not having freedom, the helplessness that consumes a person when they are trapped by others' wills and wants. Haydee could understand who Dantes had become as a result of his unfair imprisonment; Mercedes had no reference for this level of pain in her cushioned life. How could Mercedes ever understand the forces that shaped her childhood sweetheart into the man he'd become? Due to their shared empathy, it was extremely appropriate for the Count and Haydee to be together at the end of the story",circe1971,2022-12-05T00:55:29Z,3,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1

4azeal_2,4azeal,"> ""Revenge isn't always the best thing"" morality tales are a dime a dozen and always have been. 

True, but then, every story has pretty much been done before.  The joy in good literature is finding someone who does it in a unique way, and I think Dumas does.  Or at least, did - of course people copied him.  ""Dime a dozen"" didn't necessarily apply at the time of writing.  Which of course is *not* an argument that something is good simply because it was the first to do it!  I just think it's a context worth giving to the novel when you read it to help with understanding and appreciation.

In any case, I'm not trying to brow-beat you into submitting and declaring it to be the greatest piece of literature!  Just offering a constructive discussion, eh?

If you like *The Count of Monte Cristo* but want something more unique, interesting, with more action, and of course, *shorter*, I would suggest picking up *The Stars My Destination* by Alfred Bester.  It's pretty much *The Count of Monte Cristo* but in space, and everyone can teleport with their thoughts.

It's ""classic"" in the sense that it's old, and it's a damn good story in terms of character, structure, and plot. But it's not one of those books you ""simply must read"" to consider yourself cultured. Hell, with what passes for cultured these days, you might as well read Clive Cussler. 

Also: remember that it was written in French. If you're reading it in English, it's already a translation. So why not go for a more modern, easy version? Like, say, one that uses Mr. instead of M.?

I would hazard a guess that in those days people (those that read, that is, and most didn't) had more time to read and did it far more slowly than we would. It was also written in a different language, which may have something to do with it; language shapes the way we think and express ourselves and could easily influence the way we tell a story.

I also read The Count of Monte Cristo last year, and it ended as a task of duty rather than pleasure, I certainly didn't enjoy it. And come to think of it, there are quite a few world-famous titles that I've disliked or couldn't finish - Heart of Darkness was one, One Hundred Years of Solitude was another, while some very respected authors like Patricia Highsmith and Muriel Spark leave me cold. Others I can read with pleasure but with a constant awareness of their shortcomings - Agatha Christie for instance.  We don't owe authors a duty to enjoy their work. It doesn't bother me that very few people read the books I write, and I think they're great (but I suppose I would, wouldn't I?).

Sometimes one meets an author who is difficult to read but repays the effort. Dumas isn't one of them. I am thinking of Dorothy Sayers and my personal favourite of all time, Mervyn Peake with Gormenghast.

The vengeance plot is venerable, and (particularly) Western lit is just stuffed with 'em.  Dumas was working within a well-known tradition, but where he shone was in his narrative choices: the wrong done to his hero was completely unjustifiable, the dazzling fortune he acquired was boundless, and the vengeance campaign was total.

The novel The Last Payment (Последний платёж), written as a sequel to The Count of Monte Cristo. His hero Edmond Dantes, after visiting Moscow, becomes a persecutor-avenger of the killer of the great Russian poet A.S. Pushkin, Georges-Charles Dantes, whom he considers to be his relative. The novel was first published in Russia in 1990.

Plot. Edmond Dantes came to Moscow in the spring of 1838 with Haide, who had already become his wife and gave birth to his son and daughter. In one of the restaurants, one of the students, having learned the name of the count, slaps him in the face. Soon the Count of Monte Cristo learns that he was confused with Georges Dantes. The count did not like the fact that his last name was involved in a scandal, and he decides to take revenge on Pushkin's killer.

There is a conspiracy theory in Russia that Alexandre Dumas is actually Pushikin, he faked his death and fled to France.

Both are of African descent.

Alexandre Dumas avoided the controversy of Edmond taking haydee from another guy.

Author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.who wrote the famous book ""The Gulag Archipelago"" had a traumatic experience in a communist gulag like Edmond at the château d'if. He went to denounce the crimes of the socialist regime, Solzhenitsyn meets a girl 20 years younger than him who was married with a small child, her name was Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova. Her family was a victim of Stalinism and she helped Solzhenitsyn write and smuggle his books out of the USSR. And the two began a loving relationship despite the large age difference and she was married to a man who was 1 year younger than Is it over there. Solzhenitsyne Natalia shared a common past, shared political thoughts, and helped to denounce the crimes of the USSR. Haydee and Edmond had a common sorcerer and both wanted revenge on Mondego, the difference being that Haydee was single and Natalia Svetlova was married.

afose0_1,afose0,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a fascinating read, but as 'art' to react to, I find that for its length, there is very little that prompts deep introspection and reflection beyond the first quarter of the book (before Paris).

The entire Paris portion is predominantly infused with somewhat contrived mystery. A lot of it is about what we don't know yet or what we shall never know.

The first kind of mystery (what we don't know yet) involves trying to find out what Monte Cristo has in plan and how these various characters ultimately tie into the plot. It makes for suspense and entertainment, but that is not depth.

The second kind of mystery (what we shall never know), on careful examination, reflects weakness in narrative coupled with disguised ignorance. We never get a good glimpse of what Monte Cristo was up to in the several years between Marseille and Rome. The life of Sinbad the Sailor, is arguably extremely important, since those are the very years right after freedom. Also, the portrayals of Eastern culture as being mysterious (for example in the Ali's characterisation) feel superficial.

This sense of mystery, created by hiding information from the reader, makes the reader wonder; and this wonder, to the uninitiated, is easily mistaken for philosophical depth.

I was extremely excited to read The Count of Monte Cristo due to the praise it gets, and the first quarter lived up to my expectations. Beyond that though, the novel is entertaining but unremarkable.",,2019-01-16T02:56:33Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1

I believe that a lot of the structural issues, character bloat and density of the book (and of other similar novels) can be blamed on the serialization format. It encouraged successful authors to stretch out their stories for financial purposes. 

This wasn't exactly a bad thing at the time; this was before television, radio, etc., so serialized stories/novels were something people could follow, looking forward to the next installment and discussing it with their friends and family.

Believing that Haydée has for him only “the love and tenderness of a daughter”, Monte Cristo understands for the first time that she might love him for real when he sees her concern for him the night before the duel and carries her in his arms to her apartment (“the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father”, ch.90). He regretfully concludes that he might have had a chance to be loved and therefore to be happy (“‘Alas’, murmured he, with intense suffering,‘I might, then, have been happy yet’”, ch.90). His happiness to see her, when he returns from the duel, is not less intense than hers, although not as evident. Kissing her forehead makes both their hearts beat strongly (“a kiss which made two hearts throbat once, the one violently, the other\[silently\]”, ch.92) and he dares to believe that he can love again. This belief is confirmed after his journey into the past of his imprisonment. Already having overcome the doubts risen in him with Edouard’s death, he overcomes another doubt concerning the woman he loves: while passing by the village of the Catalans, he looks away and murmurs Haydée’s name “in a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love” (ch.113).

I n the last chapter (ch.117), although he knows that he loves her, the Count is still not sure if she loves him back (in his own words, “when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in \[happiness\]”, ch.3). Therefore, with his mission accomplished, Monte Cristo is determined to punish himself for the pain he caused to the innocents and leave her side, not wanting to allow his destiny to overshadow hers. He sets her free, restoring her position, fortune and name, and asks her to “forget even my name, and be happy”. When she clearly confesses that she loves him, he accepts her redeeming love (“Let it be, then, as you wish\[...\] Love me then, Haidee!“).",ivanrosion,2020-07-24T23:19:34Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,3

Some of my lengthy favorites:

* *The Lord of the Rings* \-- great world building, good character development, and the blueprint for epic fantasy
* *Don Quixote* \-- I think it was my dad who told me this book can be summed up as ""Sancho Panza sees the world as it is, but Don Quixote sees it as it should be.""  I didn't really understand what that meant until I read the whole thing.
* *The Count of Monte Cristo* \-- There's so much character development, interwoven storylines, and scheming in the book that no film has (and probably ever will) do it justice.
* *Le Morte d'Arthur* \-- Sure it's a difficult read.  But it's arguably the definitive work on Arthurian legend, and a reason it was a favorite of the likes of Steinbeck.
* *The Decameron* \-- I contend that this book, along with *The Heptameron* and *The Canterbury Tales*, give the most accurate glimpses into everyday life in medieval and Renaissance times.
* *David Copperfield* \-- Dickens is obviously famous for his memorable characters, but in this book he gives us arguably one of the greatest literary villains of all time, Uriah Heep.
* *Vanity Fair* \-- I'm not sure it meets the qualifications, but I enjoyed the character development and the way the characters' desires and machinations play out against the cultural and societal norms.

9cogf7_1,9cogf7,"The count is one of my favorite books. I’d have to to re-read the original and the abridged version you read to figure out what the differences were, obviously an abridged version can change from translation to translation.

As with a lot of books in that time period, they Would use a relationship between a indentured servant/slave and their master as a way to define the masters morality. They say that he tried to free the slaves, and that the slave rejected that freedom was a sign that the slave was loyal to the person because they were a good person.

Also keep in mind that time periods will look at things in a slightly different standpoint. In our modern age we may look at the relationship as completely abusive, assuming of course the full version gives the same feeling, but it might represent something slightly different in that time.  Alexander Dumas was a black man, so I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that he would not write a slave in a bad relationship without good reason.

To me the Count of Monte cristo was both a Revenge story And the story of obsession. We see a man who was trying to do the right thing by everyone and his entire life was destroyed, he lost his father, his career, his friends, and the woman he loved. We see a man going through the steps of revenge that we believe are justified because of what happened to him, but at the same time some of the people around him start to object because he is the most insane with his desire of vengeance. But for me at least I thought they stayed with him because even though he was up obsessed they still cared about him, Because they believed strongly that he was a good person who was done wrong and they desired justice being served because they loved him. So they are willing to put up with what from the outside will seem as abuse and insanity.

It has been a few years since I read the book, so I can’t be sure how accurate anything I said it. So take it with a grain of salt.",Cheatcodechamp,2018-09-03T19:44:01Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1

2pbkh6_3,2pbkh6,"the french miniseries one from 1998 (that i linked) seems to likely be decent, since the french actor is a well known quality french actor, and there are bound to be many details true to the period that would be well known in france, but missing in english productions. But it's a mini series, so finding all of the episode might be a problem, and it is a longer viewing experience, vs the common 2 hour movie.

The 2002 movie looks good. 

> Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4 writing, ""The Count of Monte Cristo is a movie that incorporates piracy, Napoleon in exile, betrayal, solitary confinement, secret messages, escape tunnels, swashbuckling, comic relief, a treasure map, Parisian high society and sweet revenge, and brings it in at under two hours, with performances by good actors who are clearly having fun. This is the kind of adventure picture the studios churned out in the Golden Age--so traditional it almost feels new.""

you might also want to check out the the wikipedia article on the novel itself for details that might have slipped into the cracks when you were reading the original novel.",Scientologist2a,2014-12-15T14:17:16Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,3

2mdfeh_2,2mdfeh,"I've read several versions of this novel and the unabridged [Penguin classics version](http://www.amazon.com/Count-Monte-Cristo-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449264/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1416079075&sr=1-1&keywords=count+of+monte+cristo&pebp=1416079078220) is the best.  Here's some things I like about the unabridged story that I feel compelled to discuss.

1.) It's so common in shorter versions and TV or Movie remakes to see Edmond escape the Chateau d'If and immediately begin enacting his revenge on his enemies.  In the full story Edmond took quite some time to locate the treasure.  Then after doing some quick acts of kindness he disappeared for twenty years.  Lived various lives, sailed all over the world, played pirate, educated himself.  It was only by years of experience, exploration, and experimentation that he was able to develop the traits necessary to sell the eccentric, cosmopolitan Count of Monte Cristo persona to the Parisian nobility.  He is a well rounded individual who languishes in his wealth and freedom but at the core of it all is his unfaltering desire for vengeance that he carries for decades.  And it's true, revenge is a dish best served cold. 

2.) We don't see this much in film adaptations but The Count of Monte Cristo is just one of many personas that Edmond adopts to complete his righteous mission.  For some of his enemies he appears before them as both the Count and the Abbot Busoni and they can't tell the difference.  Not only is Edmond a master of disguise but maybe one of the greatest actors ever.

3.) Edmond Dantes smokes weed regularly and this is mentioned several times in the unabridged version.  As a potential role model, I advocate for this.

4.) The most powerful part of the novel that I recall is when Edmond's vengeance results in the death of a child.  He has a moment of doubt with Villefort screaming at him, ""Are you fully avenged?"".  He questions whether or not he is really doing God's will.  And then decides that, yes he is and he will continue to enact his revenge.  This part, more than anything else, show just how much Edmond is motivated by vengeance.

I could talk about this novel all day but these are just some parts that really convince me to stick with the unabridged version",epops,2014-11-15T19:57:30Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,2

Edmond doesn't believe he belongs in France anymore, he feels betrayed by his country of origin. And haydee having lived a history of suffering like his, there was a strong connection between them. Mercedes was her first love, but Haydee was the person who most understood Edmond's distress and helped him deal with it.

odysseus killed the men who harassed his wife and tried to kill his son. He did everything to protect his family.

Edmond realizes that revenge doesn't bring happiness and doesn't bring back what happened, doesn't change the past, that he was becoming a monster because of hate.

30562f_1,30562f,"I've enjoyed several of Dostoevsky's books (long, from the same period as the Count of Monte Cristo, some cursory similarities), but this book was a slog for me. Sure Edmond Dantes suffered long and horribly, but a protagonist that is infinitely superior to the cartoonishly villainous objects of his revenge in every conceivable way is down right boring. This author self-insert fantasy gets 4 out of 5 yawns on the boredom scale.

Gonna have to reread All the Pretty Horses after this, just to cleanse my palate.",MoondogZero,2022-07-27T10:18:04Z,0,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,1
30562f_2,30562f,"The count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books I have ever read.

Alexandre Dumas i Homer (Dumas A., Mes Mémoires, Paris, Bouquins, 2003, p. 590.) and The Odyssey was his inspiration for the book.

Edmond Dantes was inspired by Ulysses' journey as he returned to seek revenge on those who had usurped everything from him, just as Ulysses killed Penelope's suitors when they tried to usurp his wife and his kingdom. Edmond's disguise resembles Ulysses' disguise when he returns to Ithaca. haydee symbolizes the sweet and loyal Penelope. And like Ulysses, Edmond is resourceful in his revenge. He uses ruses to get his revenge.

Alexandre Dumas had a great culture and was inspired by the classics to create this masterpiece.

I liked the French movies Monte Cristo (1929) and Le Comte de mOnte Cristo (1943) the most.

In 2024 we will have a new adaptation with Pierre Niney as The Count. An adaptation made by France.",Calm-Violinist9453,2023-08-25T01:33:09Z,1,COMMENT,Mystery,Count of Monte Cristo,2
