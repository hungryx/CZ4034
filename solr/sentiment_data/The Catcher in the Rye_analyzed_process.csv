5ihpl8_1,5ihpl8,"I think the age at which you read The Catcher in the Rye and/or your ability to relate to Holden Caulfield plays an significant role in whether or not a person enjoys this book.


I actually picked it up in high school because we were required to write a research paper about a book and it seemed like a well-known book with a lot of resources and material to pull from; nothing more, nothing less. I read the book multiple times while writing the paper and enjoyed it every single time. It became my favorite book for years and still holds a special place for me. Now, don't get me wrong, I have always considered Holden immature and at times, completely insufferable, but I have felt that way about so many people, self included, at his age. I think the connection to the book comes from the reader's ability to empathize with Holden and the situations he finds himself in. You don't have to share his experiences or agree with his actions, but to really get on his level and take it all in. And to be fair, he does have his moments of maturity. At some point in our lives I think most of us have felt like Holden Caulfield - in between childhood and adulthood, not quite ready to move forward, but aware that we cannot go back, leaving us with a sense of confusion or alienation. Clearly the character has a slew of issues that many cannot relate to, but they all contribute to making him who he is, even if he isn't universally well-liked. I don't know about you, but I was still rooting for him in the end. I guess I still am.",shoshbox,2016-12-15T14:57:46Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
5ihpl8_2,5ihpl8,"Holden is supposed to be immature and he isn't supposed to be this wise person who sees all the phonies for what they are. He's a kid. A scared, probably emotionally scarred kid. He's terrified of growing up or any kind of change for that matter and just wants to go back to when his brother was still alive and everything made sense. The brilliant part of The Catcher in the Rye isn't this message that everyone in the world are a bunch of phony pricks (Holden is just as much of a phony; he's a pathological liar who hides from his own emotions and puts up a front the whole book). It's that Salinger made an incredibly real lost teenage kid and gave him this authentic, flawed, unreliable voice. It's relatable when you're a teenager because you feel so many of the same things, even if you're hiding from them like he is and it's relatable when you're older (at least for me) because you remember what it's like to be that age and feel lost like that.

5ihpl8_3,5ihpl8,"One of the last paragraphs of the book talks about ""you gotta let them reach for the golden ring"" or some such (I dont have the book on hand right now). From my understanding of the book, this is when Holden changes his outlook and is the keystone of the story.

 He has been struggling between adulthood and childhood throughout the weekend, for example when he goes and gets a drink with his old friend. He wants to drink like crazy ""like an adult"" but is actually acting like the ""same old Holden"" joking about flits like he did when he was younger.

So finally at the Carousel he sees his sister reaching for the golden ring, and almost falling in her attempts to grab it. Holden has been trying to ""be the Catcher in the Rye"" to stop the kids from getting ""hurt by the big scary world"" (like he was when his bother died). He realizes to let the kids be kids, even if they fall and scrape their knees along the way.

5ihpl8_5,5ihpl8,"I hated reading in high school. I was a bit of punk ass (a big punk ass) but I was always emotionally and spiritually intelligent, meaning my interior monologue was constantly self reflecting of who I was and where I was. I was an older brother and I was always wanting to protect him. I was in fights, did drugs, and got a felony all before the age of 17.

When I was a junior, my teacher had us read The Catcher in the Rye. The opening sentence was unlike any other book I have ever read. Here is an author who is basically making fun of every book before it. That got me interested. Then the character, this fragile punk going through a city after he is suspended from school, got me interested. He is just milling around a city, where ""phonies"" and other people he despises live and he has to deal with them. I've definitely felt that, AND I still feel that.

So here's this punk kid, who sort of hates life and wants people to just f*#@ off, but as he slowly narrates his story, he slowly becomes more self aware, because at his age, this is what happens. We don't know our place in the world, we're tired of people telling us what to do when they haven't figured out for themselves (hence term ""phonies"") and then the most powerful thing of all hit me. HE CARES ABOUT YOUTH. HE'S SCARED OF GROWING UP. No other book, no movie, really got inside the head of a kid who is f*@#ing scared out of his mind, yet plays it off like he's okay. It's represented by his actions of trying to hide the word f*@# in the bathroom, the ducks and where they will go during winter, and protecting all the children from wandering through thick stalk of rye and falling off a cliff. He knows the world is a messed up place and he isn't ready for it. In fact, he's scared as hell, and he knows that youth is short lived. 

THIS BOOK IS A STORY ABOUT A KID GROWING UP AND SCARED AS HELL DOING IT, WHILE BEING NOSTALGIC FOR THE IGNORANCE OF YOUTH. AND IT DID IT WITHOUT TELLING YOU. IT SHOWED YOU.

After this, I understood what an author did. He was a painter of words. This book showed me what a book is supposed to do. It's supposed to challenge you while relating to you.

5ihpl8_6,5ihpl8,"I had a very similar initial reaction when I read it in high school, until the discussion afterwards in which my English teacher suggested that the entire crux of the book is Holden's battle with the loss of innocence that we all experience as we get older. The reference to the catcher in the rye is himself in a rye field trying to stop young kids from running off a cliff, which can be interpreted as him watching children grow up and trying to protect them from losing their innocence. I'm way overdue for a re-read, so I can't go to much further into the nitty-gritty of it, but reflecting on it with that interpretation in mind helped me appreciate it a lot more.",drumsareloud,2016-12-15T20:24:15Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,6

5ihpl8_8,5ihpl8,"What I love about the Catcher in the Rye is the honesty.  It was just a personal experience, but I found that I related to Holden's gripes with phoniness and other things.  Reading it was like having a conversation with a shrink.  I was able to see from a birds eye view what his problems were, read what people around him thought of him, and see how having a mindset like his plays out in real life, and how awful such an existence would be.  I think his gripes are common with a lot of people, and the coming of age experience is something I think a lot of people could benefit from reading.  That's why I recommend this book to others.  It is, to me, best viewed through a reflective scope.  I remember being eerily similar to him, but then I also understand the flaws in his character through my own maturing process that has allowed me to look back on that point in my life from a critical standpoint.

mfazrp_1,mfazrp,"Not only do I love this book, I really think this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Similar to other people in this thread, I had to read it twice. Once as a teenager, when I thought ""this book was garbage, I could have written it"", and a second time in my late 20s. It's an absolutely standout masterpiece to me now.

[What I got from the book is summed up extremely well by another redditor here. I've copied the text below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2h8egi/personal_reading_milestone_accomplished_i/ckqh6mj/)

Well, you sure haven't moved too far from what Reddit thinks about those books. I see this very same complaint about Catcher in the Rye all the time in this subreddit. 

I think what most people miss about Catcher in the Rye is that it is a story about lost innocence and alienation. They can't get past Holden's character and his personality and traits to see the themes his character reveals; a kind of losing the forest for the trees. 

At the same time, even though he's supposedly so annoying, Holden's character has resonated very strongly with teenagers and young adults, and perhaps some of the rest of us who remember what that was like. So there must be something true, something universal, about him. He is annoyingly sarcastic, yes. Whiny, sure. Without any goal or direction, of course. But why? Why does the author choose to describe him like that? 

The answer is, because he lacks connection with the world. He feels isolated. He feels as if he's a stranger. He's alienated, with no friends among the grown-up kids. He feels he's in a place where he doesn't belong. A very universal experience among children, teenagers, and even adults. But again, why? What does he hate about the world so much that he can't bring himself to fit in? 

Well, he says it all the time. He hates phonies. What does that mean? If you examine what he says he hates throughout the book, you'll realize he hates pretentiousness; he hates, for example, that D.B. is ""prostituting himself"" in Hollywood; he hates the kind of self-centered, self-important society that he is about to enter, by virtue of growing up. He craves all those qualities that he finds so genuinely and so spontaneously in children, like Phoebe: generosity, innocence, kindness. He himself is caught between the two worlds, and he hates that. And so he's whiny and sarcastic, and dreams that he could forever remain on the threshold of the grown up world, being the catcher in the rye, saving children from falling of the cliff - saving them from losing their innocence.

The Catcher in the Rye is really a kind of lament for the lost innocence of childhood, and about the disconnect those who exalt it, like Holden and presumably Salinger, experience when they enter a world that is so decidedly self-interested. But whatever your reason for feeling alone and isolated from the rest of the society, you can find a kind of universality in Holden. He's an outcast, a self-pariah, like so many others, and weirdly, wonderfully, this makes him part of a group; and so perhaps, like the Catcher in the Rye's optimistic ending is possibly meant to indicate, being an outcast is just a transient state of existence after all.",PepperJackson,2021-03-28T23:37:42Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

mfazrp_4,mfazrp,"I'm an aussie too and Catcher is my favourite book and has been since I was 17 and had to  read it for school. I was the only one in class who liked it so I don't think it's an uncommon opinion at all.

As a teen who felt all those things; alienation, mental health issues,  that people were just ""phony"" and the world was a shithole, I strongly related it despite the setting of place and time. I liked the language and the way it created a voice, it's one of the strongest first person novels out there in my opinion. 

I also loved the psychology behind it and the dissection of different characters, some obvious and some you have to speculate more on. I loved the innocence of Holden, the observations about people and life he has (which is why I strongly disagree that it ""didn't really have anything to say""!)  I love the metaphor of the catcher in the rye and saving all the children from growing up because adulthood is a terrible thing. About wanting to keep everyone innocent. I think that's actually beautifully tragic. It speaks to a real fear of adulthood and how once you're an adult the worlds toxicity can infect you and change you.

So I love the different interpretations of the carousel at the end too - that it makes Holden realise that people have to move on and through life despite the risks of being hurt and scared, etc.

I think the book has a lot to say about the transition from being a child to an adult but it does work in a subtle way that not everyone gets or relates to. I know people in my class were like ""nothing happens"" which I couldn't believe because I felt like so much happened. I'm also an observer so I like all those snippets of him interacting with different people from different classes, jobs, etc and the 'small' things of every day life he notices.",lifeinwentworth,2021-03-29T09:13:25Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,4

mfazrp_10,mfazrp,"True, but that's the thing about society today, things of yesteryear are being judged by today's standards:

My 3-year-old daughter is able to (and will be able to) consume pop-culture in a way that myself, my wife and my parents never had the ability to do:  She'll be able to listen to music from vastly different eras without having an idea of the timeline, historical context or possibly even genre.  Everything is (and will be) available on demand and immediately. That goes for books, movies and TV shows too.

To her ""Mr. Rodger's Neighborhood"" and ""Sesame Street"" aren't old shows from decades ago. ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" isn't a 10 year old show. To her, they are just as new and relevant as ""Blaze and the Monster Machines"" or ""Pete the Cat"" and as she grows, the same will hold true for the adolescent and adult programing/music/movies/books she will be consuming.

This holds true right now as well.  Pop culture of yesteryear is being consumed today and compared to and judged by today's standards.

The Catcher in the Rye was very ahead of its time when released, but today it would be lost among the young adult novels being released, and I'm not sure it would even earn a single award or even a single review article written about it unless it was to complain about :

* Dated references and being set in the 1950's America
* The story feels tedious and monotonous
* The protagonist is from a well-off family and tells a cushy and privileged tale.
* The story lacks diversity in it's characters.
* The protagonist is unwilling to reflect on their own hypocrisy
* The protagonist looks down on everyone he comes in contact with and disregards them as 'phony'
* The protagonist has the view that if other people's ideas don't align with his own 100%, that automatically makes them phony.
* The musings on sex, growing up, family, literature, as well as every other topic he shares with overconfident opinion of being completely correct, everyone else's opinion is wrong and just reads as angry and immature.

Some others that I've noticed:

""Aladdin"" and ""Fantasia"" have disclaimers talking about insensitivity and stereotypes in the movies.

""Married... with Children,"" ""Duke of Hazard,"" ""Home Improvement,"" ""How I Met Your Mother,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Bewitched,"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"" have all been accused of idolized masculinity, portraying offensive stereotypes and having very sexist storylines.

""Love Boat"" was accused of sexism and enabling the rape/date-rape culture where ""no doesn't necessarily mean no, you just have to keep asking""

“Friends"" has been accused of being homophobic, enabling fat-shaming, lacking diversity, only showing attractive white people and having a main character (joey) who is a misogynist as he pursues women who have rejected him, openly lies to women if it's in his best interest.

Music-wise ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" has raised questions over its appropriateness and possible ""date-rape"" connotations. ""Summer Nights"" from ""Grease"" has drawn ire for the line ""Tell me more, tell me more / Did she put up a fight?"". The Rolling Stone's ""Brown Sugar"" describes slavery, rape and other violence. Tim McGraw's ""Indian Outlaw"" is filled with derogatory stereotypes. ""Kung Fu Fighting"" pushes negative Asian stereotypes.

I don't think it is because people are overly-sensitive, it is that everything is readily available now, people are watching and listening with today's standards in mind and how we view old pop culture has changed.

And maybe, just maybe, it shows how we are growing and bettering ourselves? That we can recognize the mistakes made in the past and hopefully won't make in the future?  Or in 10-20 years we will look back at today's pop-culture and say how tone-deaf it was in regards to 'X' or 'Y'.",bschott007,2021-03-29T17:30:05Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,10

To me, it felt like Holden simply was a whiner. The novel was a let-down compared to the JD Salinger short stories I’d read, such as A Perfect Day for Bananafish.

I will say that at that time, mostly guys in the class liked the book, and very few of us girls did.  Perhaps it was aimed more at a teen male audience. 

At the time the only controversy about the book was some in the US believing it encouraged communism. I didn’t see evidence of that, nor any hint of “read this; shoot someone”. 

It’s sad that Salinger will mostly be remembered for The Catcher in the Rye, and not Franny & Zooey, or For Esme with Love & Squalor, simply because a few dolts in the eighties decided to use it as a prop when killing/trying to kill.",Mumofalltrades63,2021-08-30T18:40:49Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,5

peiw7o_7,peiw7o,"I think that most people are not aware of this. I know that we read Catcher in the Rye in 8th grade and I very vaguely caught on to the implications, but it didn’t fully register to me until I reread it in 12th grade.  Despite the fact that sexual violence and CSA is such a prevalent theme in the novel, as you’ve said, I’ve never met a teacher who brought up the topic. It’s like it goes completely over people’s heads.

Then again, I did meet a really pretentious guy in college who proudly told me I was a horrible person for liking CITR, because “JD Salinger had young women tied up and raped them in his basement.” There’s no proof of this ever having happened… but I think it’s funny how people will go to such extents to demonize the book and author.

Edit: I also don’t think that people are willfully ignorant to the sexual themes of the novel, but during the time it was published Salinger had to be very careful about being subtle about that topic. Otherwise his book never would have been published. The consequence of that, of course, is that he was perhaps too subtle. We all know that a huge theme of the novel is loss of innocence- “Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.” But the deeper, darker implications of the loss of innocence probably have gone over most peoples heads because that kind of thing was not openly discussed at the time that the novel came out, and nowadays the novel is barely taught in schools.",puffleintrouble,2021-08-30T19:13:39Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,7
peiw7o_8,peiw7o,"This book is generally seen as a red flag because Mark Chapman was holding it when he shot John Lennon.

Also, in the 90s it was banned at a lot of schools because it was ""too sexual"" for teens.

EDIT: Not sure why I'm being downvoted, but this book has definitely suffered popularity because of it's association with killers like Mark David Chapman.

""The best-known event associated with The Catcher in the Rye is arguably Mark David Chapman's shooting of John Lennon.[14] Chapman identified with the novel's narrator to the extent that he wanted to change his name to Holden Caulfield. On the night he shot Lennon, Chapman was found with a copy of the book in which he had written ""This is my statement"" and signed Holden's name.[15] Later, he read a passage from the novel to address the court during his sentencing.[16] Daniel Stashower speculated that Chapman had wanted Lennon's innocence to be preserved by death, inspired by Holden's wish to preserve children's innocence despite Holden's later realization that children should be left alone.[16]

After John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981, police found The Catcher in the Rye in his hotel room.[17] Hinckley later admitted to being an admirer of Chapman and studying his attempt on John Lennon. Hinckley's possession of the novel was later dismissed as an influence, as a half dozen various other types of books were also discovered in his possession.""",muthermcreedeux,2021-08-31T00:39:49Z,0,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,8

peiw7o_11,peiw7o,"I’m glad I came across this thread. I happened to just finish the book for the first time last night. I liked Holden and his narration. There were times it got annoying, but having teenage kids it was easy to see it as coming of age teenage angst. 

The revelations near the end of the book helped me further understand what Holden was going through and that this whole time there were much deeper things at play. 

I make a habit out of writing down my favorite quotes from books and what really left me feeling strange was that 2 of the 3 best quotes from the book (imo) come from a character that was likely a pedophile. It’s jarring. The teacher is presented to us as such a great guy but the author throws in a few red flags here and there until the big reveal of the head touching. Holden’s description of the guy made me like the character and at first made me shrug his actions off as a misunderstanding, but after finishing the book and really thinking about it more I really believe the teacher was a predator. The “handsome” comment bothered me on the first read and ends up being the nail in the coffin for me after more thought. At the end of the day, Holden has been abused before and we should likely trust his “radar” for these things. 

Another thing for me was not exactly understanding what Holden meant when telling his sister about the catcher in the rye. I looked at it as him just being a good person at heart and somebody that looks out for younger children, like his sister. But after finishing the book, it was much more apparent what he meant. It gave the catcher quote so much more needed context. His own past trauma influences his need to protect the children in the rye fields. 

The quotes for those interested:

“The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.”

“Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you.

Incidentally, the idea that he lacks empathy for those around him is quite at odds with my experience of the book. He's not too keen on peers and authority figures, but the real measure of a person's empathy is their attitude to kids, animals and such like. The passage in the book referenced by its title is one of the most empathetic in any book I've read:

iqhbls_12,iqhbls,"Sure! Here’s a bit from my first paragraph/thesis:

“While the concept of the flaneur was born in France in the 19th century, the flaneur has been continually reproduced and used as a literary figure. Such a reproduction may include Holden Caulfield, the main character of J.D. Salinger’s only novel *The Catcher in the Rye*, as Holden similarly traverses an urban city space as an active observer. However, despite Holden embodying key traits of the flaneur, his observation and engagement with his surroundings—people and place—are not born from an inherent longing to live and observe from within a transitory moment, but rather due to his adolescence. Holden does not thrive in or crave a state of flux like the flaneur. Holden is stuck within the mutable. His transition from child to adult requires a position within the luminal space of adolescence; Holden’s status as spectator is not a status that was chosen, setting him apart from the typical flaneur. Holden’s prescriptive observations (as opposed to a descriptive approach used by the flaneur), his longing for imagined, immutable spaces such as a museum or an Egyptian tomb, are characteristics unlike the flaneur. His position within and an observer of the crowd is not one of pleasure, but of circumstance.”

Please forgive my misspelling of flâneur I am on mobile and too lazy, lol. Also, this is a paper from college so grammar/development of ideas are a little rough. 

Basically, I was asked to explore whether Holden could be thought of as a flaneur: yes or no. However, I think the answer is more complicated than the question suggests (aren’t most questions involving literature?). 

Charles Baudelaire describes the flaneur as a figure who craves the instability of the ever-changing moment, especially that of an urban city space with continual modernization. The flaneur is most often male (even defined as such in earlier writings) due to his unique and privileged view of the world. A man can often move through spaces virtually unnoticed, often the subject, never the object (obviously this is not always true, but for my purposes here this is what I’m running with). When we think of depictions of women within urban spaces, we can easily sexualize them, describe what they are doing, categorize them (much like what Holden does to the various women he interacts with through the novel)—yet they are never the subject themselves. 

However, Holden is not himself a true flaneur (at least this is what I believe), as he is only within the ever-changing moment because he is an adolescent. Adolescence, I argued in the paper, is a liminal space between being the object of child (virtually no agency), and eventually the male adult, the subject (privilege and agency). 

I end the paper naming Holden a proto-flaneur: as a teen he is struggling with belonging and self-creation, meaning that his potential to be a flaneur is put into crisis by his inability to thrive and yearn for instability. He is constantly looking for the static, the safe, the unmoving (pay attention to how he interacts with spaces like the museum and especially his younger sister). While Holden certainly exists within the transitory, Holden actively rejects this space, and thereby rejects the role of the fully formed flaneur. 

I hope this was interesting! I love thinking about Holden’s relation to innocence and the unchanged as well as the powerful position that he can embody as a male teen/about-to-be adult. Much to say about the self-reflection he goes through while explaining this all to a mental-health professional, as well.

""catcher is one of those books that drastically changes depending on where you are in life. As a teen you may identify or not with holden as a moody contrarian. As an adult though all I could see was a scared, confused, traumatized boy lashing out at the world. The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books of all time and it's such a good litmus test for someone's ability to empathize. I understand Holden is annoying, but adults who outright hate him and don't understand why he is the way he is miss the fundamental point of the book. He's a damaged kid who's got nobody to help him. I mean, the people that think holden is just a selfish brat haven't even given a thought to the name of the book and what that means""

So yeah, not entirely addressing everything you mentioned but hopefully gives some reason for the love of the book. I particularly love the ending here. Holden is a damaged, neglected, lonely child who has been deemed irredeemable by the people around him, but he dreams of catching the kids lost in the same way he was. The ending elicits strong emotions because it's tragic that even after his trauma and abuse Holden just wants to be there for people who were unlucky enough to be caught in the same situation as him. He just wants to care and look after the innocent.",-Moonchild-,2023-09-24T12:54:58Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,2
16qvziw_3,16qvziw,"I think the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, presents and gives voice to something a lot of people (in the Western World) experience: alienation in the superficiality of abundance. I read the book as a critique of a society that is prosperous with few substantive relationships, because most people are selfishly engaged in their own pleasures and goals. 

In the book, Caulfield finds something “phony” in everything; realizing and ranting against the fact that he is (in his eyes) effectively constrained from doing anything worthwhile—he wants to write, but wouldn’t be allowed to write anything meaningful because society demands that art is entertainment, and even if he forwards his own expressions the audience wouldn’t be interested. 

The story is both about the disillusionment of realizing that others care for one less and less as they become more adult, and about the experience of personal struggles being ignored by others because those others choose to pursue their own interests, and/or are trammeled by conformity (like Caulfield’s absent parents). 

I think the book is very well-liked because it speaks to those who are emotionally alone in a rich society, and to those who have suffered trauma but can’t find a way to share that and receive support because nobody else really cares. What keeps *The Catcher in the Rye* from being simply a depressive book about jaded youth doing nothing, in my opinion, is the clear plea for someone to care, care truly about anything other than themselves: the need for any actual “catcher in the rye.”

For what it’s worth, Evelyn Waugh wrote funnier and more inspirational books on the same subject: if you can (and are interested) try something like *Decline and Fall*.",sworththebold,2023-09-24T20:46:27Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,3

I’ve loved it ever since I read it in high school. My grandmother suffered from Alzheimer’s and I did not know how to process my grief at the fact, so I related a bit to Holden. The book just found me in the right time when I needed it. 

As a World War II historian, learning about Salinger’s experiences during the war has made me love it even more. Some parts were written while Salinger was in the field, and you can definitely see it as a coping mechanism of sorts. Holden’s desire to protect children from the cruelty of the world - can be argued that Salinger wants protect others from the cruelty and barbarity of warfare. Salinger was present at the Normandy Invasion on Utah Beach, The Battle of the Bulge, and entered Kaufering IV, one of the sub camps of Dachau. He was hospitalized for weeks after V-E Day because of stress. “For Esmé—with Love and Squalor” plays more into his wartime experiences, in addition to “Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters” and “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” but you see elements of it in Catcher as well. 

Also, in addition to dealing with absentee (or abusive) parents, the death of his brother, and sexual abuse, Holden also witnessed a classmate unalive themselves.

I also think the ""catcher in the rye"" part is one of the most endearing and profound:

>I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge
of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.

I was having mental issues when i read it at 16 and I rememeber it was the only book or anything that moved me so much I cried. Almost everything about him resonated with me. It was like someone wrote fiction about me 60 years ago. I was trying to come out of a break down at that point and it was largely due to lasting grief from my younger brother dying when I was seven. So his struggles with his brother and how he clung to his younger sister as a reason for living really stuck me hard. I was doing the same thing with two of my male cousins who were born the same year as my brother.

4cudnq_1,4cudnq,"I considered making this post from an anon account but screw it.

I read CitR when I was 23.  I've never identified with a book as deeply as I did with this one.  I come from a history of abuse, abandonment, neglect, and the death of my single mother from cancer when I was 14.  I had battled depression for as long as I could remember, and it was all coming to a head as I went through my early twenties.

I had spent years doing volunteer work, always trying to help other people.  It was as if I believed that if I could save them, maybe I could be saved too.  I had never realized why I felt so compelled to do it until I read Holden's idea of happiness, being the catcher in the rye.

It tore down all of my ideas of happiness and showed me that I had just been burying all of that darkness over and over again no matter how many times it resurfaced.  I stripped me away to almost nothing.  

I tried to kill myself a month after finishing this book but it was the best moment of my life.  In the midst of letting go of everything I realized I could let go of all that pain.  I realized that I was in control of me, and that all those things and people that hurt me, that took everything me were gone.  I realized that I was about to end it all on the doorstep of happiness and fulfillment.  I was about to make my survival worthless.  My life has never been the same again and while I have been sad from time to time I no longer fear hope.

For those of you who read this and thought, ""that's an entertaining book"" or ""this book is shit"" just remember, it saved my life by helping me realize that it was ok for me to be happy, to assign my own meaning to life without relying on others to do it for me.",IkeaViking,2016-04-01T18:19:55Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

Everyone has different experiences and opinions on the book. Literary analyst exists for a reason. No one is required to like a book just because others feel it's a classic or have a life-saving, teary-eyed experience. In all honesty, you are not coming better off from your comment. You and many others are the definition of closed-minded in this thread.

I've read and understood the context of Catcher in the Rye. I just didn't connect. Meanwhile, I really enjoyed Huckleberry Finn. I cried when Huckleberry believed he lost Jim. If you didn't, then that's nothing to get all up in arms over a book. You have your experiences, I have mine, and neither of them negates either of the experiences. 

There's no true or absolute answer in this world. People won't always perceive what we're saying or writing the same nor how we intended our words to get perceived. Not everyone is going to comprehend what you do. I don't think it makes a person any better to look on people as lesser for not meeting my opinion. And it's ok, I understand, people such as yourself want more of the world to recognize and acknowledge a book that in your experience was breath taking.

But alas, we should take that of what we love and enjoy it. Your experience with the Catcher in the Rye is there for you just as mine with Huckleberry Finn is for me. Now, I'm not advocating haters go around giving everyone a hard time. They should let their experiences be theirs as much as your experience be yours.

But when it comes to my students, I have to think like them in order to get something they'll enjoy. If I have a lonely teenage boy who seems upset and disaffected, the last thing he wants is someone trying to 'change him' - he'll probably move further away through an act of rebellion.

upahwu_3,upahwu,"This is one of my favorite books!!

I've never read from a perspective that feels as genuine as Holden's. There's so much uncertainty, fear, and sadness that Holden carries with him about growing up that feels so genuine.

We see it when he goes to the museum, admiring how nothing would ever changes, but later despairing over the fact that even if the museum itself doesn't change, it wouldn't be the same because you would be changing and looking at it differently. We see it when Holden asks the taxi driver where the ducks go when the lake freezes over. Holden doesn't know how they cope with change.

We see it when he sees the ""Fuck you"" written on Phoebe's school walls and starts to worry about how the children will feel when they get sacred and wonder what it means and who wrote it. He imagines killing the person who wrote it, but he knows that no matter what he will never be able to protect them from every ""Fuck you"" written everywhere.

I think that there is also something very telling in the title of the book, ""The catcher in the rye"". Holden hears a little boy singing this poem to himself on the street and it makes him feel happy, though he doesn't know why. I searched up the origins of this poem and it's interesting to see that it actually has sexual origins, but the young boy who was singing the verses to himself actually gets the lyrics wrong and turns it into a light-hearted tune.

The whole sequence about trying to erase the graffiti with the curse words in case someone like his sister saw it related to this notion. I reread it recently and the unresolved mourning for his brother became the predominant theme for me. He's trying his absolute best to cope but it's just a bit too much for him, although he doesn't realise it. Another thing I noticed on the second reading is how likeable he is to the other characters, with a few exceptions. I was trying to work out what Holden's life went on to become and I'm pretty sure it all worked out for him. He's not stupid, he has a lot going for him. For someone like that, a lack of qualifications aren't going to hold him back, especially with the contacts his family and brother have. The way he thought about every situation he was in made me think it was either autobiographical of Salinger or perhaps Holden went on to become a writer like his brother.

It's both an eerie and comforting feeling that no matter how old I become, Holden is eternally a teenager. What really resonated with me is Holden's view of children as symbols of innocence and purity, and how we lose sight of our faith and trust in humanity, as well as our ability to dream as we becoming adults.

The science fiction that is written with high literary ambition is often obscure (like Gene Wolf's *The Book of the New Sun*, or Dan Simmons' *Hyperion*) or a little weighty for high school classes (like Frank Herbert's *Dune*).  
The truth is that there just aren't many science fiction books that would be worth a high school class' time.

I walked away liking it more than most books I've read in my life. I think the book is widely misunderstood, just like Holden is to others and himself. I think it's a beautiful novel, and I find Holden to be a very sympathetic character, even though he's a little shit. Holden is clearly a traumatized, emotionally disturbed kid, and his actions reflect this. As a character, he's been through a lot. The catcher in the rye metaphor is a profound way of explaining Holden's mindset. Him desperately wanting to stop others from losing their innocence, or grow up, because he is having trouble dealing with his emerging adulthood. I think it's the quintessential coming-of-age story.",_AnnualObligation_,2022-12-02T14:33:26Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,2

And I was struggling, while reading it, I looked many words up in the dictionary. Some time and twenty-thirty pages later my inner eyes opened (I cannot properly described this feeling and I never experienced it with any other language including my native one). I started to guess the meaning of the words without looking them up. More and more. By the end of the book I could read much better and my understanding of the language skyrocketed. To this day this author and this book feel like home. A cozy comfortable feeling. Maybe I'm being subjective here but I believe that the Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book, full of deep meaning.

I loved Holden. Holden is a person who cannot stand being lied to and refuses to lie. Not on the surface, on the inside. He sees the inside of people's relationships and it crushes him. His attempt to escape the society feels almost absurd but this is how the author felt.

y23v1_1,y23v1,"I'm a little late to the party on this, but I wanted to share that I had sort of the opposite experience with the novel. When I read it at 14, I was so frustrated by Holden-- I remember my teacher saying that a lot of teenagers either identified with Holden or had sort of a literary crush on him, and feeling like that was such bullshit, because how could anyone be drawn to such an insufferable character? 


Then later I re-read the book, when I was in college, and realized that I had probably disliked Holden because I was unwilling to admit how much I could identify with him, when I was younger. In sort of an ironic hypocrisy, I had felt that Holden was phony because he was always on about how phony everyone else was. As a young adult re-reading the novel, I realized that yes, Holden WAS phony, and I had been, too, for expecting an impossible level of sincerity from everyone I encountered, including fictional characters. 


What I also saw when I re-read the book, and what made me fall in love with it as an adult, was the way Salinger was able to portray Holden's pain and desperation, his descent into (and struggle against) some kind of madness, without hitting the reader over the head with it. I think this is too often ignored when the novel is taught in high schools, because curricula tend to focus on the novel as a coming-of-age story, when really it is a story of a kind of fear and darkness that many teenagers do experience, but which usually doesn't consume them the way it does Holden. 


Anyway, as others have mentioned, I highly recommend you check out his lesser known work, and then re-read The Catcher in the Rye-- I think it will make it an even more rich experience for you. ",sally_jupiter,2012-08-12T00:31:39Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
y23v1_2,y23v1,"I think people dislike it because they realize that at a time during their lives they were just as annoying, scared, and confused as Holden is. Holden is a kid that wants to to be a man but concurrently wants to maintain the innocence that children have. This is shown clearly in his love for his sister Phoebe and his deceased brother Allie. Salinger also writes Holden as a boy obsessed with death. Holden's admires death because he notices that it preserves the image of the person at the time of their death. Allie cannot grow up to be a phony like Holden's older brother because death makes that impossible. 
Salinger details the life of a depressed kid who doesn't know where he's going in life. The Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books because I'm in the same position as Holden, by that I mean I have no clue where I'm going in life.

What it was, it was Mr. Antolini’s hand.

(...) “Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too.  When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. •••That kinda stuff’s happening to me about twenty times since I was a kid•••””

And apparently this teacher DRUGED him. When Holden gets in the apartment, he claims to be very awake, but right after the tea, he gets sleepy and sleepy and sleepy, waking up to his teacher touching his head, half naked. And at the next morning he feels shaky and vomits multiple times, showing that he, indeed was drugged.

And that’s why he is the catcher in the rye. He wants to protect children from ever being through the kinds of things he has. He wants to protect them from falling off the cliff.

With that said, it's clear Mr. Caulfield is a lost kid struggling with loss and uncertainty. It's easy to write Houlden off as a whiny, rich white boy. I did for a time, but I came to appreciate what Houlden brought to YA fiction. He made teenagers worthy character studies. He gave a voice to the voiceless and still does.

I think age probably affects the reader’s interpretation to a large degree. Was gonna give my copy to my 12 year old son but I think I’ll hold off until he’s older.

Edit: Came back to touch on some discourse I see online surrounding the book and this also elaborates my original point. I see a lot of opinions claiming Holden was whiny and a brat. But in seemingly unnoticed ironic fashion, lots of these opinions sound whiny and bratty. I could see how he would come off that way to a teenage crowd. Even his friends disregard his frequent philosophical musings. His brain was not “typical” of a “normal” teenager. He didn’t want to be down at the big football game, he had all that trauma going on etc. and while this could be waved away as “teenage angst” there was a whole lot more going on there. He had real life shit happen to him and tbh I don’t think Salinger began to scratch the surface of it all, albeit intentionally, because it wasn’t in Holdens nature to be terribly reminiscent or vulnerable. I also wanted to point out a comment I saw in this thread. Someone said they didn’t really appreciate the book as a child, but read it in college and was brought to tears. I cried 3 times reading it. 

>!First two times were when Holden cried. The last was when Phoebe pulled up with her briefcase.!<

I think as an adult you can empathize more with Holden because you see him as a child who sorely needs guidance and desires an unattainable peace of mind. As a child, you may view him as being annoying because he’s supposed to be the older cool kid but he’s not. Also, without going through tragedy yourself and navigating through the perilous mental turmoil and nihilism that is so common afterward, which many young people are lucky to not have experienced yet, he will be harder to understand. This may sound strange, but many times throughout my life I had finally got around to enjoying a piece of content, a book a movie, a song, whatever, that I was familiar with for decades through title alone. And it was only after finishing that I would realize that had I attempted to take in that content in my youth, I would have grossly misinterpreted and under appreciated it.. it feels very preordained at times. Like things come across my path at the perfect stage in my life where my consciousness was in a particularly specific state designed for maximum enjoyment of that content. I mean, my last name is Holder and to this day I still get called that sometimes at work. That created an immediate connection between me and Holden. The way he described becoming too excited at times when he finally found himself in a conversation he actually enjoyed, I just became aware of that in myself, I happen to actually be from New York, Holdens descriptions of Pencey reminded me of my time in the Army etc, among many other subtle similarities. Anyway, 

To answer OPs question, 

>!the Catcher was a reference to a poem. Holden misinterpreted the poems meaning to fit his perception of the world. That was a truly remarkable detail introduced by the author and it kind of goes with everything I said before. He wanted to be the Catcher in the Rye to protect children, signifying he probably wished he could be caught if he fell (and also highlights his unprocessed grief for his brother and classmate). But his kid sister Phoebe, who was the one who corrected him in his mistaking of the poems lyrics, elucidated “the point” of the book in the last scene. Holden eased his concern for her safety by resolving that you can’t always protect children. If they fall reaching out for something they truly desire, you have to let them go for it.!<
You’re welcome.

Side note: banning this book conjures a word in my mind that starts with an r that is no longer politically correct.

3hy7so_1,3hy7so,"The thing about the Catcher in the Rye is a lot about the times, yes.  These times went on for 30-40 years after and current young people don't feel the same way, no.  People younger than myself are already acclimated completely to this changed society immediately and don't understand the stulting normalcy that was forced on you in the 50-80s. 

The norm now is to be your own your own person and that is great.  The norm back then was to conform to a *super* rigid cultural ideal of what it meant to be a person.  Holden Caufield wanted to catch people in the rye before they got to this cultural norm.  It's impossible to translate to this day and age in a lot of ways.  

Imagine that there was only one way of being right now and everyone had to get to that and aspire to be that.  A counter-culture forms saying, ""Bullshit I will go my own way.""  Catcher in the Rye described that ideal, that mentality and that process perfectly for the time.

Now we understand that counter-culture and these ideals are automatically co-opted back into the norm and this has been going on for *decades*.  Imagine a time before this where Madonna, Prince, George Michael and this book were *truly* **truly** shocking and there was debate about them being allowed at all.  Then think of the modern context with Kanye, Gaga, 50 shades of Grey being normal things. People like them were inconceivable to most of us back then (we were busy deciding to ban George Michael for Father Figure, Madonna for everything, Prince for everything). 

So to answer your question, to a lot of us old fuddyduddies, Catcher is a cultural turning point, a revelation of fighting against the norm.  The definition of norm has changed from one specific vision of reality (the house, the suburbs, the wife, the two kids, the car) to include almost all manners of human existence. You have to understand how many people wouldn't accept any of what was going on now at all 30 years ago (tattoos, piercings, dyed hair, the music, the porn, the language, etc.)  Holden's refusal to mature for the sake of childish creativity was a harbinger of the creativity that came after (didn't cause it but it lead a lot of people to open their mind to a new world).

You generations after mine are already open to this.  Imagine your mind closed and this book came out.  Imagine the world seeming really small and you wanted something else.

3hy7so_2,3hy7so,"Agreed. It is very important to place books within the cultural norm of the time period in which it was written. The author was influenced by that which he saw happening around him and it filtered into his work. 

When reading a book like Pride and Prejudice you are constantly reminded that the story takes place in a different time period, under different social conventions. The word usage alone appears slightly foreign to us. This constantly reminds you as reader that things were different back then and that you shouldn't (completely) judge the characters and actions based on modern standards.

It is however very easy to overlook the fact that Catcher in the Rye was written in a significantly different social time period than we currently live in. Partly because all the surroundings and social conventions are recognizable to us. The language used in the book is also similar to current language usage. To judge the Catcher in the Rye by today's standards of what is shocking is unfair to the book. When placing it within the correct social/time context would be a lot more fair to the book.

mjejhu_1,mjejhu,"J.D Salinger's experience in WW2 really shaped how Holden is portrayed in the book. I think the book is elevated when knowing that information going into it.

What Holden goes through and the feelings he has, are related to Salinger's return from war and how that experience effected him. The alienation he felt from the rest of society, seeing things that human eyes should never have to glance at, bring people to extremes.

dfd9se_1,dfd9se,"Wow, that was so eloquently expressed! You sound very emotionally mature for your age. This as written from the perspective of a 60 year OLD man. That transition from child to adult can be a very scary one indeed, but when you take it one day at a time, it's not so bad. Good luck with your journey! I think you'll do fine. 

It's so funny. I just read the book again after not having read it since my early 20s. It used to be my favorite book; I'd read Catcher every Christmas break starting when I first received the book when I was 14. 

It's interesting to note that J D Salinger was very much interested in Buddhism and specifically the Zen branch. There is a critical analysis of the The Catcher in the Rye which I once read that very logically detailed how the book had a subtext where Holden's experience in the book was a metaphor for the life of Buddha.

hacjq8_1,hacjq8,"I set about reading ""the classics"" a few years ago and The Catcher in the Rye made the list.  Once thing I found from my readings was that some classics are genuinely fantastic books, some are not and are limping along on pseudo philosophical analysis where people are obviously not comfortable stating they did not care for the book that everyone else is also pretending they loved.

Catcher is in the latter category.  it's devoid of anything you'd call a ""plot"".  it's more of a narrative ""a day in the life of an asshole"".  Narration starts, stuff happens, narration stops.

the oddest take away I found in the book was how integral Salinger considered cigarette smoking to be to the  story.

p03us1_1,p03us1,"The Catcher in the Rye is about Holden's vagina envy, superiority complex in gender performativity( hence ""the phonies"") and his/her pozzing fetish*(Hence the name Holden as ""a recipient"").

  Holden just wants to live as a woman sex worker, having sex with random people and ""catching"" random sexual diseases, ""rye"" was, in European litterature, frequently an innuendo about the pubic hair, most usually - a women's pubic hair. 


This is my idea about ""The Catcher in the Rye"".


Now,  there are *people*, who say, that Holden is a heterophobic homosexual with an ephebophilia fetish, who wants to seduce or ""corrupt"" younger heterosexual partners, and considering Holden's age at that point - this is just criminal, and guide the young and the inexperienced, running towards the ""ravine"" (vagina), into the warm and welcoming bosom of his bum-bum,  instead, but I say this is ascribing intent to an author and skirts too close to the predjudiced image of yesteryear's ""pederast"".",TheYearOfThe_Rat,2021-08-08T09:50:28Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

Franny and Zooey is actually much shorter than The Catcher in the Rye (by almost a 100 pages). And it's also very simple to follow, as The Catcher in the Rye follows Holden through a lot of places and deals with quite a bit of other characters and storylines, while Franny and Zooey takes place almost entirely in one area and centers primarily on only two characters and one storyline.

I guess the only thing I can understand is that it was rare to see books marketed to young adults at that time, and not even about that topic, so that's why it was popular, but now we celebrate the book more (I think) about the writing and content rather than it being the first of it's kind.

They tried to get out for a while like Caulfield and they realize that they cannot entirely do that for some reasons and they settle for conformity instead but not to the point of losing their individuality.

I like this book. It's one of my favorites. But I need to be in the mood to read it again. Sometimes, Caulfield is toxic. But I was like him when I was in my teenage years. I am like him from time to time, always questioning the world. Sure, The Catcher in the Rye maybe boring to some and Caulfield seems like a whiny jerk. But I think that's how Salinger wanted it to be. Because at some time in our younger days, aren't we a Holden Caulfield? His voice is full of resentment and loneliness in a time that he is so confused on what he wants to do in his life, wanting to be respected as a young adult and at the same time wanting to be loved as a child.

He is suffering from some sort of mental illness and has repressed much of his childhood, which is why sometimes his storytelling is like listening to a child talk: repetitive and goes nowhere (try listening to a 5-7 year tell a story haha). Holden is clearly stuck in the past and clinging on to that while also hoping to grow up and find himself.

My big gripe with it is that it isn't deep enough. It seems like an amateur existentialist novel. Really, how deep could it actually be if presented through a teenager? I can see how people relate to Holden (either positively or inversely), but it just fell short for me in exploring these important themes. In High School, I was finding value in books like The Sun Also Rises just to add context. I would actually appreciate any recommendations on books that explore the themes in The Catcher in the Rye on maybe a deeper level.

sjc1s_1,sjc1s,"The thing about *Catcher* that people invariably do not acknowledge when they are discussing Holden on /r/books is that there are **two different Holden Caulfields;** there is the Holden telling the story and the Holden about whom the story is being told. Holden has gone out west to stay with his brother after all of this madman stuff happened to him after he was kicked out of Pency and a year later he is sitting down to reflect, but also to tell the readers his story. Holden throughout the entirety of the book is reflecting on himself, the things that he did and the person that he was one year ago.

Holden isn't meant to be likeable, but that's not to say that he isn't loveable. Him sitting down one year later to tell us his story about misunderstanding what it meant to be a catcher in the rye and all, is redemptive. Holden is a character who is being consumed by his coming of age and it's a time in his life, a time in most of our lives when we aren't very likable people. I know I was as cantankerous of a 16 year old as they come and I'm sure many of you could say the same about yourselves. Unlike so many books *Catcher* isn't a book about someone you want to be like or someone you want to be with it's a book about someone you are, or someone you were. It's about protecting ourselves from the inexorable march into adulthood and the futility of that pursuit. If you are just reading *Catcher* and thinking about it within the context of the Holden about whom the story is being told it's a terribly sad story, but if you expand your reading to the Holden narrating I think, I hope, you might find something enjoyable about it. 

It takes a lot for this kid to sit down and tell us everything he went through, the stuff with Sunny, the questions he asks of the cab driver, the fact that when he goes to ""give someone a buzz"" he looks through his phone book and has nobody to call (it'd be like you scrolling through your cell phone contacts and realizing there is no one, not a single person on that list who wants to talk to you), Allie's death... these are really intimate things for Holden to just be sharing with us in conversation, and ultimately that's what *Catcher* is, a conversation and what's a conversation but a chance to crawl inside the head of someone else, for better or worse. The beauty of *Catcher* is that Holden has found a way to make us care (or at least give us the opportunity to care or not). Through creating this text and having this conversation with the reader he has found an audience, someone who will empathize with him; through text Holden has done what he couldn't get anyone to do while he was living the story he is now telling. That's why *Catcher* is worthwhile and beautiful and worth reading, it gives us an opportunity to empathize with Holden and it exemplifies the power of written language. 

**tl;dr There are two Holdens in *The Catcher in the Rye* and if you only read it thinking about one of them you're gonna have a bad time.**

sjc1s_2,sjc1s,"You know, The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye are actually kind of similar, now that I think about it. The Great Gatsby is heavily centered around Gatsby holding onto a wishful, imaginary version of who he perceives to be a “pure, innocent” girl. This girl being someone he used to be in love with. Years and years later and still, he continues to devote his life to impressing this girl because he is obsessed with his mental image of this “pure, innocent”, “perfect” girl. Whereas in The Catcher in the Rye, Holden is obsessed with the idea of saving “innocent, pure” children from “monstrous” puberty, as you can see when he tells Phoebe about wanting to devote his life to saving imaginary children from falling off of an imaginary cliff. The two books have different messages, though; The Great Gatsby is about not idealizing a person, and The Catcher in the Rye speaks about the preservation of innocence, as well as many other things.

Funnily, if Holden met Gatsby, the man with a mansion meant to simply impress a girl, he would hate “the phony”.",Throwawayaccount3374,2023-12-11T00:19:56Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,2

When THE CATCHER IN THE RYE came out, the genre that we now call ""Young Adult"" was nearly nonexistent. Back then, there were adult books and children's books. Nothing truly chronicled the ""teenage experience."" (You can probably argue that the idea of a teenage didn't come into its full maturity until the 1950s.) It was preceded by THE OUTSIDERS, which also showed teenagers as different from children and adults. 

Holden still serves as the prototypical teenager: sullen, cynical, searching for authenticity. Not all teengers are like this, but this personality type resonates with a lot of people. Who hasn't felt like they are surrounded by phonies at one point?

bspuc4_1,bspuc4,"you mentioned that he’s an unreliable narrator, and that complicates the points you’re trying to make right there.

individual points can sound sinister when extrapolated from the whole, their context.  

there WAS trauma...trauma Holden hasn’t been able to really confront:  the death of his sibling.  is he confronting it from the place he’s writing this recollection from?

the antolini thing is left ambiguous.  the guy could just have been affectionate, and holden misread less innocent motivations into it.  the whole book is also a tale of a kid becoming sexually aware and not sure how to integrate the experience yet (let alone cope with the death of his sibling).  he’s not quite a child, and he’s not quite an adult yet.  does he ever get any normal affection from his rich parents?  it doesn’t seem so.  someone showing care, concern, and nurturing (like a normal parent) probably seems weird to him...because he spends most of his time describing the adult world as phony.  no adult could be genuine.

where do the ducks go?  where do they go when the water freezes?

it’s a tale of coping, adapting.

he’s not grooming phoebe so much as mimicking his idea of parenting.  and it’s interesting this child on the carousel is the last place he visits in his story, his memory.  notice he doesn’t ride with her.  he stands with the adults.

gmrkhv_1,gmrkhv,"So, *The Catcher in the Rye* is one of my favorites and I love it more every time I read it. For me, I think it deals with something pretty universal, which is the challenge of stepping out of adolescence and finding your place in the adult world. This is Holden’s struggle in the book: he doesn’t know where he fits in and doesn’t know how to go forward. (Spoilers for people who have not read the book.)

>!Remember the scene in the museum when Holden goes back and someone has written “fuck you” on the exhibit? That’s the point of the book: he’s trying to hold on to adolescence, but he can’t because the world says “no, fuck you.” He *has* to move into adulthood, but Holden has a lot of things keeping him trapped in his childhood/adolescence; grief from the death of his brother that he never got over, possible abuse, witnessing the death of a classmate, etc. He struggles to move forward into adulthood but is held back, so he just ends up “performing” what he thinks adulthood looks like by hiring a prostitute, going out for drinks, etc.!<


People usually complain that Holden is a whiny, privileged, oblivious, brat. He is. That’s the point. I’m pretty sure most of us were self-centered and whiny when we were Holden’s age, at least a little bit. I know I was. There’s some philosopher that said something like “be kind, everyone is fighting a battle you cannot see.” Holden is fighting the battle of finding your place in the world, the same that *every* person has or will have to fight. And, yes, he has advantages in the battle. But he has disadvantages, too.

>!It’s pretty heavily implied that Holden is dictating the book to a medical professional of some kind. So as the book is happening, he’s losing the battle, or at least he feels like he is. And maybe he feels like he *can’t* find a place in the world. Which is why he wants to be the “catcher in the rye.” To keep the kids safe in their childhood, so they don’t have to deal with the struggle and disillusionment that he has had to deal with.!<


The book is not really about plot/action, it’s about Holden trying to come to terms with all of this. To me, the universalness of Holden’s story, of trying to find your place as an adult in the world (and the disillusionment that usually accompanies that time) makes the book worth reading. It’s something I think everyone can relate to in some way. And then Salinger intentionally gives us an unlikeable protagonist as a challenge, to make us see that *everyone* (even the privileged, whiny brats) is searching for a place that they belong in the world.

But, I’m not an expert, and that’s just my two cents!",okiegirl22,2020-05-19T17:13:51Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

It can  all goes terribly wrong when you are not honest with yourself. The point ot the book for me is that you get to see what a person looks like before it all goes terribly wrong.

8psnc9_1,8psnc9,"You know, I read Catcher in the Rye like three years ago at this point (when I was a senior in high school), and I'm still not sure how I fucking feel about it. 

At first I really hated Holden Caulfield because he's annoying and whiny and proto-emo (and he reminded me of myself when I was 14), but later I realized that he's just a kid who's very clearly traumatized and emotionally stunted, and I began feeling pity for him.  

The Catcher in the Rye is not a great book or a classic as far as I'm concerned, but it's really stuck with me and given me a lot to think about, and that's got to count for something. ",,2018-06-10T16:47:39Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

Nowadays our culture is steeped in it, but at the time, I suppose TCITR was seen as fresh and honest at a time when popular portrayals of teenage life was first love, malt shops, football games, and frat parties.  TCITR acknowledged the ugly, gritty feelings that could come with being a teenager and that one didn't just naturally grow into the life they were ""supposed"" to have.",mirrorspirit,2018-06-09T19:13:14Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,2
izua8l_1,izua8l,"I'm surprised the book isn't more relatable to a younger generation of readers. Holden is cynical of the world, run by phonies, and pessimistic about the future. He's an idealist who wants the world to be safe and happy for everyone, and dreams of being the person who can make it that way -- be the catcher in the rye, saving all the children. He's also not honest and is the classic unreliable narrator of his own story.

When I was in high school many years ago I could relate, I could see disillusioned people like Holden among my classmates, angry with the world and without a clear direction. Of course that wasn't *me*, I could take comfort in that. I could have looked in the mirror and convinced myself (with some smug pride) that *I'm* not Holden Caulfield, and probably fool my friends as well. Which is about the most Holden Caulfield thing I could have done.

I see a lot of disillusioned, cynical young people today, upset by the failures of the older generation, wanting very much to make the world better, but without a clear direction. That's why I am surprised it's not relatable in 2020.

For me I think the ""take away"" is that this is a coming of age story in which a cynical idealist realizes he is going to have to go forth in world anyway, and accept the truth that he can't save everyone and can't fix the problems he sees in the world. If he becomes more self-aware he might realize he can fix himself.",codece,2020-09-25T23:30:38Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

I am just about heading off to bed, so I'm not going to go into this too much, but I'll leave you with this:  At Chapman's trial in June of 1981 after he plead guilty to the murder, he was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say.  He stood up and read a passage from ""The Catcher in the Rye"" when Holden tells his sister Phoebe what he wants to do with his life.

>""Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.

That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.""

2b03c4_2,2b03c4,"I got up this morning and I was totally geeking out that someone was interested to hear more about this!

OK, so basically the reason Chapman chose that passage to read tells us two very important things about his connection with Holden Caulfield as well as his motives for the murder.

Chapman did in fact very much relate to Holden Caulfield (so much so that he made a pretty extensive effort to emulate him, I'll get to that in a bit) but in his mind Lennon did not represent all the ""big phonies"" that Caulfield so despises.  Rather, Lennon is represented by Phoebe, Caulfield's kid sister (and all the other innocent kids Holden sees in the book).

If you notice in the book, all the adults are big phonies but all the children are innocent.  The whole theme in this book is ""loss of innocence"" and in the passage which Chapman chose to read, we see that Holden does not want to accept the reality of this.  Being the catcher in the rye is basically standing around all day stopping those sweet kids from growing up.  

Now, obviously John Lennon was nowhere near innocent at the time of his death, but in Chapman's mind, he was.  Chapman was a *huge* fan of John Lennon, and did not want him to become corrupted by fame (he already was) and probably in a way Chapman wanted Lennon for himself.  He did not want Yoko to have him, nor Julian, nor Sean, and certainly not any of the music producers.  (That last bit is purely my own speculation and has never been stated by Chapman.)

One of my favorite creepy similarities about this whole thing is that the night before the murder, Chapman called a prostitute to his room, and she was wearing a green dress.  Did he request that she wear it?  I don't actually know.  Rumor has it they did not have sex, but merely talked, which would be exactly in line with the book.  

This is all that's really coming to mind off the top of my head, but it really is a cool topic (speculation or not).  [This article](http://theamericanscholar.org/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-holden-speculations-on-a-murder/#.U8n12uNdUoE) is a great read which is sort of more on my side of the whole thing.

Then there's [this one](https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/mark_david_chapman_the_catcher_in_the_rye_and_the_killing_of_john_lennon) which supports the theory that Chapman viewed Lennon as a corrupter of innocence.  (Sometimes I think I believe the first theory just because I like Lennon so much and want to think of him as good.)

Also, I'll just throw this on here for fun, in my hometown there is this crazy mofo who drives around in his van all painted with LENNON MURDER TRUTH across the side.  His name is Steve Lightfoot and he believes that Mark Chapman is actually Stephen King and that the murder is a huge conspiracy involving Nixon, Reagan, and others.  Really far out stuff, but you've got to hand it to the guy, he's kept this website up and running for years and he's got a compelling (if not ridiculous) argument.  Check it out [here](http://lennonmurdertruth.com/).

zyl85v_1,zyl85v,"You missed so much of what 'Catcher really addressed by trying to view it through a historical lens, (which Salinger was not privy to) rather than the over-arching message of abandonment and its effects on a fragile youth trying to claim manhood without support or attachment to anything but his little sister (childhood). He loses a sibling and becomes invisible to his parents afterward. The only attention he gets is negative attention, the only praise he gets comes from a teacher (at least one, though he alludes to others) that is likely grooming him for sex. In all of them he sees a general falsity, a ""phoniness"" that grows the distance between him and others, again, except his sister who is still genuine in her pristine youth, a youth lost to him now that his eyes are open.  What you call ""whiny"" is simply the voice of a kid groping about for some meaning and connection, but failing, until he finally steps off the curb and falls into an oblivious state of nervous collapse.  Its allegorical and as such, exaggerated, but its the journey between youth and adulthood that's being addressed, not hippie culture or the boomer generation or evangelicals.  The title itself should be a clue.  Holden wants to be ""The Catcher in The Rye"", a vision he made up after misunderstanding the lyrics to an old folk song. He explains to Phoebe after she asks him what he wants to do with his life, that he wants to catch all the children that wander and fall off a cliff, and make them safe (saving innocence):

"" I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff—I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.

fassdk_1,fassdk,"I suggest reading Franny and Zooey by Salinger next. It expands on that idea, particularly using the character Franny as a sort of Holden 2.0 (it's also just a great book and my fav from Salinger). 


Like Holden, Franny gets that obsession with how phony everyone and everything is, but unlike him she has a strong support system that knows what she's dealing with and can steer her towards the right answers (basically a family of  Antolinis). 


Throughout ""Catcher"", Holden is alone with his thoughts and while he is ""correct"" about somethings and has a reason to think what he does, he needs someone to bounce off of and who can bring him down to Earth. Antolini doesn't really have the time to give him the guidance he needs, but the advice he gives is the core of what Holden needs. 


While Holden is disillusioned, what he really needs is a set ideology and to think about what he wants to do (aka what he ""wants to live for""). In my mind Holden is a creative, but hasn't realized it yet (maybe an Actor or Director). Which is what  Antolini is trying to tell him to take the time to realize. This feeling of aimlessness is one many youths deal with and is why this book is so relatable in the formative years.


Antolini says, ""The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one."" Basically, I feel, Holden should go back to school like Antolini suggests because that is where he'll probably find that thing that draws him in and that he wants to dedicate his life to. In the real world, that is what usually happens. Some people know what they want to be from an early age, but many, like Holden, are particularly aimless throughout High School and then go to College studying what they think they should until they're exposed to that one thing that they feel they're truly meant to do. That's the period Holden is in and it's an excruciatingly dull one. But, his thoughts throughout the book shows a thinker with great potential and Antolini sees that and tries to help ignite a spark with his advice.


Once again, Franny and Zooey uses these themes beautifully, and has more defined questions and answers. Also, a character in Franny and Zooey is suggested to have written ""The Catcher in the Rye"" making it a book-in-a-book. But, the most important thing to pull from that idea is that the character from Franny and Zooey wrote about Holden because he has knowledge of that thought process. And, when you read it, you'll definitely see how the struggles of Holden can relate to the struggles of being a Glass Family member.

fassdk_2,fassdk,"I don't think there is a ""message"" per se in *The Catcher in the Rye*, but I think that the main theme (and it reoccurs in a lot of Salinger's work) is that we are the sum of our upbringing and pasts.  

Holden acts out because he is still dealing with the death of his brother.  He hasn't been able to process it because his parents keep sending him to boarding schools instead of connecting with him.  It's also implied that he's been sexually abused. This leads him to distrust adults and push away ones who seem to genuinely care, like Mr. Antolini. He also over values childhood innocence, which is shown by him not realizing his little sister is more mature than he thinks (and slightly more mature than him) and when he imagines his ideal job based on a misinterpretation of a risque poem.  Holden sees the world as phony, predatory, and without value.

rr58xg_1,rr58xg,"One of my top five best reads ever.   I first read it when I was about the same age as Holden Caufield back in the 1980's and I completely identified with Holden's mental struggles.  This is a testament to Salinger's writing ability because my situation in life was different than Holden's.  Holden was rich and had all of the advantages in life.   I was poor and had no advantages.   But we shared a common view when it came to social interaction.   I too saw most people as ""phonies"" and had developed a cynical view of the world. Now, as a much older person,  I realize that I was really searching for meaningful human interaction and wasn't getting it. 

Perhaps finding The Catcher in the Rye was more meaningful to me so long ago because it was before the internet and social media existed, and it was a time when mental health issues did not get the attention they deserve. I felt like I had a kindred spirit to connect with in Holden.  Holden was suffering from a form of PTSD due to the death of his younger brother, and he was not getting the type of counseling that he needed from his friends or elders. I too had suffered trauma that was not being addressed in the proper way,  and I suffered in silence as I was not aware how to begin to help myself. And so I ostracized myself from others,  like Holden.

I think too that a modern reader must put this into historical perspective.   Salinger was writing just after World War 2 at a very ""macho"" time in American culture.  Boxing was a more popular sport than professional football for example.  Soldiers returning from the horrors of war with mental struggles had virtually no recourse. If they couldn't ""handle"" normal life,  they were put in the ""nut house"" and subjected to treatments that we find cruel today (hydro treatments,  electric shock,  etc.).  So to successfully address mental illness in a sensitive manner was a tremendous  achievement for Salinger.",ericmsandi,2021-12-29T18:22:32Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
opdtt2_1,opdtt2,"I'll give my take on why paragraphs were needed.

I read the title and since I read the book I'm interested how others perceived it. I begin to read the body of the essay:

>The Catcher in the Rye follows the story of a young boy called Holden Caulfield over a period of two days after \[...\]

At this point I'm bored. I've read the book and and can summarize it myself. I skip the summary of the plot and jump to your first argument, but instead of the argument, I get the final conclusion. Where is the argument? Just to make sure I start to read a random sentence in the middle of the big paragraph and sure enough, your arguments are buried in the summary. Paragraphs help readers skip irrelevant parts.

Even if the reader wants to read each and every word, paragraphs help the audience to make sense of what the sentences are trying to do. For example, in the argumentative essay format the text is split in 5 paragraphs and the reader knows how to read each of them. If all the text is merged into a giant paragraph, the reader might get confused if they are still reading the first argument or maybe it's already the argument #3.

Dividing things into paragraphs also helps the writer to review their own work. Neatly divided paragraphs can tell at a glance if an argument is too short or too long.

P.S. One thing I found a bit troubling:

>And also I wrote this on my phone without the intention of structuring it

I'm not American, but I **adore** American or wartime literature, or anything that has to do with very detailed settings, or anything realistically historical. I appreciate *The Great Gatsby,* my favorite play is *All My Sons,* I read the entirety of *War and Peace,* cover to cover. I've written literature papers in school for all of them. Tolkien is my patron deity of fantasy, Verne's *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea* is my all-time inspiration for writing and adventure. Eoin Colfer was a nice teenage memory, reading Artemis Fowl.

I have a general dislike of Stephen King's writings because I find his books boring rather than suspenseful, but that's just me. He's a good writer, otherwise. Rowling was my favorite fantasy writer until Cursed Child made me physically vomit. R.R. Martin was overrated to me but I can appreciate his skill. I fall asleep at James Patterson's writing. Dan Brown's writing was forgetful to me. I have read countless fanfics in my time that when I think back on it, has made me physically recoil. I have **written** fanfics as a kid that when I think back on it, has made me take asprin.

All of it is nothing compared to the utter and absolute contempt and hatred I have of *Catcher in the Rye.*

A whiny little bitch like Holden made me want to see him at the ending, where he was looking at his sister enjoy herself and started to feel less of a pathetic little prick that he was, see his sister fall off the carousel and fall into a coma. I wanted to see him suffer an actual goddamn tragedy for once in his teenage life that isn't filled with some drivel about how sad or cool or whatever he is. I wanted to see him really suffer.

And for that, while I hate it with every fiber of my being, J.D Salinger may be the only writer I have ever read that made me outright **hate** the character.

I think it's also pretty clear that Holden is struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety given the loss of his brother Allie and his general anxieties about growing up. I always feel a great deal of sympathy for Holden but I've heard a lot of people describe him as being very whiny and unlikable. Teenagers generally are pretty whiny and unlikable, especially ones who are struggling. Holden isn't meant to be Edward Cullen or Harry Potter.

9mfxa_1,9mfxa,"My brother's reading the catcher in the rye now for high school and we've been talking about it.  I had read it as a freshman in high school and identified with Holden pretty hard.  7 years after the fact, I came into our conversations thinking that I didn't like the book anymore because I don't feel like Holden Caulfield, but I was wrong.

I think the Catcher is a worthy read because it successfully places the character of Holden Caulfield into a world in such a whole, convincing way that the reader, rather than getting the sense that JD Salinger approves or disapproves of Holden, will feel about Holden much the way they would about the questions that Holden has already answered.

The best example of the way that I read the book now comes through in an episode that takes place in the middle of the book, when all of the sudden Holden wants to run away from his life with Sally and they would live together and later they would get married and he would chop the wood for them in the winter and everything.

as Holden describes this situation in the first person, it is clear that he has all of these unreasonable expectations of Sally and that he doesn't think through how these expectations would apply to himself.  because Sally isn't as stressed out about the whole world and how messed up it is the way that Holden is, she doesn't really want to run away from everything.  Instead of understanding how subjective his point is and how out of left field the proposition is for Sally, Holden describes her as being pissed off and unreasonable.  Sally tells him he's yelling and Holden tells the reader that he wasn't yelling, and it becomes clear that he is unreliable as a narrator.

The way that I read in high school is still the easiest way for me to read today, that is, to totally identify with the main character and become absorbed in their world.

The problem is that in a book like the Catcher in the Rye, the point of the book is to understand Holden from the author's point of view, rather than his own.

[Edit one year on: I would put this differently. I would say that the way the The Catcher in the Rye is written, the reader doesn't learn what JD Salinger thinks of people like Holden, the reader sees what *they* think about a person like Holden Caulfield.  

As a youngster, I thought he was hilarious and honest.  Recently, I found him to be someone who shares many of my bad qualities, (a terrible listener when it matters most, very little perspective on or warmth towards life and the world).  Maybe there's one thing that's objective about Holden, he's a nervous person, who doesn't know for sure what he wants out of life.  I think it reflects the quality of writing that I could read the language of the story as a sympathizer and think JD was in my corner, then 7 years later take the same words and feel as though Salinger is making an argument for why I think Holden is scary and sad.]",TheFrigginArchitect,2009-09-21T01:36:48Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

When I was 16 I read The catcher in the Rye. I've always enjoyed fantasy and YA, but Rye lead me to the Classics. Since then I've only read from that genre. 

I've read many books but only a few has impacted me the same as Rye. Slaughterhouse 5, Lolita, Animal farm, 1984 and maybe The brother Karamazov, would be those. They have the same ""feel"". Perhaps you should wait till summer with Karamazov, It requires so much energy and focus. But so worth it.

Holden’s angst and dissatisfaction with those around him is super relatable imo; and his desire to become the catcher in the rye (and other instances, like his inability to get freaky with the hooker) speaks to complying with gender norms and expectations, which is a big deal even today! His eventual conformity makes for an interesting element as well: he gives in, he becomes the phony.

They might have been wrong coming from someone like him, but without focusing too much on him, I think he said some valid things that probably needed to be said, whether that was the intended point by Salinger or not. Then you have the whole thing where it boils down to adulthood and the struggle of conformity, when all you really wanna do is save the freedom from fear of judgement, freedom from fear of failure, freedom to speak your mind, etc that you experience as a child.

I'm not sure I agree. The book is about a very damaged individual who is lashing out at a world because he's hurt, confused, and scared. He's narrating this book from a sanatarium, and mentions at the very beginning that he was sexually abused. The whole thing about catching his sister in the rye is his way of wanting to keep her from experiencing similar trauma in her life, to retain the innocence of childhood.

He's a depressed kid who watched one brother die young and another brother turn into a prostitute. His parents shipped him off to a boarding, and when he gets there he finds that all his peers arent thinking about the same things he has been forced to face at such an early age. Not to mention the kid that jumps out the window (wearing Holdens sweater!) that really pushes his views even more leaning towards ""whats the point?""

He spends the entire book with basically no motivation other than helping kids, and trying to protect children. 
The whole wanting to be the catcher in the rye catching all the kids who fall off the cliff thought that Holden keeps having is him wanting to save kids from all the shit that you can't save a kid from when they eventually grow up.

He wants to be the catcher in the rye to prevent kids from growing up. Growing up too fast and not enjoying what they have now, in a way he is describing high school if you think about it... We as teens are too preoccupied in growing up, in becoming the adult we want to be able to drink, drive (not together xD), etc. He wants everyone to just stop and wait and take a breather.

3h5rxx_2,3h5rxx,"This is a pretty late response and I actually made an account just for this post, but I've been itching to talk to someone about The Catcher in the Rye as well. I read this book for the first time a couple of months ago at 25 and i found it absolutely profound, and I can sympathize with Holden completely. All i knew about the novel prior to reading it is that it's supposedly about the search for authenticity, so i didn't have any expectations and i wasn't looking for the common themes that most critics pin on it. I spent some time reading criticisms and praises, but there's one thing that jumped out at me: I saw a question on some sparknotes type website which went something like ""Is being a catcher in the rye a realistic goal?"", with multiple answers which all claimed that it is absolutely unrealistic and is just Holden's fantasy because you cannot save children from growing up. So basically, the common interpretation of Holder wanting to be a catcher in the rye is about him wanting to preserve children's innocence and save them from descending into adulthood phoniness... but I don't think that's what it's about at all. I don't think Holden is struggling to grow up or become an adult at all, (although that obviously depends on one's definition of adulthood). It seemed to me that more than anything he is someone that is very perceptive and is able to see people's true nature through pure intuition - this is not a childish quality at all - and one of the things that make this novel pure genius is that it brilliantly captures the confusion and devastation that comes with that kind of intuition when you aren't exactly aware of it at that particular age. So criticizing Holden as overdramatic childish and whiny is absurd. I think what he's struggling to find is a worthwhile purpose in life precisely because his understanding of the human condition is so far beyond his years. It's a kind of mid-life-crisis so to say, and most people experience it after playing house and having a 9-5 cubicle job for a couple of decades without ever really assessing what it is they're trying to accomplish in life. Holden just happened to hit it WAY earlier than most people. (And the 'whiny/childish' and repetitive qualities in his narration are the only things that make him identifiable as a teenager, otherwise he would sound like 40-year old man.) 
Which brings me back to the point that i failed to make earlier - becoming a catcher in the rye is ABSOLUTELY realistic and is in fact his redemption and new-found purpose in life - i don't think it's about saving children from adulthood, I think it's a writer's purpose in life - to provide something for the younger generations in order to bring validity and clarity to their confusion and devastation about the world. And that's exactly what i got out of this novel. Being a catcher in the rye imo is the most profound metaphor for being a good writer. Holden is the child falling off a cliff, and this book is for people like him (children or not) which provides an extremely relatable descent into desperation and a perfect solution to disillusionment with life.
As for the Mr.Antolini's gay advances theory, i think story-wise it would have been WAY too neat for Holden to just agree and have a good time and chill out right after the conversation he had with the teacher. Imo he had to stay in character, and as a stressed out sexually frustrated teenager, his disturbed reaction to the teacher's tipsy fatherly kindness was basically the perfect exit strategy to continue on with the story. I think Mr.Antolini's behaviour was pretty spot on for someone who can truly understand and feel Holden's pain, and I didn't find it creepy at all.

3h5rxx_3,3h5rxx,"It's been awhile since I read *The Catcher in the Rye*.

I didn't like it for a few reasons. I'm not going to lie; the biggest reason was probably because I had to read it for school. I can't really think of any school-assigned novels that I actually liked (maybe ATOTC, but to be fair I had read once or twice before it was assigned, IIRC).

The Catcher in the Rye also just isn't the type of book I like. I prefer conventional writing styles. I'm not really interested in reading every little thing that a character thinks. And the fucking tangents he goes off on... those were so aggravating for me to read.

And I dislike Holden because he's a whiny child. Yes, it's understandably *why* he's so whiny, but that doesn't mean I have to like his constant complaints. I will admit that a large part of the reason I dislike Holden for this *is* because of the way the story was told -- but the story wouldn't be the same if it was told a different way.

Maybe I'm due for a re-reading, but I doubt I can bring myself to do it. I just really did not like this book.

Also, is it the standard interpretation that Holden was probably sexually abused by that one teacher?

Holden doesn't understand why he likes his red hunting hat so much. This is because (in my opinion) it is the same color of his favorite person's, his brother, Allie's hair.

There's many more subtleties that most people don't pay attention too.

And to the people who don't like Holden as a character don't understand Holden. His entire life he tries to get people to listen to him but no one ever does. By the end of the book, you should realize that he has gotten you to listen/read his story (assuming you weren't forced to read it in English class or something).

Holden himself cannot distinguish whether he is innocent or mature. He drinks and smokes but he cannot bring himself to have sex (back then it would've been less common for a teen to have sex). Once he sees the prostitute who is seemingly his age he notices he doesn't want to cross that line seeing how the prostitute probably had a terrible life. All around him people seem to know where they are, Phoebe is obviously innocent, Stradlater is not, Ackley doesn't care, and DB is far past the transition state. Even though Holden tries to keep his innocence (by talking to Phoebe, the girl in the park, and listening to the boy sing the Catcher in the Rye song) he can't escape the fact he's aging. This is evident in my favorite line of the book: ""That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write 'Fuck You' right under your nose.""",justpaul95,2012-08-09T02:13:25Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,2

I feel that people that enjoy the book are those that are either currently going through a situation that is hard for them to cope with or people that STILL remember how hard it was to grow up and enjoy the book because it's a teenager learning a valuable lesson that they learned and still remember. You just can't be the catcher in the rye. Life does not work like that and that is what Holden realizes. That is what some people are realizing and what their realized and still look back at. I feel that those people are the ones that enjoy the book.


I always feared change and did not like that things had to change (just like Holden doesn't like that the ducks have to go! He wants things to stay the same...although insignificant to some, the duck thing shows he problem with change). The book, although not life changing, did allow me to see that there are things out of your control and you have to let them go. Just how Holden, after seeing his sister at the end, realized he can't change anything and can just enjoy the time he is currently having with his sister! That's what I got from the book and that is why I like it a lot.


Hope that all makes sense...I'm off to bed.",Katz_Vailo,2013-08-14T05:40:27Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
udpki_1,udpki,"Denis Johnson's *Angels* has the gritty aspects of *Catcher in the Rye*, and a very similar depressing tone. The story itself is nothing like *Catcher*, in that it's not about how phony society is. It's only similar in atmosphere.

If you're looking for something that has similar themes, but is more geared towards adults, there's no better book than *The Recognitions*. In fact, I just went to Amazon to give you a link to the book, and this is the top review:

> The Recognitions is the extreme terminus of ""The Catcher in the Rye."" Both are concerned with exposing the phony, the counterfeit. Gaddis' work is far more mature, wide ranging and dispairing. His erudition is breathtaking. The work attacks the fake and counterfeit in society, art, Christianity, personal morality and business. My favorite bits are Gaddis' thrashing of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", and the weird flashes into the pagan underpinning of Christianity. Many questions are raised and left unresolved, indeed are unresolvable. The narrative is left in fragments that bleed in all directions, blurring the line between narrative and non-narrative, the conscious and the unconscious. It is a beautiful if bitter book.

Also, I just remembered, Knut Hamsun's *Hunger* is similar, in that you're following a narrator who is slowly losing their mind, fueled by the lack of empathy and love in society, and, as the title suggests, hunger.",awaywethrow1982,2012-05-31T18:06:32Z,3,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
6437py_1,6437py,"Well, as a person who read it at the angsty age, I really didn't piece it all together until the title of the book becomes clear. 

> . . . I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff—I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.

For me it all clicked there, being younger I needed the subtly of a hammer that this scene gives. It made me very aware of how bittersweet it is to grow up. How when we transition from this...Nirvana heaven of being a child and not giving a fuck and loving life, to this jaded and untrusting person in an too unperfect world. Growing up is hard. Learning about the world is horrific. We must learn to find our inner children again. 

So if you focus on that, at least everyone will get the message of the book, even if they don't remember the prose or whatnot like me.",ZenTwister,2017-04-08T01:16:51Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

413qhd_1,413qhd,"I think The Catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book and I would argue that Holden is one of the best realised character's in fiction. I first read the book when I was 17 and have read it several times since. I think there are two things to keep in mind when examining Holden's personality. One, Holden is a teenager. This may seem obvious but it seems to be ignored by people who dislike him. Anyone with half a brain knows that teenage years suck. Your body is changing, you're on the edge of adulthood and you're coming to the realisation that you will soon have to leave your childhood behind. This is difficult enough without mentioning school, work, and managing your family and friends. In my experience, teenage years are a time of great uncertainty and most teens don't have the experience or maturity to deal with it. 

The second thing to keep in mind when it comes to Holden is that he is pretty fucking traumatized. Not only is he having to deal with being a teenager and the fact he is flunking school and doesn't like the look of the world of adults he is about to enter, he is also dealing with some serious psychological issues. Holden lost his younger brother Allie, one of the few people he genuinely felt a connection to. Not only does he feel a great pain over the loss of his brother but he also punishes himself for the times he was mean to him (like when he said Allie couldn't come out with him and his friends). Holden reveals he smashed up his parent's garage when Allie died and badly hurt his hands smashing them through glass. Holden's relationship with his parents is also distant. They aren't bad people but it's clear that they're quite distant from their children, especially since Allie died. He can't exactly talk to them about what he's going through. Holden also mentions his mother has been full of nerves since she lost her youngest son, yet another thing for Holden to be concerned about. Holden also seems to have a good relation with his brother, D.B. but he has since moved to Hollywood and away from Holden. This really only leaves Holden's kid sister phoebe but she's a lot younger than him and isn't emotionally mature enough to understand what he's going through. Holden also seems affected by the suicide of his classmate, James Castle, who jumped out his bedroom window after being bullied. The boy was wearing Holden's turtleneck sweater when he died and from what Holden says, the boy was only covered up when Mr Antolini placed his jacket over him. That's pretty messed up. Holden has a lot of shit stuck in his head but he has no one to talk to about it and lives in a time that didn't focus as much attention on mental health. He doesn't have the internet and he has almost no way to meet like-minded people. People going through difficulties like this aren't much fun to be around and I think Holden is actually doing pretty well considering the baggage holden (couldn't resist) him down. People who say Holden is just a whiny character are kind of missing the point in two ways. Firstly, he's a teenager, teenagers are whiny. Secondly, he has also got a lot of emotional baggage. 

There's a great video review by the [Blog Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSR8J6LUaT8) which I feel sums up Holden's character pretty well. ""In response to the criticism that Holden Caulfield, the narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is unlikable, I regret to inform you that you are also unlikable, so am I. There's this weird but pervasive feeling in the world of contemporary coming of age fiction that characters ought to be either the person you want to be or the person you want to be with, but I am happy to confirm that Holden Caulfield is neither the guy you wanna be or the guy you wanna be with. He's not Edward Cullen."" 

It's also worth remembering that there are essentially two Holden's in the novel. Holden who went through the events, and Holden who is telling those events. The older Holden is aware of how he comes across in the novel and often describes himself as a maniac, as immature, and dumb. He is self aware of how different he is a year or so later. Anyway, food for thought. ",_Ishmael,2016-01-16T06:43:48Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
1wfmlm_1,1wfmlm,"My post history is littered with posts like this.  

The point of *The Catcher in the Rye* isn't to identify with Holden, it's to understand why he acts the way he does.  The story going on in the background is that Holden hasn't gotten over his brother's death. He idolizes his brother and has developed a complex that glorifies innocence. This complex leads him to have hypocritical beliefs on ""phoniness"" and bizarre reactions to sex and relationships.  His parents don't seem to understand that he is still grieving and just ship him off to different schools instead of addressing his behavior.",Bishop_Colubra,2014-01-29T05:32:03Z,2,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1

ttive_1,ttive,"I loved *The Catcher in the Rye* and I loved Holden. Narrators don't necessarily have to be pleasant to be relatable, and I think he made that very clear as a character. Once you learn to look past his abrasiveness, you'll see a confused, frightened child hiding inside him. 

Even if I wouldn't use the same words to express them, I remember sharing many of the same feelings as Holden, primarily disgust with people acting ""phony"" and despair at the lack of authenticity in the ""grown-up"" world. For these reasons I connected with him more than I have with other protagonists.",,2012-05-18T20:13:59Z,1,COMMENT,Comedy,The Catcher in the Rye,1
