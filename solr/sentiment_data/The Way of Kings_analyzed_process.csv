68ssy8_1,68ssy8,I remember the first time I read The Way of Kings. I was locked up in a psych ward for trying to kill myself after getting back from over seas in the Army.

68ssy8_2,68ssy8,"Honest question: Is The Way of Kings similar in style to Mistborn? I read Mistborn because of Reddit's almost universal fawning over it, and I was really disappointed at how simple and cliche and ""young adulty"" it was. I realize that everyone is allowed their own opinions and I'm not knocking anyone who enjoyed it though. 

Mistborn is the only book of Sanderson's that I've read and I'd be curious how it compares to the rest of his work. It would be shame for me to miss out on such a prolific author's other work just because I was turned off by a single book of his.",-illuminati,2017-05-02T13:02:46Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,2
68ssy8_3,68ssy8,"Without a doubt, the Way of Kings and its sequel are my favorite Brandon Sanderson books. I first learned of him through the Wheel of Time series, and honestly I don't like most of his stuff. But the Stormlight Archive is amazing, and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.",drawsony,2017-05-02T22:53:48Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,3
68ssy8_4,68ssy8,"Am I the only one who *didn't* really love The Way of Kings? I didn't like it enough to keep reading the series. 

There were a few things that I thought were amazing:

* Shard plate and weapons. That was a really cool element, particularly how the upper class coveted and fought over them.

* The binding system of magic (Lashing, I think was the term used?) that was used by the assassin. 

* I thought the idea of the bridge crews was a pretty cool story telling technique. War stories so often just focus on the soldiers while ignoring all of the other logistical aspects of conflict. 

But there were some other parts of the book that I really *didn't* like:

* Every one of the main characters was stale and wooden. Kaladin was the perfect example of a male Mary Sue. His own flaw was that he was *too noble* and refused the Shardplate that he won. But he clawed his way up again because he is impossibly heroic and amazing! Shallan was your typical oppressed girl forced into a destiny she doesn't want, even though she's trying to become super independent! And Dalinar had pretty much the same problem as Kaladin: brought down by his own nobility, and the only reason anyone disliked him was that he was just too nice and smart and everyone else was evil and corrupt!

* Soulcasting was absurd. Magical transmutation is a world-breaking power that they just kind of use off-hand to set up camps and stuff here. I mean, they can literally turn rocks into food, and yet there are starving people in the camps? It was just completely under-utilized.

* The cool magic system of Lashing that was brought up in the very first chapter was just ignored for the rest of the book. Great. Thanks for the tease, I guess. 

* Used a lot of played-out tropes. Great coming evil that was vanquished long ago in the past, commoner warrior leading his men to greatness, etc. etc. It just felt like someone checked off a list of ""things to include in a fantasy novel.""",Luna_LoveWell,2017-05-02T14:22:18Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,4

Dont get me wrong, I love the world and in The Way of Kings i love the small scenes where he talks about that, like the skyeel scenes or the chamsfiend battle. But there are some times where he just goes on and on, describing things about his world that have already been said or implied, especially in Words of Radiance. Like he spent so many years building it, he doesnt feel content if he doesn't spoonfeed you everything.

68ssy8_11,68ssy8,"When I read the Mistborn books, I considered Sanderson to be a fun author but not a great author, but after reading The Way of Kings, I was really blown away.  It was a fantastic read.  Sanderson seems to be coming into his own the more he writes and this series has been his pinnacle so far.

If Mistborn seems to YA to you, I would give The Way of Kings a shot and see if you like it.  But, if you want to read something with great fantasy and is a bit darker, try reading ""Malazan Book of the Fallen"" series.  So good.",,2017-05-02T13:55:28Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,11
68ssy8_12,68ssy8,"I did not enjoy Mistborn at all. As a piece of writing, I think it's terrible. The magic is cool, and the world is interesting as far as the writing allows, but the mechanics of the story just aren't right. The characters are all very one-dimensional with little development of their relationships, and the plot is very jerky.

Completely night and day when compared to his work with The Wheel of Time and especially his Stormlight work. It makes sense since Mistborn was his first (or second?) novel ever legitimately published. He's definitely matured from an excellent fantasy worldbuilder with mediocre writing chops, to what he is now, which is an excellent top-tier author all around. 

I'm not him so I can't say for sure, but I bet writing the ending of Wheel of Time really helped him mature as a writer. It was entirely Jordan's story, and he didn't have to get caught up in any of the ideas surrounding the plot or the characters, he just had to turn it into a well-written novel. Seriously, the difference between The Final Empire and The Way of Kings is night and day. It's hard to believe it's the same writer.",finRADfelagund,2017-05-02T19:59:08Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,12
68ssy8_13,68ssy8,"The Way of Kings (/Stormlight Archives) feels more inspired by G.R.R.Martin and a bit from  J.K.Rowling. It's less violent and there's no sex, but they have some common themes and there's a huge world with a lot of politics and cultures interwined together to an overwhelming extent, + some mythical elements, but WoK's series differenciates itself so far by having shallower cliche characters, with a nice Brandenson-style combat system that makes the fights and action pretty interesting, in addition some other intriguing mysterious characters. The book was very slow though, the first book was huge with most of it being uneventful boring build up with some political intrigue thrown in there, although it does conclude pretty nicely.",,2017-05-02T20:11:53Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,13
68ssy8_14,68ssy8,"I agree with you. The Way of Kings is a decent starter novel. If he can build that (havent read further yet), it might become much better. However, Sanderson really lacks a few things as an author. He lacks the sense for names that Tolkien has. He has neither Tolkien's epicness, nor GRRM's touch for storylines. 

Tolkien hints at some events ages past, and it feels like the story youre currently reading only skims the surface, that's there's all that history and meaning underneath. With Sanderson, there is what is, that's it. I don't get the same feel from his books.

In Mistborn, he pulls of a lot of twists, but it always feels like the nerdy kid at school telling a story... ""But then the evil guy actually turns out to be the good guy...""

And Sanderson's characters and dialogue are pretty bland. Sanderson does magic systems really well, that's his major selling point. Sanderson writes so quickly, if he could polish his prose and dialogues more, he'd be better off imo.

edit:

Sanderson seems to me like somebody designing a cool rpg, and then telling a story to sell the rpg. Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive#Orders_of_the_Knights_Radiant Think if you can find any equivalent of this ""gamey"" stuff for any of the great works of fantasy. I bet you can't. The great books don't work in those kind of ""categories"".

68ssy8_16,68ssy8,"The Cosmere is sort of like a series of series. A bunch of worlds, each with its own story. Each world has its own magic system, but the different magic systems all have their roots in the same principles. For now, not a lot of people can travel between worlds, although a few Worldhoppers can be found. The Mistborn series will eventually feature space travel, but that's in a future time period. There will be multiple Mistborn time periods, and one will be somewhat futuristic. There will eventually be a story where everything comes together, but for now, it's mostly just easter eggs.

He also has some books and series outside of the Cosmere.

Personally, I'd recommend reading the Cosmere series in bibliographical order. The books get better as Sanderson gains more writing experience. If you read in a different order, this becomes more apparent, since you'll be used to the better books. Apart from that, the earlier books will help you get more used to the multiple-protagonist writing style, which is very very present in the Stormlight books (which includes the Way of Kings).",Amanoo,2017-05-02T15:52:39Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,16

68ssy8_18,68ssy8,"Let me say this, the Stormlight Archives are brilliant. The Way of Kings was the best time I have had reading a book ever and Words of Radiance was also pretty great, but by then my expectations had been raised. It delivered but did not exceed them. Great books, but . . .

I totally agree with what you said about Mistborn. In the Mistborn series, the magic system is well thought out, but the politics of the houses, the interpersonal interactions of the people, and dialogue are all canned and boring. Mistborn at times feels like a fantasy ad-lib or paint by numbers. It just goes through the motions of an epic trilogy.  I found the bad guys more interesting than the good guys because at least their motivations were complex and tortured. The good guys, especially the main kids, read like cliche teenagers in any young adult series. 

Warbreaker is better in my opinion. Everything about Warbreaker dazzled me. Reminded me more of N.K. Jemisin world building with gods and such. Loved it. Just very different and fun.

I enjoyed the original Mistborn trilogy to a certain degree, but felt that the first entry was by far the strongest. His PG13 style and 'cute-snark' dialogue of some of his characters irritates me, but the man can definitely tell a good story.

I re-read ""The Way of Kings"" and ""The Words of Radiance"" earlier this year and I was stunned by how much more I got from them in terms of lore and world-building.

7b2yug_6,7b2yug,"For some reason I lost my interest in Oathbringer for now... The Way of Kings was 10/10 book for me, especially the whole part with Kaladin running bridges. The Words of Radiance was a fun read but definitely not at the same level IMO; it didn't evoke nearly the same feelings as the first book and I don't like Shallan as a character.

I read the first 10 or so chapters of Oathbringer on tor (free previews) and I realized I didn't actually care anymore... I don't know, this series has been my favorite fantasy series so far, but I just didn't feel anything from reading those chapters when I should've been super hyped. Finishing the first book, I couldn't wait to see more of the plot. Finishing the second one, I didn't really feel I had too much to look forward to in the third book. Reading the free chapters, I confirmed that feeling as none of the developments did it for me.

I'm going to wait a while to read it until I find the motivation to do it. Maybe if I hear the book has some good events I will pick it up. Until then, I have no hype for it. I still highly recommend The Way of Kings for everyone.",,2017-11-06T18:12:20Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,6

I was on an airplane reading the end of The Way of Kings (when Dalinar does what he does for Kaladin and Bridge 4) and I started sobbing, I was so moved. Yet if I tried to explain it to a non-reader they would be mystified.

Same with the way Sanderson holds back on information, like large character hints, stories from their past, or characteristics of the enemies. That last one impressed me a lot, (keeping it vague to avoid spoilers here) where one character discovered something he thought was new and had never been mentioned before in the book, but when we switched to another character we discover they've known it all along. I'm really impressed, since I've rarely seen that in any other authors' works, Sanderson is really good at giving out information without just data dumping.",jordanjay29,2018-09-15T16:30:25Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,14

There is plenty of Syfy and straight fiction that ""world builds"" too but it's never really refered to in this way. 

 Lastly, is world building the major aha experience of this book or will there be a grand realization at some point?   Yes I am very taken by Bridge 4 and the incredible story.   It reminds me of ben hur or even of the biblical story  of Joseph.   I fear I may be expecting more from this book than I am going to get.   I hope not.

It ends up being 500-600 pages of build up and then 100-200 pages of a little pay off. The Way of Kings gave a bit more and was a better than previous  but still his books follow this similar pattern. I think it is just too much and he ends up in a position that GRRM is currently where the world is too big too massive and unless you have it completely planned out it can end up being really hard to find a way to wrap up the lose ends without getting cheap. 



But all in all, I really like his books and the world building however I don't think it needs they need to be as long as they are, there ends also being a lot of redundant and unnecessary scenes that don't really do much, or could be taken down to less.",Sysiphuz,2018-07-08T12:41:06Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,17
8wzzlp_18,8wzzlp,"TL;DR the shortcomings of Sanderson’s early books are not indicative of his writing in the Stormlight Archive or his most recent books in other Cosmere/epic fantasy series. 

One of the problems with reading Sanderson is that his most recent books are much better than his early output in certain areas. For example his dialogue and character development are so deep in the shadow of his world building and magic systems that they feel like flaws. Reading Elantris or Warbreaker first for example would have turned me off Sanderson because some of the characters, dialogue and pacing are subpar. In a way the same goes for parts of Mistborn trilogy #1 if you take a critical approach. 

Discovering Sanderson through the Wheel of Time series of course colored my opinion of him. The standard of A Memory of Light was where I pegged him so maybe that was too much of an anchor for Elantris/Warbreaker. The Way of Kings however blew me away. The only reason I gave it a chance was some guy on old school runescape (r/2007scape) recommended it to me based on a conversation about the ending of WOT and other epic fantasy series. 

If you start with the shorter books written early in his career and find them “meh” or lacking, try reading The Way of Kings. The stormlight archive is brilliant and should be a genre essential one complete. 

The Stormlight Archive is especially good at directly communicating how mental health issues, powerful emotional events and merely having a different way of processing the world can be overcome or turned into a strength. Importantly that process takes time, steps and failures. So much of his writing in SA has a beautiful effect of humans accepting their instance of humanity and moving forward, taking the next step, rather than becoming a slave to it or giving up completely. Sometimes they do the latter, but, as you may grow to learn (or groan at) if you read the series: is the journey that the characters take over the destination, the moment if achievement, which they seek.

Mistborn, stormlight archive, warbreaker (single) and elantris (single) are, while great solo stories, part of a greater universe, that to the canny reader, have some very fun and interesting tie-ins. This shared universe is called the ""cosmere"" and the more you read, the further down the rabbit hole you'll go. 

Example : in one of the interludes of the way of kings, there are three foreign men looking for someone in the ""Pure Lake"" these men are not of roshar, and the observant, nay, very observant reader, would recognize them from other works of the cosmere.

86uds4_16,86uds4,">Men who could read would have huge advantages over those who could not.

While I agree that literacy is obviously an advantage, I don't think it's as significant as you claim in this culture. The standard system seems to be husband/wife pairs where the wife is responsible for records/notes/reading/long-distance communication. While men cannot personally read, the effect isn't as large because all important men have wives or female servants who essentially give them that ability. In the type of society _The Way of Kings_ is set in, poorer people probably can't read anyways, so it only matters for richer men who are usually married to educated women or can hire a female secretary.

This is similar to how, in the past, business executives typically could not personally type very fast, but they had secretaries who could type very, very fast. It would have been an advantage for them to be able to type quickly (as most younger people now can), but it wasn't a particularly large advantage since they could hire people to do it for them.

>Reading is too essential a thing to remain associated with one sex.

I assume here that you mean the ""dominant"" sex would typically be expected to control literacy, as I mentioned previously that many current and past cultures have or had very low female literacy rates. I agree that this arrangement is somewhat unstable in the long run, but is offset in the short run by the factors I mentioned above.

It's likely that such a culture would eventually evolve into one where men also read (as Dalinar's interest in literacy hints at), but many cultures have quite sub-optimal gender roles, especially since culture lags behind technology. For example, women were barred from regularly serving in combat roles in the US until 2013, even though the inventions of guns/tanks/aircraft meant that there had been many combat roles where physical strength wasn't significant for many decades at the very least. These perceptions are changing in our world, but they take time. All cultures are constantly evolving, and the Alethi culture will probably accept male literacy sometime in the future, just as women in combat roles have become increasingly accepted in American culture.

>Men seem to be in charge. Would never happen if they were illiterate.

This is a more complicated issue than it appears at first. As historian Yuval Noah Harari mentions in _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_, there is currently no academic consensus on why most cultures tended to be patriarchal. The naive answer of physical strength has significant historical flaws, and other theories have conflicting evidence as well.

In any case, I think there is a timeline issue with this argument. Cultures developed much earlier than literacy did. It's quite possible that Alethi culture has historically been patriarchal, and that this is a holdover from pre-literacy times. In fact, it is reasonable to argue that the advent of literacy and its restriction to women is playing an active role in increasing female empowerment on Roshar, which is consistent with what you are claiming.

>Having a society where men dont read? Really? Its lazy to believe that could actually exist.

I think Sanderson's description of a radically different society where literacy is considered fundamentally unmasculine would be interesting even if it weren't particularly realistic, because it fosters discussion on how gender roles arise and are perceived in different societies, and the effects these often arbitrary rules can have. Many new ideas seem ridiculous at first and require further examination to appreciate. I do think it's somewhat lazy or at least arrogant to dismiss such a culture as ""impossible""; the world is a big place, and plenty of cultures that would seem ""crazy"" to modern people have existed.

I hate her character and since she's the primary focus of WoR, there are so many POV chapters for her.",Phantom_Ganon,2022-04-13T15:03:37Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,3
u250iw_4,u250iw,"If it's any consolation, Shallan actually isn't supposed to be incredibly clever. She's talking to people in a lower socio-economic class than her, so they're more or less appeasing her and trying to make her more comfortable, so she doesn't make their lives any harder. They may like her, but her jokes aren't always funny in-world. (Later characters remark on how bad her puns are or how she isn't as witty as she thinks she is.) 

General dialogue is a different thing altogether. Sanderson isn't known for his prose. He knows this, and while he has greatly improved - The Way of Kings was released in 2010, and since then he's written and/or released roughly twenty other novels, a few novellas, and a few short stories\* - his philosophy for writing prose hasn't changed. He likens prose to windows (as does the Legendarium podcast). A stained-glass window creates a beautiful picture, but the picture can distract you from what's happening outside the window if it's not your focus. Sanderson's focus is a clear window, the clearest it can be, so there's no unobstructive view of events. That doesn't mean it's perfect, that doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone, and that doesn't mean Sanderson *can't* write purple prose (he can, but he uses it very sparingly). It just means it's a choice of technique that won't work for everyone. 

&#x200B;

\*Since August of 2010, he's written and/or released: 

2 Wheel of Time books (2010, 2013)

3 Stormlight books (2014, 2017, 2020) (3.5, since he's currently writing Book 5)

7 YA books (Reckoners Trilogy 2014-2016, Cytoverse/Skyward 2018, 2019, 2021, 2023)

4 Mistborn books (2011, 2015, 2016, 2022)

4 roughly 100k secret novels (written between 2020-2021, to be revised this year and released next year) 

*The Rithmatist* (published in 2013, but written long before)

Several novellas (aka all of which found in Arcanum Unbounded except Hope of Elantris (which was written in 2006) and Dawnshard (which was written in 2020).) 

The Legion novella trilogy

The Infinity Blade novella duology

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My overall point is that Brandon has had a LOT of time and practice for voice and prose in-between *The Way of Kings* and his current stuff, so expect some improvements with each Stormlight book.",Use_the_Falchion,2022-04-13T14:21:24Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,4
u250iw_5,u250iw,I usually recommend people read the first 3 mistborn books and then Warbreaker before starting the Way of Kings. That way you will have a much bigger appreciation of the Easter Eggs you will find in the books,HursHH,2022-04-12T21:45:59Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,5
u250iw_6,u250iw,"I usually recommend the Mistborn trilogy as his starting point, especially coming off of The Wheel of Time, since there are quite a few parallels between the two, making Sanderson's work feel like a conversation with Jordan's at times. (Which makes since, given how much Jordan inspired Sanderson...and how Sanderson eventually came to finish the Wheel of Time after Jordan's widow read the first Mistborn book.) 

But since you're already reading *The Way of Kings,* my recommended order is probably going to look a bit weird:

*The Way of Kings* (Stormlight 1) - you've already started it

*Warbreaker* \- this can be found for free on his website and is usually recommended to be read at least before Stormlight 3

*Words of Radiance* (Stormlight 2)

Edgedancer novella (Stormlight 2.5 - can be found in Arcanum Unbounded)

*Oathbringer* (Stormlight 3) 

Dawnshard novella (Stormlight 3.5)

*Rhythm of War* (Stormlight 4)

Mistborn trilogy (*The Final Empire, Well of Ascension, Hero of Ages*)\* - If you feel as if you need a break from Stormlight, I recommend reading this series

*Elantris* \- this is a good palate cleanser and is Sanderson's first book, so it'll be ROUGH

Mistborn: Wax & Wayne + Secret History novella (*Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, Bands of Mourning, The Lost Metal* (coming November 2022))

White Sand Omnibus - coming out later this year

&#x200B;

If you feel as if you need a break from Brandon's fantasy stuff with some lighter and faster reads, the Reckoners series (*Steelheart*, Mitosis short story, *Firefight, Calamity, Lux*) or the Cytoverse series (*Skyward, Starsight, Skyward Flight Collection, Cytonic, Defiant* (coming 2023)) can scratch those itches! *The Rithmatist* is one of Brandon's most beloved works, but it ends on a cliffhanger; it's gone nearly ten years without a sequel\* without one in sight at the moment,\*\* so read at your own risk. 

We also have the incredibly quirky and super zany Alcatraz series, if you have something that you want to read with 3-5 grade kids. 

There's also the graphic novel Dark One, the novella trilogy Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds, and short stories like Firstborn on Brandon's website to keep you engaged! 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions!

Lastly, in terms of writing women, Brandon...isn't the best. He's FAR from the worst, and it's something he's listened to a lot of feedback on and has made great strides in, but it does take time to get there. 

&#x200B;

\*He wrote it before he even worked on the Wheel of Time stuff. Honestly, Brandon's works more or less be divided into three eras: 

Pre-WoT - *Elantris*, Mistborn trilogy, *Warbreaker* most of the Alcatraz series

Mid-Wot - *The Way of Kings, Alloy of Law*

Post-Wot - Nearly everything else 

Although I'd probably put *Words of Radiance* and/or *Oathbringer* as separate eras due to Brandon's popularity spike during those years, and the Pandemic might count as one as well. 

&#x200B;

\*\*Brandon and his team ARE looking for a coauthor of Aztec descent to help co-write the book, but we'll see when any progress is being made. Brandon's a busy man.",Use_the_Falchion,2022-04-13T22:40:42Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,6

I will say that after I finished The Way of Kings I vowed that I was not going to pick up any more books in the series for at least the next decade. This is going to be a long series (at least ten books, I don't know the actual planned count) and Sanderson publishes about one new book in a series every two years on average. If you are looking for a great series by the same author it's hard to go wrong with Mistborn, it was hard to do anything else while reading the series because it was next to impossible to put down.

2. Sanderson is a great ideas man and his prose is serviceable. His characterization is consistent. He writes fine, but the total affect of the novel is somewhat blunted by how long it takes to really get going.

3. Despite the ridiculous premise, it is at least inventive and the world shies away from many of the ""fantasy counterpart culture"" tropes that too often infect everything. However, the fact that you need a concordance to keep track of the ridiculously complex history is somewhat daunting.  In addition, the word ""Oathpact"" really bothers me. That's repetitive. It's like saying the ""Darkshadow"" or the ""Blazefire."" Which, now that I think about it, are probably terms Sanderson will use at some point.

I think part of my disappointment was the feeling of 'sameness'. If you've read Mistborn, then you know the major beats that happens in 'The Way of Kings', and the style of Sanderson just didn't carry me through this large book. There is more 'telling' in his writing than 'showing' as some have pointed out. 

Having a friend describe Sanderson's new book 'Steelheart' as Mistborn 2.0 makes me even more weary about reading any more material from him. I got the same feeling from 'The Way of Kings'. 

At the end of that day some might not take that as a criticism. But for someone who likes to read books for the novelty of the story/characters, retreading old tropes without really bringing in any new or interesting elements makes me lose patience really quickly. But if you're someone that loves the the universe, the characters, and wants more of the same (and not in a negative sense), then the book delivers and it could be seen as a great read.

2pstda_8,2pstda,"i think its wonderful. i think the second book is better, just because the characters fall a bit more into their own, but its classic high fantasy with a fresh coat of paint. The gallant heroes and demonic villains reminiscent of the fantasy genre's heritage, but with the scope of a writer who was truly inspired by Tolkien's work on middle earth, and not just someone who read lord of the rings one time.

The way of kings kind of plays out like a murder-mystery of the lost history of the world. There is some wonderful imagery in the action bits, and there is enough going on to distract from the lengthly lulls. Brandon writes very clearly, you won't find him revolutionizing the prose of the genre, but rarely does his word choice or sentence structure distract you from the 'flow.' I often say that reading a sanderson book is like a movie director telling you exactly how the scenes would go.

The first book isnt without its flaws. It's long, which turns off many people i recommend the book to. Its hard to get into. After three(!) introductions (one to the series as a whole, a prologue, and an introduction to the book's main character), the first 30% is tough and a little confusing. One character's story is a little peripheral, and only included for the sake linear telling and consistency in the sequels. And i encourage you not to judge the book fully until you finish it. i know thats a huge criticism cop-out, but the ending of the book is worth seeing the whole thing through.

I've read many other books, mostly high fantasy (Robert jordan, brent weeks, pat rothfuss, the big names mostly), and the way of kings is the best book ive ever read. but with all that said, i think the sequel is a better book. most of the flaws in the first book are cleaned up and there was a good shift in tone that still lined up with the expectations from the first.

Go for it. It's probably still free on itunes, it has been for a few months.

Then I read the second novel.

Wow is all I can say. Just... wow. It was horrible. It read like a YA book written for prudes. The budding romance scenes were just... I don't even know the word. It struck me that Sanderson might be a virgin, I'll just put it that way (not that there's anything wrong with that). None of it made any sense at all, even in the context of a semi-medieval setting. The dialogue's were very poor, the characters went from interesting and flawed, to all-powerful and perfect, practically overnight.

It had it's fun moments, but ultimately Sanderson falls prey to all the traps that modern fantasy writers fall to. Cliched writing, cliched characters, cliched plot, cliched angsty protagonist, cliched battles, cliched everything for the most part.

I would recommend the first novel, but the second is really quite shallow. Honestly, if you've read Robert Jordan or Erikson or Goodkind or any of the dross these types of authors produce(d) then really, you've read this (these) novel(s) as well.

Oh god I hated the main character of that series. 

In the Way of Kings characters make mistakes, sometimes really stupid ones, but they learn from them. They improve, they grow stronger, stop being as stupid as they once were.

In the Name of the Wind, the main character starts off by making some mistakes, which are understandable at first but he never seems to learn from them. He keeps making the same foolish decisions or worse, just digging his own grave. He even repeats mistakes right after having learned how stupid a very similar mistake was before. I quit reading half way through because the cringe worthy decisions didn't seem to be stopping and I started to hope that the main character would get killed off.

2pstda_18,2pstda,"It's not the magic that I had a problem suspending disbelief for -- it was that I did not feel the people of the world behaved in ways that real humans would behave. People's motivations and actions seemed alien, the reactions of others were out of place. My main complaint kept being ""people don't think like that"" ""society doesn't work that way"" ""that's not what any reasonable person would conclude"". 

Sanderson is great at coming up with intriguing and unique magic systems, it's one of his strengths. There's definitely some oddities in The Way of Kings, but I don't consider that to be a huge flaw (Highstorms I didn't really understand, and are a mystery that I am content with never solving.)

It's really mostly his characters and societies that are the major flaw in WoK (IMO). Nobody ever learned or grew, they just were handed solutions when they faced crisis.

Mistborn was also much more condensed and faster paced, being only 3 books, so it didn't feel bad to me, because he writes action well and the cast of characters is smaller, it might have been less obvious since there were other things to focus on.*

Tragedy and Fantasy are 2 very different things when it comes to genre. You can have Tragedy without Fantasy, and Fantasy without Tragedy.

Think about LotR. Fellowship ends with the death of Boromir and the breaking of the Fellowship.

Now think about The Way of Kings. Ends with Kaladim making the first oath (I think?) since whenever, big surge of power, beats the bad guy, day saved. Then, every single part of the story ends the same, maybe with a different character.

I find myself reading through Oathbringer understanding that Dalinar's storyline is *supposed* to be the main one of the book, but not really caring much about it.

I think my only actual complaint about the series is that it seems to be long for the sake of being a long fantasy epic, rather than being long because it has a lot to show. The interludes especially don't add a lot to the story in my opinion.

Words of Radiance is just as good as The Way of Kings but still suffers from some of the same pacing problems where I think Sanderson was world building for the sake of it without moving the plot very far.

While its large and theres a lot of areas, the Way of Kings world feels so huge because each culture is so distinct from another that it feels so large. Plus theres just so much going on and you're not just focused on specific characters that the world becomes so much larger and theres more emphasis on the mechanics of the 'magic' of the world. Rothfuss focuses only really on the one character and his worldview that it is intentionally a 'smaller' world since you only see things through the one guy's view. Its not better or worse, its just different. Most likely not an uncommon opinion but I think that they will be heralded as the biggest names in fantasy for our generation. Sanderson moreso for his world building and the different universes that he's made across so many series that he's written, and Rothfuss for how much detail he puts into the one series and how well you understand the characters and who they are. 

What I guess I'm think I'm trying to get at is that while each writer writes in the first person for their characters, Sanderson still feels like a third person viewpoint like this is happening to this main character, whereas Rothfuss makes you feel like you are Kvothe and this is happening to you.",ChiefBearClaw,2017-07-10T00:41:04Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,4
1k3va3_1,1k3va3,"Everyone's going to hate me for this, but I had a hard time enjoying it. My main complaint is the way Sanderson presents his story, by way of including multiple prologues, several interludes between acts, and only a handful of main POVs to tie the whole thing together. It's ambitious, and I recognize the appeal in something with so much scope, but for my money it came off as being extremely heavy-handed. I would have rather jumped right into the story and done away with all the fluff.

Beyond that, Sanderson just has a certain style of writing that doesn't appeal to me. Don't get me wrong, he is a *tremendous* writer - his prose and delivery are top-notch, his worlds are unique, and his characters are as multi-faceted as you could hope for. My problem is that a lot of this potential is squandered by his insistence on playing everything safe. All the subject matter is squeaky-clean and PG, yet he's writing these thousand-page tomes that simply aren't going to be read by children. It's like he's writing adult fiction for kids. It doesn't have to depraved and disgustingly violent like ASOIAF, but a little blood or sex could have gone a long way to making the story feel a little more real.

Way of kings is an incredibly slow paced story that takes a long time to come together. When it finally came together, I fell in love with the book and the series. 

It is also hard to understand a lot of the world in the beginning, but by the time the way of kings is done, you should feel mostly comfortable with the world and lore.

Brandon himself doesn’t recommend starting out with the way of kings, suggesting you read something easier like mistborn or his other works. That way you trust in him as an author and are patient with and prepared for way of kings.

So all in all it’s definitely a tough book in the beginning, and it’s certainly tougher if that is your starting place. Nonetheless it’ll steadily improve (quite slowly) and payoff wonderfully by the end. The sequels are better books with much better pacing.

gqiah4_1,gqiah4,"I would probably have to say no, my intent was to change this with the Stormlight Archives. I've read the SoIaF books and enjoyed them a lot, and I've read quite a few Discworld books and have a few more waiting on my shelf, although I would hesitate to call them a series since they are quite episodic. And when I was way younger I read the Narnia and Harry Potter books but that was way back. So not really. 

I tried reading WoT but the only main character I liked was Perrin, the others ranged from neutral to infuriating (I hold that the best way to introduce Mat would have been with a graphic description of his death). I got through book one and have picked up the second book at least 3 times but I just can't. 

I feel like this book did a way worse job than book one of either SoIaF or WoT. The way I remeber them is that they introduced the world, basic concept and conflicts that would be important all through the series while still keeping me excited to see what would happen. To me The Way of Kings wasn't in any way exciting until, as I pointed out in another answer, about 89% through the book. To ME this just seems like a big waste of my time. Other books have proved that it doesn't have to be that way even if it's the first part of a long series.

Tbh I think the language might have played a big part in this, probably even bigger than the pacing. I'm a sucker for good dialogue or clever methaphors or just beautiful language in general and, in my opinion, The Way of Kings came short here. A lot of the dialogue, especially in the Shallan chapters, is kind of cringe (I think) and overall it just came across as kind of sloppy. It doesn't feel like Sanderson has any interest in the language itself.

9r1jmy_7,9r1jmy,"I'm not really super into fantasy epics, but I fucking love the Stormlight Archive. Here's my take on it.

There were two things I particularly enjoyed about these books. Taking the Way of Kings, you can see how well planned out it is. There is foreshadowing that gets realized hundreds of pages later, and often in small ways. For example >!the king is paranoid from the start!< but much later mentions offhandedly that >!  he sees the same patterned figures that Shallan does !<. And I enjoy how well he writes the weaknesses of his characters. How Dalinar will often get politically or verbally outmaneuvered. How even someone like Kaladin can get dragged into his depression. It's never really fully gone, it's always there at the edge of his vision. Something to fight against. The whole arc where >! Shallan is losing herself to her personalities in Oathbringer !<.

I also enjoy the philosophy. Especially the often conflicting philosophies of different characters that are all basically good people. Something tells me Dalinar and Shallan wouldn't see eye on many philosophical issues. And also, their philosophies can _fail_. Dalinar made mistakes because he stuck to his ideals. Sometimes the capital-R-Right Thing to Do and the best thing to do aren't the same. >! Adolin killing Sadeas !< goes against pretty much everything he and Dalinar value, and yet it was probably a huge net gain. Would the fledgling tower have survived the constant undermining? Who knows.

All of the above, plus the fact that I genuinely enjoy the characters as people means I powered through all 3 books in about a week and a half. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it did it for me. ",,2018-10-25T04:05:40Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,7

9r1jmy_10,9r1jmy,"The problem for me was the writing. It was weirdly inconsistent. And then you have the dialogue...

Shallan's witticisms constantly fell short and much of the back-and-forth didn't work for the first hundred pages, let alone 1200 or so.

I've tried getting through the Way of Kings five different times and I always have to stop near page 150. Dialogue, poor witticisms, and the conversational tone of the prose did me in.

You can do more of that type of prose and make it work wonderfully (Neil Gaiman), or it can fall flat and feel stale (Sanderson). I enjoy him, but I expected better from a writer who insists that the Stormlight Archive is the story he ""always wanted to tell"" and that the Way of Kings is a book he worked over ten years on. Maybe in plotting/planning, but I can't see it in the execution of the actual writing.",,2018-10-25T06:12:49Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,10
9r1jmy_11,9r1jmy,"I do think that it is essential to keep in mind that the books are not about Kaladin. It was never Sanderson's intention for them to be so. The Way of Kings was about Kaladin, that was his intention. Words of Radiance is about Shallan and Oathbringer is about Dalinar with the next two being about Szeth and someone I will not mention, but you can do some digging if you would like. Each of these books has a main character, but the Stormlight Archives does not have one. Since Kaladin is first, it is hard to get around the feeling that he should be the main character, which I can understand. It is also hard to get around that feeling due to Kaladin just being awesome and fun to read, but once you do get over that feeling of that Kaladin should be the character in the spotlight, you will notice just how big of a scope that Sanderson is trying to tackle and see how remarkably well he is doing at it and how that, in the long run, the books would fall apart if he stayed on Kaladin.

 In fact, if you do some looking around on the 13th Shard or the Coppermind (a forum website and wiki website run by fans that tend to get a lot of interaction from Sanderson), you can actually find early versions of Way of Kings where Kaladin's progression to working under Dalinar is MUCH MUCH different. You can tell it is written in a way that puts/keeps Kaladin in a constant spotlight of focus...and it is not very good. 

&#x200B;

There are hundreds of little details and strings being pulled in the background that you can catch glimpses of that all begin to thread everything together, slowly but surely everything is coming along. It is impossible to do something of this scale while keeping a main character. There is simply too much going on, and an easy way and most common way of this being seen are with a character working as the Wit to the king. If you are a big reader of Brandon Sanderson, in general, you will know why, but even if you just read the Stormlight Archives, it is apparent that the King's Wit is not some simple side character. 

&#x200B;

I love these books, and I love Brandon Sanderson as an author and a person as well. His books are already an epic fantasy with each of his books in the Stormlight archives hitting the 1000+ pages area yet he still provides so much you can learn, research, and reread with each time giving you new details and perspectives that can blow your mind. Even with all this detail he still somehow manages to write a coherent and stable plot line that anyone could follow and that most would like. Which puts Brandon Sanderson to me, a mark above everyone else. 

&#x200B;

If you are looking for a storyline that is remarkable and that follows an utter badass in the fantasy genre. ""The Name of the Wind"" by Patrick Rothfuss is probably one of my favorite books is of all time and something that I strongly recommended. It sounds like it would fit closer to more of what you are wanting. Although, I still recommend you keep giving Stormlight a try or to do more research into the books. It is really quite fun.

49co8n_1,49co8n,"The Way of Kings used to be my favourite fantasy book, thay was before I read Words of Radiance, I think WoK was good, but WoR was even better (goodreads rating increase from 4.62 to 4.76, so I think a lot of people also thinks the same), it built really well from the foundation that had been laid down in WoK, I thought it started slow, just like WoK, but the last 25% or so was one of the best things I've ever read, seriously, it was epic.

The prose, wasn't flowery, it was straightforward and clear, and I liked it, it really didn't distract me from the story, this is of course a matter of preference, but I guess it might worth mentioning.

Anyway, WoR was Shallan's book, just like how WoK, was Kaladin's, at first, I was a bit worried, since I didn't like Shallan that much in WoK, but apparently, she got the character development that she really needed, and it made me like her character more than I thought I would, though sometimes her banters felt a bit forced. It also changed my opinions about Adolin, in WoK, compared to his father, he was just not that interesting I think, but after some of the things he did in WoR, I wished he'd become a main PoV character. And Wit/Hoid was pretty great, he's been in most books in the Cosmere, but his appearance in WoR is still my favourite so far.
The other thing I like is the easter eggs/connections with some other books in the cosmere, some was subtle, others weren't.

5w6bqn_1,5w6bqn,"You're not the only one to have noticed this. I noticed the same similarities as well, and have wondered how much of *The Way of Kings* was inspired by younger Brandon playing games and tabletops and coming up with his own ideas for them, as a lot of it does feel like that late-90s style dream of ""If only we could have a game with these things in it.""

Personally, Brandon's style for me marks one of the earlier shifts in the acceptance in the mainstream of actual fantasy combat. Earlier works that got acclaim, outside of a few niche areas, used to be fairly standard ""They charged at one another and swung swords, the wizard threw a spell."" Even in works that went ""mainstream"" or were acknowledged as ""literary"" (can of worms there), things were kept pretty simple.

Brandon, however, used to joke with his classes (and probably still does) about how easy it is to *break* classic DnD by not playing to the tropes (EDIT: for example, he broke a campaign once by taking his early-levels wizard and opening a restaurant/inn, since all of his spells could be used to provide things that didn't exist in the game world, such as hot running water, lampless lights, and a grill, and becoming filthy rich—his point being that classic DnD suffers a lot of worldbuilding inconsistencies a book these days *shouldn't* have, though many do) . His books were some of the first that really broke into the mainstream that have characters *using* their abilities in intelligent ways ... which a whole generation growing up on clever uses was basically waiting for.

You look at a fantasy now, and we're all about clever uses of teleportation and other magic in grand, clever ways. Far past the 80s fantasy elements of ""fireball ... and fireball.""

Part of Brandon's meteoric rise to the top was that he was one of the first highly publicized authors to bring this ""new"" approach to the fantastic.

Basically, what Brandon, Butcher, Correia, and a lot of other newer authors including myself bring to the table these days is a sense of driven realism behind things, an attitude of ""if this was really real, I could do X,"" combined with a willingness to put that in our stories and subvert the classic, tried and true ""sword and sorcery."" And the new generation *wants* that.

Note that I'm not saying that such didn't exist before, but the public wasn't fully there yet.

Last week I was at LTUE talking with Courtney Alameda about the differences in modern horror versus that of ten-fifteen years ago, and one thing that we discussed was that modern audiences, raised on horror games that demand intelligent decisions from players, *demand* intelligent horror. Classic tropes like ""go off alone when you shouldn't"" no longer hold up without solid reasons, because the readerbase for horror now grows up *playing* games like *Alien: Isolation*, *SOMA*, or *PT*. So they won't settle for dumb characters that make dumb mistakes or do ""basic"" motions.

Likewise in other genres. Readers no longer settle for elements or moments where they can think of better ideas and know the character should. Writers today need to adapt to being just as clever.

Wow, this turned out a lot longer than I expected. Anyway, I agree with you, much of Sanderson's work shows commonality with video games and modern tabletop. But it's in-part because he grew up playing those, and also because the current market is *rewarding* realistic cleverness rather than frowning on it.",vikingzx,2017-02-25T21:48:03Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1

bgewn5_7,bgewn5,"Gotta learn to love the reread! As someone who hated re-reading until recently, I've come to absolutely love the reread on these types of series and picking up on a lot of small details that were most likely missed the first time around. 

There are TONS of those little nods and hints in at least The Way of Kings.",Sanity0004,2019-04-23T11:48:23Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,7
14vifcm_1,14vifcm,"Having read a lot of Brandon's work, I don't think calling it ""sexless"" is entirely fair, speaking as someone who is not a big fan of romance or sex in novels. Half of Adolin's chapters in The Way of Kings is Adolin lusting after random noble ladies and failing, only really stopping when he gets into an arranged marriage, Shallan acted so attracted toward Jasnah that Brandon concluded he accidently wrote a bi character. The only characters you can argue are ""sexless"" is the two people who are literally slaves, and Dalinar who spoilers >!Literally bartered with Cultivation to not remember his wife after her death and is so single mindedly driven that his POV contains very little else other than his goals of uniting Alethkar<!. I personally would find it much more jarring if the person whose entire plot line is about overcoming depression spends a large amount of the book lusting over someone, or if Dalinar was lusting after random women after what he did, or if Szeth who views himself as having no free will and only being a weapon is lusting over random people. It would cheapen their stories to me. The two main characters that it makes sense to have a romance arc, both have one. Similar thing happens in Mistborn, though the sex happens off screen, Vin has a romance arc and talks about how physically attractive she finds Elend, and Kelsier it makes less sense for to have a romance given his own personal stories arc. I personally enjoyed in Warbreaker how a lot of common romance tropes are subverted with the main ""pair"" of Susebron and Siri, and we do see characters in that book still acting lusty (Blushweaver is the ""goddess"" of lust for example, and propositions Lightsong what 4 times throughout the novel?)

Unless you're looking for straight up sex scenes or novels where characters are constantly talking about how hot or attractive they find characters, in which case I guess you can make that argument but at the same time I personally find that really grating and juvenile in books, unless it's used to serve a purpose which most of the time it's not.

As someone who personally doesn't enjoy sex and romance in books, it feels more prevalent than ever and trying to avoid it is hard",chrisk103,2023-07-11T01:38:13Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1

4qpd1d_1,4qpd1d,When The Way of Kings first came out it was free on Kindle and a $1.99 deal on Audible.   It's kinda sad that it's even $9.99 for the ebook. ,Vooklife,2016-07-01T03:42:51Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1
8rwo98_1,8rwo98,I understand where you’re coming from. I absolutely loved the way of kings as well and I think it is better than this book also. But I’ve really come to enjoy the codex Alera. It may be simplistic in comparison to others in the genre but I’ve still found myself enjoying the books regardless. ,Zancrose,2018-09-05T06:42:55Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1
wgc6ln_1,wgc6ln,"I once started out with the way of kings. It ended with reading the entire cosmere, haha. have fun.

One thing I feel I should point out. Stormlight part one is five books. And since many series are a trilogy you might expect book 3 to be more then it is.

I found book 3 to be the weakest thus far. But I have since realized it was because I was expecting a climatic finish instead of continuation.

That said, book four makes up for any flaws in book three. I can't wait for five!",neotank35,2022-08-04T21:52:59Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1

lyc1ar_1,lyc1ar,"The Way of Kings is not a book where you're going to take in all the details on the first read through.  I read all the way through Rhythym of war, including edgedancer and dawnshard, and then started a second readthrough of The Way of Kings and I'm \*still\* sure that there's stuff I missed or didn't understand or both.  I'm planning to read all the other cosmere stuff and come back to reading it a third time. Hopefully  after the fifth Stormlight is released.

q25vf5_3,q25vf5,"Man I really enjoyed The Way of Kings....until I realized that this huge book was not going to resolve much of anything. It was practically a prologue. Decided not to read any more Sanderson after that (who knows, maybe I'll come back some day).

Mistborn was great because the first book stood on its own, and books 2 and 3 expanded in awesome ways you didn't realize book one was missing. I just felt kind of cheated with Way of Kings. Awesome world, great moments, unsatisfying as a whole.",rainpunk,2021-10-06T22:25:13Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,3
5oyzz4_1,5oyzz4,"Depends on your definition of ""best."" He's certainly prolific and consistent and accessible. He can structure a plot and come up with some great magic systems and has certainly imagined a huge universe to fill up with his stories. 

I thought the Mistborn trilogy was okay, though nothing special beyond the ""Ooh, cool!"" factor of the magic system. I couldn't get past the first chapter of Elantris, and I haven't read anything else of his yet. I have bought the Way of Kings, but I'm not in the mood to start another giant epic fantasy series right now. I prefer more intimate stories, a trilogy is about the perfect length to me.

He falls down in the character department, at least as far as some are concerned, and that is my main focus when reading - so yeah, I'm not a big fan. I've heard many complain that his plots are so structured that they seem to pull his characters in unrealistic directions and also that his characters don't feel very well-developed.

Also, his prose is workmanlike - he does that on purpose because he wants his books to be easily consumable, but it doesn't win him any points on the ""great writer"" scale.

I think Michael J Sullivan's Riyria was much more enjoyable than Mistborn. I thought Anthony Ryan's Raven's Shadow trilogy had interesting characters and a freshness amongst the familiar. Lois McMaster Bujold's fantasies are beautifully written with excellent characters. 

Guy Gavriel Kay is a master of language and character and evoking a setting that is both familiar and alien - he doesn't include very much magic though.",serralinda73,2017-01-19T20:56:56Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1
hk3opr_1,hk3opr,"Mistborn is his very first trilogy and definitely some of his weaker writing. That said, they’re still integral parts of the Cosmere as a whole and well lived in the community. If you want a true representation of his writing, start with the way of kings.

When you inevitably read more, make sure you read Warbreaker before more of the stormlight series.",Nostyx,2020-07-03T14:22:12Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1
16s4vsn_1,16s4vsn,"Well-written critique of the series, I can't convince you to like it especially as you so eloquently explain why you dislike it.

For me (at 58 years old) I have read so much fantasy and sci-fi over the years that always ends with almost everyone miraculously having happy endings, the bad guys get what's coming to them, and there are no loose ends. A few examples ... The Martian, The Bobiverse Series, The Way of Kings, Priory of the Orange Tree, Reamde... in those books some ""good"" people die but it usually is noble and achieves something important. So I guess Abercrombie (for me) hits that part of me that is getting tired of the almost unparalleled success that the good guys always achieve.

Having said that, the whole journey to the other side of the world (other than the excellent battles) did seem wasteful and was plenty boring in parts.",myDogStillLovesMe,2023-09-25T22:04:28Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Way of Kings,1
