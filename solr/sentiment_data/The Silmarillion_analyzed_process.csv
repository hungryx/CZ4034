50bhq0_1,50bhq0,"The Silmarillion wasn't something Tolkien ever really ""finished"" as a coherent work. His son Christopher went through all the various things JRR had written about Middle-Earth (some as far back as 1917), tied it all together as best he could, and published it. So some of it reads like very dry history, some like mythical allegory, and some of it approaches the storytelling you're familiar with. So it isn't an easy read, at all. But if you want to understand how Middle-Earth got to where we find it in The Hobbit, then the information is there. 
 
Christopher Tolkien went on to publish ten volumes of his father's papers, showing the path that JRR took to reach the final version of his stories, and how Christopher pulled all of this together to construct The Silmarillion. The interesting thing is that he was under a considerable amount of pressure from the publisher and public to put the book out in the mid-70s, and believes he would have done it differently given more time. (I read them. A lot of interesting information, but as a reading experience, The Silmarillion is a walk in the park, comparatively speaking.)
 
If you just want more Middle-Earth storytelling from JRR Tolkien, read ""Unfinished Tales"" and ""The Children of Hurin"". ",,2016-08-30T15:42:28Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1
50bhq0_2,50bhq0,"The thing is the Lord of the rings was ""written"" by Frodo so it's a good story. The Hobbit was written by Bilbo so it's a bit of a tall tale. When I think of the silmarillion I think of when Gandalf is pouring over texts trying to find information on the one ring. 

The silmarillion is a library of information and stories compiled because that's the best form to transfer that information. Enjoy it more in your mind.",TheresNoAmosOnlyZuul,2016-08-30T17:20:50Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2

**What helped me get over halfway through was the GLOSSARY that was printed in the back of the book I received.**  

If I ran into one of the multiply-named characters and couldn't think of who was being mentioned, I hit the Glossary and it straightened me right out.  If you're reading in short bursts, I would consider that necessary for any enjoyment.  If your book doesn't have that glossary, well, keep a Google tab open nearby/drag Siri into the biggest nerdsplaining session ever?

I don't think reading another book on the side is a good idea.  With so many names being thrown around, I would think it impossible to keep straight with any other reading material.",drowawaycuztired,2016-08-30T17:21:11Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,5

I read ""Amazing Grace"" (Atwood) 3 times up to page 50 or so and kept putting it down and then after months feeling I should restart.  Eventually just started at page 50 and it all worked out.

The Silmarillion, though, was a bit of a project.  Doesn't it have tons of notes?  Dense with information, it just doesn't have a straightforward narrative line that drives you through it.  I started trying to read the notes as I went along, and eventually gave up and read them first, then found it easier to plough through the main text. Still seemed like work, but was totally worth it for the backstory to one of my favourite tales.  Good luck, and keep picking away.

50bhq0_19,50bhq0,"Yeah, that's the Silmarillion for you. It's basically a history book with the trappings and language of a fantasy epic. Right off the bat, I have to tell you this: At the back of the book there should be a glossary, giving a brief tidbit of information for just about every name used. Bookmark the shit out of that. First time I read through, I was hitting it every few pages. It's absolutely crucial.

That said, it's still an amazing story. It's best to take your time with it. Take the time to look back at the maps, family trees, etc. as you read. It'll help you keep track of things while making it more of an exploration. You're basically covering the history of Europe in a single book.

50bhq0_21,50bhq0,"It's a tough read. 

I really enjoy Tolkien's stories. I also enjoy and admire the world he created in those stories. The thing to understand about The Silmarillion is it's much more a history book than a story to read for sheer enjoyment.

It's epic in scale, it's informative, and it's an impressive work in general. But it's rarely purely enjoyable. That makes it feel occasionally more like a homework assignment than reading for fun.

I personally don't know anyone who can honestly say they love The Silmarillion purely as a work of fiction. I love it in the way that I love a world of ice and fire- it's an interesting read that gives more depth to stories I love, though is not something I love on its own merits.

The thing that really helped me sit through it to where I enjoy it is that imagine that the Elves told Bilbo their mythological history. Bilbo wrote them down into the first translation of a book, and this one has been translated into English. It may jump a bit, it may disconnect here and there as the stories are told, but that the Silmarillion is a second hand telling of the mythology of the Elvish people.

50bhq0_53,50bhq0,"It took me years to finish the Silmarillion for the first time.  A friend in high school originally loaned the book to me and over a year later I returned it to him unfinished.  I tried it again a couple of years later and while it took me awhile to do, the moment I finished it I wanted to read it again (and did, very quickly). 

I'm not sure how I finished it other than taking my time and just pushing through it.  Don't stress too much over which group of elves lives where, what each of the Valar and Maiar does, etc, especially on your first read through.  I think it picked up for me when I got past Ainulindalë and Valaquenta and into the Quenta Silmarillion.  

While I reread The Lord of the Rings trilogy every once and awhile, I now reread the Silmarillion at least every other year and usually once per year.  There are so many stories and scenes that are etched in my mind and I can't say enough how much I love this book.",ryklian,2016-08-30T19:34:38Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,53

Nothing but endless lists of various minor elf tribes living in slightly different places, with an inscrutable network of lineages.  I'm still not sure how I made it through that.  (Some misguided attempt to ""complete"" Tolkien, I guess?)

Anyway, the good news, is that after you get through that, the remaining 2/3 are basically awesome middle-earth history that read more like greek myths via Bulfinch or Edith Hamilton.  I recommend that part.  It's rad, has some cool stories, and every so often you get to go ""ooooh, that's why X is like that, in Lord of the Rings!""

But ultimately, if you're not enjoying it, don't feel like you have to read it.  If you're in a ""I want to devour all things Tolkien"" mood, then it can scratch that itch, but ultimately, it's more like supplemental material than core story.  (It was never intended as a standalone book.)  If you want reassurance that you'll find some good stuff if you dig far enough, then yes.  It contains goodies.

Mostly, in my first read, I focused on the outlines of the story as a whole, and where it was progressing. I spent a lot of time inbetween, looking up simplified sources (like the wikipedia articles) on various characters, whenever I would lose track.

Once I had the outline down, and since I really loved it, I went back and read it at a slower pace, again, and allowed more details in. I've read it four-five times by now, but because of its implied scope and detail, I still discover new things every time around.

Passages like this:
""Shall we mourn here deedless for ever, a shadow-folk, mist-haunting, dropping vain tears in the thankless sea? Or shall we return to our home? In Cuivienen sweet ran the waters under unclouded stars, and wide lands lay about, where a free people might walk. There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them. Come away! Let the cowards keep this city!
...
Fair shall the end be, though long and hard be the road! Say farewell to bondage! But say farewell also to ease! Say farewell to the weak! Say farewell to your treasures! More still shall we make. Journey light: but bring with you your swords! For we will go further than Prime, endure longer than Tulkas, we will never turn back from our pursuit. After Morgoth to the ends of the earth! War shall he have and hatred undying. But when we have conquered and have regained the Silmarils, then we and we alone shall be lordsnof the unsullied light, and masters of the bliss and beauty of Arda. No other race shall oust us!""

I would highly recommend finishing it, if you love Tolkien's works.

But from a narrative and prose perspective, it's incredibly dry and honestly just not very good.  If you care deeply about the world and the lore, then sure, it's good to actually get through it, so you can catch all the references and context in the actual stories.

On the other hand if it's a book I want to have read and just lacks an instant gratification hook to keep me engaged (which it sounds like The Silmarillion is for you) I lower my expectations and sit down with the book and go through a chapter at a time, knowing that if I skim certain bits, confuse names, or if my mind wonders, it no longer matters because I'll still remember the jist of it at the end and have the memory of having completed it and the overarching story.

AFFC focuses on the South, where very little is happening and we're seeing this boring time through the eyes of most of the people we hate.   Cersei and the like.  There are few interesting chapters, it is overall a slog.

This incredibly dullness is compounded by the fact that the previous book, A Storm of Swords, was one of the most exciting books I've ever read, where almost every chapter had me audibly saying ""oh, shit.  Oh, shit!""

So...I overcame it by waiting for the show to catch up because fuck you I'm not reading that.  I dropped it about halfway through.

If the book feels like work to get through, don't read it.  The Silmarillion adds flavor to the setting, but it is not necessary to understand the Hobbit or LotR.  If you don't like it, don't force yourself.  It's just not your kind of book, and that's okay.  Being forced to read a book you don't like is what scares some people away from reading.",Throwaway60064999,2016-08-30T23:40:50Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,103

Melkor and Manwe are basically arch-angels. Eru is God. Melkor is the beautiful arch-angel who eventually gets corrupted and falls from paradise (Satan) and he then begins corrupting the minds of men. He even gets renamed. Lucifer/The Morning Star became known as Satan/The Devil. Melkor falls from grace and is forever known as Morgoth. Then after a long war Morgoth gets 'locked away'.

Hell, the story even talks about a sort of ""Apocalypse"" that will come when Morgoth eventually returns to fight the final war to end all wars where he will be defeated by Eru and the other Maia. It's basically a carbon copy of the idea that Revelations (from the bible) is still coming.

Dragons, elves, trolls, orcs and plenty of other less known side things were often amalgamations of various stories told about similar creatures. Dragons for example are known throughout the world, but different cultures have wildly different versions of how Dragons look or act.

The biggest influences you can see come from Nordic and Germanic cultures.

He was heavily influenced by the english country side (which he modelled the peaceful shire after) and he was very influenced by his experience in WWI fighting in trenches.

The hobbit started off as just a fun story for his kids that slowly developed into more. A lot of the silmarillion was just back-story for Tolkien's own notes when writing the original LOTR. He used a very Christian themed mythos with much of the concept about Good, Evil, Messiahs, the eternal struggle against Satan (Morgoth/Sauron) and much of the world building in regards to the planes, gods, higher beings, are all very easily attributed to Christian ideas.

The Silmarillion (or parts of it) was by no means just backstory for LotR, it was Tolkien's life's work.

He was a linguist first and foremost, and therein lies his whole motivation for creating Middle Earth; he wanted a setting and context in which his languages could develop. He started writing it in WWI and didn't stop until he died. His goal was to create folklore for England on the scale of Beowulf or the Finnish Kalevala (can't believe no one has mentioned that here so far). As far as I know, he didn't even intend to write LotR until publishers wanted a sequel to the hobbit.

I feel like I need to mention Kalevala again. Tolkien borrowed some of its plot lines almost directly. The story of Turin Turambar, for example, is very similar to that of Joukahainen in Kalevala, and the Silmarillion (3 gems beyond measurable value) are basically the Sampo (a device that creates wealth). Also, elvish languages were somewhat influenced by Finnish, which Tolkien also studied. I believe he liked the language for its complexity, and while there are only a handful of words that are similar, elvish grammar is derived from Finnish to some extent.

It puts me in the position I like to be in as the reader: all-knowing.  I understand the secrets of the universe.  When Frodo holds up the Phial of Galadriel and starts mumbling in Elvish, the information from the Silmarillion gives a backstory so I know who Frodo is talking about, and I also understand how this is something that truly only Galadriel could have accomplished in all Middle Earth.  For me that is so much better than just stopping at, ""the bright light scares the big spider"".

Then one time I recommended it to a friend who told me she couldn't get through the first chapter because it was like reading the Bible and I was totally taken aback and unprepared for that response.  Never having been super religious, and always needing to know more after reading The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, I never even realized this.

Day shall come again!**’ Seventy times he uttered that cry; but they took him at last alive, by the command of Morgoth, for the Orcs grappled him with their hands, which clung to him still though he hewed off their arms; and ever their numbers were renewed, until at last he fell buried beneath them. Then Gothmog bound him and dragged him away to Angband with mockery.

ks8cer_21,ks8cer,"You are mostly correct. In fact, there's a bunch of different treatments of the story. The oldest one is actually complete, but it was written long before LoTR -- in 1916 or 1917, I think. So it was even before the Hobbit. He would end up changing a lot of stuff later, names especially, but also key plot points. For instance, Melkor is called Melko in that version. It's also written in a more archaic style. Then he wrote a couple of synopses that brought it more into alignment with his other stories, but these are brief overviews rather than full stories.

The last version was written more like LoTR (and around the same time, I think), but it was abandoned just before Tuor is brought before King Turgon. This version was shaping up to be amazing! The abandonment hurts because it was clearly going to be awesome, but I think he needed to focus on whipping LoTR into something publishable at the time and never went back to finish it, alas. 

It's definitely worth checking out. The early 1917 version includes a full account of the battle of Gondolin and the escape of the survivors and the death of Glorfindel. The version in the Silmarillion is only a few pages long; the original tale is much more detailed at roughly 75 pages. The uncompleted version was shaping up to be even longer and better.

Over the years he created more monstrous beings and expended a little power each time. By the time of the War of Wrath he's fallen very far and is not the unstoppable Godlike being. He's now an ogre sized tyrant that can be wounded by conventional means.

A wonderful topic jgress

This sentence struck me. For a while now I've thought there is quite a profound 'disconnect' between the moral universe of the LOTR and that of the Silmarillion tradition, especially with regard to the Turin material. We are never invited to judge Turin in a moral sense as we are invited to judge, say, Denethor or Saruman. Despite the fact that these characters display 'ambiguity' in that they either switch sides (Saruman) or give in to despair (Denethor) I've often thought that the moral fall as opposed to the human, tragic element is emphasized. That is not to say that readers are not invited to feel pity for Denethor, but it is a pity tinged with judgement. This, I think, is what makes the LOTR 'Christian'. It is not merely that we have clearly delineated 'sides' - good and evil, if you will. Rather, it is that readers are asked to actively participate in the moral judgement of certain characters, in very explicit ways. Although literature often asks this of readers, it is not as often so dualistic as it is in LOTR. Even where the judgement is accompanied by other emotions, like pity, it is clear that this never compensates for the evil. We are invited to pity Gollum, but we are also invited to condemn him.

Contrast this with Turin, or Feanor, and this is far less apparent. Although Turin does much bad, advertently or inadvertently, we are never (so far as I can recall) encouraged to judge him as we are encouraged to judge Denethor. Even Turin's suicide is almost entirely tragic. Denethor's suicide is by contrast presented as a kind of moral failing (as opposed to a failure of judgement or character, harmatia). As Gandalf says, Denethor is not ""permitted"" to take his own life, as though there are some set of cosmic laws about these things. In the LOTR-verse, there apparently are. In the Silmarillion verse, this is less apparent to me.

On a personal note, I've always thought that The Children of Hurin is Tolkien's unfinished masterpiece. In my view it contains some of his most poignant writings, and I feel Tolkien the pagan is much more in evidence there.

More good examples. I think I'm beginning to see what the real underlying criticism is. It's not that we are never invited to sympathize with the bad guys; I think what annoys some critics is that the story has identifiable bad guys and good guys at all. Despite ambiguity at a detailed level, the big picture is still one of clear good versus clear evil. When I think back to the Iliad, it was often hard to tell on whose ""side"" Homer was: on the whole, the Trojan War was simply a tragedy that affected two sets of equally good and bad people. Despite occasional glimpses of sympathy, e.g. for the fallen Southerner in Ithilien, Tolkien still wanted us to be sure that those men were allied with evil, and if they wanted absolution they would need to switch sides.

I'm sure that Tolkien was quite aware that his story was not ""realistic"" in that way, and in fact in the Foreword he makes it clear that it is not meant to be an allegory of real life, since in real life both ""sides"" (in World War II) were evil in his view (which itself is a kind of shocking statement for many of us raised to think of it as unambiguous good versus evil). I think what Tolkien wanted to do was distill the good and evil elements that were so thoroughly mixed in our world in order to make it clearer to readers what the essence of good and evil really were, and hopefully use that clear vision to identify good and evil in our own murkier world.

ks8cer_29,ks8cer,"This will always be up for debate making that assumption and   arguing that evil does not exist.

The problem isnt that Tolkiens work lacks moral complexity it's that your personal bias and view on morality  differ from his and your can't see the value in his observations. The duality of good and evil doesn't mean something is simple, understanding the origin of evil is something we still haven't figured out IMO.

70htu6_12,70htu6,"i haven't read the children of húrin, but the silmarillion is essentially a collection of short stories and tales from a mythos. some of them are short epics, such as the whole origin of the elves, their separation along the path to valinor, their feuding and kin-slaying, and their god-damned exile to middle-earth. this continues along the feuds with melkor and sauron, and leads into a multitude of other short stories, with the sagas of settlements and civilisations in middle-earth (menegroth and gondolin) collapsing under the treachery of other elves and melkor.

it's very similar to the unfinished tales book, and the two merge a lot in my mind, which is why i try to avoid mentioning tales like túrin túrambar and tuor, though i think since both are heavily interwoven with the fate of the silmarils they both appear in the silmarillion.

That said, The Silmarillion in particular always leads me to recommend religious and mythological texts, ancient epics and sagas, and that sort of thing over pretty much any post-Tolkien fantasy authors.

Interested in Tolkien?  Read Beowulf, the Morte d'Arthur, the Books of Genesis and Exodus, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Icelandic Sagas, the Kalevala, the Iliad and Odyssey, the Theogony, the Tain Bo Cuailnge, the Mabinogion.

I decided to reread them a couple years ago and got completely hooked. What helped, though, was often pausing my reads to watch some youtube videos about some part of the book I was in. Most youtube videos on Middle Earth are pulling from the Silmarillion and his other works. This gave everything a much greater depth, knowing a rough history of each part of the book. It no longer seemed like some adventure story, it seemed like an active tale taking place in a world extremely steeped in history. With timelines of hundreds of thousands of years you get a real sense of scale of LoTR. I've since read the Silmarillion.

My favorite aspect of it all was if you look at LoTR as ""modern day"" when most regular people no longer believe in magic or even know if the old tales they grew up with are actually true. These Hobbits are quite like that, but are then thrust into this story where this one ring that was lost like 3000 years ago is actually real and the being that created it is alive and wants it back. The LoTR is sort of the final epic tale of Middle Earth. The characters often allude to the other epic tales like Beren and Luthien, Fingolfin vs Morgoth, etc, but don't realize they are in one of these tales until about halfway through the journey.

If you happen to be enthralled by all that is Tolkien, you'll find it worthwhile. But, really, it's the ""historical"" back-story for the author's use. If you've ever, say, run an RPG campaign, it's quite possible that you've generated something similar - notes to yourself that you can call on when required, that make sense of what's going on, but are never intended to be seen by your players. Such story content as there is, is highly episodic; full of stories about characters mentioned in very brief passing in his other works, who meant something to Tolkien (and by implication his characters), but held very little interest for me.

The idea is that The Silmarillion is a religious text, a bit like the Old Testament or the elder eddas, etc - for the fictional world Arda, where Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are both set.

If I recall correctly, it begins with the creation myth, where Eru and his servants sing the world into existence, then it follows the creation of the major species - Elves, Dwarves, Humans and eventually Orcs - and then it talks about some of the heroes of what might be called the dawn age, and their exploits. There's the story of Beren and Luthien, there's the forging of the silmarils, and the children of Hurin, and several others, making up the mythos of the ancient world of Arda.

I think several of the individual stories in the Silmarillion are well worth reading, but that's me, and I can't speak for whether it's worth it for anyone else.

There was a time when I considered myself a huge Tolkien nerd.

5a53qj_16,5a53qj,"Little Column A, Little Column B. 

The Silmarillion is the sort of thing Tolkien fans decide to read to get more into the universe, even though it's often dryer than the main series, and also less linear.

At the same time, The Silmarillion is a very experimental book. It's an attempt to mimic a Bible for a fictional universe, and the end result is excellent. It's just hard to appreciate the first time through, and most people do it because ""Well I like to think I'm a Tolkien fan, and this is *the* defining backbone for works regarding Middle-Earth"". 

It will be dry. You won't understand half of it the first time you read it. You'll probably need to re-read The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings, and then return to read it again, if you truly want to discover its magic.

It's a good book, just one that takes work to appreciate. And I don't think there's anything *wrong* with that; you're not entitled to an immediate understanding and enjoyment of a work. But you deserve a fair warning that, despite its short length, it's a mountain to climb.

The reason you only hear Tolkien fanboys discussing it is because they've gotten the most enjoyment out of it. It's sort of like Chaucer, or Homer: their works are great, but people specialized in English or Greek literature are going to understand the significance more than others. The Silmarillion is a dense book, and unless you're willing to pick away at it, you often won't come away with very much.

At the very least, I suggest reading some select chapters. Some of the early ones, regarding the creation of the world, are pleasant. My favorite, by far, is the tale of Turin Turumbar, which despite being only a single chapter, is one of the most well-told stories I've ever read. There's some really great stuff sprinkled throughout, but some chapters are entirely world-building for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

I'd consider re-reading Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, either before or after you read The Silmarillion. I'm not sure what would help you get through it: doing it first, to appreciate it better, or after, to avoid an overdose. Your choice. But noticing that ""oh, that guy is mentioned in Lord of the Rings!"", or ""This place's name has the same root word as that one guy"" will help you get the most out of The Silmarillion.",TheCodexx,2016-10-31T09:04:02Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,16

Personally I find it the most exciting of Tolkien's works. But then I'm both a Tolkien nerd and a historian. I read a lot of non-fiction for fun.

It's not a novel, so I guess if novels are all you read, it might seem dry. Actually I honestly can’t. There are battles that wreck continents, a bare fisted fight with a werewolf, tragic romances, hypnotic dragons, and the most beautiful creation story in all of fiction. It reads like non-fiction or epic poetry (in prose form), so people may be put off by it. But if novels really are all you read, then maybe you should consider the Silmarillion your first step in branching out. You last tried 2 decades ago? Maybe you’re ready for it now. A lot of people dive into it when they’re too young, and assume they’ll never like it.

If you are still hesitating, a lot of people suggest starting with the Children of Hurin. It’s not my favorite story in the Sil, but it is the most ‘story’ like, and comes with very nice illustrations.

Lotr is undoubtedly one of the most seminal works of fantasy fiction. It's detailed world and epic scale always make for an amazing read. 

Before you start with the silmarillion, know that it won't be a  similar read to lotr. Silmarillion imo is the history and lore on which lotr and the hobbit are based. There are many stories and countless events that create and describe the world we love. You can go for standalone books like the children of Hurin which can serve as a transition to silmarillion from lotr.

Happy reading. You will never regret delving into the vast, intricate, beautiful and inspirational world Tolkien created.",ratbag555,2018-05-20T03:16:20Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,16
8knsmy_17,8knsmy,"*The road goes on and on and on...*

So happy to see another visitor from Middle-Earth! Which parts were your favourite? Have you read *The Hobbit*? I'd highly, highly recommend the Annotated Edition, it's just so literary and fulfilling! One thing you'll notice from the books and the films (especially if you've read the books later, like I did) that the movie's changes are so... artistic. lol. I believe that Jackson's two highly under-appreciated co-producers/writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Both of these fine ladies managed to give a feminist-reimagining of some of the core narratives (a reluctant Aragon, Galadriel narrating the tale, empowered Arwen, a more 'BFF' Sam/Frodo dynamic as opposed to Servant/Master etc.) Absolutely love the books. Absolutely love the movies too! If there ever were any truly good and balanced adaptation of a book and a film, it was this :D 

Have fun with the Silmarillion! If you loved these I'd also highly recommend the high-fantasy pulp stories of *Conan the Barbarian*.  And the magical-realist narratives of Neil Gaiman's *American Gods*.  

I have never read the Narnia books because a) I couldn't find them where I grew up (Saudi Arabia), and b) Later on when I heard that Lewis wasn't as fond of myths as his buddy Professor Tolkien, I was reluctant, haha.

Don't. **DO NOT** try reading that front to back.  Unlike LOTR, the Silmarillion is NOT a single ""novel"" -- it's much more like the APPENDICES at the back of the last LOTR book (""The Return of the King"").

--
THEN -- instead of reading the FIRST two sections of *Silmarillion*... you should get a copy of *""Unfinished Tales""* and read through that (again, more or less work your way back to front).

Trust me, you will thoroughly ENJOY that book far more -- it contains all of the ""juicy"" things you REALLY want to know about (the other Wizards, Galadriel, Numenoreans, etc) and contains as couple of nice ""story"" parts that will whet your apetitie for the earlier ""Eldar ages"" stuff ... whereas you are UNLIKELY to comprehend (much less enjoy) the first two sections of *Silmarillion*... **until** you have consumed those other bits.",DWShimoda,2018-05-20T21:34:55Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,28

8knsmy_33,8knsmy,"Reading the Hobbit first can make sense because it introduces Middle-earth and famous characters like Bilbo and Gandalf. It was also the first book Tolkien published in Middle-earth before publishing the Lord of the Rings years later. It's easy to read (written as a bedtime story for children) so it's an easy way to get introduced to the world.

After that, you should read the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring, then the Two Towers, and then the Return of the King (you could also just start with the Lord of the Rings if the Hobbit isn't your style--the Hobbit isn't strictly necessary to read first, but it fills in some gaps). The Lord of the Rings is definitely not the easy children's story that the Hobbit is, but it's Tolkien's most famous work for a reason.

After that, you can read the Silmarillion. This is written as a collection of myths/tales that take place in the ancient past of Middle-Earth (thousands of years before the Lord of the Rings). Some feel it's almost biblical in style and scope (it's basically an alternative, fictional history of ancient England/Europe). There are numerous characters, monsters, and epic feats, along with some backstory for some VERY old characters from the Lord of the Rings. It includes some of the more famous stories among Tolkien fans, like the stories of Turin, Beren and Luthien, and the Fall of Gondolin. Overall, they relate to the reign of Middle-earth's original Dark Lord. This book can be quite dense, but the family trees at the back are useful in helping to keep everyone straight. Tolkien never finished this work in his lifetime, but he considered it his magnum opus, and his son Christopher compiled his notes to form a complete, coherent narrative.

If you're still craving Tolkien after that, you have some options. Unfinished Tales is a compilation of some more of Tolkien's ""unfinished tales"" in Middle-earth. Some books like ""The Children of Hurin"" and ""Beren and Luthien"" provide alternative, longer, or verse versions of some of the stories in the Silmarillion. And the History of Middle Earth series (a twelve book series beginning with the Book of Lost Tales: Part One), written by Christopher Tolkien, is a comprehensive, scholarly treatment of Tolkien's writings in chronological order over his lifetime, with analysis of various drafts at different stages in the development of Middle-earth. It explains how Christopher pieced together the Silmarillion, for example. This one is for serious Tolkien fans.

3gs2ol_1,3gs2ol,"I believe that the answer is both yes and no.

As I recall, the silmarils had their origins in Tolkien's Silmarillion myth cycle, that he had been working on in one form or another since 1914.

As I understand it, when Tolkien began working on The Hobbit in the 1930s, he did not originally intend for it to be part of the same world as the Silmarillion.  They were two completely separate literary universes.

He did, however, borrow many ideas from from his as yet unpublished Silmarillion cycle to help flesh out the story and world of The Hobbit.

There are numerous similar-but-not-exact parallels between the two works, and the arkenstone was probably a case of Tolkien recycling his idea for the Silmarils and reworking it slightly to fit into his new story.

So according to the in-universe history that was later established in both The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion, the arkenstone and silmarils are two distinct entities.  But from a meta perspective, the arkenstone can be thought of as being more-or-less the same thing as the silmaril in question. ",,2015-08-13T02:03:11Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1

3gs2ol_3,3gs2ol,"I believe this to be the most correct take on the debate.  I wish there was a comprehensive copy of the Silmarillion stories, prior to the current published version.   

Symbolically, there are quite a few similarities from the Silmarillion in his other writings.  It was not accepted by publishers ""as is"" and he continued work on other stories.  Posthumous, his son ""cleaned up"" the Silmarillion to fill in gaps.  This material was mostly a mix of the hobbit stories and Silmarillion + Lost Tales. (No direct source, pure speculation because... Well.. Only Christopher knows for sure where each gap was and which writings he used to fill them).  

I do believe, however, that JRR was not exclusive in his writings.  Once he began the hobbit series, he began to weave The Silmarillion to blend the two.  In my opinion, this occurs mid/late in Quenta and follows into Akallabeth (where the cross-name sharing really begins).  The final story (Rings of Power & the 3rd age) felt a bit rushed and piecemeal recounts of historical references from LOTR.  Quenta was also the point at which he was working on LOTR and revised some of the original Silmarillion text..

So that's kinda my take on it.  I'd really like the capacity to take the three major works (Lost Tales, Silmarillion, and hobbits) and compare them in simultaneous times, as they begin cross references.  The closest thing is really The History of Middle-Earth.

The only thing that anyone could do to them was place them in an iron crown (Morgoth) and Beren popped two of them out with his dagger in the Story of Luthien and Beleren.  I feel that it's highly unlikely that Manwe, the Eldar, and even Eru himself would allow a Silmaril to come into the hands of Dwarves (who were actually created in secret without Eru's blessing) unmolested for that long.  I think that the similarities between the Silmarils' relationship with the Noldor and Thorin's people with the Arkenstone highly encourages this theory, because they are both representative of one of Tolkien's most common themes throughout his Middle Earth stories:  a fall from grace due to covetous actions.  Even the greatest and most noble of beings of the Elves, Dwarves, and men can be corrupted by a desire for power.  In this sense, I see your reasoning in drawing a line between the Arkenstone and the Silmarils, but I think they are just parallel stories (theme-wise) for the elves (and their hero, Feanor) and Dwarves (Thorin).  Also, a side note:  the Silmarils aren't difficult and damaging to hold for everyone, only evil beings of Morgoth's creation.  He corrupted their hearts to shun the light of Valinor and hate them, so naturally a normal being like an elf or dwarf or man could hold them without any issue.

As someone is fairly passionate about the Silmarillion, it negates the ending because the entire saga essentially revolves around the wars fought over this. To have one resurface later as an awesome, but not particularly amazing gem, just makes it pointless why bloody, bloody wars were fought over it. 

Also, the Silmarils got around more than people think that they did, and given the long lives of elves, it is absolutely plausible for both Noldor, Sindar and Sylvan elves to have both seen it and/or be highly familiar with it from lore. In addition, the ring not being recognized was likely connected to the fact that it belonged to a hobbit, who seem more resistant to its influence.

I was making the comparison in order to illustrate how it would ruin the ending of the Silmarillion for this gem to be a Silmaril, just as it would ruin the ending of LOTR if someone magically appeared to have the one ring.

To take what had been taken by Melkor and to defeat him. You also know that the War of Wrath was largely a failure and it ended as was prophesied in utter sadness and tragedy for everyone involved.

>for both Noldor, Sindar and Sylvan elves to have both seen it and/or be highly familiar with it from lore. 

Indeed. But again you're forgetting the incredibley vast majority of any elves that saw the Silmarils stayed in Valinor. The only person in Middle Earth to have possible seen the Silmarils is Galadrial. Who probably never saw the Arkenstone and even if she did was above such pursuits of possessions that lead only to greed and sadness. She very likely may have thought it best to continue to let the dwarves believe the stone was not as powerful and precious as it was to avoid more bloodshed over seeking it's possession.

>In addition, the ring not being recognized was likely connected to the fact that it belonged to a hobbit, who seem more resistant to its influence. I don't think dwarves had any particular protection from the greed and lust inspired by the light of the Silmarils.

Not really relevant to what I had to say. I'm simply pointing out that if one saw the ring of power sitting on a table it would simply look like a common gold ring. Most who saw it would not assume it was the ring of power. Hell Gandalf himslef had to spend years traveling Middle Earth to verify that it was the ring of power and only discovered it based on historical records not on the look of the ring itself.

>Thus making it unlikely for anyone to attempt to do it, even if they were one of the few who might have some vague idea of where it landed.

Then by your own logic this would apply to the Arkenstone were it the silmaril as well. You're contradicting yourself.

>I think it was more tragic that the pursuit of these gems ultimately render the only two remaining heirs so evil and impure that they could not bear to touch the Silmarils themselves.

It was tragic that generations of a noble race destroy themselves through greed and corruption and war and death in the pursuit of objects and pride. The story is about the gradual downfall of a great race through the corruption of material objects and desire and being unwilling to accept the things that happen.

>They are unable to be altered or unmade by the Valar themselves, which is another reason the Arkenstone cannot be a Silmaril as the dwarves cut the arkenstone

How does anyone know the dwarves cut the arkenstone? Isn't it just as likely that the Arkenstone had been around for so long that everyone assumed the dwarves had carved it since no one thought it could have been the Silmaril? Since Bilbo wrote the Hobbit couldn't he have just mistakenly assumed it dwarven?

And the fact that they cannot be destroyed in no way makes them necessary objects. And it also contradicts your next point. No one would have thought they could remake the trees with them if in the very definition of the Silmarils they cannot be altered or destroyed. Condradicting yourself again.

>Finally, I just have to point out, as someone who has issues with the Valar, half the fucking tragedy of the war was directly caused by the Valar themselves refusing to act. Like, seriously. It's like saying ""Hey, don't wear that blue dress, bad stuff will happen to you"" and then the only bad stuff that happens is that you beat me when I wear the blue dress. Sure bad stuff happened, but it was because of your actions.


Umm what? No. Just because the Valar don't take part in helping the Elves with every problem doesn't mean it's their fault. Melkor is the one responsible for everything bad that happened to the Elves not the Valar. It is discussed in the Silmarillion that the Valar don't interefere in every problem of the lives of the Elves out of respect for the music of Eru and in letting it play itself out. It is in the playing of the music that it's true beauty can be revealed. If they interfered all the time it would disrupt the vision of Eru. Basically if everything was chocolate cake an booze and titties and happiness all the time those things wouldn't be valued or special anymore is I think the vision Tokien was putting forth.

EDIT:

>Besides the Silmarils being unable to be cut, they also burned the hands/skin of those unworthy to touch it, not ever noted in the Hobbit.

And who's to say that Hobbits and Dwarves are unworthy? It only burned Maedros and Malgor because of the evil dishonest murderous deeds they had done to obtain them.",lejefferson,2015-08-13T22:28:49Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,14

If you haven't read the Odyssey (and others asides) then you NEED to go and read some classical/mythological literature before reading the Silmarillion. I, too, struggled with it and put it down quickly first time. But years later after I had read The Illiad (one of those ancient, classic mythologicalish works that Tolkein loved and seemingly was trying to emulate) the themes and tones in the Silmarillion made SO MUCH more sense and was really very enjoyable. As en explicit example, what I read of the first era elves baffled me in the Silmarillion compared to what was presented in LOTR, but in the context of how the Greeks behaved in The Illiad it made a lot more sense and I was able to adopt a new view. So go and try some of those Greek classics, and any other ""ancient"" books on your list, then come back and try again on Tolkeins very own ""ancient classic""",RustyNumbat,2017-04-02T13:49:08Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,3

62nj69_6,62nj69,"I don't think it's that simple. 

'Why would you only read something if it has literary value?' 

I read lots of books that don't have literary value, if you take a narrow definition of the term. I love American history books and books about psychopathology. They fit in well with my limited, pre-existing interests. 

'You should read it because you want to, and THEN judge the book yourself.' 

But why would I want to in the first place? What's going to lead me to invest a chunk of my limited time into a new book? Maybe the book has a nice cover or a nice description that strikes a chord with me, or maybe its first few pages really grab my attention. But not all good books are immediately interesting (certainly not the Silmarillion). And not everything that's immediately interesting is worth spending time on (ex: hardcore porn). Some books are a tough slog all the way through and only rewarding as their messages sink in in the weeks and months after you finish. 

So now I have to choose between a bunch of books that I would never pick up if I went off my own likes and dislikes, and I need to choose what to spend my time on. Tens of thousands of books are published each year, and I'm only going to be able to read a small percentage of them. What do I go on? Perceptions of quality from previous readers (you can say this is something different from 'literary value', but then we'd be arguing about semantics).

19b0ol_1,19b0ol,"I would start with the Silmarillion which is a complete history of Middle Earth.  Actually the planet\world is called something else, but that isn't important to know at this point.  

The book begins with the creation story.  The ultimate creator god spawns off lesser gods that go about creating the world.  Amongst these gods is Tolkein's Satan, the one who created Sauron, the Balrogs and Dragons.  He is constantly making mischief, but his true power doesn't come from the powerful monsters he unleashes in the world, but in his ability to lie and deceive and corrupt the mind of a very proud Elf.  Much like the Serpent tricks Eve into eating that fruit.  Once the deception is complete the Elves Garden of Eden time is over.

I will warn you now that this text is much different than reading the Lord of the Rings.  It is reads like a mythology, not a personal novel.  There are a lot of names to keep track of and a lot of years that will go by.  The action takes place in lands that don't really even exist by the time of the 3rd age (when LotR takes place).  You may spot some references from the LotR but not many.  I'm thinking of some lines from the movie here which are clearer to me now than the books.  The Elves, for example do come from the West in a land called Valinor.  That is where those ships at the end of LotR sail.  When they meet the the Balrog in the mines in Fellowship the term ""Balrog of Morgoth"" is mentioned where Morgoth is one name given to Tolkein's Satan that makes Sauron look like a child.

You won't hear Gandalf mentioned.  Elves like Galadriel and Elrond in the LotR are nothing compared to the ancient Elves of this story.  Galadriel is mentioned, but she is more like a child elf of no real significance.

Many people report being bored.  I enjoyed it, but you have to be in the mindset for something that is more of a mythology than a personal adventure story like the LotR.

I believe the races of elves and dwarves and magical powers actually line up more with Norse, Celtic mythology?  So in many ways, despite being a devout Roman Catholic, Tolkien wanted to create a world inspired by various pagan and polytheistic mythologies.

One piece of advice though... I'm a hardcore Tolkien fan and have read the trilogy and The Hobbit upwards of a dozen times. I have only read The Silmarillion twice... And only understood the book as a whole after I read a guide to the book. That's how crazy it is. But it's still totally worth reading. It answers so many questions and hints from the other books and just fleshes out the LotR universe so much more completely than if you just stick to the trilogy and The Hobbit. It's a rewarding and challenging read so prepare yourself. 

When I was a teenager I read a guide book after I read it the first time (this was pre-internet as we know it) and I can't remember what it was called, but a quick Google search makes me think it was probably ""A Reader's Guide to The Silmarillion.""

dio9z2_30,dio9z2,"Fair warning;  The Silmarillion is one of the hardest books I've read.  The first section is a creation story, and is difficult to keep track of events prior to the awakening of the Elves.

The 2nd part of The Silmarillion, technically The Silmarillion proper, is a sweeping history.  Unlike LotR it isn't focused on individuals, though there are numerous vignettes revolving around individuals, but rather the overarching tale of the centuries of war that culminate in the end of the First Age.  It is a more difficult read due, in part, to Tolkien's giving multiple names to places, and sometimes people - even sharing some names with unrelated places from LotR.

The 3rd, and final, part of The Silmarillion is probably the easiest to read as a history.  It is the founding, history, and destruction of Numenor.  The number of places and persons that have multiple names are limited to two names, one in Elvish and the other in (IIRC) Adunaic (the language of Numenor).

Good luck on the grand adventure that awaits you.  It took me two or three tries to get through The Silmarillion the first time.  If you have to walk away, don't be afraid to come back to it later.",LilShaver,2019-10-17T01:56:57Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,30

dio9z2_43,dio9z2,"Silmarillion is not a ""book"" written by JRR Tolkein. It comprises notes meant to provide the author (not the audience) with historical depth and setting for his LOTR universe. Kind of his musings and a few short stories that he created to anchor his sense of history while composing LOTR, to give it three dimensionality in his mind. Perhaps some of the short stories were meant to be included in the trilogy and he chose not to include them, or converted them to poems or ballads for the books, instead.

JRRT's son Christopher compiled these notes after JRR died and published them as The Silmarillion. It isn't a book, imo. It is a compilation of notes and backstory. If you are a true LOTR fanatic, after you've stewed in the trilogy many times in many forms, over many years, Silmarillion can be enjoyable to expand your universe.

>And that's just the thing, the first two or three chapters really are the most difficult. It's kind of an eye-in-the-sky, historical annals style to a more traditional narrative. One thing that is frustrating about the first few chapters is when they get into the names of the Valars. Tolkien rattles off, like, three names for one dude but gives you no indication which name he'll actually stick with for the rest of the narrative and that can get confusing at first. There's no shame in using liberal use of the glossary, but beware, try not to read past the first line of an entry as they will often go right from saying Who They Are to Who Killed Them :p

>**Second**, listen along with the *Tolkien Professor's Silmarillion Seminar*. It really helps to be able to sit in on a ""class"" of people reading thru it with you, especially because some of them are repeats, and some are reading it for the first time, so you get a good mix of perspectives and questions to help you understand what's going on. It's because of this podcast that I was finally able to get thru the Sil for the first time, and sometimes I straight up just re-listen to the podcast instead of committing to a full re-read of the book!

dio9z2_55,dio9z2,"IMO Christopher Tolkien did his father a disservice when he tried to create a coherent narrative and publish it as one volume.  The Silmarillion should have been several short volumes.  The modern versions (e.g. 'Beren and Luthien', 'The Fall of Gondolin' etc.) are a better representation of how Tolkien imagined this mythology - 'a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story-the larger founded on the lesser in contact with the earth, the lesser drawing splendour from the vast backcloths'.",,2019-10-16T19:28:04Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,55

dio9z2_57,dio9z2,I don’t know if this is entirely accurate. I’m reading the tale of Beren and Luthien right now and Christopher makes it pretty apparent that his father had plans for a grand retelling of all myths in one book.

wwuej_1,wwuej,"It isn't well suited in my opinion. I love The Silmarillion, but it isn't even really a novel. It is more like a fictional history. The stories aren't connected into the sort of narrative you could make a popular movie out of, and the characters are mostly legendary and near-superhuman. People won't relate to them, even people who love LOTR and The Hobbit for the most part don't finish The Silmarillion. 

It *might* work as a HBO type series, with each story covered over the course of several episodes and the grand arc of history sort of pulled together over several seasons. Then you would be able to give the necessary time to each piece, and wouldn't need to cut out too much stuff, and the way that the story made sense over a long time and the big picture is revealed over the seasons would make up for the somewhat difficult-to-relate to characters. You could even pull in a bunch of material from the History of Middle Earth books. I can't even imagine the expense though.

I would love to watch that all in one go. Either way is unlikely to happen though in my opinion. The Silmarillion is nowhere near as popular as The Hobbit or the LOTR.",mickey_kneecaps,2012-07-21T11:05:26Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1
wwuej_2,wwuej,"Well, as much as I too love The Silmarillion, attempting to make it into a film would be akin to trying to make a movie out of the Old Testament or Herodotus' Histories. As cool an idea as it sounds on paper, it just wouldn't work in practice. There are simply way too many characters in way too many different plotlines over way too long a timespan. The only way, I think, it might be able to be done is in a long, not easily accessible, Fantasia-style animated film. And yeah, that also sounds awesome, but since it wouldn't be terribly likely to draw in the crowds, it's also not likely to happen.

Certain episodes from The Silmarillion could almost certainly be made into stand-alone productions (the story of Beren and Luthien would be particulary good for this), if the Tolkien estate could be persuaded to part with the rights, which sounds unlikely for the time being. This is probably something of a mixed blessing, as tons of moments from The Silmarillion would be awesome to see on film (an army of Elves battling an army of Balrogs, dragons, trolls and orcs comes to mind), but it would be pretty horrible to see any beloved part of the book be simple filmed as just another silly, dumb fantasy (imagine if someone decided Feanor needed to be a cut and dry hero rather than a jerkass who gets everyone killed).

Oh, and for the record, I would watch the hell out of an HBO series based off the Histories of Herodotus. Just putting that out there.",permagreen,2012-07-21T13:45:29Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2
wwuej_3,wwuej,"I really hope that they do not make a movie of it. There's too much in it for them to miss and so much of the content is less set in stone than in the later series. I would hate for them to use creative discretion on a moment that was really quite important and well... not get it correct. 

Think of it this way. The Silmarillion echoes the style of the bible. The writing, the flow and the content are all rather similar. In my opinion, proposing to make the Silmarillion would be like proposing to make the bible into a movie. It just isn't possible. People can pick it apart and choose a story within it to feature as a movie but creating an all encompassing experience is simply too difficult. Whatever stories there are, do not have the wealth of details to them that would allow an easy process of transferring from paper to screen. Not to mention that it would have to be an epic in length that not even Lawrence of Arabia would live up to. 

I wouldn't mind a mini series. Perhaps. But overall, I'd just be happier if they didn't go near it at all. It's unnecessary. And I say this not as a Peter Jackson hater. I'm still listening to the movie soundtrack regularly and I've seen the movies countless times. But I don't believe that he, nor any filmmaker, should go near that wonderful book. 

Edit: As a further point, I think that a lot of people will be using Game of Thrones on HBO as a reference to how it could work. I do not believe that they are comparable. GOT has heavy dialogue and details in its writing that lends itself easily to the screen. It's long because each look and feel and touch is elaborated on. Silmarillion does not have this.

Tolkien himself said he wished to create a sort-of mythology for the U.K. and did so with his tales of Middle-Earth, and I think Peter Jackson's tales do, in some part retain that fairy tale feeling. Why not sell the rights to The Silmarillion, or The Children of Hurin? With the amount of works he published about Middle-Earth there could be a Star Wars like world created in film.

Edit:  Through investigating so far it seems these will be new stories written during events more directly preceding the Fellowship (which are outline in the appendices to LOTR).  It's still not fully clear but, ""The adaptation will tell new stories based in the period preceding The Fellowship of the Ring"" seems to indicate this.

Just see it as a bunch of history stories, dont worry about forgetting characters, just read along and the stories that appeal to you will stick. And if you took a liking to a character or story, you might wanna know more about them, you will reread the stories that reference them or their kin and through that new framework you will remember new things from it by connecting it to that character you liked.

i for example read the silmarillion when i was really interested in thranduil from the hobbit movies, so i knew a bit of his backstory from various wikis and coudl connect with the history part of the silmarillion stories that referenced it.

Other stories are just really beautiful on their own? The love story of beren and luthien, or elwing who turned into a bird and her husband who sailed the skies, or haleth the warrior... a bit like fairy tales almost :)

the best way to approach the book is as Tolkein's own guide to/notebook about Middle Earth history. He wrote many of the passages contained within to help himself write *The Lord of the Rings* books, so *The Silmarillion* functions more as a series of ""legends"" about Middle Earth that are mainly references to Norse/Anglo-Saxon tales. 

I'm kinda drunk right now and so can't remember an example but basically Tolkein drew from a lot of older source material, mainly Scandinavian sagas and the like, and fitted these into his own fantasy world. Drout went over some of the examples (I want to say Beren and Luthien comes from some old Norse shit but that might be the one that he based on his and his wife's courtship...) and knowing this really helped me get through the book, in that I knew that Tolkein was working through his inspirations and not simply making up really dry-seeming myths.

I really enjoyed *The Silmarillion* but I think it was because I read it a. after reading everything by Tolkein (and I mean everything, including translations of stuff from Anglo-Saxon) and b. while getting lectures on its inspiration.

15lfz4_8,15lfz4,"Read ""Sons of Hurin"" first, then decide if you want more. 

The Silmarillion is not a novel, it's... it's a thing unto itself. 

The Silmarillion is a kind of fictional ""ancient text"". Tolkien is an unconventional author, who created a set of ancient imaginary languages, and then built up a mythology to give them a place to exist, in a sort of imaginary pre-history of the British Isles. The Silmarillion is a kind of make-pretend Old Testament for this fictional world. Like the ""real"" Old Testament, it's not especially readable, it focuses heavily on family histories and linealogy, it is written in an archaic and ponderous style, and it requires a significant investment of effort on the reader's part to make sense of. 

I love it. It might be my favorite Tolkien work, but that's hard to pin down. It contains some great stories, but its primary artistic value is not in the ""story"", but in the creation of a fake ""ancient text"". The reader is forced to be part historian, part archaeologist, part linguist, and all regarding a fictional world. Its literary and artistic value is not anything like being a ""great story"", it's a puzzle-box, a fake artifact.

Tolkien, unlike any other novelist I can think of, deliberately set out to create a vague-ish ""fictional ancient mythology"", complete with ambiguities, multiple languages, conflicting interpretations, and lots of self-contradiction. 

Example: Balrogs are in different places described as ""man-sized, but greater"", or filling 300-foot chambers, having wings, falling without wings, being made of smoke and fire, riding horses into battle, being cut by swords, being very few in number, riding to war in battalions, etc... the Balrog depicted in the movies is not incompatible with some descriptions, but is clearly not a thing that could ride a horse and be defeated in combat by a man with a sword, which also happens in Tolkien's works. 

Tolkien writes conflicting, ambiguous, and contradictory versions of events, especially in the Silmarillion, and also writes long, laborious, and confusing histories of families and dynasties, and so on. Silmarillion is not an ""easy read"". It's not really even a ""story"", it's a kind of imaginary primal text. 

Tolkien had an express desire that his writings would inspire future works of literature, art, music, poetry... he specifically created a world that was detailed but vague, and open to interpretation.

The Silmarilion is not a ""light read"". ",,2012-12-29T10:49:26Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,8

2q528e_1,2q528e,"*The Silmarillion* was published after Tolkien's death by his son, Christopher, and I believe it is shorter than Tolkien wanted; when he attempted to publish it shortly after WWII, he was refused on the grounds that it was far too long, requiring too many resources to print in consideration of post-war scarcity.

*The Silmarillion* may give you the wrong idea about Tolkien's writing style as in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. *The Silmarillion* is structured like a series poetic retelling of historical events, in the sense that there is no dialogue, and no overarching story. *The Silmarillion* covers thousands of years of history with few recurring characters. Perhaps the only character who appears from his subsequent fantasy works is Galadriel, and her name is only mentioned once, in passing.

I recommend against reading *The Silmarillion* first; it is a poetic history book, while *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are novels. Reading *The Silmarillion* last, I found more satisfaction than if I had read it first; it was a great way to experience more of the world after the stories were done.

If you are concerned about missing historical references, Tolkien wrote his two novels (if you include the Trilogy as one novel) so that you don't need to know any more history than is told to the characters. If you want to know more of the history, there are several volumes dedicated to the subject that are more complete than *The Silmarillion*: *The History of Middle-Earth*.",kaqmere,2014-12-23T04:10:44Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1

Gimli and Legolas become buddies, sure, but thus is not followed by any inner development. The same can really be said for Aragorn becoming king. He remains heroic Aragorn, doing what is necessary to defeat the Enemy. To be fair, we don't even really know his inner motivations as these are simply not explored by Tolkien. 

I enjoyed the books, but they were infinitely more focused on world building than character building. It reads like a modern version of a Norse epic, which I guess shouldn't be all that surprising.

I first read The Hobbit when I was 8; it was in a collection of children’s novels my dad brought home for me (also included were Black Beauty, which I didn’t really like, and Little Women, which I loved.) I really liked The Hobbit and would reread it from time to time. In high school I read the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time; the second book was my favorite. I tried to get into the Silmarillion, but it was never my jam. That opened up a whole world of fantasy for me, a genre I enjoy today.

I laid in bed for a month and literally plowed through it, and just as I got past Helm's Deep I realized I was on totally virgin territory for myself, since I'd watched Ralph Bakshi's 1977-movie, which ends after Helm's Deep too.

The last novel was unbearably exciting, and the very end made me cry a lot. After it was over, I read through all of the Appendices too, and reaped all that fantastic extra exposition.

This prompted me to later buy the Silmarillion (Ted Nasmith illustrations), and ""History of Middle-Earth"". I especially enjoyed the ""Morgoth's Ring"" part of HoME, which was wordplay, since Morgoth didn't use a ring, all of Arda was his ring; he took of himself and put it in all of the world.

letnig_2,letnig,"I love it!

English isn't my first language (it's technically my third, but I've forgotten most of my second, so...) and I decided I wanted to expand and improve my English vocabulary. ""Well,"" I said to myself. ""Find a good dictionary and a lengthy tome by a master of the English language — and get to reading!""

This was back before everything became digital, so I went to a bookstore and bought the biggest version of Oxford's Andvanced Learner's Dictionary I could find, and a copy of Lord of the Rings — and got to reading.

Between sentences that just sound hilarious in modern vernacular, like ""Frodo thought it quite queer to come upon such a dike in the middle of the forest"" and ""We should all carry at least one faggot each so we might make a fire,"" and having to look up a word per page or more I was too distracted to keep track of the world building.

See, since the goal was to really know and understand the English language I had this one simple rule for myself: if I came across a word I couldn't define, or at least verbally explain the meaning of, I had to stop and look it up. Even if I just looked it up a page or two ago, I still had to look it up again until I really got it. This rule applied to the dictionary, too, so I actually wound up spending quite a lot of time just reading the dictionary. (I highly recommend this method, by the way, to anyone who wishes to expand and improve their vocabulary.)

The story, history and the characters really hooked me, though, and the world building I could see going on while I was distracted by looking up words and giggling at Frodo coming upon queer dikes in the forest — it really intrigued me, so I read it again.

I still had to look up a bunch of words, but not so many this time as to interfere too much with my immersion into the story. I got to expand on the images I'd begun spinning in my mind on my first read through. This made me want even more, so I read it again!

I ended up reading it seven times! During that time I read the Silmarillion twice, as well as all the appendices to LotR, and finally I got to the point where not only could I read through the entire tome without having to look up a single word, I knew the map by heart, I knew the histories and legends, I could see the entire world and movements of troops even as i was trapped in Shelob's tunnel along side Frode and Sam — and i absolutely loved it! I'd even gotten used to the queer vernacular to the point that I didn't even notice anymore.

That was my seventh and, as it turned out, final read through. I don't know if I'll ever read it through again, but I think I will. Even if I don't it'll always have a special place in my heart, and will remain firmly placed among my top favourite books of all time. 

I still have that same old, beat up, ripped, taped and laminated paperback with dog-eared pages and scribbled notes that not only thought me to better master the English language, but also to appreciate how really awe-inspiring great writing can be — and inspired two decades worth of wonderful adventures in worlds both fantastic and realistic (and some even in galaxies far, far away!)

So, yeah. I love it!

Then again I come from a heavy Bible reading culture so maybe that got me ready.  The Silmarillion is another kettle of fish altogether.  The earliest parts are the hardest.  So many names!  It's rather like the Bible except it is more internally consistent. Don't expect a story line as such.

But I was quickly hooked and the pages flew by. Especially after the Tom Bombadil scenes, I really got into it and there was no going back. The grandiosity of the names, lineages, and armies was quite something, and Tolkien's ability to go from the minute to the grand is unparalleled.

Abject misery. 

I've never read LotR, but I loved reading The Hobbit, and had a varied, but mostly pleasant time, reading a variety of his other stories and tales. Silmarillion can go fuck rocks.

Like, the story of it is fantastic - it's that world's entire myth of creation, their bible if you will. The pacing, actual writing, organization, structure... absolutely abysmal. 

You have entire fucking \*pages\* of lineages, sometimes repeated shortly after, whereas some entire wars go by in a paragraph. Some really exciting plot points and events go by in a sentence, whereas several paragraphs are dedicated to fucking nothing... There is more nothing packed together than at times than I've ever remember reading in anything not named Moby Dick. It's not even a big book, but it feels fucking long.

YMMV, some people love it, but then again some people love the aforementioned Moby Dick, a book that, had I not known the author was literally paid by the word I'd have to assume was actually written by a complete sociopath who hates people.",ProxyDamage,2021-02-07T22:16:51Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,13

9bprt0_1,9bprt0,"I read the Hobbit first as a kid and then the LOTR. I don't love the trilogy any less then the Hobbit. But, when I read the Hobbit again years later, I loved it for the same reasons you do. It is simple and more action packed. 

&#x200B;

The problem with the Hobbit trilogy is it is based off a short book. When I read it was being made into a trilogy I knew it would never work. The LOTR was huge. And Peter Jackson had the Silmarillion and Lost Tales for further references on the world. As those who have read the books as well well know Jackson's movies are really only a snippet of everything in the books. As long as they are he cuts a lot out because it just doesn't all fit.

​

As a side note I love the pace of LOTR. I think it is more on par with reality. Although this is fantasy. Things don't necessarily happen to us all at once.  But in a movie you need action a lot faster. It is a different medium. ",kimchi01,2018-08-31T09:37:18Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1

I hope you try the LOTR again someday, but don’t be ashamed because as amazing as they are, they aren’t for everyone, and that’s ok!

9bprt0_3,9bprt0,"The Hobbit is the best way to ease into the Tolkien universe.  I'd highly recommend it as a first serious novel to give young children, and agree that The Lord of The Rings demands a major jump in attention span and reading comprehension.  

I tried reading Fellowship immediately after The Hobbit as a little kid and it was an agonizing slog - couldn't get a genuine read-through until several years later.  There's also a plot doldrum in the middle of The Two Towers that can be tedious at any age, so newcomers to LOTR should plan for that and not be deterred when they run into it.

Definitely read The Silmarillion at some point after the novels.  It's epic mythology that is most rewarding after you've already built up a personalized familiarity with Middle Earth.  Written pretty smoothly and easy to read, for the most part, but it resonates most deeply when you already feel connected to the material.  Otherwise it can seem a bit thin and random because it's so far removed from the time period and societies of the novels, occurring in the ancient history before them.

9bprt0_8,9bprt0,"Correct, LoTR was begun only after the publisher wanted another book after *The Hobbit* took off. Originally Tolkien tried to submit what he had done of *The Silmarillion*, but his publisher refused saying that people wanted more hobbits. Tolkien also suggested that LoTR and *The Silmarillion* be published together as one massive book titled something like, The Book of the Ring and the Jewels. His publisher (needless to say) refused. Also, LoTR was written as one work made up of six individual ""books"" that was broken into a trilogy to make it cheaper for his publisher -- sales were not expected to be high.

The Silmarillion was never actually completed during Tolkien's lifetime. His son, Christopher, compiled what he thought was the best version of the major stories together into what became The Silmarillion. Eventually his son decided to just publish his father's unfinished manuscripts, a process that is still ongoing though the Middle-Earth centric publications were primarily done with the Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-Earth.",kazingaAML,2018-08-31T19:35:38Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,8

There *is* plot, but it works on both a much larger and smaller scale. In the pages of the Silmarillion, you have the entire history of Middle Earth, told through much smaller stories. You don't have a central character, but instead focus on the various Valar, Maiar, and Elves that tell the story of Middle Earth. 

Is it dry? Yes. But it's worth it if you want to know answers to questions like:

- Who is Sauron? How did he gain his power? 
- What is a Balrog? Shelob?
- Who/what is Gandalf?
- Why are the Elves leaving Middle Earth for ""the West""?

I think The Hobbit will give you a good intro to his style. Plus it's a great book. Then read LotR. And if you find yourself wanting more I'd suggest moving next to The Silmarillion. Contains the history of Arda going back to the First Age. It reads like a mythological account you might read about any other creation myth here on Earth, so it's not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. If The Silmarillion is not to your taste skip ahead to The Children of Hurin. It's an expansion of a story in The Silmarillion, but more complete and presented as a stand alone story. Great read, I thought. If you do enjoy The Silmarillion, the next step is Unfinished Tales, and then ultimately, Chris Tolkien's 12 volume series The History of Middle-Earth, which is more of a literary and historical read of the making of the Tolkien Works.

Strictly speaking, if it's the whole Middle Earth mythology thing that you want to get into, and absorb all of the backstory (lets face it, ""The Hobbit"" is prelude, and LOTR is the main story) then you should go all the way to the foundation material, and read the Silmarillion. The danger of that is of course the intense boredom that the Silm causes in all but the most hardcore fans. Your mileage may vary.

I would also encourage you that a reread is highly rewarding for both.  I read Lord of the Rings seven times in junior high and high school, The Silmarillion twice, as well as Unfinished Tales and the other peripheral works.

I'll second the suggestion for The Silmarillion; it's a great way to understand the history of Middle Earth in a really cool way; you come to understand more about Galadriel, Elrond, and what it meant for the Elves to be returning to the West.

The Eye of the World also benefits on rereads; you can even go back now and identify >!at least three times that Rand channeled!< (spoiler just for EotW itself), as well as hints to events and people in our own modern world.

Here’s a sample of what you l’re in for if you decide to read it someday.

‘But of bliss and glad life there is little to be said, before it ends; as works fair and wonderful, while they still endure for eyes to see, are ever their own record, and only when they are in peril or broken for ever do they pass into song.’

‘Among the tales of sorrow and of ruin that came down to us from the darkness of those days there are yet some in which amid weeping there is joy and under the shadow of death light that endures. And of these histories most fair still in the ears of the Elves is the tale of Beren and Lúthien.’",Pipe-International,2020-11-03T05:15:29Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,3
2re3ig_1,2re3ig,"[The Tolkien Society] ( http://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/faq/#order) has a suggested reading order and I'm inclined to agree. If you've never read Tolkien, The Hobbit's a great place to start (one of my all time faves). That being said, The Lord of the Rings is significantly more dense, a more ""adult"" take on Tolkien's world if you will.  

Btw, I've heard for newcomers, in LotR, Tom Bombadill is ""the wall"". He's a character left out of the movies, that can be fairly taxing to new readers to get through his part, but if you can, you'll do fine with the rest. Not sure I agree with that theory, but it may hold true for you. 

After LotR, try The Silmarillion (Tolkien Society suggests Tom Bombadill's poems, give em a go if you're so inclined).

Hope this helps, and happy reading! I'm always jealous of people who get to read Tolkien for the first time.

One of the biggest problems I had when reading it initially was getting my bearings in the world before the Third Age: trying to picture what the world was like after the initial creation, the First Age, and the Second Age; because there are only one or two maps in The Silmarillion and they aren't that great. The Atlas of Middle-earth does a good job of showing you various instances of the world (because they literally change several times as gods and goddesses transform it), important battles, where kingdoms are located, etc.

It's politics are dreadful and while obviously when I was 14 I didn't think ""these politics are dreadful"" and dislike it for that reason I think the fact that its politics are dreadful was the underlying cause for my failing to fall in love with it.

That said, it's still a phenomenal achievement of a book, not least one of the best pieces of worldbuilding ever created. And I think a lot of peoples objections to it, including many of Moorcock's, are not so much about the book itself but about the rather staid and traditional direction the success of the book led much of mainstream fantasy for the next fifty years.

3fy482_2,3fy482,"First read the Appendices at the end of LotR. If you like them and want more stuff like that, go ahead and read The Silmarillion. It's a tough read the first time around, as it is written somewhat like a history book or an old mythology anthology, and there are endless barrages of strange names. But the stories in it are absolutely awe-inspiring.

If you're not too excited by the Appendices, you'll probably want to read The Children of Hurin before getting into The Silmarillion. Basically, it's one of the chapters in The Silmarillion fleshed out into  a novel. It's not as hard a read as The Silmarillion, since it follows a more familiar narrative structure and its language is not in as high a register. But there are still lots and lots of names, so don't be afraid to keep a running list of people and places so you don't get confused by them all; the main character alone, Turin, adopts something like five or six aliases over the course of the story.

After The Children of Hurin, the Silmarillion is the next easiest book. Pretty much everything else that Christopher Tolkien has published has been scholarly commentary on various drafts of these stories, dating back almost 100 years. They're incredible scholarship, and show Tolkien's creativity over time, but they're not meant to be read as novels. However, if you're interested in that sort of stuff, you'll want to check them out too.",rexbarbarorum,2015-08-06T03:39:29Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2
3fy482_3,3fy482,"I think *The Silmarillion* is the easiest introduction to the extended legendarium, as it's the most complete as a narrative. I've heard that *The Children of Húrin* is also a well-put-together narrative, but I've not yet read it. After that, *Unfinished Tales* addresses, as the name implies, the unfinished tales; in addition to the above quotes (part of a larger section discussing the Quest for Erebor), it elaborates on and gives alternate versions of many of the events in the First and Second Ages, and fills in some of the unseen events during the adventures of The Lord of the Rings.

Much of the rest of the writings are in the form of fragmented drafts, often incomplete, overlapping, and contradictory, and commentaries and notes on the work.

The register is comparable to an older translation of the Bible. It's not as archaic as the King James Version, but it's definitely not a modern style.

I understand people who say The Silmarillion is dry, but I vehemently disagree; the prose is a level of abstraction away from the novel, which is narrative in the immediate mode (i.e., places the reader in the context of the action), whereas The Silmarillion is in the mythic mode: the reader is remote from the action, as in a story told around a campfire, or a story told in poetry.

74xger_6,74xger,"Admittedly I've never read any Stephen King, so I can't really compare. But something to keep in mind when reading Tolkien is that most of his Middle-Earth work is meant to flesh out a world revolving around the languages he built, giving them context and history to explain how they had evolved into what they were. He had also stated he wanted to create a ""British mythology"" similar in scale to Greek or Norse mythology with established deities and heroes and legends. He was not necessarily trying to make the most rich narrative, and his works are often described as wordy and meandering as a result.

That said, he does what he set out to do *very* well. It is a rich world with diverse and fleshed out cultures and a solid creation story and a history that makes sense. It inspired basically all of modern high fantasy with its thoroughness and poetic prose. And to say he has no characterization isn't fair since I think the books do a better job than the Peter Jackson films in some regards.

So in a word, my recommendation is start with the Hobbit as it was originally written as a kids book and was only later included into the same universe as lotr so the prose is less intense. From there go to the Lord of the Rings. Depending on how you take the indexes at the end of the last book and the songs scattered throughout tell you of the Silmarillion will be right for you, but the Silmarillion is by no means necessary to enjoy the easier works in the same universe!

If I'm reading the ""complete"" versions of Beren and Tuor, I'm more likely to reread Book of Lost Tales 1 and 2, as the style is too jarringly different, and the worldbuilding still too different (the number of Balrogs, for one, and Tevildo, of course :) ).

In high school, I spent months typing up the Unfinished Tales and Lost Tales versions, then trying to stylistically harmonize them - getting rid of the present tense, changing the numbers of Balrogs, even altering ""Rog"" to ""Arauca"" to sound more elvish (oh, yeah, and changing all forms of ""eflin"" to ""elven"" :) ). I kinda wish CT had chosen to do that with this text, but it wouldn't really have been fair to the original texts.

I'm forever shattered that Tolkien never finished the final version of Tuor, or of Hurin, or of Earendil. It feels like the story is lost in the mists of times. :(",ibmiller,2018-12-03T17:27:07Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,5

I think a casual fan could digest Children of Hurin no problem, as a complete story. But the Beren/Gondolin books would be a struggle to get through as it's mostly commentary/different versions.

477euc_1,477euc,"As far as any single book goes... 

The Lord of the Rings is probably the greatest single work of prose written (known to modern times).

So many of the ""plot holes"" are not at all, but the nuance is tough for many readers (after all Tolkien himself held quite the distain for readers wanting simple books.)

If you decide when you are done you want to read more of the Legendarium, I would highly recommend starting with The Children of Hurin as has been mentioned. It is an amazing short tale.

The Silmarillion is my personal favorite book of all time. It is so insanely dense, interwoven, robust. Sure there are lots of names, but it is a longitudinal book covering EONS of civilizations (consider then how few supremely important players there have been).

Plus the first part of the overall Silmarillion tale (Ainulindale), is beyond amazing... I don't have better ways to describe it so I will copy some stuff from other reviewers at the time of it's release...


Although commentary about The Silmarillion has primarily focused on the work as a whole, the reaction to ""Ainulindalë"" has been generally positive. British writer Joseph Pearce called it ""the most important part of The Silmarillion"" and said, ""The myth of creation is perhaps the most significant and most beautiful of Tolkien's works."" Brian Rosebury considered ""Ainulindalë"" a success, with ""appropriately 'scriptural'"" prose. Several Jesuits have praised the story; James V. Schall said, ""I have never read anything as beautiful as the first page of The Silmarillion"" and Robert Murray said, ""In all literature, from the formation of the sacred books of humanity, it is very difficult to find a comparable mythological story of creation by its beauty and imaginative power.""",amschroeder5,2016-02-24T10:45:45Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1

>**Review:**  This is epic fantasy in its purest form; it is myth and legend, at  times obtuse, but absolutely riveting. Tolkien's world is fully  immersive. Had the physical book to follow the story, the audiobook for  pronunciation, and laptop for family trees. Absolutely worth it - even  as a casual LoTR fan.

&#x200B;

Aaaaaand I'm immediately suspicious of this list. 

&#x200B;

The Silmarillion has a lot of positive and negatives, but ""absolutely worth a ready, even as a CASUAL fan"" is as close to demonstrably wrong as an opinion can be. 

The world building is fantastic. It's Tolkien, and if there was one thing Tolkien was fantastic at doing was building worlds and stories. If that's your priority above everything else, then sure, Silmarillion is absolutely worth it... 

...However...

The plot is... all over. Because it's not really one plot, but the overall story of the world. It's the bible of that universe, and thus contains a variety of often loosely connected events that shape the story of the whole world across time. There are direct sequels, side notes, things only marginally connected to the already thin connective tissue of the ""central plot"" as it were... If what you want in this area is to learn more about middle earth in general, great, this book is for you. If what you want is an actual story with something resembling a beginning, middle and end... Yeah. This will likely leave you unsatisfied. 

Lastly we have the writing which... Can generously be described as ""outdated"". If you read something like The Hobbit and thought ""well, this is a bit on a slow and descriptive side, but that's ok. It's tolerably slow and sets the mood!"" well... Fuck that. He dials that up to 11. ""Protracted"" is a good word for the way things are presented. Drawling. Drawn out. I doubt there are a great many number of people out there to whom ""Let's read a fucking ENTIRE PAGE of fucking Geneology... And then 2 paragraphs later LET'S DO IT AGAIN SO WE DON'T FORGET"" sounds like the idea of enticing writing. Fucking DUNE seems like an action romp in comparison... It's not even consistently slow either. He'll fucking spend pages covered with 80% ""son/daughter of"" but then flash by major events and wars in like, 2 paragraphs. The pacing is a fucking mess, like the book was unfinished or in early draft phase... Because it was. Tolkien died before he finished revising and editing the thing, and honestly it shows, especially in the later parts. 

Let's put it this way, out of everyone I've ever talked with, the opinions range from ""it's good... but...."" to ""fuck that book..."".

So whether or not it's worth a read really comes down to how much of a world building nerd and/or LotR fan you really are. If you REALLY want all of the lore possible, want to explore EA more, or if the idea of reading a bible, shitty writing of the actual bible and all, of Tolkien's universe sounds interesting... Go ahead. Can't promise you'll like it, but you'll most likely think it was worth it. If you're a more casual LotR fan or want some enticing or exciting reading, then stay the fuck away from this book. This might legit put you off reading for a while.",ProxyDamage,2020-08-19T20:21:51Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2

Correct. That is because the chapters and verses are later additions made by different groups to try and make what is otherwise giant walls of texts digestible, readable, and understandable. As a result, the chapterization and versification varies between different groups.

Religious texts aren't novels and expecting them to function like one is bizarre. Your complaints are good examples of why comparing *The Silmarillion* to the Old Testament is nonsensical though.",pierzstyx,2022-09-14T15:22:09Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,19

750i5b_2,750i5b,"The LotR trilogy is easily my favorite series of all time, rivaled only by Harry Potter for me. I've made a point to reread at least the main trilogy every year since my sophomore year of high school, about 6 years ago. 


What I love so much about Tolkien's universe, is the attention to detail that he put into his work. I mean, the man actually created his own language, several in fact! The way he describes Hobbits and Hobbit culture at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring rarely comes into much importance later on in the saga, but it paints such a vivid picture of what life is like for the Hobbits that I can easily visualize it in my head. Tolkien had the family tree of every main character drawn out to, at least, a few generations. A lot of characters and names we'll never read or see mention of in the books, but just the fact that they exist adds so much to the world building.


Now I consider myself to be a diehard Tolkien fan, so I feel compelled to recommend you the other novels in that universe:


I'd start with the Appendices actually, at the end of Return of the King. This gives more of the lore that takes place after the trilogy, along with things like pronouciations and family trees. It is absolutely essential to read this along with the LotR trilogy, in my opinion.


The only other book that is a must read for me is the Silmarillion, Tolkien's bible. Though it reads like the actual Bible at times, it is a ""brief"" overview of everything that happens in the LotR world; from creation to the end of the Third age, and even hints at events beyond then. I find myself skipping certain chapters here and there, so don't feel bad if you find it to be a difficult read.


The Letters of JRR Tolkien are a nice read, and indeed a glimpse, into the mind of the author. Not an essential read, but it does add more lore and provides corrections or explanations on things that were not adequately done so in the books.


The Children of Húrin is a much smaller story in both length and scale compared to the LotR books, but it is measurably darker and much more sinister. I have only read it two times, as it is a bit of a downer for my tastes, but I would recommend it nonetheless.


There are other books that I am forgetting to mention, it's early I haven't had my coffee yet, but if you really want to learn more about this wonderful universe, there are endless resources online that will explain everything to you. r/lotr would be a fantastic place to start.

750i5b_37,750i5b,"A number of the questions you pose are answered in the Appendices, usually at the end of the third volume, although it's possible that they don't get into translated editions (I've even seen a one-volume edition in English that left them off). Tolkien gives the history of the Third Age in an outline form there, along with summaries of the history of Gondor, Arnor (the lost north kingdom that your questions about the Witch-King are partly about), and Rohan. 

That said, you may still find your questions not as fully answered there as you want: welcome to the joys and frustrations of reading Tolkien closely. Keep in mind this is partly by design: 1) Tolkien needed to keep his narrative flowing, which is why he put a lot of the backstory in the Appendices, rather than interrupt the flow of the main narrative. But even there, he doesn't have enough space to fill in all the details. This is partly because: 2) It would have taken him forever to write all the details; he was a fussy writer who niggled with details for ages. That's partly why it took him a long time to write the books, and he's gotten more published since he died than he ever did while alive, because Christopher Tolkien can finish his projects and meet deadlines. 3) In part, Tolkien keeps the details unfinished and unwritten deliberately, as a way of suggesting the depth of his world. Readers get glimpses of a deeper past, a layered sense of history, even though the characters themselves don't know all the history there--just as most of us don't know the full history of our own world, even when we see evidence of the past. He wanted to create a layered sense of history to make the reality of the story's present more believable. This leads to 4) Tolkien's literary models of great epics often had significant gaps which let other writers and artists fill in. He says as much in his letter to Milton Waldman (you can find it online). He is really talking about The Silmarillion in this passage, but it applies in some ways to his narrative techniques in *LotR* as well: ""I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and sketched. The cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama. Absurd."" Despite his self-deprecation at the end, he really did this. Of course his style in doing so may not be at all to your taste: that's fine. But this may help you understand why the text is the way it is; whether you enjoy it or not is another matter and entirely up to you.

(I'd love to read Tolkien's story on the arrival of Eorl to help Gondor, for instance, but have to be content with the outlined version in the Appendices.)

So the Appendices whet my appetite for more of Tolkien's work that he didn't write, but more importantly, by providing so much backstory in summary form they put everything together in a way I hadn't understood while reading the novel. Then when I reread the novel, I understood nuances I hadn't noticed when first reading it. But it took me several times through the novel before I even thought about reading the Appendices--and then I realized what I'd been missing.

750i5b_44,750i5b,"I personally really like the theory that Bombadil is a physical manifestation of the music that the Ainur sang during their creation of the world. 

For some background, the beginning of the Silmarillion explains how the universe was created. The one capital-g God, Eru Iluvatar, created the Ainur, lowercase-g gods, and conducted them in the Ainulindale, the Great Song. This Song led to the creation of the physical world. 

Everything was going swell in the Song until Melkor, the mightiest of the Ainur and the Valar that Sauron served, added discordance to the music and created evil and darkness. 

It could be that Bombadil is a being that is the physical representation of the Song before it was corrupted by Melkor. This would explain why the Ring, created by Melkor's servant, has no effect on him and why he is so nonchalant about it. Furthermore, there's the fact that Bombadil concerns himself solely with the natural world, that which was created at the beginning of time. Finally, Bombadil uses the power of song to control the physical world. ",pokemonandpolitics,2017-10-08T21:19:42Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,44
750i5b_45,750i5b,"Thanks. I'm glad if it helped. I don't think there's a lot to say about what Tom is capable of besides what Tolkien shows us in the two chapters Tom appears and what Gandalf says in the Council of Elrond (which isn't much). His origins are equally murky, and Tolkien didn't seem interested in pinning them down. So anything I say/think is speculative, rather than interpretive. (The earlier explanation is interpretive: arguing what specific textual elements mean, whereas speculative means that the textual elements just don't exist and I'm having to guess based on general comments Tolkien makes elsewhere. Do be aware that what I was saying is my interpretation; others may argue differently.) 

I speculate that within Tolkien's cosmology, as set out in *The Silmarillion*, Tom Bombadil is probably a Maia, like Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast, and the balrogs. He came into the world with the Valar and other Maiar when Iluvatar offered them the chance to make the song of creation real, but for reasons unspecified didn't stick with them. By his own account to the hobbits, he has been in Middle-earth before the rivers and trees, before ""the first raindrop and the first acorn"": that sounds to me like before Yavanna created the plants in *The Silmarillion*. He has seen everything since: in fact, I think the tale he tells the hobbits, taking them through history back and back to the very beginning, when he falls asleep, mirrors his own personal history. He ""nods"" as if falling asleep because he gets to the point before his own awake and aware existence. The one contradictory element for all this is that he tells them he was there ""before the Dark Lord came from outside""; however, Melkor/Morgoth entered Arda with the other Valar, so it's unclear how Tom Bombadil could have come in before him. 

I doubt Tolkien wanted to pin it down so exactly anyway: as a Catholic, he was fine with a sense of mystery cloaking some things.",Midwestern_Childhood,2017-10-08T19:25:18Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,45

skrsem_2,skrsem,"Luthien is the daughter of Thingol, an Elf lord, and Melian, one of the Ainur.  (The Ainur were angelic beings essentially, spirits made by the Creator before the making of the World but who were allowed to enter into it and care for it.  Sauron was a corrupted Ainur of the same type as Melian.)  I believe Luthien is the only stated instance of progeny between a divine being and a 'lesser' being.  Beren was fully Man.  Beren and Luthein are the grandparents of Elwing, an Elf maid.

There was another pairing of Man and Elf in Tuor and Idril.  Their story can be found in the Silmarillion, and they came shortly after Beren and Luthien.  Tuor and Idril are the parents of Earendil the Mariner.  Earendil married Elwing and given certain circumstances and as both were of Elven and Human descent they were able to choose whether to be considered Elf and immoral or Man and mortal.  Both chose to be considered as Elves.  Their descendents were given the same choice. 

Elrond is the son of Earendil and Elwing, and he chose to be considered an Elf.  His daughter is Arwen.  As such, Arwen is the great-great -granddaughter of Beren and Luthien.  (She is also the granddaughter of Galadriel through her mother.)

Elros is Elrond's brother and also the son of Earendil and Elwing.  He chose to be considered Man and thus his children were too, but he was made the first king of Numenor and given a much longer lifespan.  Aragorn is a descendent of Elros, albeit by many generations.

What we find in Arwen (and her siblings) is one who has ancestry including all three of the (good) houses of men, but also through Galadriel all three houses of the Eldar.  And through Melian also ancestry involving a spark of divinity.",OGREtheTroll,2022-02-05T02:44:50Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2

I dare say his world-building has been hardly surpassed even today, if at all. His occupation as a full time academic surely helped him a lot in developing the level of detail and thoroughness that you are just starting to see.

There was a large body of work that underwent numerous revisions and was much more disjointed. The Silmarillion is the result of Christopher Tolkien editing the material into a single cohesive story. The Lost Tales, for instance, could much more easily be described as a simple collection of stories, and they didn't have as many intersections. The Silmarils appear in old version of the stories but weren't yet the driving force they would be later.

I can't see describing it as a summary, though. The stories are fully fleshed out. The only thing published in the Silmarillion that reads like an outline is the 3rd age stuff.",midwayfair,2015-07-01T18:01:19Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,26

Tolkein worked on the material in the Silmarillion longer than all his other works put together. Many pieces were SHORTENED later compared with earlier drafts. Many pieces were rewritten at similar lengths several times. There is no evidence that he intended to expand it much beyond the scope and length of Christopher Tolkien's edit.

That's one question that's more or less answered in *The Silmarillion*.

The short answer is it's Valinor, where the Valar and Maiar (something of a cross between Greek gods and Christian angels) live.  It also contains the Halls of Mandos, which is where souls spend their days between death and reaching their ultimate afterlife (reincarnation for Elves, ??? for humans).

It wasn't originally its own world, but an island to the west of Middle Earth. That changed when some idiots (having been provoked by Sauron) tried to invade it. It still isn't wholly separate from Middle Earth (there is still a path that can be sailed under the right circumstances), but for most intents and purposes, it's its own separate world.",Nimelennar,2022-08-15T18:29:33Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2

Tolkien preferred that some things remain mysterious and unexplained. He's made a point to shoot down theories about Tom Bombadil.

Although, some of those theories are:

Tom is one of the Maiar,
Tom is the personification of the world.
Tom is the in universe version of Tolkein.

As for the Ent Wives, same deal. But those theories are:

The Ent Wives were the caretakers of smaller plants and flowers. So they may have gone to the Shire, or, more likely,

They moved to what used to be meadows around Mordor, and died out during the second age war.

Sauron still technically exists, but is too weak to take a physical form, or to influence the world in any way.

But you can come up with your own conclusions. Tolkien seems to prefer it this way.

And here's what he has to say about the Entwives: 

>*I think that in fact the Entwives had disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in
the War of the Last Alliance (Second Age 3429-3441) when Sauron pursued a scorched earth policy
and burned their land against the advance of the Allies down the Anduin (vol. II p. 79 refers to it
).
They survived only in the 'agriculture' transmitted to Men (and Hobbits). Some, of course, may
have fled east, or even have become enslaved: tyrants even in such tales must have an economic
and agricultural background to their soldiers and metal-workers. If any survived so, they would
indeed be far estranged from the Ents, and any rapprochement would be difficult – unless
experience of industrialized and militarized agriculture had made them a little more anarchic. I hope
so. I don't know.*

**-Letter 144**

>*As for the Entwives: I do not know. I have written nothing beyond the first few years of the
Fourth Age. (Except the beginning of a tale supposed to refer to the end of the reign of Eldaron
about 100 years after the death of Aragorn. Then I of course discovered that the King's Peace would
contain no tales worth recounting; and his wars would have little interest after the overthrow of
Sauron; but that almost certainly a restlessness would appear about then, owing to the (it seems)
inevitable boredom of Men with the good: there would be secret societies practising dark cults, and
'orc-cults' among adolescents.) But I think in Vol. II pp. 80-811
 it is plain that there would be for
Ents no re-union in 'history' — but Ents and their wives being rational creatures would find some
'earthly paradise' until the end of this world: beyond which the wisdom neither of Elves nor Ents
could see. Though maybe they shared the hope of Aragorn that they were 'not bound for ever to the
circles of the world and beyond them is more than memory.*

**-Letter 338**

> And what happened of Sauron?

""Death"" in Tolkien's world (which has immortal, indestructible souls), describes the separation of the spirit from its physical body. In that sense, Sauron was killed upon the destruction of the Ring, and his body destroyed. As for what happened to his spirit, Tolkien tells us it would have persisted, but in a form too weak and impotent to ever trouble the world again. Sauron had, in effect, fallen too low for his spirit to ever recover.

>*The Elves certainly held and taught that fëar or ""spirits"" may grow of their own life (independently of the body), even as they may be hurt and healed, be diminished and renewed.^11 The dark spirit of Melkor's ""remainder"" might be expected, therefore, eventually and after long ages to increase again, even (as some held) to draw back into itself some its formerly dissipated power. It would do this (even if Sauron could not) because of its relative greatness. It did not repent, or turn finally away from its obsession, but retained still relics of wisdom, so that it could still seek its object indirectly, and not merely blindly. It would rest, seek to heal itself, distract itself by other thoughts and desires and devices - but all simply to recover enough strength to return to the attack on the Valar, and to its old obsession. As it grew again it would become, as it were, a dark shadow, brooding on the confines of Arda, and yearning towards it.*

And the attached note #11

>>*11 - If they do not sink below a certain level. Since no fëa can be annihilated, reduced to zero or not-existing, it is no[t] clear what is meant. Thus Sauron was* ***said*** *to have fallen below the point of ever recovering, though he had previously recovered. What is probably meant is that a 'wicked' spirit becomes fixed in a certain desire or ambition, and if it cannot repent then this desire becomes virtually its whole being. But the desire may be wholly beyond the weakness it has fallen to, and it will then be unable to withdraw its attention from the unobtainable desire, even to attend to itself. It will then remain for ever in impotent desire or memory of desire.*

Grew up in a shitty small town in the South, always wanted to see the world, and fantasy, especially Tolkien, was a form of escape for me. Made me want to go have some adventures in the mountains of my own, I figure, so I did just that. 

I never did read the Silmarillion though in that time, and now that I've been around a bit and ""seen the world"" or at least some of it, I picked it up a couple months ago. After reading some mythology here and there (Greek, Norse, etc), I love exploring how mythologies develop and shape the human experience. The Silmarillion is probably the closest thing I've ever seen to a ""fictional mythology,"" and reads almost like one of the old myths. Through that I think Tolkien's work, especially the Silmarillion, is in a lot of ways a commentary and exploration, almost an experiment in getting into how myths arise, how they shape our current world, etc. Even in the Silmarillion, this fantastical world is slowly but surely fading away into something else, and becoming less ""Mythic"" a time goes on. 

Personally I also really enjoyed the explorations of the Elves' immortality, and how their perspective on death and life differs drastically to that of men, which as someone in my late 20's starting to think about how short life is, I found pretty interesting to read.

4um8ok_1,4um8ok,"I'm not sure what you mean when you ask if if the Silmarillion's writing is similar to Tolkien... It was written by Tolkien, so of course.

I've always found it best to break Tolkien's writing into 3 categories based on the complexity of the prose, or based on what ""grade"" reading level a person should be at to get the most enjoyment from the work. The Hobbit could be read and enjoyed pretty easily by a relatively smart 10 year old. I'd say Fellowship, Two Towers and Return of the King are written more at a high school reading level (15-18 years old). the Silmarillion is by far the most complex and difficult of his works, but in my opinion it's his best. College reading level for sure. 

Now, you definitely do not need to have read the LoTR trilogy to enjoy the Silmarillion, but it helps. I would describe the Silmarillion as the ""Bible"" of middle earth. It's structured similarly, essentially a series of loosely connected mythological vignette folk tales describing the creation of middle earth and the wars and alliances of the gods of Middle Earth.

The language that the elves speak, that the dwarves speak, that the orcs speak--Tolkien really sat down and made these working languages.

uq2d5v_2,uq2d5v,"*The Lord of the Rings* starts out with very much the same tone as *The Hobbit*. It darkens as it goes along, until by the end of *The Return of the King* it's very different, much more like *The Silmarillion*. There is much less description of characters and places, and the language is almost biblical. Just my 0.02.",FTLast,2022-05-15T13:00:31Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2
uq2d5v_3,uq2d5v,"This might be a controversial take, but I recommend reading at least the Silmarillion before The Lord of the Rings. Just don’t expect either to be like The Hobbit, or each other.",Pipe-International,2022-05-16T08:33:46Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,3
uq2d5v_4,uq2d5v,"The Silmarillion is one I’ve heard been talked about as the perfect prequel, instead of Hobbit. It doesn’t make sense to me like that, but maybe it’ll work like as anthologies of different parts of Middle Earth’s past. Thanks!",__Ouchie__,2022-05-15T12:32:02Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,4
uq2d5v_5,uq2d5v,"The Silmarillion is a prequel in the sense that the history of Egypt can be seen as a prequel to the history of London. It's a much different book from The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, it reads a lot like the Bible, huge expanses of time are covered in a couple of pages and it its more s series of stores rather than one long narrative with relatable characters. It can be a challange. At the end of Return of the King there's an Apendex that give a condensed version of The Silmarillion. I would read that and then decide based on that whether to move on to The Silmarillion or not. One story in the book, The Children of Huron was given its own separate novel which expands greatly on the story. I prefer it to the version in The Silmarillion so maybe consider reading that instead of thr chapter ""Of Turan Turambar"". I wouldn't get ahead yourself though. A lot of people love The Hobbit but struggle with Lord ofnthe Rings so it's probably best to see how you respond to it first before tackling the more challenging books.",VincentVegaFFF,2022-05-15T14:19:26Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,5

Forgiving the atrocious spelling of those names for a second. There are actually three books replacing three chapters of that part of the Silmarillion. *Beren and Lúthien*, *The Children of Húrin* and *The Fall of Gondolin* all replace their respective stories in Quenta Silmarillion (""Of Beren and Lúthien"", ""Of Túrin Turambar"", and ""Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin""). Christopher took the time for each of those to construct a coherent narrative for those books, rather than just try to throw together the pieces of unfinished text that contradicted each other and later finished works which defines Silmarillion.",crazyike,2022-05-15T18:23:46Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,6
x63hi3_1,x63hi3,You definitely need to check out the Silmarillion. Children of Hurin is just an expansion of a story first published in The Silmarillion and expanded upon in Unfinished Tales and a little from the History of Middle-earth series too.,KokiriEmerald,2022-09-05T04:28:39Z,1,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,1
x63hi3_2,x63hi3,Thanks for the rec! How easy is it to read? The Hobbit is one of my favorite books ever but I found The Silmarillion too difficult to finish. Which one would you say this is closer to?,spitfyre,2022-09-05T04:39:31Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,2
x63hi3_3,x63hi3,Christopher Tolkien had a lot of help putting together the Silmarillion from Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay an excellent writer of fiction in his own right. Check out The Fionavar Tapestry.,2fat2live,2022-09-05T18:33:19Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,3
x63hi3_4,x63hi3,"If are enjoying this book, you may also enjoy The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson. It's a semi-forgotten gem, published in the same year as Fellowship of the Ring (so before Children of Hurin, or the Silmarillion were published), and has many common elements with Children of Hurin, and Tolkien in general, while also being its own thing.",RevolutionaryCommand,2022-09-05T21:41:00Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Silmarillion,4
