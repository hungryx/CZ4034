yanjbw_1,yanjbw,"John Flanagan gets spooky in the latest adventure in the New York Times bestselling Ranger's Apprentice The Royal Ranger series!

Will and Maddie are sent to the neighbouring kingdom of Celtica to investigate reports of terrifying direwolves, an ancient species thought to be extinct. What they discover is even more of a threat - a sorceress who has brought direwolves and Wargals under her control and is building an army of creatures both living and supernatural. Arazan must be stopped before she becomes too powerful - but first Will and Maddie need to find her.

ijeq2r_1,ijeq2r,"I think one reason is the rangers apprentice books have always been largely character driven. The plot and setting are ok but the main reason people read are because the characters are so well written and likable. However, in the royal ranger this changes. Our characters take a backseat to new ones that we don’t know. I don’t think this is inherently a bad thing, I mean brotherband did very well and that was about new characters. I think it’s because when royal ranger first came out it wasn’t it’s own series, it was book 12 in rangers apprentice. So readers go in expecting to see the characters we know and love just to find out they are now background characters. If you read them now and go into it knowing it’s a sequel series I think they will be fine, but going in with the expectation of your old favorites going on another adventure will make the book disappointing, regardless of how good it might be.",Ravenofthenorth,2020-08-30T15:52:33Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1

It’s really not that bad at all. Give it a shot. It doesn’t undo anything, if anything it adds even more depth to the characters we’ve come to love. While the new ranger’s apprentice Maddie is the main character, the o.g. characters (Will, Halt, Horace, Gilan, Cassandra) still have very prominent roles.

For in which other you should read them, my advise is  


Main Series -> Early Years -> Brotherband -> The Royal Ranger  


For the Early Years and Brotherband it doesn't really matter which you should read first, but it's better to read The Royal Ranger *after* Brotherband",JasonVarhof,2022-05-07T14:39:26Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1

I have some obscenely bad news for you.

For some unknown and insane reason, nothing Flanagan has published since 2017 has been published in the UK. You can buy them on amazon, but they're American imprints and American spelling, etc.

Flanagan rejigged The Royal Ranger to a new series instead of book 12, and it already has two books (aside from TRR) published. edit: i see that your version of TRR is labeled as book 1, so I'm confused now, but there are still two more books.

I've contacted Penguin Random House in the UK, the US, and Australia, and I've contacted Flanagan himself, and none of them have an answer for me. As far as Flanagan is concerned, it's not a decision he's actively made, and the publishers are just being really cagey about it.

According to the Aussies, it's *not* because of brexit, but I have my doubts about that.

Kalkara. It leaves the reader to believe at the beginning that this ""universe"" has fantastical creatures that where going to play a larger role or just exist. The fact that Morgarath essentially held power over these creatures through mental strength leads to the impression of possibility of sorcerers or magic  in general but No. It set a tone for the story In a world that lead the reader to think one thing and then after morgarath you never see or hear of any other fantastical creatures until The Brotherband series when they get blown off course into the never ending sea and Thorn is telling them stories of a kraken and a whale breaches the surface near The ship and they freak out because they never seen one before.

afgxm2_1,afgxm2,"I agree that killing her off was stupid. I would have had no problem with it if he did it the right way. However, he just killed her out of nowhere. I mean if you are going to kill a character and deliver a more emotional punch. At least, build up the character and the scenes with that character before killing her/him off.

In the Royal Ranger series, he didn't even do a good job showing the effects her death had on Will. Aside for the fact, that he was just angry and nothing else.  Him having an apprentice was IMO for John to kill off Alyss without expanding the impact her death had on Will.

That being said, if Ranger Apprentice does have a Movie/tv series then they must eventually kill her off ,or else it won't be the same.

uq3q2l_1,uq3q2l,"Firstly, yes. Chronologically, book 7 is set before book 5 (Flanagan wrote it to give that time more content). 

As to a reading order: Ranger's Apprentice (RA) 1-4, 7, 5-6, 8-11, Early Years, Brotherband, Royal Ranger. (I'd say early years before just because it ties in with the main series), and Royal Ranger will make more sense if you've read Brotherband. 

Also, note that book 1 of the Early Years is book 12 of the main series in an earlier version, so older copies of the Royal Ranger book 1 are Ranger's Apprentice book 12.",William_147015,2022-05-15T23:45:12Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1
uq3q2l_2,uq3q2l,And if you want to read the brotherhood series I would highly recommend to read them before the royal ranger books.,werkelijkheden,2022-05-15T11:21:57Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,2
gr980k_1,gr980k,As a person who likes the royal ranger and doesn’t cast it aside because Alyss died in the first one I can relate,theflame_thrower,2020-05-27T04:46:34Z,3,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1
gr980k_2,gr980k,"I like the royal ranger and when it picked it up I was thinking someone was bound to die due to the skip, with the lives they all live",TheGaySpade,2020-05-27T06:05:57Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,2
gh6woc_1,gh6woc,"At one point in The Royal Ranger series I think they briefly mention the Caldera but not necessarily Return of the Temujai. I think it's safe to say you don't necessarily need knowledge from Return of the Temujai to complete The Royal Ranger though. I read all The Royal Ranger books and am just starting on Brotherband now, and while some things are mentioned from the Brotherband you can definitely still enjoy The Royal Ranger without having read Brotherband first.",YearOneTeach,2020-06-06T00:15:01Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1
gh6woc_2,gh6woc,"You’re not wrong, but I was listening to the royal ranger series the other day and there is actually something Hal says that helps with the overall timeline. He tells Cassandra that the temujai are snooping around the border and they want more archers. After that he says something about capturing the leader and them being shut up for a while.",youngmartialartist,2020-05-11T14:48:09Z,2,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,2
h0uim5_1,h0uim5,"Tbh, I kind of just created an alternate reality to maintain my sanity, where Alyss never dies and Maddy isn’t a spoiled brat, so she never becomes a ranger. I still read the Royal Ranger books, but it’s... way worse than the original RA series, that’s for sure. 

Love RA, love Brotherband, despise Royal Ranger",Beowulf-the-Mighty,2020-06-11T21:22:54Z,0,COMMENT,Fantasy,The Royal Ranger,1
