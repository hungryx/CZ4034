1adgp9x_2,1adgp9x,Agreed - The Housemaid is stupid.,amosc33,2024-01-29T12:12:58Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,2
1adgp9x_3,1adgp9x,I don’t think the book The Housemaid is related to the movie you’re talking about.,llama_raptor89,2024-01-29T00:08:45Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,3
1941i1d_1,1941i1d,"The Housemaid is her best book imo. I devoured it in one sitting unintentionally because it was so twisty - not the best book I’ve read like you said, but pretty freaking good. Unfortunately the few other books from her I’ve read are pretty horrible lol, but The Housemaid is for sure a great quick read.",,2024-01-11T14:18:50Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,1
1941i1d_2,1941i1d,"It's not a bad book but it's a bit cringe, not the bad kind tho, totally agree with the captivating part I finished the book extremely fast, and although her writing and storytelling aren't the best the Housemaid is still a very fun book to read.

About the second book, The Housemaid's Secret this is just my opinion but I feel like it's not as great as the first one, the ending's extremely cringe but the twist is kinda cool and surprising.",aboring_person,2024-01-11T16:27:16Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,2
1941i1d_3,1941i1d,I would have liked it better if I hadn't read The Last Mrs Parrish a few years ago. The Housemaid is way too similar.,purplesalvias,2024-01-11T20:42:11Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,3
1941i1d_4,1941i1d,"This has been my experience too! The first book of hers I read was The Housemaid. Not the best book ever but it was very twisty and kept me engaged. I read it pretty fast, and I’m usually a slow reader. 

So of course I started grabbing other books of hers, but none of them have been nearly as good. I think I’ve tried 4 others, right now I’m maybe 30% through One by One…feels predictable, not sure if I’ll finish it.",Hi_Hello_HeyThere,2024-01-11T17:58:42Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,4
1941i1d_5,1941i1d,"I just finished the housemaid and went online to see if anyone else made this comparison. This book did not impress me and I knew ""the twist"" because it's literally a ripoff of the last Mrs Parrish. Idk how it has the popularity it does.",jalspose,2024-03-07T02:09:19Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,5
1941i1d_6,1941i1d,"Wait! Is there a third book coming? Btw, it's so cool that you and your wife share a love for books and that you have someone to discuss book topics with. I can't wait to read The Housemaid's Secret myself.",Scary_Oil5414,2024-01-11T22:13:01Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,6
1941i1d_7,1941i1d,"In June!  It's called The Housemaid is Watching.

I'd suggest not looking it up til you're done with Housemaid's Secret.  The synopsis for part 3 has spoilers from part 2.",snickersmademefat,2024-01-11T22:17:48Z,0,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,7
19dfloo_1,19dfloo,"Ohh!! I love The Housemaid. For the longest time, Gone Girl was my favorite thriller. The second book as just as enjoyable. I can’t wait for the third book! 


As for Iron Flame, it fell a little flat? It was way too long. Violet and Xaden kept arguing about the same thing over and over again.",lvnala,2024-01-23T05:07:02Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,1
19dfloo_2,19dfloo,"Gone girl! I’ve heard about it. Is it as good as the housemaid though? 

Is it worth the read then for iron flame?",TackleStrange246,2024-01-23T05:50:38Z,3,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,2
v22xnv_1,v22xnv,Oh my gosh!! I gotta say I’m a little star struck. I’ve never been into domestic thrillers but The Housemaid single-handedly triggered my recent obsession with them! I love your prose style and the story itself was wonderful. You’re very talented and I’m thrilled you’ve seen this ❤️,peachcrusader,2022-09-14T20:45:20Z,1,COMMENT,Horror,The Housemaid,1
