12lyat4,A Confederacy of Dunces,"This book!  
Even though I don't know how people in New Orleans speak or how the people are, the descriptions, the vernacular captured brings out a fascinating and hysterical set of characters. Toole's descriptions are vivid and hilarious. Fatty's physical and ideological descriptions are repugnant and funny.  A lot of 'ewwwww hahahaha' moments.

gjkfv5,A Confederacy of Dunces,"Ignatius Reilly is the most unlikable protagonist I've ever seen in literature. His bizarre misadventures, where he sweeps everyone he meets into a storm of legal trouble, headache-inducing rants, and hygiene problems, are enthralling. I could barley put the book down.

The story is a great example of how to write a disgusting protagonist. I think it works because of how much effort is put on the larger world. Virtually every character in the story is an awful person, with the most relatable characters being people who have been dumped on by society. Even then, the prime focus of the story is blasting every aspect of the human race. It's scathing, it's crude (in the most articulate way possible), and it has a strange heart to it.

For most of the story, I felt almost bad for enjoying it. It had that ""dirty"" quality because it delves headlong into the gutter, but writes with a style that made me actively need to think in order to get down to that level. Then, suddenly, the story hit me with a heart. For a brief moment, even, I saw Ignatius as a human being. A disgusting, miserable excuse for a human being, but a human being nonetheless.

The line ""You learned everything except how to be a human being"" will stick with me for a long time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gjkfv5/a_confederacy_of_dunces/,2020-05-14T11:20:00Z,358,1546,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
sfio54,A Confederacy of Dunces is seriously one of the funniest books I've ever read,"Hey y'all,

So I was recommend this book a while back considering I'm a fan of comedy and wanted to work on my humor writing (may or may not be related to me wanting to start stand-up, still gotta get over my stage fright). And MY GOD this is one of the funniest books I ever written in my short 26 years on this spinning rock. I had my doubts since humor is so subjective, some people enjoy slapstick more than satire, sarcasm when not done right can come off mean-spirited, etc. And most times when I read a book and there's humor involved, I usually have a decent chuckle and continue reading. This is the only book where after reading a certain joke, it was a gut-busting laugh and I had to put the book down for a second to get all the laughter out. The main character Ignatius is the living embodiment of ""so smart he's stupid"", but I can't help but see that maybe all of us have a little Ignatius in us. I can't tell you how many times I thought I was so smart because I had so much knowledge in a particular hobby...but have terrible social skills. I mean hell one quote that stuck with me was when Ignatius' Mom tells him (and I'm paraphrasing here )""*from all those books you've read, you couldn't figure out how to be a decent human being*"". And legit that got me.

Overall, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone that's just looking for a good laugh. For anyone that's read it, what did you think of the book?? And if you're reading this, you're awesome and I hope you have a fantastic day today!!

1bayguj,"A Confederacy of Dunces was hilarious, frustrating and tragic","Absolute hoot of a novel. I’d heard a lot of good things about it and it mostly lived up to my expectations. 

I think how much you enjoy this novel will depend on your tolerance of its protagonist. Igantius J Reilly is essentially a stereotypical Redditor - a lazy, neurotic, judgmental, smug and self-righteous goblin lacking in self-awareness and blaming the world for all his problems. As irritating as he is, following his misadventures around New Orleans and the wacky cast of characters is pretty damn hilarious. There are some genuinely gut-busting sequences (the hot dog cart section being a particular highlight, as well as Ignatius somehow becoming a model employee at Levy Pants) that cross over into surreal absurdity. 

And as annoying and frustrating as Ignatius is, there’s something about him that’s also kind of tragic and depressing. There’s an underlying self-loathing that I feel like John Kennedy Toole was trying to portray in Ignatius, hidden under a veneer of arrogance and assurance in his intellectual superiority over others around him. 

I will say though, that I wasn’t as compelled by some of the side stories. I honestly didn’t care too much about Burma Jones and the Night of Joy sideplot. 

Overall though, it’s an entertaining read and a fascinating insight into the mind of a repulsive human being. Toole honestly seemed way ahead of his time in terms of portraying a character like Ignatius.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bayguj/a_confederacy_of_dunces_was_hilarious_frustrating/,2024-03-10T01:46:34Z,63,178,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
3grlue,I've just finished 'A Confederacy of Dunces',"I first heard of this book on a TV show called 'The Will' discussing the estate of John Kennedy Toole, I enjoyed the episode but never really considered reading the book (the breif summary given on the show didn't interest me). Then I randomly came across a copy of it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it to be an incredibly original and hilarious piece of literature. The devil is in the details and in the case of this book so was the hilarity, Toole tickled my funny bone with broad strokes through his outlandish characters and ironic plot but also in the details through the directness of his prose. This is the first book I've read that openly claims to make you 'laugh out loud' so I was surprised at how it delivered on all cylinders.

76ie2m,"I have read A Confederacy of Dunces, and consider it nothing less than a latter-day epic.","Hello all,

That's the TL;DR, as it were, in the title. I finished A Confederacy of Dunces yesterday, and I feel so many folks have misinterpreted it -- and some don't appreciate just how sublime it is.

I've seen, here on /r/books and on Goodreads, plenty of people trying to explain the book as an indictment of higher education, or the throes of a misunderstood genius, or even as a pretty silly and pointless farce. I can't agree. I think what this book has done is so much more than that.

What is an epic? By my reckoning (and the reckoning of the Encyclopedia Britannica etc.), and after a bit of interpretation, it is a tale with larger-than-life characters that exemplify and encapsulate an entire society. That is perfectly what A Confederacy of Dunces has done. True, Ignatius isn't a glorious hero -- but he's so far on the other side of the spectrum, such a misanthropic antihero, I feel there are powerful parallels. In fact, EVERYONE in the novel is basically a perversion of a longstanding heroic archetype, and all of their actions eventually impacting each other in one grand finale is par for the course in epics like Beowulf. 

The novel, in its characterizations, its scene-setting, its ambiance, its events, are so much more like Beowulf, or even Independent People by Halldor Laxness (often called a modern epic of Iceland), than other, highly esteemed 'satirical' books (like Terry Pratchett's Discworld, which I cherish, don't get me wrong), that I feel it's missing the grandeur of the book to say they are of the same genre. Their purpose is different; Pratchett tells a story, lampoons a particular subject, in each of his excellent Discworld novels; JKT has crystallized an entire society into one tragic, hilarious, and powerful set of characters and scenes.

Anyway, that's all -- just wanted to say, sublime. Absolutely sublime.

My resolve was diminished when I read about Ignatius J. Reilly.

I wanted to strangle the man each time he opened his mouth. And yet he hypnotized me. He enthralled me. And by the ending, even though I was convinced that pathetic homonculus of a man deserved nothing less than incarceration, I found myself rooting for him.

Everybody around him started off as logical people when contrasted to Ignatius, but by the end they were exposed for their weakness and pettiness. It was as if Ignatius acted as a catalyst to bring out the worst in everyone, and yet it didn't feel like he actually was responsible for their downfall.

3t0ohn,"On ""A Confederacy of Dunces""","Warning **Spoilers** abound

A Confederacy of Dunces is one of the funniest books I have ever read and I find many who share my sentiments. 
Throughout the novel there is a curious melancholy. Like Napoleon Dynamite no character is able to communicate fully with one another. Ignatius at times feels almost like an alien attempting to masquerade as a human, his haughtiness comes from a sense of fear. Having never belonged anywhere in his life Ignatius has decided he would rather believe he refuses to fit in than face that he simply can not. Myrna as well has decided to make an enemy of the world. She too wants to remake the world in her own image in the hopes of belonging in it.

dnpets,A Confederacy of Dunces and Seinfeld,"I just finished reading a Confederacy of Dunces and it's one of the most amusing books I've ever read. The foreword introduces the main character,  Ignatius, as a modern Don Quixote, but because I've never actually read Don Quixote, I would personally describe Ignatius as proto George Contanza. The novel also reads like a Seinfeld episode, not only because of the similar neuroses of George and Ignatius, but because of the way both stories are structured. The book introduces secondary characters through some meeting with one of the main characters. The secondary characters go on to have their own stories, independent of the main story line, until the end when every secondary story rendezvous with the main story at the climax. One of my favorite aspects of Seinfeld is all of the chaos that tangents from the main characters only to intersect them in the end. Maybe I'm the only one who sees the parallels, but if you've read the book (and if you haven't, you should), imagine the ending again.

"" Pick it up,” the gunslinger said. “Slowly.”
Fat  Johnny  reached  down,  and  as  he  grasped  the  wallet,  he  farted loudly and screamed. 
With faint amusement the gunslinger realized he had mistaken the sound of his own fart for a gunshot and his time of dying had come. ""

27lvg3,Am I missing something about A Confederacy of Dunces that makes it so popular and often recommended?,"So far, I fail to understand the popularity of A Confederacy of Dunces. ""John Kennedy Toole's hero is one Ignatius J. Reilly, ""huge, obese, fractious, fastidious, a latter-day Gargantua, a Don Quixote of the French Quarter."" Don Quixote of the French Quarter? I don't think so. Only one quote has been mildly humorous to me in the first two chapters (70 pages out of about 400 in my paperback copy), and he is such a child and so terrible that I don't even know if I can finish reading this book. [Spoiler](/s ""Not to mention the unsettling masturbatory fantasy of his deceased pet, which was seemingly unnecessary and disturbing."") I'm no prude. I just fail to see how something like that could in any way contribute to the book at all other than to increase my loathing and disgust for the character. I'm so enraged by his behavior and approach to his life that I want to blood eagle Ignatius J. Reilly in the worst way. 

Is that the point? Did I miss something that is supposed to completely change how I'm reading this? I see it recommended on /r/booksuggestions as a novel that makes people laugh out loud. Is it a humor I'm clearly not suited for, or should I keep reading because it will click for me soon enough?

2r9n8p,Casting A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES,"A film version of John Kennedy Toole's A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES has been attempted by several Hollywood generations of varying degrees of talent, but none have succeeded thus far.

I wondered who you would cast if you were the casting director/producer/Czar of a new film version.

Actors and actresses, living or dead, at any age or stage of their career, are welcome. Feel free to add characters! This is just a base. 

My ideas...

Ignatius Reilly- John C. Reilly
Irene Reilly- (an aged) Melissa McCarthy
Myrna Minkoff- (a slovenly) Jennifer Lawrence
Angelo Mancuso- Tim Heidecker
Lana Lee- Jessica Lange
Darlene- Jessica Chastain 
Jones- Chris Rock 
Mr. Levy- Paul Rudd
Mrs. Levy- Amy Poehler

And I enjoyed it thoroughly! It's the first book I've read in a while that had me laughing out loud to the point of annoying those around me.

Most of the characters (okay, all of the characters) in the book are a bunch of pathetic pieces of shit, and Ignatius takes the cake (and nine hotdogs in the span of 30 minutes, Jesus). Some highlights of the book were his correspondence with Minkoff and the little asides of the characters of the city. Mrs. Levy was horrendous. 

And towards the end, in the last TEN PAGES of the book, when I thought I could bring myself to feel sympathy for the man, he does a completely reversal in the very last two pages, and I feel the same way for him as I did throughout the entire novel. Alas, the final paragraph of the tale does hint at some change, but we will never know.

Same way we'll never know what would have become of John Kennedy Toole's career if he hadn't taken his life. As an aspiring writer, his plight hits close to home. Rest in peace, you brilliant man.

You can vote for up to three books from their list of 25, which were selected from reader nominations. The 25 are:

* *1984*
* *All the Light We Cannot See*
* *Beloved*
* *Catch-22*
* *The Catcher in the Rye*
* *Charlotte's Web*
* *A Confederacy of Dunces*

* *One Hundred Years of Solitude*
* *The Overstory*
* *A Prayer for Owen Meany*

I suspect that winner is going to be something like *Harry Potter*, just because so many people have read it. Maybe *To Kill a Mockingbird,* since so many people had to read it in school and it's relatively accessible while still having the gravitas of being a classic. Or perhaps *The Fellowship of the Ring* could capture the votes of all the fantasy/sci-fi readers. It definitely won't be any of the more recent, lesser-known ones, like *A Gentleman in Moscow.* What are your predictions for the winner?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/r1oaym/the_new_york_times_has_a_poll_up_for_the_best/,2021-11-25T04:50:02Z,150,152,books,Confed of Dunces,POST

16e53u2,What constitutes a bady written satire?,"Mistyped title: \*badly written

A year or so ago, I decided I wanted to try my hand at writing a book with satirical elements so I went looking to make a list of books that were considered satire from the archives of this sub, listicles and other forums. I read two books from the list that were most popularly recommended: A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole and Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut. After reading those two, I promptly forgot about my interest in satire and the list I'd made.

Yesterday, I found it on my computer in a text file. I picked a book from the list that I had a copy of. It was The Mezzanine by Nicholson Baker. I'm on Chapter Five at moment and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. The thing is two a years ago I naively expected satire to be genre like any other. You know what to expect in horror or mystery or tragedy and I expected there would be something that would thread through different books. 17 year old me really expected something common in the writing styles or themes or something but the books I've read are so drastically different from each other. I've realised there are limitless ways of achieving a well-written satire.

And then I wondered what's a book that's not a good satire even if it is considered satirical. Can you write satire terribly? Do authors even aim to write satire or do their books end up being satire coincidentally alongside whatever genre they were aiming for? It doesn't have to be a badly written book just a badly written satire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16e53u2/what_constitutes_a_bady_written_satire/,2023-09-09T12:57:03Z,41,32,books,Confed of Dunces,POST

zah4m7,Have you ever felt like you’ve direly misread the tone of a novel?,"I just saw Greta Gerwig on The Tonight Show saying she found White Noise to be hilarious, and a while ago remember Will Ferrell was going to be cast as Ignatius Reilly in a (long-since dropped) adaptation of A Confederacy of Dunces.

While the comedic aspects of both of those novels (which I consider two of my favorites) were not lost on me, I never considered either to be straight-up comedies, which (based on how Gerwig spoke about the book and Ferrell’s casting) seem to be what they are/were.

I read both novels as tragedies: of systems failing people and people failing systems, from different perspectives, with questionable characters operating things all the way through.

To my reading it seemed serious but a bit silly, in a Sinclair Lewis sort of way, i.e. Very Serious but also a little funny (?)… and overall, far more stark than what the consensus seems to be.

1zst1x,Need to vent about McCarthy's The Road a little bit. Not for fans of the book...[spoilers],"Ok, so i picked up this book rather open-minded but knew I was in for some cliche-ridden trouble early on. The lack of apostrophes cant/wont bothered me, the lack of dialogue quotations bothered me. I did some research and found it won a Pulitzer Prize so i decided it must get better. 
But it didn't. 
At first mention of carrying the light, i got that the boy symbolized Hope for the future. The Dad was bound to die as per most dystopian novels. While the imagery was quite good, how many times can you rewrite it was a rainy and desolate (fill in location)? Answer, In The Road, quite a lot.  It just felt like i was reading the same chapter over and over and over, each with a slight twist for shock value.  

But even with it's rather cliche apocalyptic storyline, improper use of punctuation The Road won a Pulitzer? I don't get it. 

For the record, the last Pulitzer winner i read was Confederacy of Dunces, so maybe that set the bar too high on what I expect a Pulitzer to define as 'excellent'.    

I read here that this book gets a lot of love on Reddit and have been suggested that i read Blood Meridian but...why? I'm not saying McCarthy is a bad writer but I just don't get the Pulitzer Prize for this one.


EDIT; Thanks for the discussion; i guess if you like bleak and stark, The Road has it in spades. But in the same vein, a few of us just didn't get the hype and never will. If I didn't care for this one, at least I have an idea of what to expect with anything else he's written.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1zst1x/need_to_vent_about_mccarthys_the_road_a_little/,2014-03-07T10:32:36Z,35,10,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
9kk9cv,Can we talk about the Etymologicon? A circular stroll through the hidden connections of the English language,"I have 1 very small gripe with the book for starters. When talking about how Dutch is the source for many swear words and NSFW phrases, the author forgets the funniest of all!! A Dutch Oven!! I digress. I'm sure that was omitted intentionally. He doesn't want the book to be itself, NSFW.

The final 'chapter' (or short story, rather) is titled 'back to Howth Castle and Environs'. The second I saw it I thought ""Finnegan's Wake!!"" Another book famous for its circular stroll. One of the neatest touches I've ever seen in a book is that this was the ONLY chapter whose title wasn't directly related to the contents - of course it very neatly tied the ending of the book to the beginning. This was one of may examples of the author saying ""Are you paying close attention?""

It's easily one of the most interesting books I've ever read but more importantly for me - It's THE funniest non-fiction book I've ever read and is second only to A Confederacy of Dunces in terms of constant humour and it made me laugh out loud like no other piece of writing. 

I adored this book. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9kk9cv/can_we_talk_about_the_etymologicon_a_circular/,2018-10-01T20:55:02Z,3,13,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
c7ryi,"Bookit, I need help identifying a book: a riotous farce set in apartheid-era South Africa","Things I can remember: Several incompetent policemen, a pageant that is interrupted, an abortive attack on (I think) a jail, a giant gun that sends pieces of a guy into a tree. Everything culminates in colossal damage to whatever the setting is in the end.

I read this just a few years ago and have been looking for it ever since, but I cannot for the life of me remember the author or the title. IIRC, he was some kind of big name in SA humor.

1185vd,Trying to find a link from a comment that was posted on here a while ago. (x-post from /r/tipofmytongue),"About 6 months ago, someone linked in the comments of /r/books to a website that had a list of books that should be made into movies. I've found many similar lists online, but this particular one piqued my interest on quite a few books. I think it was the type of list where every entry was on a separate page so I had to click to read each entry.

I remember the following books definitely being on the list:

* ""Geek Love"" by Katherine Dunn
* ""Inferno"" by Larry Niven
* ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole
* ""Ubik"" by Philip K Dick
* ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" by Michael Chabon
* ""White Noise"" by Tom Delillo

I THINK ""The Eyre Affair"" by Jasper Fforde and Steven King's ""Dark Tower"" series were also on the list, but I'm not sure. The bulleted books I am quite sure about though.

I remember the descriptions of the books and the reason they should be movies were extremely interesting to me. Each one had something special about it that made me want to go out and read it. I've added all those books above to my reading list (and have finished a few of them) but I would like to remember what it was that compelled me to read them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1185vd/trying_to_find_a_link_from_a_comment_that_was/,2012-10-10T01:07:48Z,4,2,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
dkkavv,How I became a ‘reader’ over the summer...,"I had a goal of reading 15 books this year (thats a book a month plus 3 extra) but by the time it got to June -almost half way through the year - I had only read 2 books! 

Im not a slow reader, I’m not dyslexic, I don’t have ADHD, I’m just lazy and id rather spend hours browsing the internet or watching shitty sitcoms!

So I made myself a reading list for the summer, it consisted of 10 books
Books (Im english so we only have 6 weeks of summer)

- A farewell to arms (Ernest Hemingway) 
- Wuthering heights (Emily Bronte)
- A confederacy of dunces (John Kennedy Toole) 
- Bridget Jones’ diary (Helen Fielding)
- Cash (Johnny Cash)
- A clockwork orange (Anthony Burgess)
- The importance of music to girls (Lavinia Greenlaw) 
- To kill a mockingbird (Harper Lee)
- Animal farm (George Orwell)
- The Dubliners (James Joyce) 

The only book I didn’t complete was ‘The Dubliners’ but I was still really impressed with myself, I didn’t actually expect to read even half the books on my list! 

And some of the books - for my age, 15 -were quite hard to read, but I still managed to complete them. 

Surprisingly it was really nice summer, I spent most my time reading in the garden or in my room or outside the tent on holiday - I fell out with a lot all of my friends earlier in the year so I didn’t have much to do, I’m glad i used my free time reading!

Now I’m back at school and I haven’t been reading as much but i’ve still been keeping up - and I’ve surpassed my goal of 15!

A few things I found helped me read a lot was;

1. Cutting my internet usage to an hour a day -this is the best tip I can give you! If you limit yourself to an hour a day (and use that hour in one go) you’ll find yourself with a lot of free time and I ended up reading a lot without wanting checking my phone every 2 minutes 
2. Read multiple books at once - not literally of course, but reading a fiction and non fiction at the same time helped me get more done - if I wasn’t into the fiction I could always just switch over
3. Make a reading list - it gives you a deadline - so now you’ve got an incentive to read more! I had a mix of books id been saying I was gonna read for YEARS and books I really wanted to read at the time
4. Set some time aside everyday to read - varies from person to person but maybe set between 20 minutes - 2 hours. This is one I’ve been using since I went back to school because its easy to just go home, switch the telly on and fall out of the reading habit
5. Deleting social media - I deleted instagram one night when I was a bit sad, and I completely forgot about it until people started asking me if I deleted it. I really have no desire to go back to it, it feels quite liberating to not have it anymore!

I think reading more really has helped me, I don’t want to sound like an english teacher trying to convince teenagers to read, but I really do think its helped! Im able to concentrate better, I feel like I’ve accomplished more and over all I feel a lot happier! 

Anyway, thats all I had to share with the internet as someone who doesn’t have any reading difficulties other then just general laziness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dkkavv/how_i_became_a_reader_over_the_summer/,2019-10-20T14:28:03Z,12,16,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
2qvmw2,The results of my 2014 resolution to read a book a week.,"I have always loved reading and have felt that that hobby was something that defined me.  However, being busy with school, work, etc. I found that wasn't reading as much as I would like.  As such, in late February, I decided I would read a book a week and keep track of it.  Since I figure some of you may be looking to do the same thing, I'd like to share my experiences.

I was able to read forty books, which, although that didn't meet my goal, I am fairly proud of since I started late february, took about two months off to prep for the bar and have been working about 75 hours a week since August. 

Also, I assigned each book a score out of 10 to indicate how enjoyable I found the book.

Here is my list:

1.  [Blindness by Jose Saramago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_%28novel%29)
     8/10

2. [Siddhartha by Herman Hesse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)) 
      10/10 - one of my favorites

3. [Fun With Your New Head by Thomas Disch](http://www.amazon.com/Fun-your-head-Thomas-Disch/dp/B000FMIHV2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419988856&sr=8-1&keywords=fun+with+your+new+head) 7/10

4. [Deus Irae by PK Dick and Roger Zelazny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Irae) 7/10

5. [The Mote in Gods Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mote_in_God%27s_Eye) 8/10

6. [""They've Killed the President!"" : The Search for the JFK Murderers](http://www.amazon.com/Theyve-killed-President-murderers-Kennedy/dp/B0006CW8C0/) 8/10

7. [Extraterrestrial Visitations From Prehistoric Times to Present](http://www.amazon.com/Extraterrestrial-Visitations-Prehistoric-Times-Present/dp/0451059425/) 4/10 (the author was really stretching...)

8. [The Morning of the Magicians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_of_the_Magicians) 9/10 

9. [The Mothman Prophecies by John Keel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mothman_Prophecies) 8/10

10. [Medicolegal Investigation of the President John F. Kennedy Murder](http://www.amazon.com/Medicolegal-Investigation-President-Kennedy-Murder/dp/0398036799/) 6/10 (As you may have guessed, this book was quite dense)

11. [The Great God Pan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_God_Pan) 9/10

12. [Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle) 3/10 - This is another book I just found dumb, I'm sorry to all the vonnegut fans out there- just not my cup of tea.

13. [VALIS by PK Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VALIS) 10/10 - another one of my favorites.  I loved all the theological madness.

14. [Dream Power by Anne Faraday](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Ann-Faradays-Dream-Power/dp/0425160599) 8/10 - This was a really interesting book about dreaming.  However, one thing that was a bid odd  was at one point the author describes a dream where her brother was making love to her ""from behind"" and this represented her feelings about her brother.  Anyways, no judgment.

15. [Clans of the Alphane Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clans_of_the_Alphane_Moon) 7/10

16. [This Immortal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Immortal) 5/10

17. [The Three Christs of Ypsilanti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Christs_of_Ypsilanti) 8/10

18. [The Food of the Gods by Terence McKenna](http://www.amazon.com/Food-Gods-Original-Knowledge-Evolution/dp/0553371304/) 8/10

19. [The Reason for God](http://www.amazon.com/Reason-God-Belief-Age-Skepticism/dp/1594483493/) 2/10 - poorly reasoned

20. [Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_and_Goldmund) 7/10 - nowhere near as good as siddhartha, too preachy

21. [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) 10/10
 
22. [Ready Player One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One) 8/10 - very very cheesy but it was entertaining...

23. [The World Jones Made by PK Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Jones_Made) 9/10

24. [Our Dreaming Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Our-Dreaming-Mind-Robert-Castle/dp/0345396669/) 9/10 -really good overview on the study of dreams

25. [Anthem by Ayn Rand] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_(novella)) 9/10 - good book, perhaps not the best philosophy...

26. [Radio Free Albemuth by PK Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Albemuth) - 8/10 This book was substantially similar to VALIS, jsut not as good.  Also- last PK Dick book in this list!

27. [Lord of the Flies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies) 8/10

28. [The Master and Margarita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita) 9/10- i loved the parts with Pontius Pilate

29. [Watership Down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down) 10/10 - just a beautiful story, I started to tear up when one of the bunnies died.

30. [Fahrenheit 451](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451) 3/10 - What is the point of this book about?  It's not about censorship because no one really cares about the content of the books, just the form of the book itself...Please enlighten me

31. [I Am Legend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(novel)) 8/10 - very enjoyable book, much better than the movie.  As you'll see, for October, I read horror novels.

32. [Horns by Joe Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_(novel)) 4/10 - Joe Hill proves he is a bad writer, just like his dad. 

33. [Haunting of Hill House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House) 6/10

34. [Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath) 10/10 - what an incredible, moving book.

35. [Monkey Wrench Gang by Edward Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey_Wrench_Gang) 7/10 - I was expecting another Desert Solitaire but this wasn't anywhere near as good.

36. [Moby Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick) 11/10 - This book took me 3-4 weeks but it instantly became my favorite book of all time.  I HIGHLY recommend it.

37. [The Dispossessed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed) 1/10 - God, this book was so boring.  They should read it to children to make them go to sleep.

38. [Catcher in the Rye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye) 9/10

39. [Confederacy of Dunces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Confederacy_of_Dunces) 9/10

40. [The Four Signs of a Dynamic Catholic](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Signs-Dynamic-Catholic/dp/1937509664)  4/10 - They gave this book out to my parents at the Christmas for free.  My dad tossed it to me and since I had nothing else to read or do, I read it in an hour and a half or so.  Wasn't the worst book ever but I wouldn't recommend it.

The rest of the books are ones I didn't finish:
(Between book 39 and 40) 1/4 of [Neuromancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) 1/10 - i felt like this was the ultimate computer nerd book and just couldn't get into it.

(Between book 25 and 26) 1/2 of [Farewell to Arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms)  1/10 - What's at the bottom of the iceberg? He hates war?  No shit.

(Between book 24 and 25) 1/2 of [The Sense of Being Stared At](http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Being-Stared-At-Unexplained/dp/1620550970/) - From here on out I started work and began reading only fiction.  This book was interesting though and I plan on returning to it since its one of the few listed here I own.  7/10

(Between book 23 and 24) 1/2 of [334 by Thomas Disch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/334_(novel)) - I was reading this on my kindle and the format got all messed up and I got bored... The beginning was good though! 6/10

(Between books 18 and 19) 1/2 of a Family Law textbook (read for exam) - Not scoring textbooks on enjoyability scale...

(Between books 18 and 19) 1/2 of a Criminal Procedure Textbook (read for exam) 

(Between books 18 and 19) [The Experience of God](http://www.amazon.com/Experience-God-Being-Consciousness-Bliss/dp/0300209355/) - 2/10 I found this book rang hollow and I stopped.

(Between books 15 and 16) 1/2 of [The Flight to Lucifer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flight_to_Lucifer) 3/10 - With all its gnostic gods, this book just got too bizarre.  Since I didn't know any of the gnostic gods, I felt I was really missing the point.

(Between books 7 and 8) 1/2 of [The Crying of Lot 49](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49)  1/10 - I know this book is really highly praised, I just didn't get it at all.  What was with the fake beatles band?


I am currently reading [One Hundred Years of Solitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude).  I am a quarter of the way through and am finding it pointless.  I'll jump ship soon.

Anyways, I would love to hear any more suggestions/recommendations or if people have questions about certain books, etc. Also, I'd like to hear strategies about how to stick to reading goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2qvmw2/the_results_of_my_2014_resolution_to_read_a_book/,2014-12-31T02:21:33Z,26,30,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
wmi7ty,The best books ever written; a meta-analysis of the internet's lists.,"I think most of us here have come to the realisation that there are too many books, and too little time to read them all. This raises what I consider a bigger problem: If I can only read a finite number of books in my lifetime, how do I choose what books to read?

Personally, I have always wanted to read the books considered the best and most influential to literature and greater society. However, I was having difficulty finding a list that I considered an acceptable interpretation of this question. Several internet communities, media publications and academics have published their own version of what they consider either the ‘best’ or ‘most influential’ books, but many of these contained so much variety and potential for individual preference that I couldn’t take just one of them as my essential source. So, I decided to analyse and combine the data from approximately 20 of these lists.

The most robust resource I could find for this project was thegreatestbooks.org, a website that combines the data of 130 different lists. However, this algorithm contains rules that result in certain lists counting more than others, such as lists voted by authors and experts counting more than user-generated lists. Personally, I would have taken the opposite approach, however it nonetheless provided an excellent resource for a starting dataset.

My process was as follows; I created a list by taking the top 500 titles from thegreatestbooks algorithm and giving them all a “score” of 1 (meaning that they have been mentioned in a list once). I then chose approximately 20 other lists from a variety of sources, including Reddit, 4Chan, Time Magazine, The Reader’s Digest, and so on. Whenever a title that was already in the original 500 was mentioned again, it received another “point” and its score was raised by one. Furthermore, whenever a book that was not on the original 500 was listed, it was added and given a starting score of 1.

I repeated this process until I had a list of 1000 books, and then ranked these books based on how many times they were mentioned. Finally, I culled every book that only had a score of 1, meaning they had only made it onto a single list (including those listed in the original 500 and never listed again). This resulted in a final catalogue of 556 books.

A couple of things before the list. Firstly, I think it is important to note that some of the lists were not stated as the “best” books of all time, but rather the “most influential,"" and so on. I do not believe the rankings on this list to be indicative of a title being objectively “better” than any other book on this list but is more likely a representation of popularity and influence that specific book has had. This is at the end of the day just another list and it shouldn’t be considered anything more than a primitive piece of data-analysis.

The following is the top scoring 302, all with at least 3 mentions. Due to Reddit's character limit, the books with two mentions are listed in the comments.

kutm4,Feeling the desire to whittle down my book collection but have a bit of guilt about it...,"Alright, so I'm on a bit of a less is more thing (i.e. If I don't use it or need it, then don't keep it or buy it).  I've been applying it to a lot of aspects lately, although I've somewhat avoided my book collection thus far.  Now, I've been pretty good in the past at getting rid of books I finish and know I won't ever read again.  Also, I tend to lend books out and generally I don't see them back again unless the book was important enough to me to hound someone to give it back...and actually remember I lent it/owned it in the first place.  So all in all we're not talking a huge collection here.  Also, I really love my kindle and e-books, so buying physical books is less and less of a common occurrence.  

But, I'm starting to feel some serious guilt about the books I own that either a) I haven't read or b) I started and can't get into or didn't finish.  I'm pretty good at stopping reading a book if I'm not enjoying it ( I used to make myself finish even if I hated it and it took me months to do so), but to physically get rid of a book I never read or finished is SO HARD.  Especially if 'everyone' raves about it and I feel like I really ' should' read it.  I guess I think that maybe someday I'll give it another go and it'll magically be interesting/enjoyable.  That isn't completely unheard of, to have your tastes change over time.   So I hold onto them, and they sit there... And when I see them I feel bad and guilty and think 'ok, when I'm done this book, I'll go back to that'.  

I'm looking for your input - am I crazy, or do you go through this too?  If you do, what's your tactic?  Also, I want to mention this applies to books I physically own.  Of course I have a 'to read' list that is never ending, but that doesn't bother me the way owning a book and not reading it does.

If anyone's interested the books I'm all conflicted about are:
Midnights Children by Salman Rushie - stopped at page 382 of 531.  Great writing but just couldn't get into the story, only reason I got as far as I did as because it was a book for a book club.

Wizards First Rule - Terry Goodkind, bought on rec from a friend.. Haven't read a page of it and I've owned it for at least five years

The Lost Highway - David Adams Richard stopped on page 133 of 393.  Writing was decent but found it to be about pretty miserable/despicable/unrelatable people so just wasn't enjoyable for me. 

Pilgrim by Timothy Findley stopped on page 304 of 534.  I really wanted to love this book, but I felt like I didn't get it or it was over my head.  Hahah I feel especially guilty/bad about this one as I felt like the book was too smart for me/ over my head.  Keep meaning to go back to it since it's probably been eight or so years since I tried - maybe I'll get it now?

Love in the time of Cholera stopped on page 222 of 348.  One of those 'I should read this"" books.  Never felt strongly about it one way or the other, just didn't capture my interest and was one of those books that just took me forever to read this far until I just stopped.

Confederacy Of Dunces - John Kennedy Toole.  Apprehensive to even mention this on reddit.  Lots of 'this is the greatest book ever' people out there.  What can I say, I saw where it would be/is humorous to some people but it just annoyed the fuck out of me.  I actually don't feel any guilt about this one...first reaction when I see it is ""I hate you"" followed by fantasies of burning it or tearing it into bits hahah.  But I won't..so don't panic people.

Ok that covers the main ones... I have some other random shit that I don't care too much about one way or another.

Also, I'm open to any suggestions to give a particular book another try.

Also love to hear what your guilty should read/finish but haven't books are.  Hopefully I'm not the only one.

Also could send you or swap some books :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kutm4/feeling_the_desire_to_whittle_down_my_book/,2011-09-29T02:37:33Z,3,1,books,Confed of Dunces,POST
2qyvtq,Made a New Year's resolution in 2014 to read more...here is my list.,"Before 2014 I considered myself a light to medium reader, I would read maybe 10 books a year (if that).  For 2014 I made the resolution to read more, specifically 50 books over the course of the year.  

I limited myself to books that were over 175 pages and they could not be books that I had read before.  I have been exposed to some amazing pieces of fiction and have learned quite a bit from some of the non-fiction books that I read.  

I kept track of all the books I read throughout the year, including page numbers so I have some stats that I thought were interesting as well.  Since 2014 is coming to a close I thought I would share what I accomplished.  

Here is the list with ratings:  

1	**Why does the world exist? An existential detective story** -Jim Holt 6.4 / 10  
2	**Ready player one**	-Ernest Cline 9.1/10  
3	**Rendezvous with Rama** -Arthur C. Clarke 6.9/10  
4	**Mind's Eye** -Douglas E. Richards 8.0/10 (I have read most of his books and some of them seem to blend together but they are all good, quick reads.  
5	**The End of Eternity** -Isaac Asimov 8.2/10  
6	**Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance** -Robert Pirsig 8.6/10 (Will probably re-read this again.  I think knowing the ending will change how it reads)  
7	**Nexus** -Ramez Naam - 8.8/10  
8	**To Kill a mockingbird	** -Harper Lee 10/10 Perfect  
9	**Neuromancer** -William Gibson 7.6/10 (Hard for me to get into, may try to re-read)  
10	**Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy** -Douglas Adams 8.5/10 (I read all 5 in a row in the span of about 10 days so separating them is difficult, as a series 8.5/10)  
11	**Breakfast of Champions**	-Kurt Vonnegut 7.7/10 (Prefer Cat's Cradle and Sirens but wasn't memorable to me)  
12	**Andromeda strain**	-Michael Crichton - 9.0/10 (Love Michael Crichton)  
13	**Schrodinger's Gat**	-Robert Kroese - 5.0/10 (Not memorable at all)  
14	**The Sparrow**	-Mary Doria Russell - 7.0/10 (I think I sped through this novel, recommended by my wife, may try a re-read)  
15	**One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest** -Ken Kesey - 10/10 (This book has been on my shelf for years and I had tried to get into it a few times, will definitely re-read this a few times)  
16	**Subliminal** -Leonard Mlodinow 8.6/10  
17	**The Physics of Wall Street** -James Weatherall 8.7/10  
18	**Damned** -Chuck Palahniuk 6.0/10 (Used to love Palahniuk, this was not very good though)  
19	**Handwriting**	-Klara Roman 7.5/10 (VERY dry, but interesting)  
20	**Daemon** -Daniel Suarez 9.4/10 (Great techno-thriller.  Very difficult to put down)  
21	**Physics of the Impossible** -Michio Kaku 8.1/10  
22	**The Spark Of Life**	-Frances Ashcroft 8.0/10  
23	**Lexicon** -Max Barry 8.8/10 (Very interesting premise but under-delivered a little bit)  
24	**Freedom** -Daniel Suarez 8.9/10 (Not quite as good as Daemon but a good continuation)  
25	**A Hologram For The King** -Dave Eggers 8.5/10   
26	**A Restaurant at the end of the universe** -Douglas Adams 8.5/10  
27	**So long and thanks for all the fish** -Douglas Adams 8.5/10

h0smtr,What book would you want to be the last book you read to have a happy fullfiling death?,"Sorry if this is a morbid question, but my intentions are far from it. 

Speaking to a lot of people preparing for their end of life (I work in aged care), people often highlight the ""finals"" of everything they get to do. 

For example: the last Christmas you'd celebrate, the last time you walk on the beach, the last song you would hear. In fact, some people prefer having certain music/artists playing in their passing moments. 

This made me think and want to ask everyone else here: books are really important to me and I imagine they are for a lot of you.

What book has changed your life and you perception of the world that you would want to read again as your last?

Is there any book you'd recommend to other people to read as their last? What about this book makes it powerful?

Essentially, what book is the book you'd want to take with you on your journey into death? Why this book? How do you think it'll make you feel in the final moments?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h0smtr/what_book_would_you_want_to_be_the_last_book_you/,2020-06-11T05:10:21Z,19,9,books,Confed of Dunces,POST

s2yjx,Need a book recommendation,"Ok, so I'm trying to pick a book my wife and I can agree on reading together. Examples of my tastes are Stephenson, Dawkins, Sedaris, King, Adams/Pratchett and the like. Hers are closer to Bellows, Kundera, Neruda, Hedges and the like. 

I am more amenable to her style of book than she is to mine, but I wouldn't mind something somewhere in the middle. Hopeless?

5yd6jo,Its been a few years since I've read 100 years of solitude but I every time I think of literature I think about it.,"When ever the topic of literature comes up in any conversation I remember the novel, out of everything I have read it just stands out so much. I've read a lot in my life, collected books and read across genres and topics and everything a good reader should read, but the one novel that remains in my head after all this time is that one. 100 years of solitude, so hard to describe and so easy to love. When I'm asked about what the story is about I always say that its story of Latin American history, that its the story of Columbia and Cuba and every other island nation... and yet its none of them. It's the story of mankind, and it blends the real with the fantastical in a way that captures reality better than any other novel that I've read. Real life is fantastical and mundane: Life is magical, random, and so many more things all while being seemingly ordinary. When I read it, I see myself and my family in its pages, I see Cuba and all of the wonder it holds for me.

:) I guess I had to write about how much I loved it after reading a quote from it. 

""He had not stopped desiring her for a single instant. He found her in the dark bedrooms of captured towns, especially in the most abject ones, and he would make her materialize in the smell of dry blood on the bandages of the wounded, in the instantaneous terror of the danger of death, at all times and in all places.

i2278m,The Princess Bride made me furious until I realized I was an idiot,"Ok, so my wife and I recently watched the Princess Bride with our kids. I loved it again, fantastic movie.  As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

Edit: Well shit, it's spelled ""Morgenstern."" Ty for the solidarity those who have fallen for sneaky Goldman also.

19e4aba,The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"I have never been a big reader which I am trying to change in 2024 and this was my first Russian novel and by far the longest book I've ever read which took me 18 days to finish reading about 40-50 pages a day which is about 2-3 hours for me. 

The Idiot was a really good and enjoyable book but having never read a Russian book and not being a big reader at all I did find it a little challenging at times following the names of people and who is who and what their relations to other people are particularly with married women being addressed by different names to their husbands and also daughters with different names to their parents eg Lizaveta Prokofyevna is the wife of 'The General' Ivan Fyodorovich and the mother of Aglaya Ivanovna but that's probably more just a cultural thing I am not used to. It's no big deal with the Yepanchin family but when people return after an absence it got confusing at times. 

Parts of this book really made me laugh such as the outburst on the train to St Petersburg regarding the ""know alls"" and I think it was Ippolit who teed off on The General calling him pompous mediocrity and an acme olympian of ordinariness without a single original idea, it was great and I plan to go back and read that part. Lizaveta was also quite funny when she got aggressive throughout the book. 

At first I really did not like Nastasya Filippovna and thought she was a real stuck up bitch but further in to the book you find out about the abuse she suffered and then she has these men who are fighting over her beauty trying to win her over with money which I took to mean that she found absurd so throws the money bag in to the fire, the prince pities her but she knows she will only hurt him. 

I liked Aglaya and felt really bad for her at the end, I was hoping the prince and aglaya would be together and live happily ever after but he's so fixated on pitying Nastasya than his own love for Aglaya who appears to grow more and more in love with the prince when he continually doesn't demonstrate the qualities of a ""knight"" that she is looking for. I think she is constantly humiliating him in public in a way to challenge him but he repeatedly just accepts the situation without fighting and this possibly drives her to loving him more and more. She seems to have grown up in a very sheltered and protected environment where the older sisters will do everything to ensure that she is the one who succeeds and gets to marry the man with large wealth but she doesn't appear to want that and dreams through books about her own future which she wants the prince to be. 

The book often gets described as a ""day time soap opera"" but that's only surface level IMO when you start to think more about each of the characters individually there's a lot of depth and even mystery about them but it was also fun just spending a day in the life with wealthy 19th century Russian and seeing the hilariously shallow mindset they have, I'm enjoying just reflecting on the book and absorbing the development and understanding more about their motives and values. 

The downside of the book was that I found the blurb on the back was a bit misleading and in a way it ruined the ending for me which I think is why I didn't feel as impacted by it as most do because it says ""The Prince gets caught up in a love triangle, blackmail and ultimately murder"" but it doesn't happen until the last 10 pages and the further in to the book I got I kept thinking when will the murder take place? I don't remember what the blackmail was either or maybe I just didn't understand or interpret that there was a blackmail in the story. 

I've bought Crime and Punishment because I enjoyed The Idiot and Dostoyevsky's writing but I'm going to read something smaller next before tackling it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19e4aba/the_idiot_by_fyodor_dostoyevsky/,2024-01-24T00:54:47Z,18,26,books,The Idiot,POST
15lq0wd,The Idiot by Elif Batuman,"probably one of the most polarizing books i have read. there was no plot or bigger picture, and no real chapters. i personally loved loved loved the book though. the way Batuman wrote Selin’s stream of consciousness was amazingly witty, charming, and profound. I found myself actually highlighting so many things when I’ve never highlighted in a book before. Her ideas and thoughts immersed me in her world, feeling her emotions. I found myself researching so much too: Dostoevsky, Mayakovsky, Epictetus, the lost hungarian word for bear, etc etc. It was just an enthralling rabbit hole of knowledge that i wouldn’t have happened upon myself. I related to the main character in such a way that i became unimmersed a few times just in awe of how well i understood how it was to think the way she did. it was as if Batuman was writing *my* thoughts. The book made me feel seen while being filled with so much information to learn about. 

ive never given a book 5/5 stars but wow Elif Batuman deserves it. 

a few quotes i really enjoyed:
•it was a mystery to me how Svetlana generated so many opinions on contact.  Meanwhile i went from class to class, read hundreds, thousands of pages of distilled ideas and nothing happened 
•condemning you to the awareness that everything you said was potentially encroaching on someone else’s experience, that your own subjectivity was booby-trapped and set you up to have conflicting stories with others. 
•But it seemed that one had always been midway the journey of life, and would be maybe right up until the moment of death. 
•a tree with wings: despite roots he flew away. 
•the eternal pauper in the great marketplace of ideas and of the world, i had nothing to teach anyone 
•[if i must be put to death, let it be] by your aristocratic little hand. 
•i felt every level, graphemic, morphological, and semantic, and they all hurt. 
•but the egg felt like the whole universe
•the idea of an onion masquerading as an artichoke seemed sinister, even sociopathic
•space and time shut down, one dimension at a time, the sky collapsing from a dome to a plane, the plane collapsing into a line, and then there were no surroundings, there was nothing but forward, and there wasn’t even forward
•I couldnt imagine how i was going to dispose of my body in space and time every minute of every day for the rest of my life",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15lq0wd/the_idiot_by_elif_batuman/,2023-08-08T18:22:24Z,29,29,books,The Idiot,POST

The possible inconsistency occurs in Part 3 Chapter 3/4. Even though I read it at least twice, it still seems that the events are impossible to occur the way that they occur.

  
Chronologically,  
Myshkin bumps into Keller, who has been following him since he left the Epanchins', Keller offers protection to Myshkin which he thinks is absurd. Then Myshkin walks to the park where Rogozhin appears, they discuss some stuff, and Myshkin remembers that it is his birthday. Myshkin invites Rogozhin to join him to celebrate in his villa.

  
Now this is where it gets unreasonable,  
When Myshkin and Rogozhin arrive at Myshkin's villa, the whole squad is waiting for them. Long story short, we are told that Keller told the squad that it was Myshkin's birthday.

  
The problem I see is that there is no way that, as I understand the plot, Keller might know it was Myshkin's birthday. On top of Keller barely knowing Myshkin, even Myshkin did not remember it was his birthday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/185112g/dostoyevski_the_idiot_possible_inconsistency/,2023-11-27T11:39:48Z,7,0,books,The Idiot,POST

Myshkin is such a pure and innocent figure who is Christ-like it makes his arc all the more tragic. Him cradling Rogozhin in the finale after Rogozhin murders Nastasya and leads him to view the body was brutal. Honestly Myshkin is too pure for his own good and by the ending he truly becomes ""The Idiot"" through his series of actions.

15dszwi,The idiot by dostoevsky (thoughts),"I've read ""crime and punishment"" and i really enjoyed it, so i bought ""the idiot "" because it was one of his famous books among ""brothers karamazov"" and ""the demons"". It was an interesting book at first but then i felt that some parts after the 200th  page were Unnecessary. Maybe I'm not a fan of books about high society, and that's why I thought that in the middle of the novel the plot was poor and the women's reactions, especially to such simple things, were exaggerated. It's probably one of the few books that I dislike almost all of the characters, but that wasn't an issue for me.parts such as Prince Mishkin's birthday, his stories about his life in the countryside, the narrator's  thoughts on various social issues, but also the many            "" philosophical ""monologues made by various characters, breaking the structure of the story, were my favorite points of this book.But as I said at the beginning there were many chapters that were unnecessary (although I personally have no issue with a book having a few chapters that They may be considered unnecessary) and the end had an interesting plot twist although my thoughts after all of these chapters (which the plot was nothing special) ""that's all?!? "" . Characters like Ragozin and Nastasia were quite interesting and unpredictable and brought the book to life. After  reading this book all  I have to say is that the lizabette must shut the fuck up. 6/10 i  hope the brothers karamazov which i am planning to read will be more of  my liking. :)

18eo4n9,"Loved Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, but didn't enjoy Notes from Underground and The Idiot as much?","I read C&P earlier this year and absolutely loved it. Since then I also read NFU and The Idiot but I don't know why I didn't enjoy them as much.

I was puzzled by NFU's part 1 (although since I only read the P&V translation it could be a translation problem). NFU's part 2 was interesting, but it wasn't amazing/life-changing for me like many other people claim.

I was very hyped up starting The Idiot, and indeed the book started with such a bang with part 1. However, I found myself getting lost with parts 2 & 3 (again, could be a translation problem? I had P&V). Part 4 was also very good but after slogging through parts 2 & 3 I was more focused on just finishing the book rather than enjoying the ending.

I also have Demons and The Brothers Karamazov on my TBR list. Given that my experience with Dostoevsky has been hit-or-miss so far, I am a little afraid that I won't enjoy these two books as much as I hope.

I'm curious if anyone else had a similar experience with me. If so, did you enjoy Demons and/or TBK (if you've read them)? What should I expect?

Naturally, I went out and bought the book, but I also bought the idiot (I wanted to read it as a warm up to the author). Dostoevsky has an ability in creating characters that I’ve never seen any other author have. His characters are emotionally raw. Many of the characters in the book are rich, and the way that they are written feels hilarious, but also completely accurate in context. So much happens in the first part of this book alone, and what was mind blowing to me was that it happened in only one day. My favorite characters are the prince (who I relate to) and nastasya filipovna. The way that nastasya brings out the disbelief, anger, and hilarity of the rest of the cast was a great read.

I know, from reading the dust jacket that everyone thinks The Prince is an ""idiot"". He finds that his good-naturedness (though I still don't exactly see him that way) keeps him from totally relating to the people around him because they're so morally empty (as per the synopsis online I read). Again, I see (sort of) where these people are morally empty. I haven't found one I find redeeming. The male characters all seem to want to be with this one young woman Natasha but why?

I remember the first part on the train, the two people sitting next to him assumed that he was an idiot when he really said nothing wrong, they simply assumed it and started treating him like one because of his readiness to answer questions and his honesty.

Prince Myshkin continues being that person throughout the whole novel, honest and good to everyone, but why are people like that labeled as idiots? Can't someone be genuinely good without expecting anything in return? Or be honest and answer questions as they are? Or not care about what people think is important (money) and have other goals in life? Do we all need to plot against others and have a trick up our sleeves in order to be respected?

I read this after reading ""Crime and Punishment"", which was very impactful and entertaining. I just thought ""The Idiot"" was hard to get through in some parts, and the story progressed too slowly without anything really happening. 

As all Dostoevsky's books are layered with symbolism and themes, the first read is bound to be a bit more surface-level than future rereads. I think what would have helped and what I suggest those of you who haven't read the book is to read the analysis of what Dostoevsky is trying to say online first, before reading the book. As I think that way you will have the right mindset and thematic lense to read it in. When I was reading it I was constantly struggling to find the deeper meanings and what he is trying to say about society. This method might not be for everyone though, as some might not want the book spoiled.

Also maybe I am not the strongest in looking past the surface when it comes to great literature.

l93zf3,The Idiot by Dostoevsky,"So I just finished this book recently and was...disappointed. I've begun reading Dostoevsky's major work in chronological order. So just coming off Crime and Punishment - a literary masterpiece which had an immeasurable toll on my psyche and perception - I was expecting a more developed and intriguing novel to succeed it, that being The Idiot. 

While the book was interesting in parts (specifically Parts 1 and 4 for me). I felt it just dragged on, repeating a variation of The Prince being in a predicament, and then being chastised for the way he handled it, by being called some variation of idiotic.  Overall, it didn't seem to pack the same punch as Notes from the Underground or C&P. It didn't really explore the human psyche as well as it's predecessors also, in my opinion.

I felt the ending was quite predictable. Rogozhin felt underdeveloped; I know people attribute passions to his motivation, but I don't feel there is enough evidence to draw such a conclusion. From my understanding each of the three main characters were intended to reflect the three dimensions of F.: his unwavering devotion to his faith (the prince); the nihilism he experienced and was surrounded by during his exile (Ippolit); but what dimension did Rogozhin represent? I was looking forward to Ippolit's role towards the end, especially after 'The Explanation'; but his impact on the story seemed to peter off. 

I guess the book was trying to answer this question: is there any room in this world for a good and pure man. While I agreed with his answer in the end, I don't think it was delivered in the profound way that was similar to his previous books.

While I say this, the book in itself is probably a good or even great book compared to other literature; but it still left me a bit disappointed knowing what F. was capable of with his previous works. On to Demons now, which I'm still excited about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/l93zf3/the_idiot_by_dostoevsky/,2021-01-31T04:00:25Z,17,22,books,The Idiot,POST
wbhi6n,Help me appreciate The Idiot by Dostoevsky (and other books like it),"I’m about 30% through and I just don’t get it. There are definitely some absolutely beautiful parts; the first one that comes to mind is the discussion about what a person thinks before being executed. They talked about how absolute a persons future is when imprisoned by the government and on death row, as opposed to other situations such as being injured in the wild (or something like that? Can’t quite remember) where you’re still able to maintain hope, no matter how dire your situation is. This part of the book gave me chills. 

But overall, the main thing I notice is: it’s a whole lot of conversation written in a way that doesn’t feel like real conversation. People talk for way too long, saying odd things. I can’t articulate it very well; it’s just that the conversation doesn’t seem “natural”. Is this just because of the difference in time? People just don’t seem to act like people. 

And these conversations go on and on and on and on, with no real point it seems half the time. 

One really weird spot was right before part 2. You have this incredibly long buildup to the craziness that is Nastasya Fillipovna, and her running circles around all the suitors, then she runs off with Rogozhin, the Prince chases after her, and it feels like it’s getting exciting and THEN!!!! 

Nothing. Skip to a few weeks later where nothing of interest came of all that tension and buildup. If that sort of thing happened in any book published today, it would be a good example of why that books writing sucks. 

Another small but annoying thing is when certain actions by characters aren’t explicitly stated. In any other book, it would say “and then bob cracked the door and stuck his head in”. But in this book, it’s more like the action of bob appearing in the scene is mentioned after he has already started speaking, or after someone is already talking to him. I just find this weird.

oebls9,Thoughts on 'The Idiot' by Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Just a few moments ago I finished David McDuff's (Penguin Classics) translation of *The Idiot* by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 

Now here's the thing; just before this one I read *The Brothers Karamazov* (McDuff, Penguin), and was utterly mesmerized with the span of the novel and Dostoyevsky's control over the whole story; no character too insignificant, no anecdote written carelessly; each and every word in TBK contributed to its denouement. Every element merged so beautifully to the story, that I was somewhat crestfallen, when immediately after TBK I picked up *The Idiot* and finished it.

To begin with, generally I do not use additional notes or references to read books unless specifically required; but after finishing this, I went to its [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot) and read this certain part:

> The artistic method of conscientiously testing his central idea meant that the author could not always predict where the plot was going as he was writing. The novel has an awkward structure, and many critics have commented on its seemingly chaotic organization.

Again, in another place,

> Rather than bring a man to goodness, he wanted to start with a man who was already a truly Christian soul, someone who is essentially innocent and deeply compassionate, and test him against the psychological, social and political complexities of the modern Russian world. It was not only a matter of how the good man responded to that world, but of how it responded to him. Devising a series of scandalous scenes, he would ""examine each character's emotions and record what each would do in response to Myshkin and to the other characters."" The difficulty with this approach was that he himself did not know in advance how the characters were going to respond, and thus he was unable to pre-plan the plot or structure of the novel. 

These facts are coming to me only after I finished the book, and was naturally quite bewildered with the flow of the text and the whole clutter and confusion visible in the narration itself.

While there is this much to criticize, it is also very truly close to Dostoyevsky. He shares his epileptic traits with Prince Myshkin and also made the Prince, at one point, recount a story of how a man was sentenced to death only to be pardoned at the last moment— something Dostoyevsky has experienced himself.

So yes, while there are its bad bits, I guess keeping these facts in mind before starting to read it will make it a better experience. For their benefit, I've kept the spoilers to a minimum.

jkruc6,"""The Idiot"" is truly masterpiece","Absolutely amazing. I'm still just appalled by this book in so many ways. Without spoiling, it really is more or less just a soap opera but written in the most intriguing ways possible and the characters are just wild. I found myself loving my own discoveries of what I picked up on about human behavior about this book, but then I'm also questioning the originality of my own thoughts because I'm just picking up what's being written down and how I, myself, fit within society as a original or ordinary man. Anyway, it's just fascinating to think about. My mind is just racing from Dostoevski's brilliance.

Prince Myshkin is an absolutely adorable character and I love the social/religious commentary about a perfectly ideal entity personified in modern society (even though its nearly two centuries old and still SO RELEVANT). 

It's also fascinating as he is referred to as one of the original ""Conservatives"" and to read into the political climate of 1860's Russia is so interesting to me and what conservative means then vs now.

highly recommend if you haven't read. Also when learning about Dostoevki's life, it makes the book very interesting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jkruc6/the_idiot_is_truly_masterpiece/,2020-10-30T06:40:51Z,6,34,books,The Idiot,POST
281zzv,Just finished The Idiot. Discussion wanted!,"I just finished reading The Idiot by Dostoevsky and I have no one to talk to about it so I come to you reddit. I have yet to form an opinion of it as I am still mulling through the emotions and ideas the book has stirred in me. 

I'm interested in talking about absolutely anything regarding the book, but to start things off I'll just list a couple of things that have me the most interested:

Why do Aglaya and Nastassya fall in love with Myshkin? It seems totally unrealistic. Myshkin seems like the sort of man that could capture no woman's heart and yet he gains 2 of the most beautiful women, within his circle, hearts to an unfathomable extent. 

The egoism of the society/mankind vs the complete sincerity in Myshkin. I don't have a specific question for this one, but I just wanted to talk about this topic in general.

Was Myshkin autistic? I personally think, in addition to being prone to seizures, Myshkin would best be described as someone with Aspergers. While this may damage the spiritual message of the novel, do you think this is a fair assessment?

So those are just some things I've been thinking about. I'm interested in what the rest of you think about the novel.

162t5t7,"Just finished Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I'm wondering what to take away from it and keep with me?","I've only just started really reading in the past 2 years or so... I read Crime and Punishment, then Brothers Karamazov, then Les Misérables, started War and Peace (after 300 pages I just gave up, I enjoyed some of the characters but it just was not an enjoyable read for me) and then I wasn't really sure where to go. 

&#x200B;

At the time in my personal life, I was dealing with an incredible amount of stress from my work. I am not an easily stressed person but this work environment was the worst I've ever seen in my life (and I've been mortared). 

&#x200B;

I just wanted to help people and get the job done, but I constantly found myself in horribly toxic situations. Someone actually once threatened to beat the shit out of me because he didn't like a decision my boss made. I always tried to be open and honest (if I messed something up for instance, I'd own up to it) but I realized it only helped everyone else point their fingers at me and blame me for more problems, especially ones I did not cause. One individual seemed to lie to me every day because he thought I'd get mad if what he told me was bad (it took me months to realize, I thought I was losing my mind because I kept trusting him at his word) .I tried to look past it and give people credit, but they only ended up taking even more advantage of me. More work was given to me, I was asked to stay late more often to get things done because ""others couldn't be trusted to get it done"".

&#x200B;

It had a horrible impact on my health. I started experiencing chest pains, my blood pressure kept rising, I was even having stress-nightmares. I started therapy for the first time in my life.

&#x200B;

So, finally I quit.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the huge digression, but it was pertinent to my decision making in my next book to read. I wanted to go back to Dostoevsky and after reading the description for The Idiot, although admittedly I am not nearly as magnanimous and intelligent as him, I related so much to Prince Myshkin.

&#x200B;

I know it's not my story, and it's not about me, but I secretly had hoped to come away from this book with tools to use to help me deal with such an irrational world. Should I simply heed the warning that going down the path of the Prince Myshkins and the Jean ValJeans  will end in a life of torment?

ihgb4z,Finished reading The Idiot by Dostoevsky 3 days ago and wtf,"I have read crime and punishment, brothers karamazov, notes from underground and now finished The Idiot but I don't understand it completely. 

First of all the tragic end in such less pages makes me wonder why would Dostoevsky would that. In middle part some pages felt like drag like the Ippolit suicide speech. The last 50 pages have more drama and development than the middle 100-150. I don't understand why would Dostoevsky would do that. The brothers Karamazov jumped like this too but it's ending was still much more detailed than this. 

It felt like had my heart stabbed when I realised Nastasya was killed. Why didn't Prince wanted her to be taken away after she was dead? I still don't understand what Dostoevsky was trying to say clearly. For me it's just a tragic end of a pure hearted man. Was Dostoevsky trying to say a pure hearted man like an idiot will not be able to survive in the modern world?

7piolr,Having difficulty with The Idiot,"Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I've ever read.  The fever and claustrophobia and paranoia experienced by the protagonist was palpable and exciting.  I read Brothers Karamazov previously and enjoyed it for its depth and density.  However, The Idiot is so dialogue heavy that it's nearly impossible for me to maintain focus.  I'm often finding the conversations confusing and tedious instead of thought provoking.  I'm around page 200, it's a struggle, makes War and Peace read like an action novel but I really want to enjoy it.

The conversations are endless circles, with out ever really getting to a point, and there are amazing gaps of 'time' and relevance. 

If anybody by chance has read this book, I would love to discuss their views on it. I feel like I'm missing something (as though I am the idiot). And, I fear the ending won't clarify it. I'm 110 pages away from the end; and I fear it will draw no conclusions, or even clarify anything that has happened.

lxqx7o,What's with the gatekeeping surrounding audiobooks?,"As I am writing this, the top post on the sub is someone sharing about their experience listening to World War Z on audiobook. They mention that they ""read"" the book, and there are a *lot* of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn't ""read"" the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to ""read"" a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn't that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.

There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they've read, then they need to read more books. There's no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.

Stop gatekeeping ""reading"" or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as ""reading"" does not harm you in anyway.

EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn't matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That's really all that matters.

bzhglv,"I just finished Dostoevski ""The idiot"" and need to vent","I first read Dostoevski a year ago with Brothers Karamazov and it still is my favorite work of literature, out of the other 8 books I read written by the author, the Idiot was the one that I felt being the most similar to brothers K. with a huge pull of absolutelly interesting characters that are so different from each other that you can feel the disonance alive every time they interact, while inevitably laughting at how everything is presented.  I laughted out loud ALOT during this book, maybe the most I had ever with Dostoevski, excluding the Gambler.

&#x200B;

  I think the most memorable scene is the one in Nastascia Fillipóvna's Birthday, relatively early in the book. So many things happened there, a very stupid game of ""Let's all tell the most shamefull thing each one of the people did. Of course people went the opposite way, using it as an opportunity to humble brag. Than it was the tensions escalating, Rogogin coming in, Nastacia going wild, the Prince proposing to her and Nastascia's ultimatum to Gania : We all know how rotten your soul is, you would sell your mother for a few rubles - Than she throws 100.000 rubles in the fire ( 33 times more than the 3000 rubles in brothers K. mind you ) and tells Gania - If you go inside the fire and save the money, it's all yours.  His pride wins the fight against his nature and he doesn't save the money, but at a great price - He actually passes out and his personality changes forever.

&#x200B;

  Honestly, that is maybe the MOST MEMORABLE SCENE I ever read in any piece of literature ( it is still fresh in my mind so I wont speak in absolutes )

&#x200B;

  But I'm here to talk about the ending. The nauseous morbid thing that was made into the last chapter. It wasn't just the murder, but the way it was presented, the way all others senses were amplificated when we see the body.

&#x200B;

  Today was an really good way above avarage day to me but after reading those last pages I felt - and got myself sick. I started crying when I was driving home, not because of a sad ending, I felt I was getting back from a funeral, burying a loved one.

91o479,Just finished The Idiot by Dostoevsky (Spoilers),"The Brothers Karamazov is one of my favorite books of all time and I got hooked onto this book after a 100 pages or so when the personality of the prince started being established.  I just finished it and the ending has left me feeling bummed out so I'd like to talk about it.

Dostoevsky makes every character seem so human because even though they're unpredictable and volatile, you end up understanding their thoughts through their long animated speeches. Also every conversation feels so intimate, to the point that I get really caught up in the relationships of the world. I could understand the Prince's ideals, they were a child's ideals of not letting anyone suffer and complete trust in the world to behave the same way towards him. I read through a bunch of older reaction posts and read that Dostoevsky was intentionally trying to write about a 'pure' person in a modern/self-centered world.

The first half of the book had me so optimistic for the prince but the second half throws a lot of suffering at him. There a bunch of philosophical ideas and intense scenes that are thrown around that just add to making the characters seem so human. So many scenes felt unpleasant but did not feel like they were there for shock, like the scene where the kid who's going to die from disease soon tells people why he hates the world so much (basically his suicide note) and expects them to understand or acknowledge him, and when they don't and disapprove, he tries to commit suicide in front of them for mocking his suicide note, he then fails which leads to them mocking him even more. Like this, the scenes at the end were pretty unpleasant but in a tear your heart out sorta way. The scene with all the nobles over at the Yepanchin house had me cringing so hard. People's dialogues carry a lot emotion throughout the book since they seem genuine but are also so messy.

I didn't expect this because the ending of The Brothers Karamazov felt pretty hopeful. This book demolishes hope. The protagonist really was an absolute idiot towards the end but I guess that's the point of the book.

Edit:  My interpretation of the book is that towards the end, the title ""Idiot"" for the prince stops being ironical since he clings to his idealistic values that do not exist in the real world after REPEATED observations that the people around him do not relate with those values. That's what DOES make him an idiot at the end. He's an idiot in the sense that he CHOOSES to be ignorant to the flaws of people.

cc672,I need to diversify my reading. I'm looking for a list of books to catch up to the level of someone who can talk about literature and not feel like an idiot.,"I am a huge geek, but I have recently come to realise that I cannot talk to people about literature or films, because I focus my attention on tiny portions of each.

Can someone point me towards a list of great books, which will give me a valuable experience? By that I mean, I don't like reading books for the sake of reading them. Many people I know go on and on about how they love X Y and Z, but that means they have watched or read it once just so they can say they have. I want to be one of those people who talks about books and films in an honest and intelligent way.

I don't want to fight with the language or have to go and read explanations after the fact. I just want to read some damn good classics. I hate having the choice between looking like an uneducated moron and being a charlatan. 

It might be worth mentioning that I didn't attend any school where reading was encouraged, and my family think reading is for fags. I have honestly never read books that many of you would consider school assignment classics. I have escaped through shit pipe and now find myself surrounded by well-read and intelligent people for the first time in my life. I thought it would be great until I realised that all through my life I have been taught how to be a lazy, lying son of a bitch. I literally have nothing to offer in conversation, unless it is about a handful of book or films.

TL;DR I was brought up a charlatan and now I want to actually read the books I was told to claim I had read.

[edit] **Thank you all! I am keeping a list of all these recommendations and I will try to get to them all at some point. There are enough books listed here to last me years! Thanks for not (all) mocking me.**

s81qex,"My dad wants to strip the entire fiction genre from school libraries because fiction is ""nonsense""","My dad doesn't believe that fiction has any value (period.). It's not just that he prefers non-fiction-- he gets mad at Greek mythology because it is ""full of nonsense creatures not based on biology."" He dislikes the Orient Express because none of the events actually happened.

And it's not just novels: he hates anything written which is not firmly grounded in reality (Just for example: refused to finish reading the satire ""A Modest Proposal"" because it's ""nonsense"" and ""could never work in real life""). Like, I'm sure the guy would hate the Declaration of Independence if he wasn't such a die-hard patriot.

He also doesn't recognize writing as a valid art form. He doesn't think it takes any particular skill, that authors only have to ""talk out of their ass,"" make the prose flowery and unnecessarily complicated (I tried to explain what imagery was to him once, and he cited the entire technique as emblematic of poor, cheap writing). Specifically, he compared it to scientific writing, which is entirely precise and unadorned. This bit ticks me off in particular since writing is a passion of mine.

The only book he's ever liked was Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"" he read when he was 8.

And now he thinks schools should pull everything but nonfiction off of the shelves. He's worried that fiction makes kids more prone to misinformation and more likely to become flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers, etc.

How would you explain that that's not the case? That almost NONE of this is the case???

edit: he likes music and art too. It's not a vendetta against entertainment-- just THIS specific form of entertainment.

edit: he's also not religious at all, i dont know where people are getting that from. like, he actually has some kind of grudge against every god and main religious text of every culture

8sm530,Interpretation of The Idiot by Dostoevsky (Spoilers),"I recently finished The Idiot. I've looked at some reviews on Goodreads to compare my take on the book to others, and I feel like I've interpreted the book differently than the reviews I've read. Throughout the novel, Dostoevsky often uses humor (General Ivolgin's Napoleon story for example) and melodrama (the birthday party scene, most of the plot actually). The plot to the novel of written out bare bones is pretty ridiculous. There's multiple scenes with people in a room yelling at one another like an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Characters burst out laughing out of nowhere. The group openly mocks Hippolite after his ""Essential Statement"". 

I interpreted the book as being, at least in part, a satire of Russian society and in part melodrama. The characters sometimes seemed like caricatures acting ridiculously. Dostoevsky even admits at the beginning of Part 3 or 4 that he plays up characteristics because writing about average people is boring. There were obvious attempts at humor, often through Lebedev (how he repeatedly calls himself vile then repeatedly acts in the same underhanded manner and the wooden leg story) and General Ivolgin. Yet when I read the reviews, most people seem to interpret the book as being completely serious. There's no mention of the humor, melodrama, or caricatures. I wonder if I read the same book. Am I wrong in seeing humor and satire in the novel?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8sm530/interpretation_of_the_idiot_by_dostoevsky_spoilers/,2018-06-20T21:25:10Z,2,5,books,The Idiot,POST

av9fvx,I just read “The Sirens of Titan” by Kurt Vonnegut.,"Both of my parents were writers. As a rebellion, I often deliberately avoided books they would recommend. That turned out to be idiotic, because they have impeccable taste.

I just finished the book, not 5 minutes ago-

and I sobbed.

The language, the flow, the cadence, the characters. This book enveloped me within the first 3 pages. The journey of Malachi Constant, from shitty, rich playboy, to Martian slave, to disgraced Earth monster, to Titanic nomad, to salvation seeking earthling once again.

It’s all nothing.

I never believed I could be moved by something so nihilistic and bleak. But this shook me to the core. Life is random. Life is an accident.

Read this book. Please.


Edit: A lot if you were asking about some other recommendations from my parents. Here are some my favorites off the top of my head:

Winter’s Tale - Mark Helprin     
Rebecca - Daphne Du Maurier    
The Second Coming - Walker Percy    
Cry, the Beloved Country - Alan Paton    
Telegraph Avenue - Michael Chabon    
Lincoln In The Bardo - George Saunders    
100 Years of Solitude - Gabriel Garcia Marquez    
A Tale for the Time Being - Ruth Ozeki    
The Exorcist - William Peter Blatty    
Naked Lunch - William S. Bourroughs    
The Sellout - Paul Beatty    
The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Haruki Murakami    

There are a million more, but these ones were all given to me by them over the years and became some of my favorites. Once I stopped being a dickhead and actually read them.

*""Heh, heh, heh! The last in her line. Heh, heh! What a way to put it,"" the clerk tittered.*

*The swarthy man also smiled. The blond man was slightly surprised that he had managed to make a pun, though a rather bad one.*

1ak0jnl,"I feel a lot of 19th century Russian novels poke fun at the ""Intellectual""","This is ironic, because at first glance, when people hear about the ""Russian Novel"" they get intimidated and think it's an intellectual chore. 
After reading Anna K, Brothers K, Crime and Punishment and the Idiot they all play to the fact that ""intellectuals"" really just like to hear the sound of their own voice and pull mental gymnastics in conversation just show off their mental prowess. 
For example, in Anna K, the conversation between Vronsky, Anna, Golenishchev and the artish Mikhailov does exactly this. Mikhailov is showing off his painting and knew the rich elite know nothing about art and will just critique his painting just to show off, which is exactly what happened.
I just love the awareness and it really makes me less intimidated of people I feel may be intellectually superior.

On the contrary, I actually feel like the 19th  and early 20th century English novel lacks awareness completely and puts the ""intellectuals"" on a pedestal and is highbrow for the sake of being highbrow.

o7iht5,I just read The Alchemist...,"and I'm livid. I can't even express in words how much I hated that baby's-first-philosophy BS. Why does everyone love this book so much? Can somebody please explain to me what I was supposed to get out of this experience? Am I just too stupid to ""get it?"" It's so... basic. So surface level. What's there to get?

Edit: Wow. I didn't know I was hopping on a well-ridden hate train when I posted this but I'm blown away by the responses. Thank y'all so much for the awards and thank y'all for the conversation. I really did take everything that was said into account. We don't have to agree but I very much appreciate those of y'all who provided genuine insight. I think the main issue is this. I always heard about this book from adults who presented it as a life-affirming lesson in philosophy. I've always seen it marketed to adults, so I decided to give it a shot and form my own opinion. I didn't know what it was about going in or that it was written as a fable. That being said, I believe that children are capable of handling pretty heavy subject matter without it being dumbed down to the level this book went. I learned that a lot of y'all came upon this book during a transformative period in your lives and it resonated with many of you. Some of y'all said it motivated your love for reading. I think that's fantastic. Don't think that my absolute disdain for The Alchemist means I don't believe it meant something to you. I just personally hated it. Sorry if I don't get to all of you individually, but I'll try. And to the ppl who decided I was a snob or an idiot because I didn't like the same book as you...I mean, my opinion remains my opinion. I hated the way this book was written and the repetitive nature of its message. It is what it is. I'm am glad it's not just me who was super annoyed by this book. Maybe I'll revisit it later, as many have suggested, and it will strike a chord with me. Or, at least, it won't fill me with rage at the annoying superficiality of it all. Keep reading, guys!

bdq8uv,i love crime and punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. can't seem get into The Idiot. (Spoilers for Both),"The idiot seems really stale plot wise compared to C&P. I think the characters are still good, but story wise, nothing really substantial really is happening. Nothing happen really pertains to main character prince myshkin, just random events the main character stumble and involved with , and with the end of part 1 of the book, there is barely attachment from the main character. We get 2 days of events happening, then BOOM 6 months timeskip with just a chapter explaining whatever happened in between.

Crime and punishment sucked me right in. From the first chapter, wondering what crime is brewed, the act of the crime and all the psychological warfare and turmoil happened in the novel. It had substance, it had events affecting alot of people that is integral to the main character's life happening and unfolding with each pages.

While in the idiot most of the important thing happened in off-page or trough retelling.

9gbf1v,ITT Name the beloved character (or characters) in world literature that you secretly hate!,"For me, it's Bertie Wooster, beloved upper-class chump from the Forever England 1930s. It's not that he's an idiot, it's because he's *not* an idiot. Here's a man who quotes Shakespeare, Kant and Spinoza in his interior dialogue, can instantly sum up the character of other people and can devise complicated art heists, and yet in action he's a blithering idiot. (Seriously, Kingsley Amis said there was no connection between Wooster the narrator and Wooster the character). The babbling idiot drives me nuts with frustrations, I just want to shake the weak-chinned boob. If you want a version of perfect Wooster-type Character/Narrator integration, try Dorothy L. Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey.

662g5n,What is the difference between a 'Ship of Fools' and an 'Idiot Plot'?,"About two summers ago I was reading a rather lengthy book about a small agricultural town in the northeast that was beset by an unusual meteorological phenomenon.  As I read along, I was astounded by the fact that this little community could not have survived for as long as it had without having to deal with something like snowed-over roads, or drought, or another issue that comes as a result of being more isolated from infrastructure compared to an urban area.  And yet the characters consistently made one bad choice after another and only further deteriorated their living conditions.  (You're welcome to guess the title, but I've excluded it on purpose)

I wrote an email to my writing mentor at the time and he explained that this was a 'ship of fools' story.  Things are intended to get continuously worse in order to further the underlying allegory about the dangers of mixing ambition with ignorance.  What, then, is the difference between a Ship of Fools and an Idiot Plot?

auushr,"Jim Mullen's ""It Takes A Village Idiot"" enraptured me over the weekend","Allow me to lay the scene. 

My friends and I had planned a weekend getaway to upstate NY for the last two months. We'd rented the house, and had taken the required days off of work. We arrived late Friday night and after a long day of driving and preparing, we immediately set to bed.

Saturday arose, and with it, a subconscious need to take advantage of our time here, to ensure we didn't waste all our long evenings of planning. We hiked, we explored, we traveled the city and the sights it had to offer. Afternoon arrived and our group of five split. 

Three decided to head to a shop they had noticed, mayhaps a bric-a-brac may be found that would resurrect memories of the present day, in the future. Two, with me being one, retired back to the house for some well-needed rest. We arrived, the resident dog awaited us with wagging tail, and the wooden stove was quickly lit. A picture perfect weekend scene.

I noticed a small book on the coffee table with an enticing title. With a little light reading on my mind, I opened it and begin the adventure. Unwittingly I was drawn into a parallel universe with terrifying similarities to the journey we had taken ourselves. I had to look up when the book was written to ensure we hadn't written it ourselves. It was published in 2002.

Nearly twenty years have passed since Jim Mullen wrote ""It Takes A Village Idiot: A Memoir of Life after the City"" and nearly nothing has changed. His depictions of life in NYC as a successful columnist enjoying every facet of the Big Apple, the abrasive attitude that permeates the city, the bleakness of the roads to the Appalachia of New York, and nearly every facet was masterfully written and woven into a comedic manner that had me laughing out loud to the point of embarrassment.

There were passages that I had simply no choice but to read aloud to my friend, sharing with him the experience that I knew he would revel in, as there is simply nothing better than realizing you are part of a select few who have first-hand knowledge of what an artist produces. 

The fire crackled, the dog lay peacefully, the sun slowly set, and the silence was broken by the rustling of pages and the occasional burst of words read aloud to a drowsy yet attentive audience. It was indeed, bliss.

Shortly thereafter, from outside, we heard the unmistakable sound of tires, followed by slamming doors, shuffling shoes, and rustling jackets. Our comrades had returned, presumably empty handed as there was a distinct lack of glass clinking. Bric-a-bracs are always made of glass, it is not on me to question why, they simply are. 

Once the excitement had waned, we had caught up on our respective adventures, we sat for dinner. The group, satisfyingly stuffed, ended up in the living room again, as the comfort of the wooden stove tantalized us and left no choice but to be drawn to it. Two lay on the couch, two on the loveseat, one lay on the rug. The home's collection was explored and a CD was produced for ambient music. The speaker was loaded and soft jazz began to fill the room.

As we settled into a comfortable silence, I once again delved into the world Mullen wove and was soon enraptured but this time, I had a full house to share with. As I would find passages that I knew my friends would enjoy, I would simply read them out loud. The depictions of the roads that led to upstate NY, the rusting and decaying equipment on the side of the road, even the people themselves. We had experienced everything he wrote about ourselves.

At some point, the absurdity of it all struck me. Here we are, a group of college students, between 21 and 22, all with standard social skills, fairly outgoing individuals in a town that has two decent sized colleges on a Saturday night, and we are around a fire, listening to a book being read. And I wouldn't change it for the world.

Alas, as all good things do, I finished the book the next morning and fittingly enough, it was then time to leave. As we backed out of the driveway in our baggage laden vehicles, I realized one thing. I am incredibly, incredibly lucky. Referencing a quote from ""The Office,"" I was blessed enough to know that I had experienced one of ""The good old days"" while it happened. This is a memory of mine that will live on forever, and this book will be treasured by me for as long as I live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/auushr/jim_mullens_it_takes_a_village_idiot_enraptured/,2019-02-26T04:06:04Z,1,9,books,The Idiot,POST

4u5tlt,"Yikes, The Idiot...Not sure if I should keep reading","I've read the first third of this book. Now, when it started, I loved it. When the Prince was sitting around talking to Liza and the daughters I loved every moment of that, too. I couldn't put it down. There were beautiful, human moments in those stories that Myshkin told. I even cried!

 Then after that the book became a glorified soap opera...Nastassya should marry this man, but no, she should really marry this man, and these people are swindlers so don't take their money and this man doesn't care about you either!

And then that went on for a good one hundred pages and for some reason the Prince loved her and she said yes then she said no? And then he left and book one ended. 

I like the amount of characters. Coming off of East of Eden, I'm really into a large cast of characters interacting with each other. I'm just not liking the content of the interactions and I find myself forcing my way through the chapters...

I can see myself liking Dostoevsky if it was less soap opera and more philosophy/actual love/romance. I'm a sucker for love and romance in my stories - any time Bukowski interacts with a lover I can't put him down - but that hasn't happened in this book.

I just...I don't know. I think I might have to put it down. I hear Brothers and Crime and Punishment are better books of his and I want to give those a shot. Any ideas?

**Final edit: A blessed soul from 7-11 found it and it is back in my hands (I did a much longer post but wanted to reach all the people who've been agonizing with me)
Thank you all for the positive thinking and creative suggestions (and normalizing my dumb ass somehow losing something I hold for 12 hours a day)**

24 hours of searching. I've ripped the house apart, offered my teen a cash bounty, and now I'm begging for inspiration online. 

Full disclosure: I'm an idiot and I read while I walk around the house. I've been known to leave things in the fridge or balanced on top of the cans in the cupboard. It could be anywhere, and that place is probably the stupidest place a thing could possibly be. 

FWIW, the garbage and recycling haven't gone out, the couch and bedframe have been checked. I just rifled the deep freeze and checked the washing machine and dishwasher, and lifted all the rugs. My kid isn't messing with me, he desperately wants the cash reward.

Anybody have an idea before I collapse in disgust and read my kid's copy of Divergent?


Edit: thank you, everyone! I've been running around looking wherever each commenter has suggested. No luck thus far. Time to get stoned and take a break and then back to the hunt

**SECOND EDIT: Okay, I've removed the seats and spare tire in the car, taken apart the beds and couches, lifted the rugs, checked inside every appliance (I emptied botj deep freezes), gone through all the laundry, checked on top of everything. I've crawled the house with a high-powered flashlight and walked around on top of all the furniture to check the tops of things.

nc8wfc,"Books have target audiences too! If you read a YA book for teenagers and hate it it's not because the book is bad, it's because it's not meant for you (Eragon, Divergent, Artemis Fowl, etc.)","As a book lover I've lurked this sub for awhile now and people really should check what age group the book was written for before reading them or making posts about how bad they are. Eragon, Cirque De Freak, Artimis Fowl, Divergent, Twilight, the list goes on and on. These books are meant for Young Adults and Teenagers. It's not a surprised if you read them at 27 and realize how bad they are.

They aren't bad books, they're just not books for you. It's okay to admit that and move on. Books have demographics just as much as TV and movies. An adult doesn't go to see the Wiggles and expect to have a good time (although they are surprisingly enjoyable) or critique their children's Saturday cartoons or their teenager's cringe  werewolf romance drama show for being simplistic and predicable. It's great to them because it's for them. It's crap to you because you're never expected to watch it anyway. That's okay. There's really no need to tear those things apart in a reddit post.

Obviously there will be some adults who will still love YA books, shows, and movies. If that's you, please keep recommending them to people. It's not your fault if someone neglects to notice the YA or TV14 tag and ends up hating it.

Edit: I'm not saying ""you're not the target audience"" is an end all excuse so you can never say something is bad. Some books are indesputably bad. I believe that if you hold an opinion that contradicts what is widely accepted as true, then it's probably more about your personal preference than something being inherently bad. For instance, I hate Avengers movies and think they are full of crudely written dialogue and oversized casts where no character actually matters. Obviously the world disagrees with that opinion. I'm willing to look at that and say that Avengers isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't suit my preference. Try to look at books the same way. Even though something like Twilight can be torn to shreds for the author's poor writing, it is beloved and treasured by such a large audience it's obvious there was something there that made it great but didn't suit my taste so saying it's a bad book is simply not true. Pointing out flaws and saying something is bad are two different things.


Edit 2: The comments are pretty fun you should check them out. Admittedly most of them say I'm wrong and an idiot lol. But the others are filled with people saying a book is horrible and then others saying the same book is great. The only constant is that Divergent and Eragon seem to be hated by almost everyone, it's like a 9/1 ratio. Artemis Fowl is nearly 50/50 which is cool.

bwo53s,The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is a masterpiece in espionage fiction and a must read,"Spy fiction is usually filled driven by action and focused on the gadgets of espionage. But in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, LeCarre focused on the human aspect, on how men manipulated each other and schemed to get what they want. 

There is no action, no fights (besides a very small segment around the middle), no tech, no gadgets. Yet the book was able to create a brilliantly gripping tale, filled with deception and suspense. The reader is constantly kept on his toes, while the narration seems authorative, but the more you read, the less you actually know. 

Most interestingly, I found the conclusion of the book refreshing. The hero didn't walk out triumphant, and the ""good guys"" in the great game all ended up in a shitty situation. The protagonist who sacrificed much of his life in devotion to the plan didn't get his happily ever after, the antagonist, a diligent Jewish man devoted to his cause ended up terribly. The racist Nazi turncoat sellout was the one who ended up the best at the end.

Never, anywhere in the book did it become preachy, did it push an ideology. It doesn't matter what you believe, it doesn't matter what ideology you hold, success is how well you play the game.

mkhpex,"Two years after reading it, I found out that Children of the Arbat was the first in a trilogy. Am I an idiot for not realizing this before?","I have read this book twice now and loved every moment of it, yet it never occurred to me that there was more to the story that needed writing. I honestly thought it was a story that ended with implications and it was ultimately up to the reader to make up their own minds about the future of each character. It still felt complete to me, I thought that each character was well on their way down their respective arcs and that leaving the rest up to imagination was actually pretty nifty.

Since it takes place in 1930's Russia, obviously there's no implications regarding the setting. The reader knows *exactly* which direction that is going, but that's part of what made it so easy to wonder at the fate of each character. 

Just to be clear, I'm not knocking the sequel before reading it. I actually feel like Christmas has come early for me. Children of the Arbat had such a strong effect on me when I first read it, parts of it nearly had me in tears. The unsettling atmosphere of pre-purge Soviet Russia and the Stalin POVs had me in a state of suspense the entire time.  I'm going to absolutely devour this next one.

Someone who tries to learn new things but never fully understands what he’s learning simply because he thinks he’s capable. I always loved the figurative smack in the face he gets from different people he meets when they tell it to him that he’s being an idiot not taking his time to understand something entirely.

t62de9,"[Spoilers] I read Stephen King's unabridged version of ""The Stand"" and I'm so frustrated with the ending. Is that the point though?","I jumped into this book with no expectations. I had no clue what it was even about, but I was pulled into it easily and I was really enjoying the buildup, which often drags in Stephen King novels.

Imagine my surprise when we're thrown an entirely new supernatural angle halfway through the book. There's a brand new major antagonist. I feel like there were some established expectations about the world that were just ripped out from under me. I went from enjoying the terrifying and plausible concept of a Super Flu to rolling my eyes and continuing the story because I hoped there was a saving grace, because I had already invested so much time into this book. I just didn't sign up for a silly Americanized Holy War. Possibly the worst part is that the antagonist ends up with a smaller body count than the supposed good God who sends 3 men who decide to trust him and his ""mysterious ways"" to their deaths in the most idiotic and pointless way imaginable along with the thousands of other people in the community.

The men could have started an uprising, they could have all died as long as that ridiculous journey hadn't all been for naught. Trash was gonna bring that nuke no matter what and00 you're telling me that they ""had"" to be put on trial to get one guy to stand up. That one guy ""had"" to have his mouth burned closed in order for the nuke to be set off?


What a load of garbage.

zvr666,The simple greatness of Agatha Christie,"Agatha Christie's novels feel so cozy, like hanging out with a friend while they solve a dilemma. I can rely on Christie to give me a mystery where all the pieces are there, you just have to pay enough attention to the details of people’s personalities to put them all together. She also writes entertaining characters to interact with her detectives. And she can still keep you guessing! The path to the inevitable conclusion is always just as fun and entertaining as finally getting to solve the mystery at the end. 

From a remote island to a snow-stalled train car, she favored locations isolated from society. By restricting the scope of her stories, Christie limited possible suspects and built tension by forcing characters to stay put— even with a killer among them. 

Sometimes she further heightened the drama by making the characters strangers, unsure of who they can trust. But while her settings are eerie and extraordinary, her characters are just the opposite. 

One of the biggest criticisms of Christie’s novels is that they’re full of two-dimensional people. But Christie avoided complex characters for a reason. By reducing people to a handful of simple traits, she provided readers with predictable suspects. Well, usually predictable. Christie also used the audience's expectations against them. 

However, this typecasting sometimes relied on what contemporary readers know to be harmful stereotypes. She frequently caricatured particular occupations and ethnic groups for comic effect, reinforcing the prejudices of her time. 

This is certainly not an element of Christie’s work worth emulating, and fortunately, many modern mystery writers have found less problematic ways to use this technique. Even when she got it wrong, Christie worked to make her characters feel authentic. 

She closely observed the people around her and constantly scribbled down details from overheard conversations. She would then rearrange these details to piece her mysteries together, often switching who the murderer was as she worked. This approach kept information murky and disoriented even to the sharpest readers. 

However, there’s an important balance to strike between being clever and being confusing. Nobody wants to read a predictable mystery, but if things get too convoluted you can lose your reader altogether. Christie handled this in part by keeping her language simple and accessible. She used short sentences and clear, snappy dialogue to help readers follow the information. This kind of clarity is essential because the best mysteries string their audience along with a carefully laid trail of clues. 

When a character cries that “Everything tastes foul today,” just minutes before he dies, the reader races to determine who poisoned his beverage. But they’re likely failing to truly consider this clue. If everything tasted foul that day, then he’d been poisoned long before that drink. 

Christie also used clues to intentionally mislead her audience. For example, readers might recognize a clue associated with one suspect, only to learn that it was being used to frame them. Other times, she built misdirection directly into the story’s structure— like when a narrator reporting the murder is revealed to be the killer. 

Outside crime and clues, there’s one more ingredient in Christie’s formula: the detective. Christie created many sleuths, but her most enduring are Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Neither this petit Belgian refugee nor this elderly amateur detective is a traditional hero. But their outsider status is exactly what helps them slip past security and make suspects let their guard down. 

With Christie, a good clue is one the reader will remember, but usually, fail to completely understand that is what I think made her one of the greatest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zvr666/the_simple_greatness_of_agatha_christie/,2022-12-26T16:49:57Z,143,1459,books,The Idiot,POST

mrfgx3,I've finally finished Dostoyevsky's 4 great works. I'm can't even find the words right now to describe how I feel.,"(Edit: lol at the title)

TL:DR I feel both good, and almost empty. I think it might be a little bit before I encounter another author like him.

After 2 long years, I've finally read **The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot**, and **The Possessed**, in that order. I finished the Possessed just last night.

Dostoyevsky is such a writer.

I don't even know what I should say! He's probably my favorite author in the world right now! He's the funniest author I've ever read, he brings to vision the most horrific things, his tragedies and redemptions are golden, his villains are flesh and blood, and his plots are a fascinating connection of ethical, political, and theological rants glued together with the most insane characters you can imagine.

Every one of his books are written in such a way where you have absolutely no idea where the story will go one page from the next. In the span of a few sentences, a nihilistic rant might ensue, some joker might get into a jam, the narrator(who either does, or does not exist) may divulge in a sardonic backstory for a character that shows up once, somebody might die, a love quadrangle will be established, a nefarious event may be ambiguously alluded to, somebody will have a mental breakdown, a villain will provide a logical point of view to his actions... it's unlike any author I've read before.

The Idiot was his funniest and strangest book.

The Possessed was his deepest and most tragic book.

Crime and Punishment is his most focused and narrative story.

And Brothers Karamazov is his well deserved magnum opus.

He doesn't just write books with a sole plot or theme, he is an author of humanity.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel, and what's more, it missing the point was perhaps inevitable given how his brand of stylization interplayed with the source material's plot, setting, and themes.

To put it bluntly, Luhrmann's adaptation simply made the Jazz Age look *too damn cool*. The story is about how empty and vapid the lifestyle of the upper class in that era was, with Fitzgerald writing from experience on the subject, but the movie was all about the cool parties, the vintage luxury, and the romance. It's like doing a Bret Easton Ellis adaptation that makes yuppies into role models of monied '80s coolness.

So that got me thinking. If you told the basic story of *The Great Gatsby*, but stripped out the 1920s period setting and moved it to the present day, you'd probably get exactly the tone that Fitzgerald was originally going for, but which is often lost on modern readers thanks to decades of nostalgia, glamour, and romanticism for the Roaring Twenties coloring their perspective.

Ironically, it would not be a dissimilar move to Luhrmann's adaptation of *Romeo & Juliet*.

I'm specifically thinking of having Jay Gatsby as a warped parody of Jake and/or Logan Paul, a social media star from humble beginnings who now presents himself as a baller to his millions of followers and livestreams massive parties from his West Egg mansion. Daisy Fay likewise is updated into a parody of Addison Rae (right down to the name) or Lele Pons, a brainless beauty who's more often than not clad in either a swimsuit or workout wear and always has her phone by her side ready to take the perfect selfie. Instead of the Jazz Age, the story takes place against the backdrop of modern (late 2010s/early 2020s) ""influencer"" culture. The characters drive Teslas instead of Duesenbergs, and debate Jordan Peterson's *12 Rules for Life* instead of Madison Grant's *The Passing of the Great Race*. At least one of Jay's parties could even be 1920s-themed, as a direct nod to the source material.

And change *absolutely nothing else* about the plot and characters. Jay still feels empty inside, holding his famous parties more out of social obligation than because he actually enjoys them. His worldview is still a perversion of the American Dream, obsessed with getting rich quick for the sake of having money and status to flaunt. He probably made at least some of his money through shady means; back in the 1920s it would've been bootlegging, in the 2020s it may well be a crypto scam and/or an MLM. His ""outsider"" background as a kid from North Dakota made good who feels that he needs to prove himself would barely have to be changed, except insofar as now there's less emphasis on him being the son of immigrants and more on him being from red-state ""flyover country"". (Alternatively, you could still have him be an insecure immigrant's son, albeit named Javier Gomez instead of James Gatz.) Daisy is still a materialistic airhead who lives in the moment, and the fact that Jay is still obsessed with her after all these years, in ways that border on stalking, indicates that he too is a shallow idiot pursuing only surface-level markers of success. The narrator and viewpoint character Nick Carraway is still Daisy's cousin and an outsider to this world of beauty, money, and excess who readily sees through the artifice and recognizes it for what it is.

Yes, I know my idea sounds like heresy. But personally, I've thought for a while that this may just be the best way to do a film or TV adaptation of *The Great Gatsby* that captures exactly what Fitzgerald thought of the socialites and upper-class lifestyle of his era, without simply drowning in our modern, romanticized image of the 1920s as a decade of flapper dresses and speakeasies.

There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy—at all events hoping on in some degree—even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope—having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,—is taken away from the wretch and certainty substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death—which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2u5ob4/what_do_you_guys_think_about_prince_myshkins_view/,2015-01-30T03:05:48Z,4,6,books,The Idiot,POST

d2sawm,"Shout out to all the readers out there slowly but surely ticking books off of their ""to read"" list","Once in a while, I see someone post in here about how they just reached their 100 books for the year, or something along those lines. I offer congratulations and respect to these people for achieving such a feat, but there are a lot more of us out here consistently reading a modest number of books every year, and I want to tip my hat to the rest of you who, like me, take books in at a more relaxed pace.  


I don't think I'll ever come close to reading 100 books in a year. My pace is closer to around one book a month (according to my Kindle app, I've read 35 books since I started using the app in 2016) - I read whenever I am on transit and occasionally during my lunch break, but my commute is fairly short and I don't always have time to read at lunch. My list of books to read may grow faster than I can tick names off of it, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth it! I just finished Oliver Twist yesterday, and before that spent about 8 months on reading all six books of the Dune series, and prior to that spent a couple of months slogging through The Idiot. Today I will start Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, which was recommended to me by a good friend.

Anyone else out there racing through their ""to read"" list like a tortoise? What book are you reading right now, and is there anything you're looking forward to starting once you're done?

1abzmjj,I hate the use of imagery,"I can visualise complex scenarios, I just don't retain the scene because of imagery.

I find Shakespeare easier to comprehend due to it being a play; its just dialogue with little to no imagery.

Too much imagery makes my brain skip the whole part, and inevitably this makes it impossible to retain what I just read. Even if I read word by word, it doesn't matter or change a thing; it just gives me a headache.

A user's post [*Why can't I comprehend any book I read*](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pvqnk9/why_cant_i_comprehend_any_book_i_read/) summarises my issue with reading novels. 

I prefer to read only mangas; many here would suggest I cannot visualise hence the substitution for mangas however, as stated earlier, I can retain plays too.

The best supporting argument is the following: recall when your friend was telling you a story about an event that occurred, and, instead of describing unnecessary details such as the time of day, the weather, how they were *really* feeling, etc. etc. they cut the long talk and stayed on topic. They told every little detail without much imagery, and this is why I can easily recall stories from friends but I cannot recall a single thing from novels.

Another point: in the 8th grade, I noticed my struggle with this problem because I never used to read books except *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* (though it has drawings, it lacks imagery, again proving my point) so when an assignment asked to read *Half Brother* by Kenneth Oppel (horrendous book) I could not keep up with the plot, characters, themes, or anything useful. Instead, I started reading summaries and synopsis on the internet and this made me more educated on the assigned material than the entire class that read the material, word for word. 

Equivalently, I did the same for my 12th grade essay: I was assigned to read Gatsby and I read 3/4 of the book, however, as the essay's due date was approaching, a person who's read only 1 page was more educated on Gatsby than I. Again, I searched for summaries and found my answers.

All summaries have 1 attribute in common: they lack imagery and are direct. I cannot read Dostoevsky or Kafka or any book because it has too much imagery for me to understand the material.

It enrages me how illiterate I am and how I cannot enjoy Dostoevsky or Kafka like every person does. I want to enjoy *Crime and Punishment*, *The Brothers Karamazov*, *The Idiot*, *White Nights*, etc. but I cannot because of how disgusting the writing is to me. 

Yes, that's correct, it disgusts me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1abzmjj/i_hate_the_use_of_imagery/,2024-01-27T02:05:16Z,192,0,books,The Idiot,POST

* Watching so many booktube review videos where people give their opinion of a book and the flaws in it has made me a very picky reader, to the point where I can't turn off my brain to enjoy and be on the lookout for flaws like emotional manipulation or redundant dialogue that treats the reader like an idiot.
* The studies, of course.

j1so52,"I read As I Lay Dying by Faulkner. And it is the worst, most meaningless, wretched trash I’ve ever had the displeasure of reading.","I read this book for school. My professor used it as an example of post-modern literature. And, as much as I really adore a lot of post-modern works, this trash novel was almost enough for me to denounce the entire movement. It’s so poorly written in every single way. Not a single choice Faulkner made while authoring this crap was a good one. 

My professor told the class that apparently Faulkner said that to fully understand his books, “you have to read them 4 times.” 

No Faulkner, I am not going to do that. I am not going to read your bullshit over and over again like I’m studying a religious text until it makes sense. If it takes that much energy and effort to understand whatever the hell you’re going on about, then maybe your writing isn’t some sort of avant-garde, brilliant work. Maybe it’s just nonsense that people stare at long enough until they convince themselves that there’s meaning because otherwise they cannot justify wasting that many hours of their precious life. 

For fuck’s sake, there’s a chapter in this book that only includes the words “my mother is a fish”. Yes, I get that it’s supposed to be a 5 year old trying to understand that his mom is dead, but it’s so fuckin clear that it’s being written by some pretentious dick-wad trying to pretend to sound like 5 year-old. Faulkner’s head was pressed so far up his own ass he couldn’t be asked to try to actually write a decent child-character and so just made a bizarre, abstract idiot. 

Also one of the characters in this book was a girl that gets pregnant. It’s so poorly written that I 1. Genuinely didn’t realize the character was a girl till 3/4th of the way through the book and 2. Had no idea that there was a sex scene in the book. 

Apparently Faulkner also would write his books all in one go, and wouldn’t really go back and edit, and would also write his books in a very short time span. This is incredibly obvious to anyone who has tried to write a story quickly and didn’t think it through all the way

Allow me to share a quote from this nightmare of a novel

“In a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep. And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you. And when you are emptied for sleep, you are not. And when you are filled with sleep, you never were. I don't know what I am. I don't know if I am or not. Jewel knows he is, because he does not know that he does not know whether he is or not. He cannot empty himself for sleep because he is not what he is and he is what he is not. Beyond the unlamped wall I can hear the rain shaping the wagon that is ours, the load that is no longer theirs that felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either, lie on our wagon though it does, since only the wind and the rain shape it only to Jewel and me, that are not asleep. And since sleep is is-not and rain and wind are was, it is not. Yet the wagon is, because when the wagon is was, Addie Bundren will not be. And Jewel is, so Addie Bundren must be. And then I must be, or I could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room. And so if I am not emptied yet, I am is.”

This means nothing. I don’t care how many times I have to read it to understand. I don’t care what “eternal truths” or “profound mystery” is being shared. This is unacceptable and the fact that his editor didn’t immediately hold Faulker at gun point until his removed this garbage is the greatest dereliction of duty in human history. 

I feel like the young boy yelling that the emperor is naked. Faulkner is bad, people. We can all stop pretending that he’s brilliant because we are afraid of being called dumb. 

Also, for all you people who are going to suggesting I try another book of his, I won’t. I will not give this fool another second of my life. This book was so bad it completely poisoned the well. 

And if this post is too choppy and poorly thought out to make sense to you, or if you disagree, please re-read this post 8 times while listening to “blue” by Eiffel 65 backwards and reciting the Lord’s Prayer. If you do that, then you will be able to understand my brilliance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j1so52/i_read_as_i_lay_dying_by_faulkner_and_it_is_the/,2020-09-29T04:50:48Z,1067,3709,books,The Idiot,POST

18wodgv,Do you read for the experience or the memory?,"ETA: Good discussion in the comments! Perhaps a refined question would be whether what you take from a book is more colored by the experience of reading the whole thing or by whether it ends in a way that makes sense for plot and character. OP below. 
   
I finally realized why I'm disappointed by so many books that are popular with others, long after realized ""people read with different goals"" (and the more obvious ""people like different genres). The split, I think, is between people who read to experience, and the people who read to remember. 

I think I'm an extreme ""remember"" reader, which is why I'm so focused on the logic of the plot and emotional truths of the characters' actions and reactions. Experience readers are the ones who praise beautiful language, mood, setting, etc. (Obviously a spectrum, as many things are; don't treat this as a binary.) I notice those things, but if the plot isn't tied up neatly or if the characters act like idiots to advance the story, none of those things matter and the experience is ruined for me. Perhaps the best TV example is Lost: so many people loved it and continued to love it after it ended, whereas the unsatisfying ending to the major storylines absolutely ruined everything for me. It wouldn't occur to me to rewatch it, like some people do.

One of my old professors once [identified the difference](https://lindagraham-mft.net/the-experiencing-self-vs-the-remembering-self/) between our ""experiencing self,"" that is, the ""me"" that is doing the reading, and the ""remembering self,"" the ""me"" that takes the memory of that book into the future. These two selves are virtual strangers to each other. I think it applies here.

11. Wordsworth collection of Dostoevsky's short stories (minus Notes from Underground)

This is just fiction, mind you. I read a couple of non-fiction books earlier this year. I've been thinking about why I decided to rank Hardy's Tess over Dostoevsky's Demons. I think it's because Demons is Dostoevsky's weakest major novel imo - way too long, way too confusing, way too many characters - and this is largely because of Dostoevsky's own uncertain approach to the novel. But I ranked Dostoevsky's other works over Hardy. I think the reason for this is that whilst Dostoevsky's plots and characters are more sensational than Hardy's. I love Hardy, and I've really enjoyed what I've read so far from him. But he is a much truer 'realist' than Dostoevsky, who creates fantastic figures like Stavrogin and Myshkin and Raskolnikov that have something of the sensational and the unreal in their characters, though they are exaggerated versions of real people - caricatures, even. By contrast, Hardy's characters feel more like real people, but perhaps less exciting as a result. We pity poor Tess Durbeyfield, but are we as gripped by her plight as we are by Raskolnikov's psychological conflict between arrogant egoism and contempt for others leading him to commit a murder, and his deep-seated guilt and desire to reach out to his fellow man? Tess gets irritating because you just know things are going to get shittier and shittier for her. With C&P, you don't quite know how it's going to end. I think there is still a stroke of romanticism in me that prefers the grandiose and the sensational in the Dostoevskian vein, with all its world-historical and philosophical implications, to the provincial tragedies of English Realism, even if the latter seems closer to the our everyday experience.

I ranked Gatsby above Brideshead. Both Waugh and Fitzgerald are brilliant prose stylists. It was a tough one. I liked both novels. Both had somewhat contrived and even unconvincing endings. Gatsby's death is just out-of-the-blue wacky, and Myrtle's accidental death at the hands of her lover's wife is approaching Shakespearean levels of improbability. The ending of Brideshead, in which everyone regains their Catholic faith, was also unconvincing, but not quite as dramatically unconvincing as the ending of Gatsby. I think The Great Gatsby is a more exciting novel, with something of the sensational and theatrical which Brideshead lacks, and that is the main reason I ranked Gatsby above Brideshead. It at least has a compelling (albeit repulsive) male lead. None of the characters in Brideshead are particularly compelling for me, even though I enjoyed the story. Julia is perhaps the least interesting character of the lot, and the contrived romance between her and Charles is a lull from the homoerotic thrills I got from the Sebastian-Charles relationship in the first half of the novel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wcx2k3/rank_the_books_you_have_read_so_far_this_year/,2022-07-31T19:42:43Z,362,157,books,The Idiot,POST
12hwq40,Would you consider The Diamond Age a difficult read?,"Hi all, a friend recently recommended me The Diamond Age so I got it on my Kindle and started reading it, but quickly got frustrated as it felt I was looking up the definition of a word on every single page.

I understand that I'm gonna discover new words in books, and I enjoy learning about them - but it was getting ridiculous for me and I'm just a little confused as to whether this is just because I'm an idiot, or if other people consider this a difficult book to read?

For context, I'm a young 20s who's lived my whole life in a native English-speaking country (English is my first language) and I consider myself to be fairly well-educated in terms of reading/speaking/understanding English.

Am I simply just not educated well-enough to have known what any of the following words that appeared in the book mean:

* Multifarious
* Prevarication
* Gallimaufry
* Primping
* Propitiation
* Velleity
* Concinnity
* Perfunctorily

I eventually gave up with the book, as there were too many words that I had to keep looking up in order to have a basic idea of what was going, slowing my reading speed to a crawl.

These were all words I'd never seen in any literature before reading this book, which is why it makes me think it's a difficult read, although maybe I just don't read enough.

gsd5qf,I never liked Charles Dickens. Listening to his books out loud has been the most fun reading I've ever had.,"Charles Dickens is known nowadays as a really stuffy author, too wordy and too foreign to appreciate. And when I read Oliver Twist last year, I had the same opinion: he was just too hard to read to really enjoy.

But then I saw a reference online that Dickens during his day used to do readings of his novels aloud to crowds, and people say he was one of the best actor/writers ever to live. This definitely piqued my curiosity.

So I decided to try listening to one of his books as an audiobook (Bleak House), and I was absolutely blown away by how entertaining, funny, dramatic, and above all, totally understandable the novel was as soon as a great actor was able to speak the text aloud. I had a big dopey smile on my face the whole time I was reading it — I forgot I was even reading a classic!

It helped that Miriam Margolyes, the narrator, was really amazing, and was particularly good at using a different voice for every character. I was able to fly through such a long book, never getting characters confused or plot details mixed up (and I am not always the strongest reader). Now I'm reading The Pickwick Papers and I'm once again having the time of my life.

I can't remember the last time I had so much fun reading books. If you're stuck at home these days, and are at all curious about Dickens, I'd highly recommend trying an audiobook (either with or without reading along with a text). It has totally changed my perspective on ""classic"" books.

Edit: There are some people calling me an idiot and that seems uncalled for. When you see someone talking about reading classics for pleasure and think that’s a bad thing...you might be the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gsd5qf/i_never_liked_charles_dickens_listening_to_his/,2020-05-28T19:39:41Z,77,503,books,The Idiot,POST
12ehdwr,What’s the cleverest (not most beautiful) book title you’ve come across?,"For me, it’s _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman. 

According to Wikipedia, “_The book's main thesis is a differentiation between two modes of thought: ""System 1"" is fast, instinctive and emotional; ""System 2"" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical._”

I’ve not read this book but it’s ubiquitous. I almost can’t walk into a bookstore without seeing it and I always read the title twice.

I remember when I came across it initially and I read the title, I paused. I was trying to figure out what it could mean. It’s not _wrong_ per se, but it didn’t make a whole of sense. Then I read the back of the book and the penny dropped. 

Now, whenever I see it and read the title, 
I read it like this the first time: “thinking fast and slow”. 

It’s meant to be read: “thinking” [pause] “fast and slow”. 

To date, my brain immediately reads it without the comma (ie it’s thinking fast) and then rereads it with the comma (ie thinking slowly). It somehow does this even though I’ve already figured it out. It’s because reading book titles is such an automated process that it’s a millisecond ahead of recognition. 

Now, I think it’s very clever. It’s a perfect illustration of the book’s central premise. 

I saw it again just now, while shopping online, and was wondering if you guys have come across clever book titles along this line. 

Note: to reiterate, I’m not talking about book titles that are poetry. I’m talking clever - something that makes you go “ohhh! I get it!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12ehdwr/whats_the_cleverest_not_most_beautiful_book_title/,2023-04-07T11:00:52Z,123,99,books,The Idiot,POST
1bc39vo,"Roadside Picnic is one of the best literary sci-fi books I’ve ever read. The main character, Red, feels like he walked right out of a Cormac McCarthy book into a dark, mysterious world that has been forever changed by an alien visit.","I see now why this book inspired so much other art! From the classic Tarkovsky movie Stalker, to the STALKER video game franchise, to Metro 2033 - the Strugatsky brothers have left an awfully big legacy with this one.

Here’s the setup (no spoilers, but inside tags just in case you want a blank slate):

>!Red Schuhart is a stalker, one of the young rebels who venture illegally into the Zone to collect mysterious artifacts left behind by aliens after their visit. But when he and his friend Kirill go in together to pick up a “full empty,” something goes wrong. Despite the danger, Red keeps getting pulled back to the Zone, again and again, until he finds the answers he’s looking for, or his luck runs out.!<

The book is a masterpiece of world-building and suspense.  The Zone itself is a character, a constantly shifting landscape that both repels and compels those who enter.  I won’t say too much more about it, and the specifics of the danger lurking there, or the power of the artifacts inside, because seeing it alongside Red, piecing together its secrets through his experiences, is a hugely fun part of the book.

Red is a complex and fascinating protagonist, a man hardened by his experiences but not without compassion. He’s tough, cynical, and incredibly competent, but also has a huge soft spot when it comes to his family and the people he knows. Absolutely one of the best, most fun, and complex characters I’ve come across in all of sci-fi, and he’s what makes this book so special. My only complaint about the book is that it's four parts long, and in one of the parts, Red is mostly offscreen - we could have had a few more pages with Red Schuhart!

So when it comes to clothes and stereo equipment and all that other shit where he drops 50 brand names a page it makes sense that he is a superficial human that really has little interest in anything other than impressing and showing superiority over others.

Does he see music the same way he sees brand name designer suits? Cause there seems to be a huge difference between his opinions on music and literally every other consumer product he mentions.

Also, I've not read the book in over a year so my memory of it is hazy despite having read it a couple times and it being one of my favorite books.

18mtx4x,"Humbly report, Sir, that I'm reading The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek","I am almost finished with this book, which I stumbled across quite at random in the library stacks. It's a military satire set in the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I, written by a Czech soldier in the early '20s (and cut short, unfortunately, by his untimely death).

The main character, Švejk, is ""an idiot"" who ends up conscripted and eventually becomes a batman to several officers. Cleverer than he presents himself to his officers, he spends considerable time sitting cheerfully in military prisons, commiserating with the other brutalized misfits as he prepares to winsomely liberate himself, often with the help of a kind or befuddled officer.

The book, which was originally published as brief newspaper installments, is a bit uneven, especially for the first third or so. But once the narrative hits its stride and the chapters get longer, the book, and especially the characters, really get a chance to shine. Even throwaway or gimmick characters have are the right combination of life-like and over-the-top, and there were many occasions where I cheered at a character's reappearance or at their failure to learn from their own mistakes (allowing them to create a whole new mess to get out of).

The version I read, printed in the '70s, is accompanied by some of the (hundreds of) original illustrations by Josef Lada. These really served to ground me in the narrative; often I'd be reading about soldiers who could have been drawn from any army or war, and just as I'd pictured them as, say, *M*A*S*H* characters there would be an illustration to remind me of their grandiose Habsburg facial hair. It was good to be shocked back into the actual context of the story, though military satire has a timelessness that (when combined with the quality of the humor) makes the book of more than just historical interest.

I like to browser reddit when I finish a book to see what others think, and I was very surprised to see how many people disliked it. A common complaint seemed to be that it flat out wasnt interesting, or that it had an anticlimactic ending. But I honestly thought the ending was my favorite part. I thought it was very fitting for Dick to sort or fade away into obscurity and mediocrity and that this was the greatest tragedy that could befall a character like him. The whole book left me feeling very melancholy and I kinda want to read it again. People say that the characters were one dimensional but I thought they had some complexity to them. 

A lot of people say you need to consider Fitzgeralds personal life to really appreciate it. While I agree this adds a lot to it and its interesting to see him bleed into the character, i thought that the book was able tk stand on its own two feet and got a lot of thought/emotion out of me.

10s0kst,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea,"All throughout I had a great time, despite knowing  about the submarine, the time taken to build up to it and the mystery around what it could be and the eventual reveal still was wonderful .The various kinds of sea life described and the care put into the descriptions and where the nautilus was really added to the feel of adventure and mystery and even the  strange sadness of the man made things underwater when passed by. Some favourite moments of mine were the journey through the mediterranean, the coral forest and the ice. And despite feeling a little soon after a big event thought the ending felt right since it was constantly being mentioned by Ned.

And the most important to all this was the nautilits, i don't know enough about underwater exploration (even though i do like underwater settings) to comment on how accurate but the care and detail put into the ship and its crew's equipment definitely added to the believability. 

The characters themselves were excellent and memorable. I liked Nemo’s mystery and strangeness.

kts0d5,"I finally read American Psycho, and it is probably the most boring/worst book i ever read","Obviously this is solely my opinion, and i understand many people find the book to be great.

&#x200B;

I have wanted to read American psycho for a long time. Pat Bateman figures on the top of several ""Most memorable/best psychopaths in litterature"" lists, and people seem to find this book super shocking etc. Furthermore, it was the favorite book of the canadian serial rapist/killer Paul Bernardo. So my expectations where set pretty high.

&#x200B;

I guess i expected some intelligent and smooth psychopath, kinda like a Harvey Specter(From the TV show suits) if he was a psychopath and liked to kill people. But what i got was an idiot.

&#x200B;

Pat Bateman does not strike me as a psychopath, in the clinical sense(I know psychopathy is not an actual diagnosis, but experts like Robert Hare and Hervey Cleckley are pretty agreeable on what a psychopath checklist looks like). Even though he shares some character traits of a psychopath, he also holds a whole bunch of traits that an actual psychopath would not hold. At no point during the book did i think ""Damn, Bateman is a smart guy"" quite the opposite. The man seems to be an idiot. He murders people in public, drags bodies in public(in a sleeping bag, but still) and leaves a long trail of potentiel witnesses and in general loses his temper over small stuff. In the real world, Bateman would be apprehended pretty damn quick. Furthermore, the guys inner monologue reads like that of some teenage cringey edgelord, and not some intelligent adult who is highly sophisticated and intelligent, but happens to like murder.

&#x200B;

Also, im pretty certain you could fill 50 pages, if not 100, with the description of what any given person is wearing at any given time. Pure filler. Same with the random reviews of 80s music artists...why? Was Ellis paid by wordcount or something? Thats what this book felt like in general...filler. What people are wearing, where they should eat, dinner reservations, music reviews, product reviews, constant mentions of ""hardbodies"" etc. with the occasional murder thrown in(which doesnt happen until you are 50% into the book).

&#x200B;

I have never sat through such a slog. While i did find some of the murders to be ""creative"" it simply was not enough to save the book, in my opinion. I guess the shock factor was simply much higher back when it was first published?

&#x200B;

Now i do understand that part of it is about analyzing what ""is really going on"" in the book, and what the various characters represent(For example, Louis, Sean and Bethany all seemed to represent different aspects of identity/life). But to me, a story needs to be captivating on the surface as well. I need to want to keep turning pages, and here i simply didnt want to, or care at all.

joxygl,"Stephen King's ""The Stand"" is such an underrated masterpiece","I know King is extremely popular and ""The Stand"" is one of his most popular books, but in the grand scheme of things I think this book is so underrated. Unlike 'The Shining"" ""It"" or ""Pet Sematary,"" no one outside of Kingdom knows about it, owing mostly, I'm sure, to the lack of a notable film adaptation to place it within the cultural zeitgeist. 

Besides that, though, I think this book is overlooked frim a critical/literary standpoint, too. It never gets talked about at the university level and I know King himself has been famously spurned and looked down on by the literary community, but I just can't believe the absolute treasure trove of devices and and mechanics and characterization being ignored here. 

This has been one of my favorite books for years, but rereading it now for the first time since high school I'm blown away by this thing. The introduction of Frannie Goldsmith may be my favorite character intro in all of literature. Her personality is painted so quickly and vividly I was knocked out of my chair. That whole opening scene between her and Jess just oozes heart, personality, and melancholy. Not only is it a great intro for Fran, but also in setting the stage for the whole novel and the bittersweet feel of it all, including the end. 

The first three chapters of this book just feel so much sharper than I remember. King's prose is incredibly fresh here and his descriptors are staggering. Maybe my heightened appreciation for it only comes from the fact that lately I've only been reading King's new stuff, which is stale garbage, but this... This is something special. 

What do you guys think? Agree or am I nuts?

EDIT:

Wow, I was not expecting the absolute shit storm this stirred up. At all. 

To be clear, titling this ""underrated"" was a mistake as it conveys the wrong idea. I've also been blasted for calling it a masterpiece and told I don't know what ""underrated"" is. I am not using ""underrated"" and ""I like this book"" interchangeably. I like this book a lot, yes, and think it is King's masterpiece. I know it has been adapted and influenced music. None of that addresses anything else I said in my post. I think the actual writing and mechanics of this book don't receive enough attention- and some people have said they think the writing and characters are poor, which is ok. I'm not going to tell them they're wrong, especially when they take the time to give the reasons they feel that way. My question this whole time has solely been:

Why is this book not regarded as critically ""great"" in the wider literary canon, and why has this book- despite being so popular among his readership- not found the same cultural success as some of his other works? Is it simply due to lack of a popular, recent, lasting, theatrical adaptation?

If I come of as an idiot or fishing for something, I'm sorry. This is not intended to be a controversial post at all, but instead basically just an opinion poll. I have not had any luck finding fellow readers at my University (despite enrolling in master's English courses) or really anywhere else. That's part of what got me feeling this way about the book in the first place- the lack of exposure I've personally witnessed. If that doesn't align with other people's experiences that's completely fine, as those experiences are what I'd like to hear about. Obviously I'm the asshole due to the largely negative feedback I got here and if I ever post again it will be nothing like this. 

But anyway, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to comment and interact with me and the post. I appreciate the discussion and hearing other people's thoughts.

In the case of **Pillars of the Earth** I believe the author may have written exactly the book he intended, with exactly the techniques, devices and characters he needed to convey the message he wanted. But **sweet Jesus fuck** should he have wanted something else.

This book was bizarrely well received, with a Goodreads rating of over 4.3 after 700,000 ratings, frequent appearances in top book lists in newspapers, a TV miniseries etc etc etc. If you search for PoE on this very /r/books you will find nothing but praise in the top threads. Many positive reviews share some common themes, and I hope to address these points and more to explain why this is literally the most overhyped book of all time.

**Chapter 1**  
I am near-certain that all readers of this book will recognise chapter 1 as being just the stupidest shit they have ever read. The difference between the 1 star reviews and the rest, then, is the extent to which readers are able to forgive this unholy embarrassment. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was not easy. For those who have not read the book, the chapter features our early MC Tom whose wife dies of exposure in childbirth after a gruelling winter on the road. Fortunately a sexy forest girl with massive tits (we'll discuss everyone's massive tits in more detail shortly) fell in love with him fifteen minutes earlier because of his eyes so they have a cheeky shag, he falls in love with her, and the dead ex gets mentioned about once in the rest of the book, all characters apparently happy just to forget she ever existed. There is no merit to this chapter in isolation, and it informs no characters or themes except the theme of weird sex stuff. It is perhaps the single worst passage of fiction I have ever read.

**The weird sex stuff**  
Ken Follett likes massive tits and he wants you to know it. The only author I've read who matches Follett's dedication to publishing his private sexual fascinations is Terry Goodkind, and that is never a favourable comparison. The sex is almost exclusively male - we hear about the volume and buoyancy of each lady's boobs from a range if male perspectives, but female perspectives are largely sexless. It's always boobs - one if the final passages of the book is literally a timeline of the various states that Aliena's boobs have gone through during the course if her life. Follett sincerely felt that this was an important thread to wrap up. But it's not all about massive tits - we can also talk about Jack curing Aliena's rape-induced PTSD with his magic dick, or about Aliena's constant complaints about how hairy she is, or about the number of characters who sexualise the same teen arab girl. There is just a lot of dodgy sex stuff (and a LOT of close-up descriptions of massive tits) that just don't add anything and instead make you feel slightly slimy for having read them.

A genuine quote from a woman *who is being made to choose between staying with her baby or searching Europe for her husband:* ""She imagined meeting Jack again. She visualised his face, smiling at her. They would kiss. She felt a stir of pleasure in her loins. She realised she was getting damp down there at the mere thought of him. She felt embarrassed"". This is blatantly inappropriate to the circumstances, but sadly far from the worst erotica the author offers us. ""She was suddenly possessed by a desire to show him her breasts"" come on dude.

**The characters**  
The characters in this book range from utterly ridiculous to merely poor. Many positive reviews note the quality of the characters, and I genuinely pity these reviewers for the quality of book they are apparently missing out on if PoE represents the upper end of what they expect.

If the book can be said to have a main character then it is Phillip, and Phillip is a Mary Sue in the strongest possible sense, which is to say that the world and characters around him warp their nature to make him look better. Despite his position of authority, no character ever bears a grudge against Phillip - in the rare cases that they deserve to, we get point of view chapters confirming that they forgive him for everything. We never see any circumstance in which Phillip, as a moral authority, has to grapple with moral ambiguity. The closest we get is scenarios where Phillip has to impose church law on the undeserving, but even here it is made  unambiguously clear that he would happily act in line with modern sensibilities if it weren't for his malicious colleagues, meaning he feels more like an anachronistic insert than a real character. We get a scene in which Phillip identifies that mortar takes time to harden, whereas the builders set aside time for superstitious reasons - does Phillip take more naturally to building than his own professional master builders? Perhaps so, because Phillip is divinely perfect.

The primary antagonist is William who is so comically and unrealistically evil that he doesn't even feel threatening because he is so comedically over the top. His scenes include yeeting a baby and talking about how he enjoys torturing because it reminds him of raping women. His mother is also a cartoon villain who rolls around looking evil, speaking in cryptic phrases then crying 'idiots' when her henchmen don't understand what she's talking about. Literally like a bad Disney villain from a spin off TV cartoon.

The rest of the cast get various degrees of poor to mediocre characterisation, but the single key point that I found I kept coming back to was that nothing ever informs anybody's character. I touched on this earlier when I mentioned that Tom forgets his dead wife less than 24 hours after she passes, where you might think that in the hands of a better author a dead wife could be a big character moment. Her dying wish is for him to build the cathedral, and even this doesn't come back except as an afterthought well down the line. Tom's big weakness (and you can tell that each character has all the complexity of a pair of columns labelled 'good traits' and 'bad traits') is his unwillingness to discipline his son, but we never see where this comes from or how it interacts with any other element of his character. It's an artificial 'weakness' that the author performs for us occasionally rather than actual depth. We see this same issue across most other characters - William is terrified of hell but we don't see where this comes from and it never affects his behaviour; at Tom's death Phillip declares Tom was his closest friend, but we never actually saw evidence of this.

Aliena literally announces the end of her character arc. She is standing in a street and loudly declares to nobody some shit like 'Father I am finally free if your oath etc etc'. There is a genuine sense in this book that characterisation should be delivered just by declaring it and calling it development.

**Historical accuracy**  
I am no expert on any period of history, including the setting for this novel, and to give credit where it is due there is a definite sense of authenticity about the building of the cathedral. I was uncertain about the implicit claim that this single town revolutionised a wide range of economic activities through the invention of (among other things) automation and market capitalism, but as I say, I'm no expert. However, I did find some external criticisms of the historical accuracy very convincing, including [this review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/30702791) which notes various inaccuracies ranging from the minor (how women would have worn their hair) to the critical (the nature of religious/common marriage law at the time, which the plot repeatedly hinges on).

**The plot**  
I'm not usually so bothered about the details of the plot to be honest, but with that said I did feel there were some key weaknesses here. First of all, it felt like the plot was essentially episodic - we have a cycle under which the dastardly villains hatch a dastardly scheme, only for Phillip to accidentally find out and cleverly foil the dastardly forces of evil. This ties in to a lot of issues I have raised already - the dastardly plot is often hatched by William's mum who already acts like a bad Disney villain, and this structure further cements this role for her; Phillip finds out about these schemes by accident and is given the undeserved opportunity to fix them thereby rendering him the plot's saviour, but only because the plot warped to allow him this chance - the hallmark of a Mary Sue character. 

I also noted a certain amount of plot recycling going on. The closest we see Phillip get to moral ambiguity is when he is forced by the villainous forces of evil to separate Tom and Ellen - though a PoV chapter from Tom makes it clear that he doesn't blame Phillip. Later, Phillip faces similar turmoil when he is forced by the villainous forces of evil to separate Jack and Aliena - though a PoV chapter from Jack makes it clear that he doesn't blame Phillip.

**Overall**  
Everything about this godforsaken disaster of a book is a mess. It benefits from almost no redeeming features. It's vaguely possible that if you took out the weird sex stuff (thereby halving the size of the book) you might salvage a 2-star novel, but on balance it's easy to feel like the author really wanted to write a weird sex book with a small amount of plot structure. Is it possible that I'm advocating for the removal of the central feature of the novel? Perhaps so.

I genuinely do not understand what people see in this book. I don't understand why all the top threads about it are pouring with adoration. I don't understand why it is one of the highest rated books on Goodreads with one of the largest readerships. I saw a comment on one thread that recommended following up with Lonesome Dove, and this one comment has forever put me off reading Lonesome Dove because I cannot bear the thought of approaching anything that is regarded as remotely comparable to this absolute fiasco. I have nothing more to add other than to say I hope that this review will in some way balance the scales so that some unsuspecting and naive future reader can avoid falling into the same trap that I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vwdxrt/spoiler_pillars_of_the_earth_is_the_most/,2022-07-11T09:05:08Z,1510,8734,books,The Idiot,POST
80yin0,"My biggest mistake in reading. The desire to be ""well-read""","I love books, I love reading- most importantly, I love stories. 

I feel like an idiot because ever since I got my revived love for books, I put learning over entertainment by seeking out the ""classics"" and ""must reads"" not don't get me wrong, nothing is bad about reading classics. But I'm currently reading ""The Castle"" by Kafka, after reading ""The Trial"" and ""The Great Gatsby"" all which I didn't really care for- so why did I read them? Why did I finish two novels I didn't like? Because of the stuffy air around them. And also my desire to be ""well-read"" amongst my peers.

I think reading books gets slightly burdened by the stigma that it makes you smart, so a book reader like myself may want to fulfill that stigma and be seen as smart. 

I'm done trying to be verified through what is supposed to be a hobby. From now on I'm reading just to be entertained and have fun. I've learned powerful lessons from books I just picked up for a good time:

Catcher in the Rye taught me about the beauty of childhood and toughness of growing up. Also that last page: bringing up old friends in conversations leads to pain.

Dance, Dance, Dance by Murakami taught me to live a life with passion. Same thing with The Stranger by Camus (also that life is pointless)

w1t50j,What would your thoughts be about a living author delegating the rest of their series?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about writers like George RR Martin/Pat Rothfuss, who have wildly  popular series that have gone over a decade without conclusion, often due to the author’s mental or physical health.

When writers die without finishing a story, another author will often step in to finish it, and often the fans are even well-satisfied with the result. (See Sanderson and wheel of time*). Other times, authors might turn to ghost writers, but that comes with a sort of shame and failure to acknowledge others’ work that could (and arguably should) dissuade honorable authors from going that route. 

So, what would you think about an author handing over the reins to someone else? Have you seen it done? Would a certain amount of original author oversight make you more inclined toward it? Things that might be your biggest concerns? Am I an idiot and is this already common?

I want to document my thoughts on the book in more of anonymous way then posting on Goodreads because I still feel like I am idiot. At least in some sense.  I wish I had read more about the themes, author, background on the book before diving in.  I think I would have appreciated the book more.  As an adult, I see Holden like most teenagers.  He thinks he understands most things but I don't know if he does enough self introspection.  I think he understands some situations well but then other times he could be so frustrating.  How realistic is this book?  I don't think as a teenager I ever went out on the town and if I did it wasn't multiple days at a time.  Does this give a look into what privilege some prep schools have?

olppsp,Have other people noticed the bias against fast readers here?,"To clarify my own position, I absolutely love reading, and read a shit-ton of books (hundreds a year). What I'm doing is not skimming - I have full comprehension of everything I read, and find that when I'm discussing books with people, I usually have much more recollection of plot nuance and details than average. I read normal-length novels and non-fiction books, no audio books or graphic novels (though I have nothing against those).

Lately I feel like there have been a lot of posts bashing people like me due to our volume. People calling us liars, claiming we're ""cheating"" or skimming books, claiming we can't possibly be enjoying (or comprehending) books at the rate we read, etc.

I just want to point out that people have vastly different reading speeds and comprehension ability, and that's totally fine either way. Just like it would be an asshole move for people to call slower readers a bunch of drooling idiots, it's also an asshole move to call faster readers a bunch of lying cheaters who aren't actually reading.

14wtqlf,"Clive Barker's ""The Great and Secret Show"" and ""Everville"", when a follow up just does no good.","The impressions online i initially read of Everville really made me feel as though im reading a different  book than everyone else. I set quite a few that preferred it over the first and i was excited to read something that can finally surpass ""book 1"" the curse of almost any trilogy, series or whatever.. But that wasn't the case 

I could easily prattle on about how annoying it is Tesla is now dragging us through reintroducing her story for the 14th time, or that when Joe goes to another literal different dimension he thinks his morals are valid after witnessing individuals enthralled to Noah which leads me to speak of quiddity and the fact that a dream realm with tenuous metaphors serving as our only possible methods of comprehension is suddenly just another little place with people and cities populated with all forms of familiar sort of landmarks instead of this metaphysical realm...

So much of this book has me wondering if barker realized he couldn't keep up the framework of the first one and instead of just letting it stand on its own he forced himself to write something and it resulted in losing his unique world that he showed off instead opting for a cheap Narnia 

Everville is an unnecessary continuation that reconfigures the previously used imagery for the sake of making things happen narratively (hard to use metaphysical dimensions as a primary setting instead of being largely mentioned in passing). He also manages to somehow turn previously enjoyable characters into a cast largely consisting of annoying snide idiots.

8adr0n,The Genius of Fyodor Dostoevsky,"I'm midway through reading The Brothers Karamazov. I've already read Crime and Punishment and The Idiot. And therefore, I conclusively state that Dostoevsky is a literary genius! 

His psychological explorations of the human mind in relation to moral questions is unparalleled.

You can read his books over and over again but somehow always find new substance. Crime and Punishment is one of the best books ever. It was also very innovative for its time, since psychology was not a developed science by then. And for Dostoevsky to understand the inner workings of the complex human mind was an achievement in itself. The things he said in his books still ring true (while one may say Freudian ideologies are considered outdated). To add to that, Raskolnikov is one of the most well-written characters in literature.

But The Brothers Karamazov is undoubtedly one of the greatest works of world literature. The Grand Inquisitor by itself is a literary masterpiece. You can read it as many times as you'd like and find a hidden philosophical gem every time. Need I say more?

18nmk37,Starling House by Alix E. Harrow is a Love Letter to the Gothic Genre,"How might a love letter to the gothic genre look? It might, first, be in the novel form: nothing less would capture its grandiose themes, its dark and brooding atmosphere. Then, there must be a house. Not just any house will do. You know the type: a tangle of rust-covered metal gates and fence, and behind them a jagged, dark marvel of Gothic Revival architecture, ""like a vast animal from its den: a gabled spine, wings of pale stone, a tower with a single amber eye. Steep steps curl like a tail around its feet."" (Harrow, 18). And within this house? The tortured and self-denying ways of the novel's--the genre's--protagonists, your Heathchliffs and Elizabeths and Frankensteins and their Creatures. Driven, tragic heroes--most often driven towards their own destruction.

  
Judge Alix E. Harrow's latest novel by these measures, and you will find \*Starling House\* a laudable work, a gothic novel well worth reading. It's Emily Brontë's \*Wuthering Heights\* that the book gives homage to, in ways explicit and implicit. A few examples of the latter: Starling House feels as remote from the town of Eden, Kentucky, as the Wuthering Heights  felt from whatever nameless, fictional town Brontë decided to situate her novel near, both places eery and the source of curiosity and fright alike (i.e. they give off creepy vibes). There's the naming convention: both novels carry the names of their central locales, of course. Gothic protagonists are not the pretty boys of teen vampire fiction; Heathcliff was never a looker, Arthur is described by one supporting character as a ""big scarecrow"" (223). As for explicit references, main character Opal enjoys her gothic reads; Arthur, the male lead of \*Starling House\*, eventually ends up under 'Heathcliff' on her phone.

  
There are other elements that you'll inevitably find--I read \*Wuthering Heights\* two years ago, and it's not the freshest novel in my mind, so I'm certain I overlooked a fair few callbacks. It's important to note that while Harrow's gothic novel shows nothing but love to Bronte's genre-defying work, \*Starling House\* is not mapped onto it. Francine Prose defined for the NYRB some of \*Wuthering Heights\*'s strongest suits, namely ""its wild originality, its immensely intricate narrative structure, its hyper-romanticism masquerading as naturalism, the dialogue that makes its characters seem always to be shouting even when they are conversing"". These traits are not the traits you'll find in Harrow's novel; its structure isn't going to startle you with its originality; the fantasy gothic is not reinvented in some miraculous way. Nor need it be.

  
This isn't only a love letter to the gothic genre, it's also an Alix E. Harrow novel. If you've read \*The Ten Thousand Doors of January\* or \*The Once and Future Witches\*, you know exactly what that means. If not, I'll tell you: a deep and abiding interest in the power of stories, in their plurality, in the polyphony of different versions of a central story or motif. Here, this polyphony relates to the various stories told about Starling House's origins: horror stories and tales of emancipation, wrongs righted only half-way but still lingering all the way to the present.  
Some don't like the switch between first- and third-person points of view; I loved this particular choice. Opal's perspective takes prime place: she is a thief and a liar, forced into both roles for the sake not only of herself but of her younger brother Jasper. Eden has taken her mother, has denied her opportunities freely given to those in the town who have more normal lives, families, support networks.

  
Opal's a bit of an idiot to begin with, which makes her growth so much more satisfying. I don't mean here the annoying, insufferable kind of character that you won't be able to stand. Rather, Opal's a bit of an idiot like anyone who's ever lived is a bit of an idiot - she takes too much on her shoulders, tries to hold together the weight of two lives--her own and Jasper's--without asking for help or discussing her plans with anyone else. She's wilful, driven, doing the best she can in an incredibly difficult situation. Her reactions to the uncanny circumstances she finds herself in are relatable, and she has a wryness and a wittiness about her that make her point of view sections a joy to read. This citation, for example, from a conversation with a co-worker:

>Lacey’s mouth bends in a glossy bow. “That’s not funny. My meemaw says there were two Starlings living there back in her day, a pair of women.” Her voice lowers, bowing beneath the weight of implication. “Neither of them ever married.” I would like to ask Lacey’s meemaw if she’d considered the quality of potential husbands available in Muhlenberg County, but I suppose, given the existence of Lacey, that she must have made certain compromises. (28)

Arthur is the Warden of Starling House, fighting shadows and Beasts of uncertain origins. He appears as brooding and melancholy as Heathcliff; despite initial appearances, he and Opal have an awful lot in common. Both characters are driven by goals they will not be dissuaded from and both characters go through narrative arcs that force them to come to grips with the limits of what they can achieve alone. Opal's purpose is to make sure that Jasper doesn't end up stuck in Eden; Arthur's is that he will be the last Warden of the House. How their paths cross, and how well they succeed at these goals, I'll leave to the reader to find out.

  
What of Eden, Kentucky, itself? The tried and tested irony of naming a location Eden and proceeding to make it anything but is always appreciated. Its story is profoundly American, another township with a once-glamorous history exploited to the brink, its citizens now the victims of precarious and constant economic risk. As unreal, as gothic as Starling House itself is, Eden is tangible: just another locale in the USA's Rust Belt, decimated by deindustrialisation and the running out of coal. Its people hate the local corporation that has brought them to this ruin--Gravely Power--and need the jobs and businesses it keeps on life support if they are to avoid worse ruin yet. And this, too, strikes me as something characteristic for Alix Harrow's work - it's timely, reflects issues in the world beyond its covers with awareness and sympathy. The members of her supporting cast reveal themselves as more than stock characters: Bev, the grouchy motel keeper who lets Opal and Jasper live in room 12 rent-free, is more than the tobacco-chewing curmudgeon Opal initially introduces her as. Opal herself, in the daily drudgery for survival, has forgotten some of that. The novel allows her (and the reader) to see people anew, to create new connections, to revisit and reconceptualise old ones.

  
Allow me a final return to the most emblematic gothic element of this fantasy novel: Starling House is alive. It contains multitudes within itself: dreams, feelings, nostalgic memories, and mysteries most of all. These mysteries go deep and range far in time and space; the untangling of them by Opal is the novel's greatest joy. The house is a storied space, in so many ways. As significant as Opal and Arthur are, its constant presence overshadows even the two of them. It certainly overwhelms:

>The surface is scarred and stained; it’s only up close that I see there are tiny shapes carved roughly into the wood. Hundreds of them—horseshoes and crooked crosses and open eyes, spirals and circles and malformed hands that run in long rows like hieroglyphs, or lines of code. Some of them I almost recognize from Mom’s tarot decks and astrology charts, but most of them are unfamiliar, like letters from an alphabet I don’t know. There’s a derangement to them, a desperation that tells me I should leave before I wind up ritually beheaded or sacrificed on a stone altar in the basement. (21)

Hell of a first impression, House. And it only gets better from there, with the complex relationship that Starling House develops with Opal, with the even more complex emotions between it and Arthur, with every sad creak and joyous flap of a curtain. Explore this space at your own pace--but do give it the time of day. Especially if the gothic genre speaks to you.

Tl;dr: You'll enjoy \*Starling House\* by Alix E. Harrow if:

&#x200B;

* You read and enjoy gothic literature. Did \*Wuthering Heights\* twist up your silly lil heart and romantic expectations? Good news - the heart-twisting fun continues here!
* You loved Harrow's previous work: the accent on stories and their power continues to be an ever-present pole in her writing, and, folks, it is a delight;
* You have a thing for scarecrow boys and crooked girls in contentious, fun relationships - just think of the shipping potential!
* SPOOKY HOUSE!
* And plenty more! Prob'ly.

A final word on the materiality of the book: Tor's printed International edition is a good example of a finely printed book, a paperback worth owning and treasuring. The paper is pleasant to the touch, and the font's size makes for a more economical layout--while still immensely legible. If this were a Gollancz publication, it might've easily been a hundred and fifty pages longer; this edition closes at three hundred and eight pages. As someone without any space for books at this point, I appreciate these particular aspects of the paperback.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18nmk37/starling_house_by_alix_e_harrow_is_a_love_letter/,2023-12-21T13:03:20Z,0,25,books,The Idiot,POST
15px1uj,Starships of Sci Fi Books. Complained about for being unrealistic or doesn't deserve the hate?,"With the growing world of science fiction novels these days, there have been many different views of what alien/humanoid starships look like in books. 

Books like The Last Emperox and the Consuming Fire show perfect example of unique human made ships in a future where humans have advanced greatly across space.

But I have watched a review video recently about the numerous designs of starships in science fiction novels and why they are all the same nowadays. I highly disagree due to every book is unique in their own way depending on the story.

But looking back now and after reading some of the comments on the review video, with mixed opinions, do spaceships in Sci Fi deserve to be complained about just because of the author's taste or not?

142lgal,"The Crucible is bad, actually","I don’t think this is a particularly hot or relevant take, but I think The Crucible may be one of the most overpraised literary works of the 20th Century. People (or maybe just my high school lit teacher…) are always drooling and fluttering their eyelashes at the use of allegory, and sure it was controversial at the time it was produced for speaking out against McCarthyism. However, I think it fails both to seriously indict its historical context and as a story.

First let me history nerd a bit: the Salem Witch Trials and what may have caused them are fascinating subjects of historical research and conjecture. Theories include everything from psycho-active rotted wheat stores to the ultimate expression of a patriarchal society’s destruction of its most vulnerable members to the idea that groups of young women sought to gain political power in a social order that subjugated them completely. 

What does Arthur Miller imagine was the root cause of such a famously cryptic historical event? A jealous teenager wants to continue to bang his self-insert character at seemingly any cost. John Proctor, of course, is not truly at fault for sleeping with his young employee. Even when he finally apologizes to his wife, she assures him it’s really her fault because she “kept a cold home”. Proctor is a man martyred not by single-minded societal pressure committed to political homogeneity as allegory lovers might suggest, but by the whims of a silly girl who just couldn’t control herself. 

Anyway, excuse my random rant…I’ve been raging at this one for years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/142lgal/the_crucible_is_bad_actually/,2023-06-06T16:28:17Z,12,0,books,The Idiot,POST
1676k0b,I just finished reading Barb and The Battle for Bailiwick!,"This is going to include spoilers so beware just in case you're going to buy this book, read it first then come back to this post. I'm very disappointed with this third book in the Barb the Last Berserker series. This third book was so fast paced it will make your head spin. It's really bad. The pacing is so messed up, everything moves at the speed of lighting, not giving us enough time to watch these characters develop.

One of the biggest rules in writing anything is the ""Show, don't tell"" rule. Well... Dan and Jason told everything in this book. Thirteen chapters were in this book and major moments were just explained via poorly written info dumps which killed the flashbacks in this book. To make a matters even more lame, the Ghost Blade isn't explained or fleshed out all too well. The massive epic battle between everyone against Witchhead and his evil army was completely skipped. The writers of this book must have been just trying to get this series over with as quickly as possible because for them to spent three books introducing all these characters only to skip the final battle is beyond infuriating! The ending isn't much better because the main villain who caused all this damage and hurt everyone is redeemed!!

They rushed this book and it was so short they jacked up the pacing, I won't be buying anymore of Dan and Jason's books and their publishing house Simon & Schuster just ignored all of the book's pitfalls. I truly believe that when you treat children like their idiots or deify them as precious little angels that must be protected from everything, you're doing that child a disservice. The reason why Avatar: The Last Airbender (TV Show) and the Bone graphic novel are legendary series is because they treat children with respect and tackle some interesting and complex issues without going overboard to the point to where they'd be seen as inappropriate.  Dav Pilkey, the writers of the Dog Man series and the clowns who wrote this book need to take some lessons from those franchises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1676k0b/i_just_finished_reading_barb_and_the_battle_for/,2023-09-01T13:02:36Z,3,4,books,The Idiot,POST
6r085j,I hate the fact the highschool/college has ruined pleasure reading for me,"When I was a kid I used to read every night before bed, usually way above my reading level. It was the only way i could get to sleep. I used to blow through books like it was my job, and I enjoyed it. I was the only person in my friend group who was a ""reader"" too, and that was something I was proud of. Then high school came along and, as you all are well aware, I was forced to read books for the curriculum. Some of the books I enjoyed, like Brave New World and Macbeth, the latter of which I mainly enjoyed due to breaking the story down in class. But for everyone book I did like, there were two that I did not, and of course, I had to read it anyway unless I wanted to flunk out. My pleasure reading grinded to a halt around the end of freshman year, and even now, two years after graduation, I still struggle to finish a book. I can't really explain it, maybe I lose interest quicker or just the overall experience of reading was tainted. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but it really does bother me at times. Like why is it that, of all things, SCHOOL is the one that robbed me of the love of books, I think that's a real problem. Maybe with the way American school systems are set up now, or maybe I've just gotten lazy.

xvpnje,The Goldfinch won a Pulitzer and it sucks,"I don’t often put my thesis statement in the title but I don’t want to leave any confusion here. This book is terrible.

I went in knowing literally nothing about the book, which is honestly how I go into a lot of books. I’m not one of those weak souls who’s [terrified of spoilers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSRWJMM98pM) or anything like that, but I usually don’t need to know anything about a novel to give it a chance. The fact that it’s an award-winning novel is often enough for me to at least pick it up from the library.

That’s how I got here. And in service of keeping you from making my same mistake, I’m here to tell you that this book is definitely not worth your time. More than that, it’s not even worth your library card’s time.

## or, Intrigue!

The novel begins engaging enough, though I’ll tell you now: I hate books about New York for two reasons:

1. New York sucks
2. Because I’m an idiot who reads a lot of books, I have been reading about New York since my brain was the consistency of pancake batter and I have already memorized every street name and every story about young sensitive people with too much money and not enough sense.

Honestly, if you’re going to write a novel set in New York or if you’ve already written it or if you’re writing it now, change the setting. Even keep all the details identical but just say it’s taking place in Indianapolis. Don’t even edit out the many inevitable references to Brooklyn or subways rides. Just say that all of this is happening in Indianapolis and when anyone asks why Indianapolis sounds exactly like New York, just say it’s science fiction and stare at them without blinking until they’re like, “Uh, yeah, I get it.”

But because I didn’t bother learning even a single thing about the novel before starting, I didn’t hold this against it. Instead I just powered through, which is pretty easy because Tartt is a fantastic writer of a certain type of scene. The language and voice carry you along, lulling you into a sort of stupor so you don’t even care that part of you is wondering if this is just Catcher in the Rye for the 21st Century.

And then the bombs go off.

I really cannot describe how shocking this was to me. It felt like a rather mundane literary novel got invaded by a thriller and when you asked what the hell just happened the novel was just like, “Get on board, fella: we’re barreling to hell!”

When you’re on a rollercoaster, you may as well throw your hands in the air when it plummets back down to earth.

The chaos of the moment causes our young narrator, Theo, to steal The Goldfinch, a very famous and very expensive painting and take it home after being unable to find his mother.

The next hundred or so page deal with the fallout of this event. Theo is taken in by an excessively wealthy family. His former best friend is the son of this family. We get a lot of great interactions and relationships built. The effortless power of this section allows her to flex the novel quite a bit. And even though I think it mostly leads to disaster, it kept me reading because of how well the foundation of the novel is laid.

I really have to say: the first quarter or so of this book is just fantastic. It’s the perfect omelette.

It’s also a Victorian novel.

## or, the Ruined cathedral

A growing disquiet brewing inside me for months has made the following question ring in my head like a gong at midnight:

*What if I’ve already read all the good books?*

The question is both ridiculous and potentially more accurate than I’m comfortable with. I mean, obviously there are more books out there I’ll like a whole lot. The amount of books published through history may as well be infinite, but I do think I’m already familiar with the majority of writers I will truly love in life.

I read a lot of books. Thousands of them.

If this sounds like me bragging, ask yourself if you have ever been impressed by the number of books someone’s read.

Over the last few years, I’ve had varying degrees of success with reading fiction. Often, I find many books disappointing. Even ones that win awards or all kinds of acclaim. I’ve read pretty widely across genres as well, though it’s possible Romance, that great untapped fount, holds a great deal of promise.

I’ve been dipping my toes back into the 19th Century because many old favorites live there and so it was that I ended up reading Tess of the D’Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy, a novel perhaps most famous for the ways Hardy leverages culture and plot against his heroine.

Tess of D’Urbervilles is a moral novel. A brutal cultural critique. But this also makes it somewhat silly.

Many novels of the time period functioned this way. Sort of primers for behavior. Art meant to engineer society by giving people models of Right Action or at least by giving them models of Bad Behavior.

Much of this involves putting the protagonist through a lot of misery, excavating their heart and mind for the powerful emotions boiling beneath the reserved dignity of the age.

It’s a bit funny reading these old novels. Thomas Hardy is a great writer, pumping out luxurious prose and even creating masterful scenes of tension and desire. But he’ll race through years of summary so that he can capture an entire lifetime between his pages. And all that summary is largely to turn our complex characters into stock characters and/or metaphors for virtue or vice.

## or, the coney island sandcastle

The novel begins to go wrong once Theo’s estranged father returns. This section is also the last memorable part of the novel. For better or worse, it also holds the key to the action driving the rest of the narrative.

Where the opening section packed itself full of character interactions and intriguing scenarios and even moments of great emotional clarity or distress, this is where Tartt begins summarizing the novel.

I’m not against summary, by the way. But when you spend 30 pages writing a conversation between two drunk teenagers but summarize moments that change a relationship between characters, we have a problem.

For example: we get a lot of Boris in this section. Structurally, this makes sense because Boris is the hinge of the whole novel.

## A Brief Aside About Being a Teenage Dirtbag

As I have said before: I was an idiot. I have lived a stupid and sometimes dangerous life. My teenage years were a wash of depression, alcohol, insomnia, broken hearts and broken limbs, and a constant urge to die, to be dead, and the love shared between friends and almost lovers.

The relationship between Theo and Boris was made for me. Or, it should have been. I lived this stupid life, minus all the wealth. I was an idiot spending almost every night drunk with friends who I was so close to that the thought of being apart from them seemed worse than anything.

My friends were my family.

My relationship with my actual family has always been fraught. During high school, especially, I was very distant from my family. My family felt like six strangers forced to live together, but without all the fun and excitement of a season of The Real World. Instead it was more like six strangers trying to avoid one another in the same house.

And so I understand Theo and Boris. I was them.

The fact that this relationship did absolutely nothing for me in the book has got to be one of the biggest failings of the book. I was so predisposed to connect directly and fiercely to these characters living this deranged teenage life that Tartt didn’t even have to do much to make me feel this viscerally.

And yet!

All we get is summary for everything that matters, with so much of what matters in the novel skipped in service of…well, this is the whole problem.

## or, return to the coney island sandcastle

But Theo is living with his estranged father.

Their relationship is tense and awkward and very uncomfortable. But then, seemingly at random, Theo tells the reader that his relationship has improved dramatically with his father. He then summarizes a change in feeling that happened over the course of months.

It sure would have been great to see this! Instead, we had another scene drenched in shame between Theo and Boris where they seem poised to become lovers but never do.

Of course, the reason she summarizes this change in feeling is because it doesn’t actually matter, except to the degree that it moves the plot forward. Theo and his dad become closer just so that Theo’s dad can manipulate him into handing him a big chunk of his inherited wealth (this, of course, doesn’t go through), which leads directly to the death of his father, which sends him back to New York, Boris-less.

After the time jump, we’re back into the rhythm of his life in New York and Theo’s a drug addict but mostly just an asshole.

Slowly, I came to think Tartt had done something brilliant here: she pulled us in for 400 pages with a rather mundane literary novel only to then deliver us a thrilling art heist.

Yet once again, we don’t see Theo do any of this. We see Theo talk to Hobie for dozens of pages at a time, but we don’t see Theo do anything that’s actually driving the plot.

He’s sort of on the run as a conman and forger, amassing massive amounts of wealth by lying to rich idiots.

Do we see him pull off one of these cons? Do we see him getting deeper and deeper into this predicament?

No. We’re just told that it all happened later.

The novel becomes a you-had-to-be-there story strung together by dramatic scenes of tense dialogue between characters who were very well established and important to the first 150 pages of the novel.

Beneath it all is the fact that Theo still has The Goldfinch. At this point, he believes returning it would land him in prison so it’s his deepest, darkest secret. He’s hiding from the law because of his initial crime and now, too, because of all the fraud he’s perpetrating.

While Tartt’s powers as an author are enough to keep the tension rising, the stress circling like a noose around Theo, it all feels very abstract. And then Boris comes back into the novel and it does sort of become a thriller, albeit a ridiculously dumb one, and then we finish with Theo moralizing for dozens of pages to end the novel.

## or, spilled milk to the gallows

That the entire novel hinges on his theft of The Goldfinch is just stupid. When he steals the painting, it makes a sort of perfect sense. He’s in shock and not really able to think about what he’s doing. That he doesn’t immediately return it is believable enough because teenagers are notorious idiots.

But it also requires the suspension of a brain for hundreds of pages. At any point, Theo could have just thought about this for one minute and brought the painting back. Or, if he was so terrified of getting caught, he could have just left an anonymous tip and placed it where the authorities could find it.

Yes, I get it. It’s tied to the loss of his mother, but it’s also just dumb. Or, it would be less dumb if the novel remained a slice of life novel about the bored and boring and disinterested property class choking America. But instead it sort of gestures towards becoming a thriller and even walks those beats for a while.

But the biggest problem with the novel is that the emphasis is almost always pointed backwards.

Theo and Hobie talk for literally twenty pages about furniture or whatever, but we just skip everything that actually drives the novel. Whether it’s Theo’s relationship with his shitty dad or even the moment when Boris steals the painting from Theo (honestly, it really seems like this moment not being on the page is just bonkers levels of stupid) or any single moment where Theo perpetrates fraud on the unsuspecting overly wealthy clients of his and Hobie’s store, we never see any of it.

We never even see Theo’s relationship with Kitsey until they’re engaged. This is despite the fact that Kitsey is actually in a lot of the novel as a character bouncing along the periphery of the narrative.

## or, you can pour ketchup on your eggs, you freak

So what are we left with?

A thousand pages of idle chatter and the tension of consequences to actions we never witnessed.

It’s just bizarre. The structure of this story makes no sense. Tartt is a master when it comes to scene construction, but I have to ask: why did you choose so many scenes that have no consequence and leave out all the scenes that matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xvpnje/the_goldfinch_won_a_pulitzer_and_it_sucks/,2022-10-04T20:24:59Z,14,0,books,The Idiot,POST

Then I heard somewhere about a month ago that Holden is writing from a mental institution, something I didn't pick up on the first time round (I must have not been paying proper attention in the first few pages). I decided to give it another go and the book completely changed, especially my opinion of the ending. It's now no longer about a spoilt kid wandering aimlessly through New York but about someone who is really struggling, the revelation he was writing about his last few days before he was taken to a mental institution means I read it in a different light.

If anyone else has the same experience, coming away from reading it and being underwhelmed, I thoroughly recommend going back and rereading. I know I'm an idiot for not picking it up the first time around, but it really did make me understand Holden so much more, he felt less of a phoney.

Tl;dr I was a phoney and missed that Holden was admitted to a mental institution, rereading it after some time made it a completely different experience",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8fdqi4/i_just_finished_rereading_the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2018-04-27T18:06:43Z,35,32,books,The Idiot,POST

q9eww4,Dracula by Bram Stoker is the most misogynistic book i have read thus far.,"Since the start of the pandemic and the destruction of regular television I have started reading again.  I decided to read the classics and have been choosing at random books to read from various top 100 lists on the internet.  Since 2020 i have read:

Albert Camus
- [ ] The Plague
- [ ] The Stranger

Dostoevsky 
- [ ] Crime and Punishment
- [ ] The Idiot
- [ ] Brothers Karamosov

Tolstoy
- [ ] Anna Karenina
- [ ] War and Peace

Stendhal 
- [ ] The Red and the Black

Mary Shelly
- [ ] Frankenstein

Voltaire 
- [ ] Candide

George Orwell
- [ ] 1984

Harper Lee
- [ ] To Kill a Mockingbird

Gabriel Garcia Marquez
- [ ] 100 years of Solitude

Ralph Ellison
- [ ] The Invisible Man

Aldous Huxley
- [ ] Brave New World

Jack London
- [ ] Call of the Wild

Bram Stoker
- [ ] Dracula

Truman Capote
- [ ] In Cold Blood

I have enjoyed most books on this list, save for one.  Dracula, though written well after books like Anna Karenina or The Red and the Black, seems like it was written by a more basic and primitive human.  From quotes like

 “I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears”

or

“we want all her great brain which is trained like man’s brain”

And there is even a whole bit about killing your wife before another man can get to her and how “noble” it is.  Its like some incels fan-fic about how women are completely powerless in the arms of a “foreign” man and incapable or thinking or acting for themselves.  They seem to be nothing but the prize for the men in the book as a reward for their efforts in banding together to kill off a dangerous foreigner.  

Maybe i am reading it all wrong but compared to all the other books on my list this one felt so simplistic and skewed to one view point that i feel like it should never belong on any top 100 lists of the greatest books of all time.  Is it purely because it outlined the modern view of vampires that it is so well regarded?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q9eww4/dracula_by_bram_stoker_is_the_most_misogynistic/,2021-10-16T16:05:45Z,41,0,books,The Idiot,POST
wmi259,Ending to Up Country by the great Nelson Demille (SPOILERS),"Firstly I have to say I love this guys books. His main character's response to pretty much every situation (humour - mainly cynical sarcasm - especially when dealing with officious idiots) just speaks to me and cracks me up. Add that to great plotting and storytelling and you have a winner every novel.

SPOILERS:
I just finished the second Paul Brenner novel and thoroughly enjoyed the ride through modern day Vietnam. What I wasn't 100% on was the very open ended future of Brenner in relation to the likely future president (what would he do with the info, what would the president-to-be do about his past potentially being made public).

I'm guessing this was in case he decided to pick the story up again with a follow on book. I read that Brenner hasn't yet had another story of his own though, but features in Panther (a later book in the brilliant John Corey series).

Does the goings on in up country get mentioned in panther? I'm reading in order and am a couple of books behind in the series so won't find out for a bit. I'm trying to savour the series and resist the urge to read them all one after another.

18one4e,Listened to the audiobook of If I Could Have Your Face,"Stumbled across this book via Spotify's audiobook recs and started it bc I had a long week of boring admin tasks ahead of me. It actually made me look forward to them, which is wild. Also, I loved having a separate narrator for each protagonist.

So, right, I first checked it out bc the description made it sound like each girl was doing something socially unacceptable. Like, the title drop comes from the second chapter, which is from Kyuri's perspective. She's a relatively nice neighbor who takes care of her artist roommate, who initially comes off as pretty sheltered. She's also a call girl who had plastic surgery to get ahead in her career. And we listen to her talk about bringing a photo of a pop star to her consultation, as she wanted to get ahead in her field of work. She sits next to said pop star in the plastic surgery clinic and thinks about how if she had that chick's face, she wouldn't do things like get into dating and coworker bullying scandals.

But it's not just about the face of some celeb who proceeds to get slut shamed for dating a boy band member that Ara (one of Kyuri's neighbors) likes. It's really a book about perspective, and wanting stuff others seem to have, even as they deal with their own issues. It's obvious in the scenes like Wonna, their downstairs neighbor, musing about how carefree and happy these girls seem to be. All while dealing with a seemingly nice, yet distant husband she only married bc she wouldn't have a mother-in-law with him (and bc it was an escape from her previous situation).

She doesn't really hear Ara because she's mute. She works at a hair salon, stans the most popular member of a pop group, and is overall happy to have escaped her hometown. People always seem to think she's dimwitted, nevermind that she's imo one of the biggest realists in the cast. Well, aside from her blindspot regarding that one pop singer and the indulgence in the slut shaming bit.

And we've got Miho watching it all. She's in fine arts, managing to self-support. Yet she's not particularly free, beginning with the bit about not cutting her long hair because of her department head and a too-nice-to-be-true rich boyfriend. Also not a saint, as she uses people she knows as inspo without any real permission. I still liked her well enough bc she treats her roommate's occupation like an honest job (and hell, it's a lot more honest than the drunk, cheating businessmen she works with imo).

These characters each had an interesting perspective to follow and I didn't really have a narrator I groaned at getting (which can happen in multi-POV novels). Also, the evolution of their relationships had my full interest. Like, there was some pretty interesting blink-and-you-will-miss foreshadowing for it, like the convos that happened around the gender of Wonna's kid. 

And the social commentary grabbed me as well. It was in the stuff like her worries about the cost of daycare and what kind of dumpster fire world she's even bringing a kid into. And in Ara's experiences as an unusually quiet hairdresser. And Kyuri's discussion of entitled rich guys. And the way that Miho keeps getting treated as part of her artwork's marketing. Plus a ton of other things. Yet somehow, it doesn't feel like an after-school special for grown-ups. 

Anyways, I was invested within a few chapters and cried (from joy) at the ending. Prob haven't had a similar tier of literary fiction experience since like Shuggie Bain or Sirens and Muses.

Edit: Local idiot remembers the title was actually If I Had Your Face. Anyways, the author is Frances Cha",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18one4e/listened_to_the_audiobook_of_if_i_could_have_your/,2023-12-22T19:53:46Z,8,10,books,The Idiot,POST
192jjoe,"Reading ""The power of your subconscious mind"" has been kind of a disappointment, is it actually as good as it is claimed and should I continue reading it?","So I bought ""The power of your subconscious mind"", being one of the most popular self-help books I was expecting great things from it, anyway I read a few pages and I was instantly disappointed. First of all, the start of the book is very ""magic-like"", the way the author talks about your subconscious mind sounds more like a fairy tale than actual science backed facts, and the stories mentioned later in the book make it sound like he actually believes that your subconscious mind is like a genie. For example he mentions a story about a woman that wanted a purse that she couldn't afford, so she really believed that she would have it and believed in the power of her subconscious mind. Later she got a present from her friend and it turned out to be the purse she wished for, moral of the story: if you really believe in something miracles just might happen to you. Reading the author's words on this it makes it seem that he believes she got the purse BECAUSE she believed in the power of her subconscious mind, and not because it was a coincidence or the person just somehow figured out what she wanted.

But this wasn't that bad and I just skipped it thinking the translation was probably stupid (I'm reading the book in my native language) and he really meant to say that you should have a positive mindset because you never know what might happen. After reading a few more pages I came to the section in the second chapter that I assume was supposed to be scientific proof of his theories on the subconscious mind, which he proved with studies on hypnosis and claimed you can make people believe they are dogs or cats and make them play the part, which happens because of your subconscious mind.

 To be fair I thought hypnosis wasn't real in the first place, but after doing a quick google search I found out it is a real thing, however it is not nearly powerful enough to force you to do something you otherwise wouldn't and you are just more open to suggestions, not full on doing anything you are told (my source: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22676-hypnosis). Asking chatgpt real quick gives this result: 

""Hypnosis does not possess the power to completely alter a person's identity or core beliefs. When individuals participate in stage hypnosis shows, they are usually open to the idea of acting in amusing or unconventional ways, and they may go along with the suggestions given by the hypnotist because of the social context or their willingness to entertain.""

This really made me question whether this is a book about actual science backed methods to improve your life or just (and I'm sorry for the language) and old man who's watched too many magic shows and actually believes in them.

So my question is this: Is the book actually worth reading and are the procedures described here actually effective despite (from my research) the pseudo-science approach.

j6pmvo,Lessons learned from The Grapes Of Wrath,"This novel has made me realize that I've become a bit of an apathetic jerk lately. Steinbeck, in his own brilliant way, has taught me that there is equal value in each individual experience. We're all a bunch of idiots on a tiny planet in a universe that's incomprehensibly large, to look down on what somebody else holds dear is senseless and I've been guilty of it.

The beautiful thing about great art is that the artist lives in the heart and minds of those that take in their art long after they're gone. John Steinbeck passed away in 1968 but he's still teaching us lessons in 2020. 

Oh yeah, how about that ending? God damn! I finished the book last night as I was going to bed and I had a hard time getting that image out of my head. 

Anyway, here's to Steinbeck and the artists that make us look inward, where upon introspection we learn and grow as individuals.

mkas01,The Greatest Piece of Literature ever written? Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy.,"A few months ago, I read the novel ""The Idiot"" by Fydor Dostoevsky, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I could relate to the ideas and themes the characters in the book casually discussed. That is what prompted me to read ""Anna Karenina"", because I expected to experience something similar from there.
Now, having read the book, I can confidently say that I am not in the least dissatisfied. The novel was remarkable, every single character was complex with their own thoughts and personalities, the parallel between the lives of Anna&Vronsky and that of Kitty&Levin was really great and, most importantly, the ideas and philosophy put forward in the novel, the thing for which I came here, was present more notably than it was in Dostoyevsky's novel and also more coherently. Aspects of the story transcends time, and can even be applied in our daily lives today.
I could go on and on about the things I liked about this novel, but yet, I can't shake the feeling that something was missing. The realism might be phenomenal, the themes might be way more relatable than what one would expect from a story about 19th Century Russian Nobility and Part 7 of the book was simply incredible- but for a novel considered to be the greatest piece of literature ever produced, it sure didn't quite feel like it.
It is undeniably one of the best ever written, but THE best? Am I missing something? 
I believe I understand why it is great, but why is it the greatest, that I do not. Could someone please clear it up for me?

aec4r,"Anyone ever bought from A1Books? Quite the scam, that one is.","First, let's just get it out of the way: I'm an idiot. Or, at least, I *was* an idiot when I thought of what a great deal the Pevear/Volkonsky translation of *War and Peace* was ([$9.97](http://search.a1books.com/cgi-bin/mktSearch?act=showDesc&ITEM_CODE=1400079985&WVSESSION_ID=2138023599)) and decided to buy it from a site I'd never heard of. 

So I give them my information; money is deducted from my account; order is being processed; I am cautiously optimistic.

Next day rolls around and there's a mysterious charge of $50 to my bank account from ""NCSoft.com."" I'm not a big gamer, and certainly didn't buy Aion and forget about it, so naturally I become pretty curious.

I google ""A1Books scam"" and, that's pretty much the end of my story. **That site is (periodically)* a scam.** [Tons of testimonies](http://www.resellerratings.com/store/A1_Techbooks) about being [fucked over](http://www.ripoffreport.com/Search/a1books.aspx) by them. Sending the wrong book, never sending a book, never getting a refund, etc. Also, there's no real way to contact them when things inevitably go awry. Their ""help desk"" on their site doesn't provide a number, or even an email address.

So, I suppose I just wanted to put it out there for anyone who might've ever been tempted by a questionable online seller such as this. And if anyone's curious, I've already sent NCSoft an email about it, so hopefully they'll cancel the transaction. Oh, and I'm getting a new card tomorrow. I've actually been meaning to do that anyway.

**EDIT:** Reading more of the stories of people, it seems like there are still quite a few satisfied customers out there. Whether or not they're actual customers is anybody's guess, but it makes me think that it's really a toss up with them. Funnily enough, they even send people books that just have similar titles. 

There's certainly a good chance that I won't ever get my book, or my $10 back, but there still seems to be *some* chance that they'll send me the book. Realistically, assuming they send me anything, I'm waiting for them to send me the wrong translation. Or *The Art of War*, or *Peace and War*, or something.

**EDIT2:** I seem to have glossed over the $50 thing. I hardly ever use my card, so this charge was too convenient. What completely convinced me was that I found that the same thing happened to [this guy](http://www.resellerratings.com/profile.pl?user=605578) last month.

What series have you found to be such the case?,"I finally caved and read Divergent and to my surprise I quite liked it. However the follow-up, I'm struggling with. The narrator's tone amplified the immaturity and whiny candor that's typical of a pre-teen girl, but it's often overdone and in pretty unrealistic situations. The outbursts were so cringy I had to stop. The point that killed it in it's entirety for me in Insurgent was when Christina approached Tris in the Dauntless HQ after returning from Amity, to tell her she's starting the forgiveness process >!for Tris shooting Will.!<

And what followed was a full paragraph of idiotic, childish yelling. I get that the main character, and surrounding cast are suppose to be teenagers, but growing up in an environment like this, where a multitude of people have died would sort of harden them a little.

The writing also took a step backwards (which is telling considering the criticism of the first book). Every other interaction is patterned at this point.

b9fib7,"I’m currently reading Crime and Punishment, I wish I could find it interesting but the language can make it hard to follow.","I’m about 100 or so pages in and so far I’m enjoying the plot, the characters and Dostoevsky’s writing. His use of monologues are interesting, however the fact this book was written in the 19th century can make it hard to follow. I sometimes find myself struggling to understand what Dostoevsky is trying to convey at certain times, which puts me off continuing to read it.

I don’t want to sound like an idiot that is out of his reading league, but this is the first novel I’ve tried to read for a few years, mostly reading true crime biographies. Maybe it’s due to the fact that I’ve jumped straight into the deep end with trying to read a difficult book. But what would people recommend I could do to make this read more enjoyable for me? I will finish this book as I find not finishing it even more pointless, but I want to be able to enjoy it to the fullest extent it was supposed to.

Just finished this saga and wow, what a ride. Loved it. I know I’ll miss the world/worlds and the characters met along the way. 

I had commented on an earlier thread that I was near finishing the last book and I was forewarned about the ending/endings. I get it. 

The first ending felt good. Roland had accomplished his life long pursuit. Susannah was back in a familiar home with versions of Eddie and Jake. It felt good. There was a nagging “but what’s in the Tower?” that I kept asking myself during the epilogue. And then came the second ending. The one King himself will warn you about prior to reading it.  That second ending is something else. I loved it. “Ka is a wheel.”  It makes sense for it come back around. Ending the last book with the first line of the first book made me smile like and idiot and just shake my head. I can see how people might hate it. Our poor hero Roland is destined to do it all over again. This time however he has the horn. And now I ask myself how much the story would change now because of that horn.  I’d love to read that version. But there are other worlds than these, and I’m sure that version exists in one of those...

At the end, I felt that it was just to much for men to endure. I can't comprehend what it means to fight for survival as men in such wars have and to live and reenter civilization. This is a must read. I will end with a quote from the book. 

“Too many people learn about war with no inconvenience to themselves. They read about Verdun or Stalingrad without comprehension, sitting in a comfortable armchair, with their feet beside the fire, preparing to go about their business the next day, as usual.  
One should really read such accounts under compulsion, in discomfort, considering oneself fortunate not to be describing the events in a letter home, writing from a hole in the mud. One should read about war in the worst circumstances, when everything is going badly, remembering that the torments of peace are trivial, and not worth any white hairs. Nothing is really serious in the tranquility of peace; only an idiot could be really disturbed by a question of salary.  
One should read about war standing up, late at night, when one is tired, as I am writing about it now, at dawn, while my asthma attack wears off.

12gaxdq,"I’m getting really pissed about how some people criticize Sanderson, and the implications it has on the reading community as a whole.","This is gonna be a long one, just letting ya know.

Okay, so I’m a fan of Sanderson. His works were the beginning of my obsession with reading, and continue to inspire and entertain me. They’ve helped me through struggles with mental illness and familial trauma, and have shown me a way forward in times of need. They’ve always been an integral aspect of my experience not only as a reader but as a human. 

Since Sanderson’s rather recent rise in popularity, and even more recent public debasement via a Wired article, I have seen a lot of criticisms of his writing. Mostly these criticisms are of his prose. If you aren’t familiar, Sanderson writes very simply. His prose are as direct as they can be, built to be accessible. This is something Sanderson himself has made a point of stating is intentional and necessary to his motivations for writing in a recent blog post; he would like to let as many people “inside” as possible. I was, of course, one of those people. 

Although deliberate, his writing style is not for everyone. It results in a lack of subtlety in communicating character motivations, machinations, etc. and it inhibits his ability to build a rich atmosphere and tone. Personally, I wish Sandersons prose were more flowery, as my ideal is a blend of simplicity and complexity akin to the style of Murakami. 

Here is where my annoyance comes from: people equate taste with quality. I have seen multiple posts and reviews that not only “criticize” his prose but actively insult him as an author and a person to communicate how vehemently these people despise his writing and the praise he receives. They go out of their way to say that it’s trash, and not only devalue him but devalue his readers; making the case that anyone who enjoys his writing has the reading comprehension of a child and an inability to think critically.

I understand how his writing isn’t for everyone, it isn’t for ME at times. It needs to be balanced out with something more rich and nuanced. That anyone could stand there and insult a large portion of readers just because their taste for “higher literature” isn’t met by a popular author disgusts me. These readers seriously fail to grasp the concept of subjectivism and stumble their way through rationalizations of extreme “objective” opinions that are themselves based on personal taste. I do not understand how one can think this way. 

This is an issue much larger than Sanderson though. As popularity in reading grows on social media, and big name authors in multiple different genre spheres rise to popularity, more and more “fans” degrade each other for their taste in books. Reading YA, or reading Sanderson, is considered low effort. It’s for stupid readers who can’t grasp more complex themes and inaccessible writing, idiots who can’t appreciate the classics. The same goes for readers of fantasy in general. Anyone who values these stories above others is unintellectual, apparently. This stance seems to be so adamantly defended as well, people somehow feel attacked that anyone could enjoy something “low-brow”. What’s up with that? 

I, for YEARS, thought that I shouldn’t like Sanderson. I thought that the stories which had been so foundational to many of my personal beliefs, the characters who had brought me nearly to tears and motivated me to continue through life, I thought that in order to be valuable as a reader I could not like Sanderson. I tied my self worth to my lexile, my ego was dependent on one defining characteristic: what grade I sometimes choose to read at in a medium of art most commonly consumed for enjoyment. This community, through gate keeping and belittling anyone that doesn’t conform to their narrow view of what’s intelligent, has become a toxic, often harmful place to be. Even today, as I read and enjoy an author I love, I feel guilt that I’m not reading the other book I’m working through, which has dense prose and a more intellectually focused plot. 

I know this topic has been beaten to death, but dear lord did I need to get that off my chest. To anyone who’s fed up with this as well: your worth, ability, and intelligence ARE NOT dependent on whether or not you read fucking Shakespeare or Cassandra Clare. You are not WRONG for enjoying what you enjoy, and the knowledge you gain is no less inherently valuable. YOU make what reading means to you, YOU make what matters. We have a culture that’s unhealthily obsessed with intellectualism down to the entertainment we enjoy, and that obsession often leads to insecurity. Recognize the true inherency of the knowledge you gain through entertainment: it is as valuable to you as you make it, and no one can tell you that what’s valuable to YOU is wrong.

7pcb6z,‘The Power of Positive Thinking’ - a deceptive and misleading title.,"Written by Norman Vincent Peale, the exterior has no mention of the book’s true contents. I bought it on Amazon after seeing it was well rated and the blurb was intriguing. 

It just became the first book I have ever shelved without finishing. Every page is filled with ‘God this’, ‘God that’ and various bible stores / stories about how the church has helped people

If the writer wishes to be Christian and believe prayer will solve mental health issues, then that’s his right to do so. But to write a book that has no mention on the exterior of religion at all, is deceptive to say the least. 

I opened it expecting practical and relateable stuff, I usually enjoy books of this nature so it was really disappointing to see that the whole book was a dressed up sales pitch for Christianity. The foreword and intro did hint at this, and the first chapter just delved deeper. I resolved to substitute any mention of a god for ‘self belief’ or similar. By the end of the second chapter it was unbearable, so I decided to pick points at random to see if the theme continued. 

It did. Extensively. 

A more appropriate title would be ‘The Power of Masking True Intentions To Sell Millions of Copies to Idiots Like Phoxa on Reddit’. I feel deceived. Thanks Norman!

Some comments I've read regarding this theme are less than impressed by it. They're convinced that when push comes to shove, we're all generally good people and in the face of peril we'll always opt for cooperation. 

Call me a pessimist but I don't buy it. Generally, I do believe that we all want to do the right thing. However, if history has taught us one thing it usually doesn't take more than a charismatic idiot profiting off of the fear and paranoia of the masses to convince everyone to throw that ""do the right thing"" stuff out the window and give in to their more base urges and instincts.

i0o2xc,I don’t know if I should finish Ken Follett’s Pillars of the Earth,"I started reading the book a week ago and I’m currently about a third in. I’m not sure if I want to continue reading.

It started off okay and I was intrigued by Ellen and the role she would obviously play throughout the book, and curious when and how Tom would finally get to build his cathedral. 

But now, a third of the way through, I hate most of the characters. Ellen’s action to have sex with Tom a mere few hours after his wife died seemed... questionable and made me a little annoyed with her, but okay. But after that I only got more sad, annoyed and angry. A lot of the men behave like frightened, egotistical, shallow idiots in my opinion, to the women and to each other. I’ve had to put the book away multiple times in the past 24 hours because I just got too anxious about the rape scene (I skipped over as much as I could) and all the misfortune after that. I got especially angry after Richard first tries to protect Ariana when William and his groom rape her and then doesn’t care if she becomes a whore against her will once they’re in the city, because he’s hungry. I mean, really?

The reason I’m posting here and not just putting the book away is that I’m not sure if this is just Follett’s writing style or if the book develops into something else. I still find the premise interesting that the book follows the building of the cathedral over multiple generations and I’m curious what will happen in that regard. But I can’t stand the characters. Does the book develop into another sort of tone, or should I stop?

If anyone could give me an explanation, that would be nice.

Also, my thoughts on the book are that it was alright. Nothing really special, didn't really have anything to say, I'm sure it was more controversial when it first came out.

So as it occurred to me that I couldn't possibly respond to every comment, I decided to make this edit. I actually wanted to adress the questions yis all had for me. 

1. I DON'T HATE THE BOOK! Jesus Christ a lot of you got the impression that I hated this book. I DO NOT! I merely just think that it's not special. It's somewhat of s good book, but just not a masterpiece. 

2. I was 17 when I read the book. So you can't really say I was too old or anything when I read it. I will pick it up when I'm older, but stop using this argument please.

3. A lot of people were saying that I needed to know the context of when it was released. Well I do know that context, but it doesn't matter. I wanted to know why people TODAY thought it was a masterpiece. I have no doubt that it was very controversial for it's time. But it's not the 1950s anymore. Because that today it's nothing more than a young adult novel. 

4. Also some people were asking if I ever suffered from mental illness. All I will say is that I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions before. 

In conclusion, I don't hate the book, it's enjoyable enough, just not a masterpiece. Also stop commenting please, my phone is literally blowing up.

peiw7o,Do people who proudly hate on Catcher in the Rye know it’s about CSA?,"**CW: mentions of child sexual abuse (""CSA"")**

I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time. We’ve all heard that liking this novel is a “red flag” and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel.

As someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He’s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it’s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: “that kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.”

I feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn’t this very obviously a trauma response to unspeakable suffering? Catcher in the Rye isn't about Holden being an ethical model to follow- instead, Holden is deeply flawed and poorly adjusted because he has not been given the resources to heal from the trauma he's suffered. The novel’s approach to sexual violence doesn’t even begin and end with Holden - it permeates the novel, from Jane Gallagher (who is being abused by her step-father) to the sex worker Holden meets in the city to the sexual violence/aggression Holden knows his peers enact against other students and girls he knows.

It’s a really weird “flex” that people think dunking anyone who identifies or likes Holden is impressive. Do people realize that some CSA survivors, especially boys who are far less likely to speak up about their abuse, may see themselves in Holden? Are they aware that finding Holden annoying for whining or being pretentious or jaded or depressed likely perpetuates the idea that the only good victims of abuse are the noble, palatable ones (ie the ones that don’t actually exist outside of movies)? What do y’all think?

iqhbls,Catcher In The Rye may have saved my life,"I read Catcher In The Rye at one of the peak moments of my teenage depression. I was 14 and on a really awful holiday with someone I thought was my friend at the time, but of course she wasn't a true friend as herself and her family verbally abused and neglected me the entire time. I wanted to go home, I was also dealing with neglect there too, but at least it was home. Alas, they wouldn't let me. Looking back, it (the holiday) wasn't  the worst thing that has happened to me, but it certainly felt like it at the time. It was  the longest 16 days of my life. I will spare the details.

I guess I really related to how lost and depressed the protagonist felt. I remember thinking if Holden can make it back to NYC without committing suicide, then maybe I could make it back as well. I know he is supposed to be extremely apathetic, but I felt that in his heart he was hopeful for a brighter future. I cried whilst reading the book, numerous times.  Later we had to read it in class, most people found it boring which surprised me. I did make it back from that holiday but I dealt with a lot of depersonalization and derealisation for the next few months following. Life is better now, I like to think Holden's life improved also :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iqhbls/catcher_in_the_rye_may_have_saved_my_life/,2020-09-11T01:51:16Z,327,3481,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

It's one thing to be annoyed by the main character, it's another thing for a book getting vitriol because the central character is whiny. Catcher in the Rye receives a lot of criticism because Holden is a misanthropic, edgy teenager, but do people realize that this is a portrait of a psychological make-up of a traumatized and frustrated adolescent?

As I got older and gained more experience in the world, I think CitR made me realize how we often dismiss the mental well-beings of adolescents (especially male adolescents) and how they feel eternally trapped (while deluding themselves that they're different and better than the rest) as a result.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wzuy5s/i_didnt_hate_catcher_in_the_rye_more_as_i_got/,2022-08-28T13:00:25Z,341,4577,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

10hrg6o,Just finished Catcher in the Rye for the first time,"As with most books it took me a couple of chapters to settle into the narrative style, but once I did I  thoroughly enjoyed the way Salinger wrote this book.

I've seen a lot of people talk about receiving this book differently depending on the age you read it at. If I'd read this in my late teens/early 20s I feel I would've identfied with Holden's angst but I probably wouldn't have picked up on the themes of CSA and living with trauma which seemed obvious to me reading at the age of 29. 

I didn't find Holden pretentious as I've seen many say, if anything I felt empathy towards his character. He's clearly suffering with his own mental health, combined with an ongoing struggle to find his place in the world and an inability to express himself. I think this really lands during his date with Sally where we see him have an almost manic episode. 

His relationship with Phoebe again is something that I don't think would have landed the same with me if I read at a younger age. I don't think it's just their strong relationship that's as important to Holden compared to the preservation of innocence and ensuring she isn't corrupted by the things in the world that Holden despises so much.

upahwu,just read Catcher in The Rye for the first time,"Im 16 and we just read Catcher In the Rye for the first time.
I really like how schools push this book for such young students, its a jaded, traumatic, bleak and often depressing look on society (endearing at times i must admit)...all coming from a teen in the late 40's... 

all my classmates though Holden was a self-entitled, self-absorbed, immature, privelleged kid. 
No clue where this notion comes from, Holden clearly has experienced great trauma - what with coming to terms with social ostricization, losing his brother and extreme symptoms of depression and PTSD.

He's just a kid with trauma and a different personality who's trying to fit in at the end of the day, and its honestly quite ironic how society in the book looks upon him the same way many readers do; immature, privelleged brat. 

Anyhow, I really enjoyed the book. Its extremely unique and suprisingly relateable for the increasing number of depressed adolescents in todays age.

This kid is hilarious, often times when he repeated something or blatantly contradicted himself I laughed out loud (rare for a book). I started to think about stuff in his wording in my head at a certain point and yeah. I mean he complains about stuff but I just found it endearing, interesting but never annoying. He is such a nuanced and realistic/relatable character that I feel like I could imagine what he would think and say about anything. That's a brilliant achievement. One of the most well realized characters ever created in any medium, period. Also he's outwardly a really nice person. He cares deeply for his siblings, he asks to bring Ackley along to get burgers because he knows he doesn't have any friends. He gets pissed at Stradlater because of the way he only likes Jane for her looks and wouldn't care that she ""keeps her kings in the back row."" I wanna give this kid a hug.

wtso5x,Catcher In The Rye Apologist,"I've recently been asking my friends about their favorite book from high school and reading them myself. I just finished Catcher In The Rye and I owe the book's fans an apology. 

Not only do I love it, all the memes about what's ""wrong"" with the book are the parts I find the most compelling. The main thing folks seem to take issue with is Holden himself. Before I began I wholly accepted that Holden was an insufferable, pretentious, hypocritical phony, but that wasn't what I found at all.

 I really love Holden's characterization. I don't think I've ever seen a character go through a manic episode and breakdown in a way that feels so natural and unforced. I also enjoy the way in which he subtly wraps the story around his worldview. The scene where he strikes out with the girls from Seattle who he really didn't like *anyway* and was really doing a *favor* is probably one of my favorite examples of unreliable narration.

I do admit that Holden can be annoying at times. Not only is this clearly intentional, I think it's undoubtedly a good thing. Holden is still a kid and is struggling to articulate and control complicated feelings. That's what makes the inciting moments with Stradlater work for me. Not because Holden is on some ""nice guys finish last"" rant, but because it's something we've all been through when we were young. It can be surprising to realize you feel possessive over someone you were never really with in the first place and it's certainly frustrating to see someone you care about be with someone you don't think appreciates them. 

And lastly, it's so hard not to empathize with Holden. He's dealing with a lot. From still grieving his brother, to seemingly losing his older brother in a different way, [likely] sexual abuse and clear signs of mental illness it's clearly pretty tough to grow up!! 

I think that's the part of this books reception I don't really understand. It seems like the people who find Holden self absorbed and phony seem to miss all the important subtext and underlying humanity. It's like a weird circular game of pots calling kettles black. 

Even if you can't relate to being an angsty teen like Holden (and if you were calling Holden the real phony in English class you totally were) I just don't see how you can't feel for him. I can't help but see anything other than a compelling depiction of a scared kid and a frankly cathartic read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wtso5x/catcher_in_the_rye_apologist/,2022-08-21T06:32:38Z,60,297,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
ppc00e,Who is the target audience of Catcher in the Rye?,"Today was the second day of my AP Lang class (I’m a junior in hs) and my teacher was explaining primary and secondary audiences. He started off with an example, asking us if The Catcher in the Rye was written for us. Everyone shook their head, but I raised my hand to disagree. When he called on me, I said “it could be,” but he immediately interjected and said it wasn’t. 
His next example was asking if Romeo and Juliette was written for us as the primary audience, which I clearly agreed it wasn’t. He never did end up defining the two target audiences, only going as far as to say(/joke?) that Shakespeare er so I’m not sure what they wrote it because he wanted money. 
I wanted to argue that The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel that helps teenagers in finding a relatable character who has similar struggles with the confusing time of adolescence. When I read it (for school) two years ago, I found Holden extremely relatable and I really liked him. I know there are many teens and adults who despise him and think he’s annoying/selfish/you name it. To me, I think that he’s flawed for sure, but that’s what makes him such a compelling character. Is this not written for teens as the target audience? What makes a target audience in either case, and what’s the difference between primary and secondary? Who would be the primary audience for Catcher then?

Edit: I would like to clarify that I am not blaming my teacher for anything at all. He’s a well experienced teacher and is already becoming my favorite after three days of school. I’m sure a lot of the confusion in my post is my misunderstanding or misinterpretation, not his. We’ve only had two classes but I already really like how my teacher thinks and I’ve agreed with many of his opinions. I also didn’t mean to make him sound rude by cutting me off — I’m sure he had his reasons to.

y23v1,I just finished Catcher in the Rye and I have some questions.,"I asked my teacher for a summer reading list to get me prepared for high school, and immediately my attention was drawn to the controversial *Catcher in the Rye*. I wanted to read it because the controversy, but also because I always hear people saying how much they dislike it. I just finished it, and I really enjoyed it, but this leaves me with some unanswered questions.

The thing I enjoyed about *Catcher in the Rye* is Salinger's amazing ability to write from the perspective of someone my age. I always respect an author who can write from a perspective not their own. For example, in *The Brothers Karamazov*, Dostoyevsky, a devout Christian, puts forth the most excellent argument for the Problem of Evil that I have ever read--better presented than even Hume could do. 

Anyway, I do realize that Holden is an annoying person, something of a whiny brat. However, Salinger does an incredible job capturing the angst and feelings of someone my age--something I feel is beaten out of adults as they steadily have to conform to social norms and what is expected of them. I only wish more adults could read *Catcher in the Rye* and reconnect with the rebellious nature of their youths. If this were the case, I think the world might just be a better place, and people would be more apt to question the status quo. Also, it's an incredible commentary on the oft perceived degradation of society, and the hypocrisy of humankind (e.g., how can one be misanthropic and yet continue to live?). As well, I don't think you have to like the protagonist to enjoy the book. A good example of this is Ignatius Reilly, a person who is incredibly misanthropic, a total intellectual elitist, and who seems to suffer from social anxiety disorder; yet, he happens to be a fantastic character to study, superbly interesting, and, yes, even likable.

For those who disliked the book, I'd be interested in hearing why you disliked the book, and your thoughts on what I've said.

fddsji,The catcher in the rye,"I read this book back in January and I still think about it. I haven’t been feeling well mentally, so I can relate to Holden they way he just left without saying anything to anyone, the way he just want to have an honest conversation but fluctuate between sarcasm and authenticity. The bangs of utter loneliness and despair. The intense anger at the end. The farfetched dreams of leaving society. The delirious questions about the ducks and what happens to them in winter time.I feel like some more than others have an inherent personality flaws that lead them to be in a similar situation where they are alone and not entirely integrated with their environments and life. Maybe it was loss that started it, maybe Holden looked at himself and had an epiphany about how life truly is and how he can’t be hypocritical by just letting things go, moving on, putting a show because the show must go on. I don’t know maybe I got it wrong but I look around me and think that some people are more likely to be displaced and suffer some sort of existential crisis than others, they make impulsive decisions that derail them further and further from people around them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fddsji/the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2020-03-04T14:30:34Z,70,135,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

7q3ek3,Appreciating the subtle beauty in The Catcher in the Rye,"J.D. Salinger wrote it in 1951 (or, that's when it was published) to mixed critical reviews. Many loved it, most didn't, and it was subsequently banned from schools. Without giving anything away, it was ahead of its time. It's not about childhood bulling directly, but about not being able to fit in, and the problems that come with it. Very relevant today, when cases of bullying crop of regularly. 

It's one of my favourite books of all time, along with Catch-22, The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy & On the Road. Catch-22 is like the Rolls Royce of cars. So much luxury, such finish. It's like Heller pondered over each & every word in great depth, like a masterchef preparing a meal & contemplating each ingredient & how it might compliment or contrast the others. On the Road is like a Formula 1 car. Such speed. It feels like a buddy narrating a hilarious story to you for the first time. Unplanned, but fresh. One of the few books that, once you pick it up, it's really difficult to put down. The Catcher in the Rye, on the other hand, is like a bicycle. Easy pace that lets you take in the surroundings. It has a no frills tone that's easy to understand & pick-up on, and one that almost anyone with a remotely troubled childhood can relate to.

One of the things that gets me about this book is how plainly it's written. Ordinarily, a book this good is never written in such a simple tone, with such common, easy-to-undersand words. This is one of the few books, certainly the only one in my all-time list of books, that never made me reach for a dictionary. This is important. It was written from a 14 (or 15, I cannot remember exactly) year old's point of view, and reflected in the tone & expressions that are used. 

>I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me,...

-

>Sensitive. That killed me. That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat.

Salinger was 33 when he wrote it, but you won't know it by reading it. It feels like he got into the character's skin, and then fitted these masterful observations, deep emotions & simple complexities, in that voice.

The book also carries great emotional depth with such simple sentences. It isn't doesn't over-elaborated and made to feel heavy, but kept light, open ended. 

>What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to get a feel for some kind of a good-by. I mean I've left schools & places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to *know* I'm leaving it. If you don't you feel even worse. 

-

>I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll admit, but I hardly didn't even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie. My hand still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist any more--not a tight one, I mean--but outside of that I don't care much. I mean I'm not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway.

-

>All I need's an audience. I'm an exhibitionist. ""I'm the goddarn Governor's son,"" I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the place. ""He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in my goddam blood, tap-dancing."" Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense of humor.

-

>They don't do any damn more *mold*ing at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid or clear-thinking at all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably *came* to Pencey that way.

Another thing I love is the sharp observations that are littered all over the book, but pointed out in such a way that I can't help but smile at them. It feels like an adult's observation, but then he deprives them of any over-riding emotion, like criticism, anger, jealousy etc., and states them plainly.

>You take a guy like Morrow that's always snapping their towel at people's asses--really trying to hurt somebody with it--they don't just stay a rat while they're a kid. They stay a rat their whole life. 

-

>He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like ""Song of India"" or ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue."" He could really mess a song up.

-

>I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying to lead you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her.

-

>We had a terrific guy on the team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff.

I really appreciated Holden's commentary and humor and felt like he would've fit in well with my high school friend group. Never once thought of him as being spoiled (maybe that speaks more to me as a person, for better or worse). His personal troubles and the way he was going about dealing with them and coping were what spoke the most to me. Thought the ending was really great too. Left it on an optimistic note that didn't necessarily imply he was going to all of a sudden thrive in school, but instead made it seem like he had healed some on the inside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/102j3pe/just_finished_the_catcher_in_the_rye_and_i_loved/,2023-01-03T20:53:54Z,25,47,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
kw8k80,The Catcher In The Rye is a must read book. Here is why,"Hello Reddit I just finished reading catcher in the rye and I thought that it is a beautiful book.I know many people don’t like it because they think Holden is annoying spoiled rich whiny brat but he has suffered so much and clearly needs help. The whole flow of the book was understanding to me and the language accurate to what teenagers (me) think and talk like. I get that this book isn’t everybody’s cup of tea but it is worth a read. Holden obviously had trauma from grieving his brothers death, to dealing with several mental illnesses to feeling alienated and detached to society and having a pessimistic view on life. Throughout the book I cried and after the book I sobbed. I relate to Holden but I’m not an ass most of the time. I wonder where Holden would be today or in ten years? I like to think that he has a good job and lives with someone he loves and is happier. I will be reading this again multiple times. Anyways I recommend this book to everyone but make sure to have a sympathetic open mind.

Am I missing something? 

It was a load of crap. I understand why at the time it would’ve been seen as quite edgy and it got banned some places etc so got a reputation, but I don’t think it’s aged that well at all. 

I’m genuinely staggered that this book is still given such legendary status. It is one of the least interesting fiction books I’ve ever read with little to no redeeming qualities about any character in the entire book.

eek98q,The catcher in the rye is Phoebe,"I have just finished reading catcher in the rye and after reading forums and reviews for a few hours I havent seen anyone make this point. That Phoebe is acting as 'the catcher' in the story. She is  catching Holden before he falls off the cliff into spiralling depression. Holden is on the verge of adulthood and lost with no direction, as if running through a field of rye. Before she gets on to the carousel for the second time she plants a kiss on Holden and a kiss also features in the poem by Robert Burns: 

""Gin a body meet a body
Comin thro' the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body—
Need a body cry""

Obviously the original poem is of a sexual nature and Holden is viewing it in his childlike manner as completely innocent. That of someone catching children falling off a cliff when playing. (Which is a point that has been made many times). I also think that the cliff can represent self destruction and the catcher is meeting a depressed, lost individual and loving them and preventing them from falling off the cliff. Like Phoebe does for Holden. Phoebe also then represents the good nature of humanity. She sees the good in holden and is willing to help him (she wanted to come with him) and she shows him love. It was only her, a child, that had the warmth and depth to her soul to help Holden in the whole story. Also suggesting that adults tend to lose our kindness and humanity as we experience the harshness of the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eek98q/the_catcher_in_the_rye_is_phoebe/,2019-12-23T12:53:14Z,40,116,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

zxwycd,Catcher In the Rye - theme and ban discussion,"I was discussing Catcher in the Rye with my SO recently and I was caught off guard when he told me that the entire novel was about a spoiled rich kid who assumed that everyone around him was beneath him, and of course, that everyone other than himself was a phony. 

Don't get me wrong.. I have heard this argument at least a hundred times before, but my SO is very intelligent, so it surprised me to hear it come from him. 

My rebuttal, of course, was that the book was actually about loss, grief, dealing with said loss and grief, clinical depression, self destructive behavior and its' penultimate consequences, and finally, acceptance of the new reality for our character and all those who have had the misfortune of landing smack in the middle of his mentally unstable path.  

After talking about it for a while, I decided to read a few articles on the themes in the novel and came across dozens saying that the literary classic had been specifically pulled from a multitude of schools throughout North America due to concerns (and I'm seriously not joking about this) that teachers and students alike may misinterpret the messages presented in the book.  

Maybe this is just me.. but seriously?? Books are being banned because they are afraid that teachers aren't intelligent enough to convey the proper meaning behind it and/or students may be offended and misunderstand the ""adult"" context presented throughout?  It's kind of baffling to me if I'm being completely honest.

Regardless, I am curious how others feel about this, as well as the decision to ban it and what themes exactly.. are too controversial for a kid in say.. their 10th / sophomore year or secondary/high school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zxwycd/catcher_in_the_rye_theme_and_ban_discussion/,2022-12-29T05:31:15Z,15,16,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
mjejhu,Why I like The Catcher in the Rye,"I understand a lot of people do not like this book, this interpretation is my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. When I think of The Catcher in the Rye I think of the word ""haunted"". Specifically the poem by Emily Dickenson ""One need not be a chamber to be haunted"". Many human beings, in my view, float about the world being disliked by many because they are easy to anger, petty, annoying, cheap, lazy etc. But ultimately some of these people act out because they are haunted by something. And when you are haunted it is not easy to become unhaunted, and it is not easy to communicate the hauntedness, especially when you are a child. Because being haunted is not a material thing, there are not ghosts slamming doors or knocking over tables, it is something that lives inside you. 

When I was 14 I was suicidal and was haunted by things that happened to me as a child. I went to the guidance counselor one lunch period. I don't remember what exactly triggered me going to her, but I do remember I felt as though if I stayed in the cafeteria for a second longer I would explode. She was very nice but I have never been able to fully trust someone at that point and I was too scared to look her in the eye. I just ended up rambling about nothing and then leaving. I acted as if I was annoyed to be there even though I was the one who asked to visit her. I remember scowling at her, but at the same time I could feel tears trying to leak out of the corners of my eyes. That is what the Catcher in the Rye is to me. We are sitting behind a desk as Holden sits on the edge of a couch in front of us.

He is trying to tell us something incommunicable. But he is being evasive. He doesn't want to be there but he needs to tell someone his story. But his desperation is masked under his fear of being vunerable, of being found out, so what he really wanted to say remains veiled under a layer of posturing. Ultimately Holden is a protector, he cares about the ducks, about children, about his sister. He has deep love in his heart. But he is a child who is still haunted by the death of his brother and he possibly has been molested in the past. We sit at the desk and we can listen to him, but he does not really believe we care enough to help him. He tells us a story, but there is a story behind the story, something that can only be glimpsed at before he tries to distract with something else. Yes he is a whiny little brat, yes he is a hypocrite. But this is not a adventure book, no one is a hero. This is a book about a child, who is also a bit of a prick. Not everyone will like the book, and that is ok.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mjejhu/why_i_like_the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2021-04-03T18:44:01Z,29,100,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
dfd9se,"Just finished Catcher in the Rye, my life has been changed","I just finished The Catcher in the Rye and I had to discuss my thoughts on it. I didn't know where to post, so I hope it's okay for me to talk about it here.

I started the book on Saturday at 11pm and finished it on Tuesday at 5pm which sets a new record for me. I have never read a book so fast before. This book had me captivated the entire time! I can relate to Holden so much since I am also a 17 year old teen boy. Now that I'm in college and have a job, I find myself becoming more of an adult everyday and get kind of depressed over it. Sometimes I find myself overwhelmed by school and work, and I fear adulthood, just like Holden. Although I do not have the negative view of the world, Holden's desire for innocence and childhood strongly resonated with me. When I read about Holden wanting to be the catcher in the rye field to save the children from falling off a cliff into adulthood, I almost started to cry. This idea of catching children before they fall captured exactly how I feel right now. It made me upset and optimistic when Holden then discussed the golden rings on the carousel and how you can't stop children from growing up and becoming adult. Although I am upset there is nothing I can do to stop myself or other from growing up, I have to accept it. 

This book was exactly what I needed to read at this scary turning point in my life and I have truly learned a lot about myself and life from it. Although I am still fearful of adulthood and the phonies in the world, I know that there are people like Holden who understand what I am going through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dfd9se/just_finished_catcher_in_the_rye_my_life_has_been/,2019-10-09T06:47:29Z,66,113,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

pxkp10,So I just finished Catcher in The Rye.,"I thought it was a pretty good book overall. I liked just hearing about the life of Holden. Many people say that Holden comes off as preachy and annoying, which I can see but when you actually think about the reason he is like that it makes you understand his character more. This book is essentially about Holden dealing with his innocence coming to an end, and also him trying to numb the grief from when his brother died. He tries to numb the grief with buying things, sex, etc. Throughout this book it really presented Holden as aimless, which is a symptom of him dealing with the grief of his brother’s death. On the subject of the end of innocence, I think one of the best examples in the book that stood out was when Holden was walking into Phoebe’s school to give the letter to the principle, he saw “f*ck you” written on the wall. We see Holden get very annoyed and angry about this and he imagines Phoebe and her friends seeing it and being confused or scared. He proceeds to wipe it off the wall. This shows that Holden wants to preserve innocence of the youth. This book shows Holden being submerged into a world where he is aimless like a child. Hearing of his voyages around the city is like seeing the aimless journey of a depressed kid who does not know where he is going in life. I think this book accurately describes the feelings and emotions of somebody who is aimless and unhappy with their life, and somebody who is grief stricken. Obviously I could keep going talking about this book, but these were just some thoughts I had about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pxkp10/so_i_just_finished_catcher_in_the_rye/,2021-09-29T01:21:34Z,27,52,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

p03us1,"Discussion on ""The Catcher in the Rye"" - SPOILER FREE!","Hi!

I'm sure discussions about this book have already been held on Reddit too many times, but that isn't stopping me...

I have just finished J.D Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" and my head is filled with thoughts!!!

When it comes to my opinion on the book, I truly have mixed feelings. I'm not sure how to grasp them yet.

For personal reasons, and how I related to Holden's frustrations and his view on the world, made me really feel for his character and was probably what I enjoyed most about the book. Also, the irony that he called literally anyone, who wasn't his sister, a phony and ""fake"" while still being pretty much exactly that himself, was brilliant in my opinion.

Otherwise, it felt sort of...bland at times? 

I might just be too much of a pessimist. Before reading this book I had heard of so many people claiming this book had forever-changed them. While I (obviously) can't deny that that was the case for these people, that wasn't the case for me at all. I felt for Holden, I understood his frustration, I also tend to dislike most people I meet and have trouble meeting authentic people I genuinely admire - but that was about it for me. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I expected a lot more from this book that i, unfortunately, never got to experience.

Since finishing this book I have read countless reviews on it and I am incredibly fascinated by how different view people have on it. This seems to be a book you either hate, love or just find boringly mediocre. It's about a book, so there cannot be an objectively correct answer, which makes it all the more fascinating to me!

So, what I want to ask is, what did you think about this book? Did it change you in some way, and if so, how?

wkak1o,Franny and Zooey is so much better than The Catcher in the Rye.,"JD Salinger's most celebrated book is The Catcher in the Rye. Everybody applauds it as one of the greatest books of the 20th century. But why? In my opinion, The Catcher in the Rye, in terms of writing, depth, and storyline, is the 20th century equivalent of a modern tacky YA novel. If we celebrate the book for touching on the subjects it revolves around, then Franny and Zooey should be recognized more. 

Franny and Zooey is one of my favorite books, and touches on the subjects of The Catcher in the Rye but goes so much deeper than The Catcher ever did. 

If you loved or liked The Catcher in the Rye, tell me why you did cause I feel like I'm missing something.

fl15j1,The Catcher in the Rye at 15 and 30,"I imagine something similar has been posted before, but it’s amazing how differently The Catcher in the Rye reads when you’re 15 and then when you’re 30.

At 15: “This Holden guy really knows what he’s talking about. Fuck society!”

At 30: “What stuck up, ignorant, whiny little bitch.”

It’s pretty brilliant. When I read it as a kid, the book was a monument to my inflated sense of self-worth. Now, it reminds me of what it was like to be so sure of myself as a kid - or at least to act that way outwardly - but to be scared stiff on the inside.

gj6q59,The Catcher in the Rye wasn't all it's hyped up to be.,"I'm a 16 year old guy and I expected more from a book like this. Holden's quite the character and there's no doubt that the book hints at some pretty deep psychological issues that he hasn't quite come to term with, (until the end?) but I'm a huge fan of the coming-of-age genre and I'd much rather prefer books like Black Swan Green, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Some might even refer to J.D Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, as the king of coming-of-age books. My issue with the book is that it just feels like all the encounters Holden experiences are just regurgitated back to readers with a slight change in detail and it always ends with the protagonist, Holden, calling everyone a phony and ordering a scotch and soda. The main character is so complex, and at the same time, his personality is so simplistic because of the repetitive thought process that you're exposed to when reading this book. Now I'm not a fancy book critic but this book is officially cancelled coming from a guy the same age as Holden is in the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gj6q59/the_catcher_in_the_rye_wasnt_all_its_hyped_up_to/,2020-05-13T20:12:38Z,52,26,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

Maybe I was over-hyped up, expecting some gripping allegory and social commentary. However I not only found both books rather bland, but they missed the mark on both regards in my opinion. 

In fact, I am convinced that Holden Caulfield is one of the most lackluster and impotent protagonists that comes to mind.

Am I the only one who feels this way? I love classics, anything by Dumas, Doyle, Poe, Hemingway. I also enjoy Philip K Dick, and adore most fantasy.

sizopr,Thoughts on Catcher in the Rye?,"Catcher in the Rye is famous as being the favorite ebook of edgie teens for close to 70 years. It has been banned frequently and often ( unfairly) referenced as being “ brilliant”.

I am 5 chapters in. I don’t think it’s brilliant literature but I think it’s very entertaining and like it a lot. 

My observations so far.

1. Holden is an attractive protagonist. For all his sassy, moody attitude he seems like a moral actor of sorts. He’s selfish, but what teenager isn’t? He seems to have the right instincts of who is good or bad and rightly disdains “ phonies” or people who value superficial things. He’s also terribly funny in a dry, observant, dead pan way. 

His description of the norms and personalities at his elite ( Episcopalian) boarding school have echoes with me and the Catholic high school I attended. 


2. It’s a period piece but timeless piece. Holden Caulfield’s world is one few kids today experience, that of the WASP boarding school he flunked out of.  A lot of it is dated: how unsupervised kids in that time were, the slang/ banter, and the way Holden views women and how women were treated.  I think it’s a world that any teenager who came of age between 1950 and 1980 would have recognized and experienced. 

Still though, many teens today are alienated, and disillusioned with the society and school they are part of. Many are depressed and ignored and feel something is wrong with the society around them. Catcher is still relevant. 

3. It’s not a classic but it is good. It’s not brilliant  or cutting edge, but it is a great enjoyable and even moral work of fiction that I’m disappointed  wasn’t covered when I went to High school.

tcpj4g,Is catcher in the rye an outdaded book ?,"Okay i know the title is a bit weird, but i just read this book today. Someone told me if you like the movie taxi driver you should buy this book, so i buyed it. 

First i don't think the book is ""bad"" or great, i thinks its pretty readable, but whats disturb me the most, is the writing style, the pacing and the character. When i started the book i thought Holden Caulfield was a basic teenager, but his persona is so weird through the book. He speaks like a""teen bad guy"" but he his so passionate about litterature and reading books, he quote maybe 20 old school friends anecdotes but is playing the loneliness card. 

I don't know i feel like sallinger was forcing this ""teen"" aspect. Also i really don't think how he could go from just a simple kid fired of his college, to a depressed lonely kid in maybe less then 1 week.

There is no real event, its just like a trip for me, maybe the most bizarre event is the prostitute , i really thought he would go mad or something really bad happens to him. but really nothing happened.

The most beautiful passage for me is the ending with phoebe and the chapter in phoebe room (even if she feels like really intelligent for a 10 years kid)

Holden is entertaining and in someways relatable, but there’s never any huge change of his character. I’d love a discussion about the book. A few questions on the plot:
1. Does Holden end up in a mental institution? (“The psychoanalyst they have here”,”the woman’s wing”.)
2. Was Holden previously molested/assaulted? (Mentions people getting “Pervy” at least “20 times in my life”)
3. Does his mother have clinical depression? I suspect so as he uses the word “depresses” for anything that makes him feel in any way negative, showing a familiarity with the word but perhaps not it’s true meaning.

iu508b,I read The Catcher in The Rye.,"For over a year now, I've been hearing about this book ""The Catcher in The Rye"".

There isn't a single bookshop in my neighborhood, plus I rarely leave the house so I never really searched in many places. However, my dad bought it for me on my birthday two weeks ago. 

When I read chapter 2 I knew this book was gonna be something special. I loved how I understood how Holden was feeling. I was and still a little am, though not as much as Holden, judgemental and self-involved. My friends and I considered almost everyone we met phonies, however now I'm trying to control that tendency within me. It's nice to see a book that captures how most teenagers feel, and researching the book more, it's surprising how much us teenagers don't realize this tendency within ourselves.

bspuc4,Catcher in the Rye: Is it about coping with the effect of rape and molestation?,"I first read the Catcher in the Rye about 12 years ago in high school and this novel has always disturbed me a great deal. Many articles have been written about the Great Gatsby's unreliable narrator (Nick Carraway) and homosexual undertones, but much less has been written about the Catcher in the Rye's unreliable narrator and many hints of pedophilia and child molestation. This is what I think. Feel free to agree or disagree.

Jane Gallagher: Victim of child molestation by her ""booze hound"" stepfather, Mr. Cudahy. This was clearly implied by Holden Caulfield comment of him ""tried to get wise with her"". Her stepfather used to run around the house naked. She refused to answer her stepfather when he asked if there were any cigarettes in the house and later couldn't stop herself from crying in Holden's presence. They soon kissed without kissing each other's mouth. Holden bonded and identified with her because Holden himself was very likely also a victim of molestation (more on that later). Childhood trauma possibly caused Jane to become a ""slut"" in high school as she went on a date with Stradlater and was possibly raped again.

James Castle: ""Skinny little weak-looking"" (possibly gay) Castle allegedly jumped to his death while wearing Holden's turtleneck. He called Stabile ""conceited,"" so Stabile and ""six other dirty bastards"" went to Castle's room to torment him. Holden refused to tell us what they did to him because it was too ""repulsive"" but the clear implication was something sexually humiliating. My guess is rape, possibly with an inanimate object. It was also possible he was murdered and thrown off the window instead of jumping to his death. Mr. Antolini, who was later revealed as a sexual predator, was the one who carried Castle's body away, which implied a close relationship between Castle and Antolini. It was possible Castle was molested by Antolini.

Sunny and Maurice: Like Jane, Holden identified with and empathized with prostitute Sunny, who seemed to be around Holden's age, and put her on a pedestal. Her pimp, Maurice, came across as an exploitative pedophile.

Mr. Antolini: Married to a much older rich woman. Seemed to have a distant relationship with his wife. Fostered close personal relationships with male pupils, including Holden (used to play tennis together) and evidently James Castle. When Holden stayed over at his place, he called Holden ""handsome"", didn't provide Holden with any pajamas (presumably wanted him to sleep naked), and later pet Holden's face while he was asleep. When caught, he claimed to be just ""admiring."" My guess is Antonili and wife were each other's ""beards"" and touching Holden while he was asleep was part of the ""grooming"" process.

Even Antolini's ""advice"" could be interpreted as an offer to enter into a ""pederasty"" relationship. ""You’ll find that you’re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You’re by no means alone on that score. You’ll be excited and STIMULATED to know. Many, many men have been troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You’ll learn from them–if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It’s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn’t education. It’s history. It’s poetry.""

Stradlater and Ivy League bastard: Both guys have rape-y vibe. Ivy League bastard was feeling up his date under the table while simultaneously telling a story about a guy in his dorm who tried to commit suicide by overdosing an aspirin. The date was telling the Ivy League guy to ""Don’t, darling. Please, don’t. Not here."" This is similar to many of Stradlater's dates (""Please, don't. Please."" Stradlater clearly was a date rapist and Coach Ed Bankey was complicit in his effort given that he often used Bankey's car. After his date with Jane Gallagher, he didn't boast about his conquest, leading Holden to think “something had gone funny.” Holden fought Stradlater, but was easily manhandled. The implication was Jane resisted Stradlater and he raped her and traumatized her all over again.

Carl Luce: Holden's student advisor at a previous prep school was a ""fat-assed phony"", well-documented pervert, and possible predator 3 years older than Holden. Luce used to corrupt younger students (including Holden) with graphic descriptions of weird sexual kinks and fetishes, including beastiality with ""sheeps"" and homosexuality. He also had a habit of prying into younger students' sex lives. By Holden's telling, Luce knew ""who every flit (gays) and Lesbian in the United States was."" Additionally, Luce claimed gays could be ""recruited"". ""He said that you could turn into a flit practically overnight, if you had the traits and all."" And Holden suspected Luce was a closeted homosexual. ""I kept waiting to turn into a flit or something."" When Holden met up with him, he was in an odd relationship with a much older Chinese sculptress from Shanghai (cue to ""Asian Dragon Lady"" stereotype). Luce claimed he was dating her due to his preference for ""Eastern philosophy,"" which apparently considered sex as both a “a physical and a spiritual experience."" Reading between the lines, it seems clear that Carl Luce was a closeted homosexual who might've ""turned out"" Holden when he was his student advisor and was now being ""pegged"" by his significantly older Chinese girlfriend and enjoying being submissive to an ""Asian dragon lady.""

Holden: After fleeing Antolini's apartment, Holden revealed that similar ""perverty"" incident happened to him ""about twenty times since I was a kid."" Holden's flight made it obvious that Antolini's sexual advances set off a defensive trigger in Holden. This also made it obvious that Holden was molested, which explained both his affinity for fellow victims of molestation (Jane, Sunny) and his desire to be a ""catcher in the rye."" Later at the train station, he experienced a major freakout, developed diarrhea, and collapsed on the floor in a public bathroom. It seemed likely Antolini ""roofied"" Holden's coffee.

Phoebe: We now know most pedophiles were themselves molested as kids because it is ""learned behavior,"" which brings me to the most disturbing part of the novel. Holden's relationship with Phoebe was downright creepy and he was either desperately trying to suppress his incestous urges for her or already molesting her. He described Phoebe as ""nice skinny"" with ""nice, pretty little ears"" and ""really nice"" red hair. He later sneaked into her bedroom and found her sleeping in his bed. He asked the rhetorical question, ""What’s old Phoebe got to spread out?"" Note the sexual innuendo. She was asleep and ""she had her mouth way open."" Another sexual innuendo. After he woke her up, he noted that ""She’s very affectionate. I mean she’s quite affectionate, for a child. Sometimes she’s even TOO affectionate."" And then after she realized he was expelled again, she punched him with her fist, which came off as rather flirtatious and inappropriate for a ten-year-old. And then he pinched her ass. WTF!!!???

""Then, just for the hell of it, I gave her a pinch on the behind. It was sticking way out in the breeze, the way she was laying on her side. She has hardly any behind. I didn’t do it hard, but she tried to hit my hand anyway, but she missed.""

This passage really seals the deal for me that Holden Caulfield was not just a victim of pedophilia but had also become an incestous pedo himself. First of all, why would he be checking out his 10-year-old sister's butt at all? And why would he pinch it just ""for the hell of it""? It got even creepier.

""She was sitting way up in bed. She looked so pretty.""

And then they danced to four numbers. They got ""sweaty."" Phoebe asked Holden to feel her forehead to see if it felt feverish.

And then their parents got home and Holden hid in the closet. Phoebe lied to them to cover for Holden, which implied Holden had been grooming her for quite some time now. Phoebe offered Holden money and he cried. And then Phoebe said Holden ""could sleep with her if I wanted to,"" which implied they had slept together before.

Later, Phoebe wanted to run away with Holden, like how Holden wanted Sally Hayes to run away with him (Sally seemed like the only normal, albeit shallow, person in the book). And then an argument ensued and the subsequent interaction once again made Holden and her 10-year-old sister seemed more like boyfriend/girlfriend than 16-year-old brother with his 10-year-old sister.

It's also worth noting that JD Salinger had numerous relationships with much younger, barely legal women during his lifetime and that the veil of elite prep schools' pedophilia and sexual abuse have slowly been lifted in recent years.

However, I also understand that these feelings will change over time. I am very excited to reread this book when I am an adult to better understand Holden's ignorance and youth and relate to some of the adults such as Mr. Spencer, Mrs. Caulfield, and Mr. Caulfield.

qykrz7,Why is Holden Caulfield from the Catcher in the Rye considered to be mentally ill?,"I saw a thread in this sub this month which casually mentioned that some readers may misconstrue Holden as whiny instead of actually being mentally ill. I kept this thought through my reading but I don't really find anything that supports this theory.

Holden seems to be just the typical teenager: with delusions of grandeur, cynicism and angst brought on by his unconventional ideas. At most, he is **eccentric**. But he is not mentally ill.

The only thing that I think can be made out to mean he is mentally ill is his conversation with Sally Hayes where he doesn't realize he is shouting or getting emotional. But that's it. And again, that may just be him being socially inept.

There's also when he pretends to be wounded after getting punched, but I think that's just a way of dealing with the emotional blow. And he does it in private, who doesn't do weird stuff like that? I suppose how he 'talks' with Allie towards the end is also weird. But that's because he was leading up to a terrible fever, as he mentions in the first few lines of the last chapter.

mt0x1k,"""The Catcher in the Rye"" is the greatest portrait ever written","I just finished the book and Im in awe at how amazingly written it is. Not only does the reader get to know a unique yet familiar main character with all the right quirks a teenage boy usually has, but all the supporting characters that Holden is forced to interact with are designed to make his personality even more vibrant and believable.

Whether that be Mr. Spencer, Phoebe, Sally Hayes or Mr. Antolini, they all highlight a different part and  a different struggle within the mind of the protagonist.

I never thought I would be so consumed by a book with virtually no story, but in my opinion the story gets traded for one of the most complete, detailed and engaging portrayals of any character I have ever read.

""Catcher in the Rye"" is not without its flaws. Strange pacing and lack of any real suspense were the main ones for me. Still, it is in my opinion one of the most unique books out there and if you have read it and not liked it that much, I urge you to reread it with a different mindset. Dont look for a story or a purpose, but instead dive deep into the mind of a young lost boy who is just trying his best to make sense of the world. You can learn a lot about how to make a fictional character feel truly human.

Give this book a chance and you won't be dissapointed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mt0x1k/the_catcher_in_the_rye_is_the_greatest_portrait/,2021-04-17T22:48:44Z,18,32,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
izua8l,I feel like Catcher in the Rye does not deserve to be considered a classic.,"I was actually kind of looking forward to reading this book sophomore year and having class discussions about it, however it was extremely different than I expected. The story follows a boy with a very negative outlook on life, who gets kicked out of school and goes out into the world, having very awkward and uncomfortable encounters with people he comes across, and ends up hardly accomplishing anything throughout his journey. There’s supposed to be a deeper meaning behind all of it, but I just see it as a monotonous read with no real big idea to take away from it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/izua8l/i_feel_like_catcher_in_the_rye_does_not_deserve/,2020-09-25T23:09:46Z,53,0,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
hlhhzh,"So I finished reading ""The catcher in the rye""","I liked the book, after reading so many ugly books I hated reading this month, this was a fun experience. The prose is absolutely sublime and it's really stylistic, like to the point of being breathtaking. Seriously, its gorgeous writing. I loved that part. Now about the story, I sort of get it but also don't really understand the point of it. I hoped for like a big payoff at the end but it just sorta ends? Like I understood a lot of why Holden was so angry with the world, the teenage mind and all that but really, it felt ultimately aimless. He never even fucking called Jane Gallagher because he was such a pussy thinking she must've changed or something. I didn't hate Holden tho, he makes sense sometimes, I like how even if it seems like it, he really has no specific world view and is just an average angsty teenager. That's what I liked the most about the book. Also seriously what the fuck happened to the ducks?

zyl85v,"I read ""Notes from the Underground"" and ""The Catcher in the Rye"" back to back","I decided to cap off 2022 by reading these two books as I thought it would be interesting to see how they compare and contrast. I looked over both synopsis and I figured they'd be pretty similar seeing as how they are both first person narrated books where the main character is anti-social and a prostitute plays an important role in the narrative.

Upon actually reading both of the books however I found out that the two books are trying to do two different things.

So I'll start off with the first book I read ""Notes from the Underground"" by Dostoevsky. For the record I read the Oxford World Classics version translated by Jane Kentish, I don't know what or how different this translation is from the more common Constance Garnett translation but I felt it was important to at least point it out in case I talk about stuff that is different from Garnett's translation. 

First thing I'll say, yo this book is hard to read. Even though this book normally is around 140 pages (the OWC version I have is formatted to be around 120 pages) I'm pretty sure it still took me a longer time to read this book than it did for me to read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and that book is 60 more pages. For people who haven't read ""Notes from the Underground"" and don't know what I'm talking about, let me say that one time I was reading the first part of the book and I see that the text of a paragraph is continuing on the page I turn over, I then notice that the entire page is still this same paragraph, and then I look at the page next to it only to see that too is still the same paragraph that had begun 2 pages ago. Two entire whole pages of a wall of text, I was like ""yo Dostoevsky calm down"". 

""Notes from the Underground"" is a novella that is seperated into two parts. The first part of this book is complete insanity with it being a man writing a paradoxical and nonsensical philosophy for 50 pages straight. The OWC version that I'm reading comes with a nice explanatory notes index going into all the references that Dostoevsky was making. The point of this part of the book is that it's meant to be, at least how I interpreted it, to be a brutal satire of the intellectuals that Dostoevsky hung out with that eventually lead to him getting thrown in jail. It's also a self-deprecating satire of a more extreme version of Dostoevsky himself. It's a lot to take in. 

The second part of ""Notes"" is a couple of stories involving the narrator (who is commonly referred to as the underground man) when he was a younger man in his 20's. The point of these stories is to show the narrator's delusional line of thinking and narcissism, how he tends to make a big thing out of nothing, and generally how he's a massive loser. The big climax of the book is him ending up with a prostitute, essentially giving the prostitute a ted talk about the problems with her line of work, and her simply responding that he ""talks like a book"". It's brutal. ""Notes"" is meant to be brutal in it's take down of intellectuals in 1800's russia. 

So while ""Notes from the Underground"" is a satire of intellectuals in mid 1800s russia, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is more of a look at teenage depression, or if you really want to stretch out it's relevance, a look at how post WW2 America didn't really handle PTSD all that well. 

I never read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" in school. Wasn't assigned it, I was assigned ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" but never ""The Catcher in the Rye"". So this was my first time reading it as a 32 year old man. 

The style of the book was irritating. I didn't think it added anything to the overall experience. I'm saying I didn't like the style of the book. 

I know, I know, everyone has made similar jokes like that before but hey I just read the damn thing can you blame me? But one of the first things you notice about the book is how stylish it is and it just got on my nerves. I get what the book is trying to convey, I really do, but I just felt like Holden needed an editor in the damn asylum or something. 

I feel like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a book that's more interesting to talk about than it is to actually read. Like it's interesting to notice the cultural significance of it, how it effected the boomer generation, how it was probably the catalyst of the hippie movement of the 1960's when they misinterpreted one of Holden's delusions as an elegant lifestyle, but the book is just so ehhhh. Not reading it all these years I thought the book was going to be more philosophical and less whiny but maybe I just saw all the glowing praise for it, how so many influential boomers said it was their favorite book, that when I did finally read it I was set up for disappointment. It's not a terrible book, but it's a book about a time firmly in the past. 

It is funny, however, that it was banned all over the place, even though the book doesn't really have that many controversial ideas nowadays. Here's a good example:

""Notes from the Underground"" - Criticism of Chernyshevsky's idea of the Crystal Palace: I sleep

""The Catcher in the Rye"" - Say that Jesus wasn't the best at picking his disciples: REAL SHIT

This is truly the society we live in... Say one thing that would upset evangelicals in the 1950's and you go down in history as having one of the most ""controversial"" books of all time. 

I think that's also the main difference between them, Dostoevsky's ""Notes"" is a lot more indepth a lot more challenging, while Sallinger's ""Rye"" is a lot more approachable and relatable. People go through trauma and feel depressed, so it's easy to see why that story latched itself onto the public consciousness; for me though I just wish it was more interesting and had more to chew on. I guess I just prefer books that have 50 pages of paradoxical philosophy over a teenager calling everyone a phony.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zyl85v/i_read_notes_from_the_underground_and_the_catcher/,2022-12-30T00:13:01Z,5,3,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
htqku5,The Catcher in the Rye questions,"I've just reread this book and have some questions. It's been about 20 years since I read it in high school so I cant remember everything I ""learned"" then reading it the first time. 

1. What's wrong with Holden? Assuming there is something wrong, that is. The death of his brother seems to have really impacted him. Is this severe depression following that? I've read a few different ""diagnoses"" online and there doesn't seem to be one major theory. I've seen depression, anti-social personality disorder, fear/anxiety, narcissism, and insanity. But haven't settled on what I agree with. It could just be typical teenage issues and nothing more major, too.

2. Is this whole story just Holdens essay he writes for Stradlater? Holden talks about how often he lies. Stradlater asks Holden to write a descriptive composition for him. Is the rest of the book after that just Holden making stuff up for an essay?

3. What is the meaning of the title?

Bonus: This is one of the books that Charlie reads in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Charlie seems to think the main characters in each book have something in common and are trying to teach him something too. Any thoughts on that are also appreciated!

hqelhc,Catcher in the Rye -Finished this weekend,"I remember reading about this book in an article about John Lennon. After Mark David Chapman assassinated John Lennon, he supposedly sat on the roadside and read Catcher in the Rye till the police came to arrest him.
Hence I was fascinated as to why someone would want to read this book after a cold blooded murder.
After managing to get hold of a copy, I finished it and frankly I'm a bit underwhelmed by this book.
I understand it's a classic and everything, but Holden Caulfied just keeps complaining about how he hates everything in the entire book. Some of the phonies he talks about is true even today, which I agree to, but most of it is just downright disregard for anyone who does anything that Holden doesn't like.

How come nothing exists where copyright editors or storytellers can put a remix on their favorite author's original story and sell it as their own?

Would it be interesting to read Catcher in the Rye (or any book for that matter) again with overall the same storyline, but with a unique twist from a different editor(story teller)?

190kmil,What's the worst book you've ever read? And why?,"I used to love reading romance novels. They were a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. Then life got in the way. I didn't have a lot of free time and reading wasn't something I prioritized. 
  
Well. When I was finally able to get back into reading, one of the firsts books I read was **Mila Gray**'s *Stay With Me*
  
Here's my review of it (I wasn't on Goodreads when I read it 😅)
  
> I read this in 2019. I can't remember the exact details of why I hated, just that I hated it. Poorly written and extremely cliché. As someone who was in the military, I was looking forward to reading a military centered novel. However I was extremely let down. I've never wanted to puke and simultaneously throw a book out of a window more. Absolutely would not recommend. And no, I didn't DNF it. I finished it in hopes that it would redeem itself but it never did. If I had it in me I would throw this book straight into the trash.
  
Imagine my surprise when I went on Goodreads and saw that it had a 4.2 star rating!! 😱😱😱

It wasn't until recently that I realized that this book ruined the entire romance genre for me. And, honestly, just romance  of any form in any book. 🙃

2. Atlas Shrugged  
   
3. Fifty Shades of Grey

q6e6x2,Reading Catcher in the Rye - Three Years Apart,"First read and finished Catcher in the Rye during my freshman year of high school. My aunt had bought me a copy as a gift the previous year, and for the most part, it had been collecting dust on the shelf. After seeing another peer read Anna Karenina, I remember being obnoxiously envious of her ability to read such “adult classic books”. Hence, I read Catcher in the Rye. At the time, I found it boring. Holden was a temperamental teenager with a troubled past - haven’t we heard that before? I didn’t understand half of the situations or symbols then. Or even there was supposed to be a “loss of innocence” (per Google), but I thought Holden was never innocent to begin with.

A couple of days ago I found the book on my shelf. I decided to give it another go. I’m a senior in high school now, applying to college. I’ve experienced a pandemic, high school, and the in between of life. I’ve learned a little more too.

Turns out, I had originally hated Holden because he reminded me of myself. I was the hypocrite too. I did - and still do - call others phony and judge them for their actions. I people watch too. I make mistakes and believe I’m perfect too. I make sporadic decisions too. I have trouble with maintaining a proper family too. 

I’m Holden Caufield.


My peers thought I was crazy. But as I do the same reflecting that Holden did, I can’t help but realize how fake we live. And how we can never stop pretending. I think 9th grade me was in denial, because she was built on the idea of pretending. She pretended her whole life.

Just some though of a graduating senior in high school. Have any of you ever had such an experience?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q6e6x2/reading_catcher_in_the_rye_three_years_apart/,2021-10-12T04:34:51Z,8,11,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
n211jm,Catcher in the Rye: an Indian reader's review,"This godamn book has been paraded under my nose so often, but I never did get around to reading it. It seemed to be so phoney - for starters, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why it was titled so. It just seemed like those books that intend well, but end up being phoney anyways. I get really mad when that happens - I hate those kinda books. 

Anyhow, switching back to my regular tone -

I felt compelled to read this book after rewatching an episode of my favourite show, Bojack Horseman (Hollywoo Celebrities - What do they know? Do they know things? Let's find out!) 

From the get go, the book just encapsulates the ""Rebel without a Cause"" zeitgeist of the 50's in the US. The protagonist Holden is the James Dean of this book, ridden with teenage angst, cynicism and a more than healthy oscillation between being cockheadedly sure of himself and being utterly lost. 

And this is a double edged sword. The book is a lovely persona study into the mind of the American teenager, grappling with the upheaval undergoing American psyche and society but in doing so, also makes it a book written for a certain personal disposition, age group and cultural milieu - and neither of the above three work in my favour. 

Despite this, I would rate this as a book to read once (and not anymore) - more from a sociological and psychological lens than anything else.

I also really liked how Salinger depicted the centrality of people to an otherwise 'individualistic' character - just to show that even when we judge ourselves to be a lone fighter in this bad world, our decisions are heavily influenced and affected by the people around us. We see this strongly as we reach the last few pages.

Mr. Antolini becomes this respite, this warm shelter to the troubled, unravelled mess that Holden finds himself becoming by the time he knocks on their door. His kindness, when Holden needed it most, is what shapes his decision to leave New York City. And Phoebe, by her one action, is able to change the course of Holden's life. Sometimes, kindness and someone else's agency is what shapes our lives. 

But hey, what does a phoney like me know about godamn life. I'm no Salinger. 

What I liked:

The crash course into the mind of a 'Rebel without a Cause', the very beautiful rendering of how depression can be so easily fueled by the smallest of nudges, pushing us into fumbling from one place, person, experience to another - all in vain hopes of escaping from the crushing weight of despair. And of course, the paragraph above.

What I didnt like:
The tediousness of attempting to accept all the angst in the book, and the utter lack of effort to make Holden relateable (maybe this was intentional by the author)

81fdoa,Changed my mind on Catcher in the Rye,"When I read Catcher in the Rye in high school, I spent the entirety of the experience softly hating the main character for what I thought were pretty justified reasons. As a student who worked his ass off, I was offended at Holden's failing academics and at his leaving school over the phonies there. What's more, I couldn't stand the ending's weird anti-payoff.

But I guess at some point since that first reading I've gotten more comfortable with the idea of a narrator trying to cover things up and with ambiguous endings. Also since my first reading I've stopped believing that high schoolers are generally honest (I know I was naive at the time), and that change helped me read the story as a tragedy being told by someone who doesn't exactly want the reader to know that it's a tragedy.

The book gets a decent amount of flak online, and I respect that. Certainly I used to agree with those views pretty hard.

fassdk,"What Salinger wanted to imply through ""The Catcher in the Rye""","I just finished reading *The Catcher in the Rye*. It was such an exceptional book. I've never read such language in a literary work before. Holden Caulfield is immature, reckless and a ""madman"" but deep down, I guess all of us have something in common with him - whether it is the disgust at human behaviour or confusion of our life's purpose. What I want to ask of all of you, what do you feel is J D Salinger's message to the readers? The ending of the book seems to suggest a warning or a vision - of what society will turn to. It would be really helpful if someone could explain the ending, with Mr Antolini's message to Holden.

**Edit**: My heartiest thanks for the amazing comments. You guys' comment provided valuable insight and broadened my perspective on the story and Holden's character. Truly *Catcher...* is one book I'll keep returning to. I'll surely check out Salinger's other works.

PS: Funny thing to say, but actually my grandfather had this book for a long time. But only after I saw the book - in Makoto Shinkai's anime film *Weathering With You* with the protagonist, a 16-year old boy who runs from his village to Tokyo, Hodaka, carrying the book with him - that I wanted to give it a read.

I wish she could relish in the happiness of figuring herself out instead of worrying about the hateful comments that she reads.

rr58xg,Review of the book The Catcher In The Rye by J. D. Salinger.,"A few days back I finished reading a book called **The Catcher In The Rye** by  **J. D. Salinger**. A little background story about that book. It was published in 1951 and is about a 16 year old boy who perceive everyone around him as corny and phony. The only fascinating thing about this book was the use of  contemporary language. When you'll read this book, you will feel like this book must have been publish a few years or a decade ago. But boom!!

And if I talk about the plot, well, I have mixed views. I didn't like it much. It's one of those stories you read at night and will forget with the coming dawn. There are some scenes where I literally laughed out loud but then there are many scenes where I was just waiting for something, like a plot twist to come but it didn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rr58xg/review_of_the_book_the_catcher_in_the_rye_by_j_d/,2021-12-29T10:35:51Z,7,0,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

opdtt2,An honest review of Salinger’s ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ (Minor Spoiler Alert),"The Catcher in the Rye follows the story of a young boy called Holden Caulfield over a period of two days after recently discovering that he has been expelled from his school for a lack of concern in his subjects. The narrative begins at Princey private school and shortly moves into the jungle of New York. As soon as Holden arrives in NYC, he showcases to the reader the ‘phoney’ nature of adult life and how it massively contrasts the innocence of childhood. I have been recommended this book several times and now that I have finally decided to read it I find myself disappointed, as many apparently did on its debut. 

I constantly felt like there was a gap in the story which needed filling with something more than just Holdens encounters with pimps, hookers, ex-school chums and dodgy blokes. Perhaps the reason why this book was highly praised in the first place was not because of Salinger’s ability to portray a teenager in a semi-autobiographical manner, but because of its simplicity and relatability to teenagers. The metaphor surrounding Holden being the catcher or saviour of children in the rye field was innocent and this can be reflected through his approachability to the children in this book. 

I like how, like Steinbeck, Salinger decided to incorporate Burns’ poetry into the novel’s alluding title and that, at its centre, it had a greater meaning than one would expect from reading the first 150 pages or so. But overall, the book appears to me as overhyped and not worth the read.

Let me know your opinions. Perhaps I can be persuaded…",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/opdtt2/an_honest_review_of_salingers_the_catcher_in_the/,2021-07-22T13:28:22Z,15,0,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
gj7qt3,I just finished The Catcher in the Rye (spoilers),"In high school I didn't read it and my literature related classes in college never addressed it. I went into the book knowing almost nothing about it other than it is a sometimes banned/censored book. I didn't even know the plot or really even what it was about. Kinda crazy I avoided any information on it for this long, but somehow I did.

I just finished the book a couple days ago and boy, what an odd experience it was. The whole time I read it I kept getting frustrated with Holden's bitter, incel attitude. He hated everyone and everything and was convinced it was their fault. He is so blinded by his self centeredness he can't realize that he is part of the problem. I had hope for him in the one bar scene where his friend suggested he see a therapist, but the rest of the time I was just frustrated with him. 

Anyways, the book was weird but it serves as a warning to a darker side of ourselves that we can fall into if we let ourselves.

I usually see people say Holden was at his lowest and he was doing horrible, I did kind of feel that but also not really at all. I don't know why but I just can't seem to get into that perspective, I saw him as a boy that had deep insecurities and was stuck in life but he was a heavy emotional character. The sequences with Phoebe at the end made my eyes water a lot, or when he was at that guys house and his mind started racing, it was very intense and fearfull. I just feel a lot of compassion towards him, I can't Identify with him at all, but I don't get how people mark him off as a horrible MC - (I do want to acknowledge some of the misogynistic etc. stuff in the book tho dgmw)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q672l8/the_catcher_in_the_rye_and_what_it_means_to_be_at/,2021-10-11T22:05:49Z,9,20,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

g7lhq5,Finished My Re-Read of Catcher In The Rye,"I re-read Catcher in the Rye as an adult.  I remember reading the book in high school and it being one of my favorite books I read.  It was also one of the few I read from cover to cover in high school as well.  I was kind of an idiot, maybe a little like Holden who thought they knew everything.

I want to document my thoughts on the book in more of anonymous way then posting on Goodreads because I still feel like I am idiot. At least in some sense.  I wish I had read more about the themes, author, background on the book before diving in.  I think I would have appreciated the book more.  As an adult, I see Holden like most teenagers.  He thinks he understands most things but I don't know if he does enough self introspection.  I think he understands some situations well but then other times he could be so frustrating.  How realistic is this book?  I don't think as a teenager I ever went out on the town and if I did it wasn't multiple days at a time.  Does this give a look into what privilege some prep schools have?  

I feel like I am ranting.  Am I missing something when it comes to this book? I wish I could write better more thought provoking and stronger arguments.

Here’s my list: 
- The bone shard daughter 
- The Testaments 
- Iron Heart 
- If on a Winter’s night a traveler 
- By the River Piedra I sat down and wept

- Catcher in the Rye
- Ready Player One / Ready Player two

8fdqi4,I just finished rereading The Catcher in The Rye and it was completely different,"I read this book for the first time around five years ago, I didn't hate it or love it. It just didn't resonate with me, I could tell that it's a book where you have to connect with Holden for it to work and I didn't. I remember having that slight regret that maybe I shouldn't have bothered finishing it.

Then I heard somewhere about a month ago that Holden is writing from a mental institution, something I didn't pick up on the first time round (I must have not been paying proper attention in the first few pages). I decided to give it another go and the book completely changed, especially my opinion of the ending. It's now no longer about a spoilt kid wandering aimlessly through New York but about someone who is really struggling, the revelation he was writing about his last few days before he was taken to a mental institution means I read it in a different light.

If anyone else has the same experience, coming away from reading it and being underwhelmed, I thoroughly recommend going back and rereading. I know I'm an idiot for not picking it up the first time around, but it really did make me understand Holden so much more, he felt less of a phoney.

Tl;dr I was a phoney and missed that Holden was admitted to a mental institution, rereading it after some time made it a completely different experience",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8fdqi4/i_just_finished_rereading_the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2018-04-27T18:06:43Z,35,30,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
10dr7ce,"What are the books that pretty much everyone has positive reviews of, that never seem to disappoint?","It seems like some books get effusive praise, and nothing else. The opposite of people's reactions to Ready Player One/The Catcher in the Rye/The Alchemist/The Da Vinci Code/JK Rowling/Ayn Rand.  

The only ones I can think of right now are The Count of Monte Cristo, 1984, East of Eden, and most Virginia Woolf books.  

Have you read any that seemed like that when you were looking it up? What books appear to be immune to criticism sometimes? The creme de la creme. Contemporary books are also encouraged, I think one of the big Andy Weir books might qualify.

2qi0m2,Is Catcher in the Rye really outdated?,"I am apologizing previously because English is not my first language, I can read it just fine, but my writing sucks sometimes and it's 1am :(

Anyway, I looked for a post about this and didn't find it, so here it goes:

I saw a lot of people saying The Catcher does not describe or fits in the life of the current teens, but I don't know if I agree.
Holden seems to have a hard time to understand life and people, he does think adult life isn't as awesome as everyone sells it and he has a breakdown about... Well, everything, I guess.
So, isn't that kind of problems the same problems a big parcel of teens and ""young adults"" have to deal? I'm 24 and I still relate to Holden in some level, the level where I feel lost and question myself about what the fuck I am doing and why the hell people does X or Y.
Depression is one of the biggest diseases around the world; these days, if you are 25 and you are not rich, you are a failure. There is pressure and distress and self questioning in unhealthy levels.

I’ve only cried two times during reading books, with Forgive Me Leonard Peacock and A Little Life. The lingering sense of sadness, even during it’s light and funny moments, just wrecked me. I don’t know how to describe Holden but the closest I can come is specific. The way he describes certain characters was just so specific and that’s what I loved about him. And someone commented on my previous post that Holden was “kind” and I completely agree. I wanted to give him the biggest hug(I also wanted Leonard Peacock to give the biggest hug). It’s heartbreaking to see (read?) someone who doesn’t know his place in the world trying to make himself work and not be understood. Reading the book reminded me of the feeling I get when I watch Frances Ha (my favorite film ever). I’ll definitely revisit this book again.

3ciag1,Catcher in the Rye,First off I loved this book. Something about it just seems real like it's not a story but believe able. Something that's discussed in the book is Holden's hatred for the disciples. He says he likes Jesus but thinks that the disciples are all phony. One thing that I haven't seen discussed with the book is the possibility that Holden is supposed to represent his idea of Jesus while the adults are supposed to represent the disciples and how they let down all the children in the novel that Holden is supposed to protect. It may be reaching too far but maybe Holden's struggle between being a child and adult is like how Jesus was part man but also part God. I'm not too religious but I just made this observation and want to discuss it and just the book in general.,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3ciag1/catcher_in_the_rye/,2015-07-08T03:08:21Z,18,16,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

3xiwcx,The three stages of A Catcher in the Rye,"I'm reading *A Catcher in the Rye* for the third time right now, and it struck me that every time I've read the book it has a brand new meaning to it, so I wanted to know if others have felt the same three emotions towards that book I have.

1) Empathy - When I was young I read the book, and fully 'got' Holden, his railing against the world seemed natural to me. I understood his anger and frustration, his feeling of confusion and displacement, and I thought he was a boy lost in the world. I don't think it necessarily reflected my own feelings, but it maybe amplified something I had inside that I wouldn't admit.

2) Anger - Not that long later I read it again. I obviously felt I'd matured by then, and felt that he was childish and arrogant. I found myself thinking he needed to ""grow up"", stop being such a whinger. I was angry that he couldn't see that he was the problem, not the world around him, and frustrated with his attitude. "" He'll never make it through life like that"".

3) Sympathy - On this reading I've changed again. I now feel sympathy towards him. This is an amalgamation of the last two views, I understand his frustrations and his anger, but instead of feeling anger towards them I hope he grows up, I hope he can survive in a world without being too corrupted. I think he needs to learn to fit in with the world around him but I hope he doesn't lose his way of thinking, doesn't forget how it felt as a child and can help people in the future.    
I've also realised, for the first time, that he's not the catcher, he's just another lost kid in the field, but also that the cliff isn't a cliff at all, its just a small drop that looks so much bigger from a child's perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3xiwcx/the_three_stages_of_a_catcher_in_the_rye/,2015-12-20T00:27:53Z,21,68,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

The distrust and disgust you feel for everyone around you, the feeling of running away from everyone and everything, the careless attitude because deep down you feel nothing even matters, the facade you put up of being cool and tough because you're scared they are gonna figure out just how much of a coward you truly are, and a lot of other things I could go on and on about. 

I also liked that in the end he got help and was getting a positive attitude and outlook on life and was actually healing instead of going through with his erratic plans or committing suicide.

However, I am still curious and making possible scenarios in my head as to Holden's parent's reaction to his ax.

5fmr5w,A confliction I have about Catcher in the Rye,"I am a high school sophomore and this year we had to read catcher in the rye. Although while I was reading, I literally wanted to blow my brains out because Holden is the biggest piece of shit I have ever seen, when I finally finished the book I understood the message. I understand how Holden wants to be the saviour of innocence, to preserve it from both adulteration and adulthood, and how he goes through arduous endeavours in the face of phonies and the tough revelations of reality and society. I understand how Holden isn't suppose to be a individual character, but a representation of the youth, and how almost every teen has gone through that mentality (I still kinda am). However, I think the underlying problem with Holden is that he failed to recognise the perspective of the ""phonies"". He never stops and wonders why some people think a certain way, or why certain things happen, and to whom. Holden uses his pragmatic, pessemstic, and at times, narcissistic judgement to conclude the reasoning of the fallacies of his reality. I guess this relates to the mentality of the youth, sometimes. I just wonder, is this what Salinger mean't? Is my perception of Holden a correct perception? I just feel like we can't only think Holden as what he tries to be - the saviour, the messia, the trouble and wretched soul that derives from our hegemonic society (even though he is). I think we must also contemplate his mistakes, his pretentiousness, and how he lacks the understandment of the world that revolves around him. But maybe that's the point, maybe Salinger was trying to show how the youth is troubled because they CANT understand the world fully, and they must experience it fully to finally have some revelation. Maybe that's what Holden's whole journey in the book was about?

Please tell me your thoughts, for I am too a troubled member of the youth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5fmr5w/a_confliction_i_have_about_catcher_in_the_rye/,2016-11-30T01:35:14Z,24,26,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
5j9jmw,I've just finished The Catcher in the Rye,"I don't read books often, but yesterday I got bored and thought I might read this one. I've seen a post about The Cathcher in the Rye on this sub recently so I've decided to check it out. It took me just two days to read it, never has a book kept me as glued to it as this one has. 

The thing I loved the most about it was that I could relate to it. I'm sixteen and I completely understood Holden. His thoughts, his actions, his words, I could relate to it all. This book isn't really plot driven, the plot was sacrificed to create a perfectly rounded character who seemed like a real person. A character that took you inside his world and you never doubted if it was real. During the three days in which the book takes place, we get to see Holden's ruthless side, his insecurities, his trauma and his suffering. We get to really know him as if he were a real person in our lives. 

I can see how someone could say that the book is overrated. I personally don't think that it's overrated, it's a masterpiece to me. I think that I'd hate it too if I was forced to read it in school, but I've chosen to read it myself and it didn't let me down.

Ofc, the book mentions alot of teenage POVs and dilemmas which I have to admit I've found myself in. That's the thing I like about literature even after around 69 years ago is still very relatable. The boy meticulously explains the New York of the 50s.

I like the overall POV of our old Holden, that guy kills me everytime he says this. Gotta say you laugh, you feel sad and imo you never fail to relate to this character. There are so many instances of questioning Masculinity, feeling inferior or  alone with genuinely lacking understanding companionship.  
The character of Holden Caulfield is a misanthropic rebel who is stuck between adolescence and adulthood. Whi simply at heart is a person who is basically a asocial who ironically lacks human interaction. The alienation and angst he feels when he is alone makes him do these decisions of asking people out of blue to hangout because he is alone and whether he admits it or not he needs a company to whine about world.  

[SPOILERS] 
Holden thinks it's stupid (or if I may say PHONY) of those people who think about love and show affection to others are being phony whereas he himself thinks about instances of eloping twice with someone he barely knows.

9ouz5u,My opinion on The Catcher In The Rye,"I had to read this book for my English class, because I had to do a report on a book on the list. TCITR was short and popular, so I gave it a try. 
    I didn’t like it. Maybe it’s because I’m from a  younger generation and just don’t have the same tastes, but I don’t know. I found Holden to be basic and 1-dimensional, and he didn’t change a lot from the start of the story. 
    The entire book seems to follow the same format: Holden wanders around, meets a person/people, does something with them, and then repeat. There is no grand problem. There is no goal. Just a delinquent roaming the streets getting into trouble that’s not even exciting. No challenges, no obstacles, no adversity. 
    Especially considering we have no story from this character. We don’t know who he is, where he came from, why he is the way he is, what his early life was like, nothing. Just a character that I can’t connect with. 
     I’d give it a 2/10. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9ouz5u/my_opinion_on_the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2018-10-17T03:31:44Z,14,0,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
nbdbh1,I just finished Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger,"I finished reading this book yesterday, and it was much more emotionally draining than I would have initially considered. First of all, the lack of social awareness by Holden throughout the entirety had me looking back and cringing at my teenage years when I was not too dissimilar. I'd like to imagine I wasn't so delusional, nor so misogynistic, but I also know I've had to grow a lot over the last decade or so.

Second, something that really concerned me was the way the novel acted as somewhat of a mirror on large swaths of society. I'm not saying that every person is a realisation of Holden as a character, but there are just little ticks of his that I have seen in the people around me. The persistent idea of everybody being a ""phony"" followed by Holden going on to do the thing he criticised seems somewhat common to me. I'm not claiming innocence from doing this, but I am interested as to whether other people think that Holden is not so different from the majority of people?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nbdbh1/i_just_finished_catcher_in_the_rye_by_jd_salinger/,2021-05-13T10:15:42Z,3,10,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

1l72nc,Secret message in 'Catcher in the Rye?' (Literal not conspiracy),"In my high school English class one of the students noticed that there is a seemingly blank page after the final page of text in The Catcher in the Rye. At the bottom of this page in grey ink so faint that it was almost impossible to read without holding up the page to a light was the sentence, 'Sometimes it's best just to leave.' Of course, this disrupted the class and we found that about half of the books in the class had this message and the other half did not. 

I have done some online research and can't find a single article about it. Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to provide evidence but I swear on my life this is true. If I ever go to my folks house I will see if I can find my copy (which had the message). 

I do see within the context of the book how this final sentence may provide some insight into Holden Caulfield's ultimate fate. (Think about the pond scene and then the secret message). I am just wondering if anyone has more info about this? Did Salinger add this hidden msg? Is it a publisher Easter Egg? How is it that only my Grade 12 English class seems aware of this and I can't find a single article on the net?  Can someone post a picture as proof if their copy has it?

EDIT: A few people have copies with this in it. Apparently the wording is a little different than my memory, ""Sometimes, what I think is, you're supposed to leave.""  Can somebody with this link a photo please?

EDIT 2: Current going theory is that it is a printing artifact (a little disappointing as we all know secret messages are fun). If someone could provide a 'Printers key' from a copy with the secret message we might be able to get some closure on this!

dvkjdn,So I read Catcher In The Rye & I wanna talk about it,"A lot of people hate this book but I feel like what it says is SO important and something that’s not really said when it needs to be said anymore. Everybody’s like, “I hate Holden. He complains too much, he’s insufferable, etc.” But most people *are* phonies. My interpretation of Holden’s meaning is that people will suppress their true feelings, their true nature, their true interests, etc to seem “cool, trendy, eccentric” or whatever to others. This is known. This is a fact. But I see it all day everyday and it’s never called out. For example, somebody acting like a totally normal thing and something most people do is super “weird” or unique. This development of the “new outcast” has always puzzled me. How the most popular girl wants to say she’s a loser, has no friends, etc. when that’s obviously not true so that she’ll be relatable, likable and therefore *more* popular is crazy. Another example is peer pressure. Duh. & it’s all important. I think Holden’s right, this “phony” culture has gotta change. Individuality is one of the most important characteristics you can have and it’s MOST definitely a characteristic lacking in our society today. I mean, even I’m a “phony” to some extent, everybody is. I suppress my true interests to achieve a commonality with the people I know, but obviously the thing goes much farther than that, but of course I wanna reform that. So the question is: is this an inherent part of human nature or is this a product of our current society, or society in general? It’s known that the need to fit in is innate but is it more innate than our longing to be true to ourselves? I dunno. Anybody  feel like talking more about this? Definitely DM me. 

TL;DR (you should read it though) Is Holden right to hate phonies? Are most people phonies? Is fitting in more important than being true to yourself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dvkjdn/so_i_read_catcher_in_the_rye_i_wanna_talk_about_it/,2019-11-13T01:54:48Z,19,15,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

9vccpa,"Is my analysis of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger wrong?","Hello!

I just read The Catcher in the Rye this week. I looked into the book with the rather low-minded intention of finding fault in it. The reasons people praised it always seemed a bit silly to me: I can't stand spoiled teenagers behaving petulantly just because they don't want to be just another cog in the machine, despite failing to do any of the 623 things that keep you from being just another cog in the machine. It seemed like the book was just an anthem for feeling inadequate and living a lost, Kerouac-like life.

I read the first 90 pages fairly fast (in a little less than 2 hours), and at this point, I am getting kind of bored. However, I'd seen a bunch of lists that considered this a palmary book of American literature, so I kept going.

I am very happy to have continued, because in chapter 24 what I believe is the key to understanding the actual meaning of the book shows up. Mr. Antolini, despite being a rather controversial and ambiguous character, might as well be the true philosopher in this. Here is an excerpt of what I consider a summary of the principles in The Catcher in the Rye:

>""This fall I think you're riding for--it's a special kind of fall, a horrible kind. The man falling isn't permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom. He just keeps falling and falling. The whole arrangement's designed for men who, at some time or other in their lives, were looking for something their own environment couldn't supply them with. Or they thought their own environment couldn't supply them with. So they gave up looking. They gave it up before they ever really even got started. You follow me?""

Here, we can see a beautiful evaluation of Holden's behavior. Despite having experienced many tragedies along his life, Holden's complaints don't seem to be based on them.

His attitude toward life shows us he is actually very arrogant, an arrogance that makes him think he is ""too much"" for this world. His sensitive nature, however, masks this.

This notion that there are people believing their own environment can't supply them with what they need is what probably prompted the writing of the book, and The Catcher in the Rye is something like a manifesto against that posture. Salinger shows us inside the mind and the thought process of people with that kind of ideal.

The plan surely backfired, since Holden Caulfield is now the patron saint of the highbrow rebel without a cause, and people quote the book as an excuse for going against some completely inoffensive societal norms. For example, saying you are pleased to meet someone even if you aren't isn't ""phony"". It's just polite.

Thank you so much for having the patience to read this.

You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you.

nrptb0,Mr. Antolini in the Catcher in the Rye: Could he be considered an antagonist?,"Mr. Antolini is a character from J.D Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, and was the one person who carried James Castle's body and didn't care if his coat got all bloody. Mr. Antolini, however, emerges as an antagonist of some sorts. At first, Mr. Antolini seems to be a better person than the phonies Holden encounters. However, things get suspicious. Mr. Antolini is overtly affectionate to his wife in public, but in reality, he and his wife don't sleep in the same room, as Holden describes it. Holden receives coffee from Mrs. Antolini, and Mr. Antolini gives good lectures to Holden, explaining how he should better apply himself in school. Later, Mr. Antolini becomes more of an antagonist than a person Holden could count on. Holden gets tired, and Mr. Antolini asks Holden about his girlfriends. He calls him handsome and comments on his long legs, two things a teacher would never do to a student. When Holden wakes up, the teacher is touching his head. The professor doesn't apologize to Holden when Holden freaks out, and instead attempts to urge him to stay and even follows him around, calling Holden strange. Holden freaks out, and he leaves the apartment. Holden later experiences diarrhea, indicating that the coffee he received was not as innocent as it seemed. Holden realizes Mr. Antolini is a bigger phony than he thought, and this experience showed that the person who he trusted was the one who hurt him most.

Mr. Antolini can also be compared to several antagonists, and I think he is most similar to Mustapha Mond in Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Mustapha Mond is one of the controllers of the World State and basically started out as a young scientist and had to choose between being sent to an island or becoming a world controller, while Mr. Antolini is a teacher at New York University who used to be a former teacher of Holden’s at Elkton Hills, and had to choose between living as a prejudiced gay man openly gay in society in the 1950s or marrying a woman to cover his homosexuality and not be seen as inferior. While Mustapha Mond believes in happiness and stability as opposed to emotions, human relations, and individual expression, Mr. Antolini does not show much emotional attachment to his wife, marrying her for money and happiness, and is seen happily drinking and having a party.

What is your thought on Mr. Antolini as the main antagonist or him being similar to any major antagonist?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nrptb0/mr_antolini_in_the_catcher_in_the_rye_could_he_be/,2021-06-03T22:28:03Z,4,4,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
5jvm2k,Everyone Misinterprets Catcher in the Rye (Spoilers),"Edit: Sorry for the bad title. I picked something that sounded like click-bait garbage off the top of my head and told myself I'd change it later. Then ""later"" came and I forgot to set things right. Anyway, on with the show!

After the ""Catcher in the Rye: what am I missing?"" post reached the front page, I started thinking about all the people in my life who had similar reactions to the book. I first read it in high school, but never officially encountered it in a curriculum until a young adult literature class in college. The professor treated it as an introduction to the course: the first ""young adult"" book, the beginning of the genre. Holden's journey through New York was portrayed as a coming-of-age story. He was a protagonist struggling to accept the end of childhood and the beginning of adulthood. The carousel spinning endless circles with Phoebe riding the horses captured this theme in picture-perfect fashion. The only problem is, my professor was wrong. Catcher in the Rye isn't a young adult book or a coming-of-age story. One of the reasons people have trouble enjoying the book could be that it’s constantly getting misinterpreted. Let's examine the details.


Coming-of-age books teach lessons. The characters follow an arc that leads them on a path of self-discovery. They start at a place of immaturity and grow into wisdom as the story progresses. These are narratives of *gain*. The character attains something, usually understanding, self-confidence, or a more adult perspective. Holden doesn’t gain anything. *Catcher in the Rye* is a book about loss. Holden leaves prep school to escape, not to find himself. He’s running from the death of his younger brother and his mother’s subsequent nervous breakdown. He strives for intimacy with others (the prostitute, the cab driver, his old girlfriend, his roommate, his teacher) but fails to form meaningful bonds. Almost everyone responds to his conversations with annoyance; and whenever Holden *does* find intimacy, he confuses it with perversion or considers the person a “phony”. Many readers see this aspect of his character and label him as an angst-ridden teenager. They don’t like him because he blows people off and wastes his time rambling to strangers. But Holden doesn’t do this because he’s “going through a phase” or because he’s young. He does it because he’s *broken*. Remember that the story is framed by scenes of Holden in a mental hospital. Like his mother, he’s suffered a nervous breakdown. Holden encounters the adult world and it defeats him. But, in reality, he encountered it before the story began. The death of his brother snapped him out of childhood. That, more than anything, left him lost and alone. And, aside from a few outings that lead to nothing, Holden remains alone throughout the book. No one, at any point, acknowledges his brother’s death or patiently lets him speak. People are so eager to dish out lessons, they forget to give Holden a chance to express his thoughts. He’s stuck with only the voice in his head and an obsession with death. “Where do all the ducks go in winter?” is a question about where people go after they die. “Does a man in a white truck take them away? Do they fly somewhere warm?” Holden is searching for a way to deal with his grief. When he finds the world going about its business like nothing happened, it forces him to withdraw into himself. Phoebe riding the carousel isn’t a picture of perpetual childhood: it’s a desperate attempt to avoid death, to stay frozen in the same place forever (like the exhibits in the museum or the fish in the pond). Treating *Catcher in the Rye* as a young adult novel does more harm than good. Holden’s story isn’t one of transition from childhood to adulthood. He doesn’t learn important lessons along the way. He simply collapses under the weight of death and sorrow. The story ends with Holden’s condition up in the air. Just like grief in the real world, maybe there is no remedy for Holden’s problems. Maybe, if people stopped treating *Catcher in the Rye* like a young adult novel, they could better appreciate Holden’s journey and what it means for everyone living in a world surrounded by death and indifference.

It seems like we’re making it to the front page with posts that slam some famous author or book more than anything else. Yes, not many people like Catcher in the Rye, can we all just move on? 

Why not more “underrated” posts? What are some guilty pleasure books of yours? Let’s celebrate what we love and pass on that enthusiasm!

Edit: I realize we have many posts that focus on the good, but those aren’t swarmed with upvotes like these negative posts are.

2nd Edit: I actually forgot about this post since I wrote it while under the weather (*glug glug*), and when I went to bed it was already negative karma. So this is a surprise. 

Many great points made in this thread, I’d like to single out u/thomas_spoke and u/frog-song for their wonderful contributions. 

I think my original post wasn’t great content and while I appreciate the response it received, I wish I had placed more work into my criticism instead of just adding onto the bonfire of mediocrity and content-shaming. 

However, it’s a real joy to read your comments. This is what makes r/books a great subreddit. We’re very self-aware and we can all enjoy how ridiculous we can be sometimes. I mean, all of us have upvoted a bad post at some point. 

Thanks everyone! If you’re reading this, have a wonderful day and I hope the next book you read is a new favourite.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nwga7p/the_is_overrated_posts_are_becoming_tiresome/,2021-06-10T05:50:45Z,1210,8397,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

3h5rxx,Can we talk about The Catcher in the Rye?,"Just finished rereading this book and found myself identifying, or at least sympathizing, more with Holden at age 19 than I did during my initial reading when I was 17.

I get the feeling that a lot of people just hear that the ""mature"" response to Catcher is to think that Holden is annoying/an entitled little shit/etc. and thus react accordingly so as to convince themselves, or others, that they're mature. Going through this novel sure, there were a few bits where Holden was hypocritical or a bit whiny, but overall I found myself sympathizing with him quite a bit.

Can any of you tell me what things Holden concretely does or says (other than the admittedly cringe-worthy overuse of ""phony"") that make you hate him so much? Keeping in mind this is a kid who had a mental breakdown, lost his brother to cancer, is profoundly alienated and was probably sexually abused as a child to boot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3h5rxx/can_we_talk_about_the_catcher_in_the_rye/,2015-08-16T02:12:08Z,18,1,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST
8pl1qs,Question about The Catcher in the Rye,"Many people say that Holden is in a psychiatric hospital while he narrates the story, but in the beginning he states that he is in the hospital to get check ups for t.b: “I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year. That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddamn checkups and stuff. I'm pretty healthy, though.” I just need some clarification because I think it is an important aspect of the novel. I only just re-read catcher for the 4th time and this was the first time i noticed him saying that at the beginning.

Most people who talk about not liking the book have the major complaint of Holden not being likable, and the main retort is ""That's the point."" I'm just stating the facts, with which some I happen to agree.

I just finished the book, it took me 2-3 days, but I enjoyed it. Near the end I actually felt emotionally attached to Holden and Pheobe.

Obviously, I know which was published first and what critical acclaim has been lauded on Sallinger's work but I am asking this as a reader. 

Personally, I found Amis's protagonist much more identifiable (although he was a total git), the story more interesting and the whole experience much more absorbing. 

After finishing Catcher In The Rye I was only left feeling that I could have used that time to read something else, it provoked no real emotion from me which was definitely not the case with The Rachel Papers.

I was wondering if the movie actual exists or if something similar to it does. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to be doing this, but I thought maybe someone here will know. I will also be posting to /r/movies later to see if maybe they know.  

Here is the part i'm talking about: 

It was about this English guy, Alec something, that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all. He comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place, all over London, not knowing who the hell he is. He's really a duke, but he doesn't know it. Then he meets this nice, homey, sincere girl getting on a bus. Her goddam hat blows off and he catches it, and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about Charles Dickens. He's both their favorite author and all. He's carrying this copy of Oliver Twist and so's she. I could've puked. Anyway, they fell in love right away, on account of they're both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all, and he helps her run her publishing business. She's a publisher, the girl. Only, she's not doing so hot, because her brother's a drunkard and he spends all their dough. He's a very bitter guy, the brother, because he was a doctor in the war and now he can't operate any more because his nerves are shot, so he boozes all the time, but he's pretty witty and all. Anyway, old Alec writes a book, and this girl publishes it, and they both make a hatful of dough on it. They're all set to get married when this other girl, old Marcia, shows up. Marcia was Alec's fiancée before he lost his memory, and she recognizes him when he's in this store autographing books. She tells old Alec he's really a duke and all, but he doesn't believe her and doesn't want to go with her to visit his mother and all. His mother's blind as a bat. But the other girl, the homey one, makes him go. She's very noble and all. So he goes. But he still doesn't get his memory back, even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid. But then, one day, some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball. Then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and kisses his mother on the forehead and all. Then he starts being a regular duke again, and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business. I'd tell you the rest of the story, but I might puke if I did. It isn't that I'd spoil it for you or anything. There isn't anything to spoil for Chrissake. Anyway, it ends up with Alec and the homey babe getting married, and the brother that's a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on Alec's mother so she can see again, and then the drunken brother and old Marcia go for each other. It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies.

az03hd,Objectionable Content and Characters in “The Catcher in the Rye” - Why was it banned?,"“The Catcher in the Rye” has been banned in so many different schools because it contains vulgar language and mentions of sexual activity.

I don’t believe the novel has many characters that relate to the objectionable content besides Holden, Sunny, and Mr. Antolini depending on how you perceive his character. I’ve heard people saying that Phoebe relates to the objectionable content, but I really don’t see why anyone could relate her to it?

I am teaching English 11 to high school juniors and we're moving onto my FAVORITE novel, *Catcher*. I'm so excited but I am nervous that this book will drag on or that my enthusiasm will cause them to reject it. Currently the students are in a passive,seething revolt against me because I made them write 2 essays in 4 weeks (the horror!) and I'd like to alleviate that a bit, or at least not ruin an important book for them. 


The reason I love *Catcher* is because of the incredible symbolism and because it's the book that changed my life by making me realize that I was severely depressed and that I could ask for help. I read it in school and mostly explored it on my own and I fell in love with it and it changed my life. 


Other *Catcher* lovers, in what ways did you read and process the book that made you like it? Any *Catcher* haters, in what ways did you read and process the book that made you hate it? 


Any teachers have other suggestions? Thanks all.

I certainly never related to Holden Caufield or his daydreams of catching children before they run off a cliff, that obtuse and painful metaphor felt like an adult trying to understand childhood after far to much time had passed from his own.""

413qhd,Holden's actions in Catcher in The Rye,"I finished the book for the first time back in September and being an adolescent myself it completely blew me out of the water by how close to home it hits portraying the mindset of a typical teenager. The novel itself is not too hard to read yet it’s executed so well that you’d think that Holden Caulfield were a real person who wasn’t J.D. Salinger that wrote it about right after he finished his little journey. Fantastic, but, today I want to talk about Holden’s actions. Are his actions and thoughts justified? As evidenced, he seems to be going through what today we call a “teenage angst” phase. He’s got everything and appreciates nothing. He has a hatred towards nearly everyone and everything, except maybe his sister. To most people who’ve read the book says that he acts irrationally and irresponsibly, and I do agree in some part. But in my opinion Holden is not to be blamed throughout his journey. First of all, Holden is a teenager. How many teenagers have you met that haven’t at least said the F-word (Ironically, Holden hates F-words…and phonies), got into a fight or an argument over silly stuff with a friend, or flunked some subjects at school? And there’s the experience with the adult world. Is it really Holden’s fault that the pimp beats him up for not paying for the “service” that he pressures an inexperienced teenage boy into it? Is it really his fault that the adult world is shady, filthy and harsh? Holden, I think, is more mature than most of the “adults” that he resents in the story, for he is self-conscious enough to appreciate the innocence of childhood. This is just my two cents, let me know what you guys think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/413qhd/holdens_actions_in_catcher_in_the_rye/,2016-01-15T16:15:50Z,4,6,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

4qcvg8,Thoughts on Catcher in the Rye: From Outside the Echo chamber.,"Yes, the title is a little pretentious, however the general consensus on Reddit - and yes, I'm fully prepared to get downvoted - when it comes to Catcher in the Rye, is this: ""Caulfield should just shut up, he's son annoying!"" ""I can't relate"" etc. etc. This always irks me, because there's so much more going on in Catcher if you look a little deeper:

I remember for a long time wondering why that book had been given so much critical acclaim, and it wasn't till a re-read and a few searches through analysis and reviews that I got it.

If you read the book when you're young (13-18) you're going to either A: Typically detest Holden and find him a pretentious jerk who's spouting nonsense, you think it's so annoying how he calls everyone a phony (yet the irony here is, you're just as much of a phony for thinking you're better than him, such is life at such a young age.) Or, B:You will agree with him that everyone is a phony etc. the lack of perspective that comes with being young. I'd also add, that by saying ""I can't relate to him, god he's annoying."" Is, in a certain way *being* Holden, one of his sins is that he never exits his immature perspective, the solipsistic perspective, he never thinks that maybe there's something else going on is other people's lives, and that their not just *his* burden, by saying ""I can't relate"" you're being just as solipsistic, not allowing yourself to come outside of *your* view and think for a moment that perhaps Holden himself has more going on in his life than what's at first glance.

Once I grew up a realized that the beauty of the book was that as you aged you no longer saw Holden as somewhat of a, say, competitor or ally in what it is to be a teenager. You realize, through the subtleties of Salinger's language that Holden has clearly had a rough past of abuse, and is now extremely insecure, arguably repressed and suffering from PTSD (pointed out to me from a Redditor). Also, in the 50's mental illness, abuse and your personal past was something of a taboo to talk about, so Salinger was making leaps here.

By saying Holden frustrates you, in is some way confronting some truth, he's an extremely *real* character, fully dimensional, where one can relate to the point of wanting to punch him in the face. Yes, he pushes people away, yes he's narcissistic, but are you, as a reader any better if you merely belittle him for ignorant shortcomings and push him away for his narrow world view. Do what Caulfield doesn't and think from someone else's perspective. 

At first, yes, I thought Holden was this pretentious little whiny shit. Then I grew up and realized Holden is just a kid, and we, as adults completely forget what it's like to have that kind of seemingly important drama going on all the time, the drama that is so absolutely new and real that is *must* of course be important, and we grow and then it isn't, it's replaced with more seemingly important drama, we forget what it's like to be a kid. And, really, Holden can be forgiven, because he's just a kid.

8mkn3f,Norwegian Wood really gave me a young adult Catcher in the Rye type of feeling,"After seeing Norwegian Wood by Murakami recommended by a lot of people on this sub, I picked it up and finished it over this past week. While I'll concede I really enjoyed the story, and liked a few of the characters, it seemed like the overall story was very similar to Catcher in the Rye, but just with a setting in Tokyo and young adult characters instead.

[Spoilers ahead] After I finished the last few pages, it dawned on me that Watanabe basically had zero character development throughout the book. He is constantly hung up on Kizuki killing himself, and later the same with Naoko. It's constantly spelled out in his face (by either Midori, or even his own realizations) that he is being incredibly selfish and self-absorbed in his refusal to stop his sulking throughout basically the entire novel.

I also found it incredibly frustrating that Midori tells him exactly what his problem is multiple times, yet he just ignores it and goes deeper into his funk, even while Naoko is still alive and is reciprocating his feelings for the most part. Then in the end, Reiko tells him that he had always ""chose"" Midori, despite the fact that he told Midori he basically can't ever be with her while Naoko is alive. Even after her death, he disappears with only a letter's notice for a month, and only re-surfaces when Reiko and Naoko have finally disappeared from his life. And to top it all off, the first thing he says on the phone is *I* need to talk to you, *I* have a million things to tell, etc. After all the death, despair, and depression he's gone through, he still reverts back to his selfish tendencies instead of maybe thinking about how Midori feels on the phone call.


So to bring it back to Catcher, the biggest criticism of Holden I see is how whiny he is, calling everyone a phony, when he himself is one and refuses to grow up. Watanabe talks so much about how Kizuki is forever 17, Naoko is forever 21, and he's the one soldiering on, being strong because no one else is; but, three years later (and I think there are even flash forwards with the narration to him as an older man?), he still has the inability to view his relationships subjectively and realize how much pain he's causing those he loves or interacts with, effectively staying the in the same mindset he had at 17. 

The motif I picked up on in the book is relationships or bonds Watanabe has with those he cares for. In the beginning, he and Naoko bond over Kizuki's death, then later, Reiko replaces Naoko in that sense, and disappears as well, leaving him completely alone. Midori sort of acts as the only grounding element in his life, trying to bring him back to the real world, yet he constantly ignores her, treats her badly, and refuses her advances or advice. The ending is sort of ambiguous, and many discussions on here I've read see it as hopeful, but I just saw it as more hopelessness, with Toru surrounded by strangers and somewhere he can't even describe, while Midori is still trying to bring him back out of whatever/wherever he is stuck in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8mkn3f/norwegian_wood_really_gave_me_a_young_adult/,2018-05-27T20:49:52Z,10,20,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

so, if u you don't really remember, let me paraphrase; mr antolini is the teacher whom holden admires and respects, which is actually very rare for holden. He's also the teacher who carried james castle's dead body after he committed suicide. james was holden's school mate back then.

years later, when holden was spending the night at antolini's place, he wakes up to antolini patting his head. feeling confused, he leaves the place. 

to make a shallow comment, i don't think antolini was a bad person (because i love holden and trust his instincts about people) but he might have as well fancied young boys. i've always wondered if something ever happened between antolini and james? could he have molested (or, i don't know, sexually approached to) james and that's why he felt compelled to lift his dead body as he was feeling remorse?

or do you think his intentions were innocent even when he was patting holden's head?

and most of the stuff i read about the book today were kinda disdaining and saying one could only relate to holden during their teenagers but i am 26 and i can still relate to holden in so many ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5iksti/could_mr_antolini_have_molested_james_castle_in/,2016-12-15T23:09:53Z,7,9,books,The Catcher in the Rye,POST

18l9j5p,Reading “Good Omens” and I feel like I'm reading Gibberish. Need help in understanding what's wrong.,"I have never seen the show, and knew close to nothing about this book before beginning. I'll also mention that English is not my first language, and I'm a beginner reader. 

I began this book with high hopes, and I'm absolutely not trying to say that this book is bad. It's just that I understand absolutely nothing. I might as well be reading German or Spanish (I don't know either of those languages) 

There are paragraphs that I've read multiple times, but I still have zero clue what it's trying to say. I'm like a monkey with a Quantum physics textbook.

I had this exact same problem with Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. I started that with really huge expectations too, because I love sci-fi, but I was so lost the entire time. 

I struggled with Jane Austen a lot but I literally became familiar with that very quickly, and ended up enjoying all of her books very much, but I finished ALL of Hitchhiker's guide but I can't remember a single thing. It's not the randomness that's hard to understand. It's the language itself. I don't know why I'm struggling with this when I can read other classics and understand it pretty well?

For example, this from Good Omens:

“Sometimes this sort of leaflet had a little historical bit, because the kind of companies that hired places like this for a weekend of Interactive Personnel Analysis or A Conference on the Strategic Marketing Dynamic liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building - give or take a couple of complete rebuildings, a civil war, and two major fires that some Elizabethan financier had endowed as a plague hospital.”

I have ZERO clue what this paragraph means. Am I just dumb? All I understood from the chapter it is from is that the characters go into this building to meet some nun and some guys start shooting at them for some reason??? I have no clue what it all means/why it's supposed to be funny. Then, they leave.

Does anyone know if this is like a different style of writing or something? So, I can avoid it in the future? Or is there a way to get better at understanding it? All I know is that both Hitchhiker and good omens feel the same. It's not the randomness that confuses me. There are dialogues and paragraphs and entire pages where I feel like I'm reading a different language.

Edit: Thank you so much for explaining, guys. Looks like I'm not at the level where I can understand these books. I also don't have any knowledge about British culture, so the satire is lost on me. Just want to say that I was not at all trying to bash these books.

The first one I ever encountered was Neverwhere, also dramtised with the wonderful James McAvoy as the main character as the main character Richard Mayhew. Although I still think that Neverwhere is the best of Neils work (Corline is fun but short and I dropped Ameican Gods after slogging through 6 of its tergid chapter) I do belive that Good Omens is the the funniest of his work. I enjoyed it even more after reading The Omen which it is a partody of.

11gsskq,Finally finished Good Omens.,"Man , what a cool book. I feel bad it took me so long to read. I’m not really a reader, or I should say I have a bad track record.  I get all geeked on reading for a week or so and then putz out, but I’m trying to change that now that I’m sober and hopefully not nearly as depressed..lol..

Anyway, I’m excited to learn what I even enjoy reading. I randomly picked up Good Omens based on a Reddit post 3 years ago and really don’t know what else to read or what/who I even like. I’ve read like, 4 books in my life I think, and the Alchemist is one of them, so, yknow. 

I bought Legends and Lattes today because I hear it’s popular and I like coffee. I haven’t started it yet but I’m afraid of being “too old” for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11gsskq/finally_finished_good_omens/,2023-03-03T05:49:41Z,63,391,books,Good Omens,POST

15wurlg,"Of nice and accurate prophecies: ""Good Omens"" by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.","Finished a very good, and witty novel by two literary giants! It is ""Good Omens"" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (of Discworld fame). And these two fellows created one hell of book!

So according, at least, to a book known as ""The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (the only known book of prophecies that is completely accurate that was written in 1655, right before the author blew up) the world will end on a Saturday. Which,of course, is next Saturday.

So now the armies of good and evil are gathering, Atlantis is rising up from the depths, frogs are falling from the sky, and of course tempers are flaring. It all seems to be falling into place in the whole Divine Plan.

However, two individuals, a slightly fussy angel and demon that loves fast living, who have lived among the mortals ever since the very Beginning and becoming quite fond of the lifestyle, don't seem to be looking forward to the Rapture. And for some reason someone has misplaced the Antichrist somehow.

This is quite a charming and funny fantasy story and one written in collaboration between two big names. Neil is one whose work I'm quite firmly familiar with, but not so much with the work of Terry Pratchett. The late Pratchett is also another very big name in the world of popular literature particularly with the fantasy series ""Discworld"". His is a name I've heard on several occasions but never had the chance to read any of his work, until this I read this collaborative work that he did with Neil. And I think I might probably consider reading some of his Discworld novels someday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15wurlg/of_nice_and_accurate_prophecies_good_omens_by/,2023-08-21T02:36:43Z,83,240,books,Good Omens,POST

ultih4,A love letter to Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.,"I must have been living under a rock my whole life, but until the Amazon Prime series premiered, I’d never heard of Good Omens. Even when I suddenly started hearing about it everywhere, I somehow managed to avoid learning that it was based on a book, and that Terry Pratchett was one of the authors of that book.

I’m one of those obnoxious people who becomes less inclined to do something the more people tell me to do it, so the more I heard about the show, the less inclined I became to watch it. Eventually, after enough time had passed I stopped hearing about it altogether, and forgot about it until now and then I’d hear Queen’s *You’re My Best Friend* which would instantly take me back to those times when the Good Omens trailer would play before *absolutely everything I tried to watch on Prime*.

Fast forward a couple of years to 2021. I met the love of my life and although I count my blessings that she’s a book lover too, I recognise that I don’t think I could have fallen in love with anyone who wasn’t. 

Anyway, we live in different parts of Europe, so we have to resort to spending many our evenings on the phone together. We’d been toying with the idea of reading something together, going away and reading a chapter of a book during the day, maybe, then coming together of an evening to talk about it on the phone. It was just a case of deciding what book to read first.

My girlfriend suggested that we read Good Omens. It’s her favourite book, and so I put aside my grievances with having the show shoved down my throat in 2019, and went ahead and bought a copy. I trusted her judgement, and more than anything, I felt so honoured that she was wanting to share something she loved so dearly with me. We’d agreed, by this point, that we’d read the book aloud to one another over the phone, and I felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility to do her favourite book justice, and not ruin it for her forever.

It took us a month to read it, all in all. Long phone calls, several sections read twice over because listening to me read often made her fall asleep. But when she managed to stay awake, there was laughter, tears, stutters around beautifully complex sentences that, as a native speaker of English I really shouldn’t have struggled with as much as I did, and a whole lot of joy. 

All of this is to say that *I effing loved it*. I’ve never read anything quite like it in terms of creativity, its cleverness, its perfect blend between fantasy and reality, its sense of being commentary without being that *preachy* kind of commentary, the absolutely spot on anecdotes about British life, and just the *humanity* of it all. I’ve never read any sort of fantasy novel that’s managed to feel so *possible*. There was a beautiful sense of normalcy to it; The settings, the characters, the little details and the genius bigger ones.

In particular, I was so impressed with how ‘The Them’ were written. I feel like it’s such an underrated and rare talent to be able to write kids who *sound like kids*. The dialogue was bright and brilliant and colourful, and genuinely had that naive, sunshine-y quality to it that I feel is so hard to achieve in fiction. It felt like there was a legitimate childlike logic to the kids’ misconceptions, the mistakes they’d make about the Spanish Inquisition for example, and the dynamic between them just felt so genuine.

This book warmed my heart right through, and I feel like there was a greater reason I never felt tempted to watch/read it before. I got to experience it for the first time with my favourite person in the world, and the book itself has become one of my favourites of all time now, as has the show (we binged it in a single sitting a few days after we finished the book). I feel like it’s been years since I’ve felt such a strong, emotional connection to a book, and it’s one I think I’ll keep coming back to for the rest of my life. I can’t wait to read it again, and I cannot recommend it enough.

15x6omg,German translation of Good Omens is deliberately inaccurate,"I'm trying to learn German and having recently read Good Omens, thought I'd give the 1991 German translation a shot. Lo and behold, every instance of Aziraphale pinging someone's gaydar has been edited out. The famous line about people reading him as 'gayer than a treeful of monkeys' is now 'more mischievous [vermitzter] than etc'. Guess it's less vulgar if Aziraphale gives the impression he'll steal your glasses and throw poop at you. Shadwell doesn't call him a Southern pansy but a dumb Southerner. Poofter becomes Lackaffe (a loudly dressed male). And so it goes. It's clearly intentional. For whatever reason the translator made a point of using expressions that mean anything but gay. 

Anyone know the backstory here? Has anyone else come across books that have been censored in translation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15x6omg/german_translation_of_good_omens_is_deliberately/,2023-08-21T12:45:58Z,25,75,books,Good Omens,POST
zcudhc,Thoughts on Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman,"I have a New Year's resolution to read more and visit the library more often. Every year, I start a resolution early to see if it will stick and make it a habit before the new year rolls around. I started out by reading Good Omens, a book that's been suggested to me by a few friends and I finally got around to reading and finishing it.

Overall impression is positive! It was a page turner for sure and I liked *most* of the characters, Crowley and Aziraphale chiefly. Before this, about a year ago, I read American Gods by the same author and I can see many similarities which was a lot of fun. There are some things I'd like to nitpick with you all if you would humor me...

The multiple viewpoints, especially in the last third of the book or so, were giving me whiplash. Crowley, Aziraphale/Mr. Shadwell/Madame Tracy, The Four Horsemen, Adam Young/the Them, and Newt/Anathema each had their own separate stories that intertwined with each other and that was great but sometimes each viewpoint only had a paragraph before bouncing to the next character's story. I don't mind this but it happened so much towards the end that it began to take the wind out of the climax's sails (for me. Keep in mind this post is just opinion).

The notes at the bottom of the pages were often hilarious but sometimes were a bit distracting. The writing was genius and there were times I looked forward to the little asterisks but towards the end there they sometimes felt like too much author interruption. Sometimes those little notes broke up the flow of the story a bit too much for my liking.

The concept of modern-day Four Horsemen of the apocalypse was awesome and I loved each one

Reading about the Them (i.e the son of Satan and his friends) felt very slow. I feel like I should be lenient here because, after all, the kid's 11 years old and the authors pretty much perfectly summed up 11 year old life and activities. But yeah, the 11 year old children's dialogue was so accurate that it was slightly painful sometimes. 

Absolutely loved how similar Crowley and Aziraphale were. Just two agents that were sent to do a job and though on surface level were opposites, both were just two sides of the same coin. I liked seeing how Crowley could be selfless and the moment Aziraphale cursed for the first time in 6,000 years.

Mr. Shadwell was a dick to Madame Tracey and didn't contribute all that much besides sending Newt on his mission to Lower Tadfield. I may be way off base here and if I'm missing something crucial then I'm terribly sorry.

So yes, all in all the above are fairly small things that I didn't love but overall the book was great. Really fun concept, witty writing and definitely entertaining.

kxyxf3,Good Omens Appreciation Post,"Good Omen's by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is a laugh out loud supernatural thrill ride as funny as it is potent. When the end of days is imminent, Aziraphale and Crowley need to find a misplaced antichrist in wacky supernatural hijinks. What stood out the most to me is how well the two author's styles blended. I always see Gaiman's work as deep and powerful, tales of ancient magic and powerful gods. Pratchett's work on the other hand is off the wall creative and hilariously funny. These seemingly diametrically opposed styles actually build off of each other instead of contradicting. Gaiman grounds pratchett, deepening the themes and moral undertones, while Pratchett lends creativity and humor to the text. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and wish there were more books coauthored so well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kxyxf3/good_omens_appreciation_post/,2021-01-15T17:13:44Z,15,34,books,Good Omens,POST

qy52cf,Can't finish Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman,"First off: this may spoiler some people and I have no idea how to put a spoiler tag. 
So if you plan on reading it,you know! 


I gave up on the book around page 270 or something. 
I know that  lot of people love it and I gave it a fair try. I also love Neil Gaiman so... yeah..
But to me it was flat out boring and way too silly.
My probelm is not even the British humor - I like British humor in fact.
The premise was good to be honest. But the thing is: the execution of it was more than terrible. 
I cannot count how many times I groaned whenever a new side character with backstory, name etc (don't even get me started here) appeared that contributed nearly to nothing to the plot. They also distracted a lot to properly focus on Aziraphale, Crowley, Adam (the supposed to be protagonists + maybe Anathema). Sadly, their characters were too flat and underdeveloped to save the book for me. 
I also didn't quite understand that Aliens, Tibetans, Atlantis and a ship being attacked by the Kraken played a role? To me it seemed to be just randomly thrown in to add some wit and humor. It just absolutely failed at that attempt. 
It only contributed to even more confusion. Adams sudden change (instead of a slow developement) to show his power felt rushed. 
All in all: the book felt rushed, didn't make sense to me in the most parts and is just a huge mess. 

I genuinely cannot fathom how people actually like it? Anyway, I am happy that some do. 
I just couldn't. I cannot enjoy a book, where I have to take notes on the many side characters and have to wonder in what way they are necessary to the story. If they are not necessary, then I wonder why were they added? Just for a bad attempt to throw in a joke?
I gave it a fair chance. I didn't like it. Reading it felt like a chore. I will never finish it and most likely donate it to the library. 
Maybe it will find a home, where someone does enjoy it :) It seems there are enough people out there for it anyway :) 
For myself: I hope I am not alone with this opinion and will now move on to another adventure!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qy52cf/cant_finish_good_omens_by_terry_pratchett_and/,2021-11-20T12:56:59Z,24,3,books,Good Omens,POST

hdzgtj,Is this Gaiman's or Pratchett's touch that I'm seeing in Good Omens?,"Just finished this book for the first time and it was a lot of fun! There is so much humor and I absolutely loved it. One of my favorite aspects of the book was the character descriptions. They said so much about the characters while poking fun at their unique traits. The first one coming to mind being Wensleydale, who is described as (paraphrasing) ""*the sort of person that paints all the little fiddly bits of his Airfix model before starting*"" and ""*his parents call him 'youngster' hoping he'll get the hint, as he seems to have the mind of a forty-five-year-old in a child's body.*"", etc. 

From what I understand, the book was a joint venture between Gaiman and Pratchett. My question is, are these humorous and detailed character descriptions more characteristic of Neil Gaiman, or of Terry Pratchett?

b7ji55,Good Omens: Discussion,"OK, I am currently listening to the audio book for Good Omens during my down time. It's a great book, but I often find myself zoning out when Aziraphale is speaking. I find him to be a fairly boring character, it seems the book mainly focuses on Crowley, but I still want him to feel less stilted. Am I the only one who felt this way? It may be because I'm only a fourth of the way through, but I don't really sense that his character will be deepening any time soon.

Pratchett writing quirks where he just throws characters and traits for no apparent logical reason here and there, and this really messed with me keeping track.

After damn near 20 years (I think) of being in the works, it was finally, ACTUALLY getting made! 

It finally premiered not too long ago, and I watched the first episode the day of.  I was... Not drawn in. Which was disappointing. But, I figured I'd hold faith and I watched the second episode a few days later. Still, I wasn't feeling it. I ended up not even finishing the second episode, I was folding laundry while watching it and I paused it to get up and do something, and I ended up not going back.

I'd like to watch it, because I love the book and I was really excited for the show to arrive, but for whatever reason I just couldn't get into it.

9erzc5,"Just got back from a long trip; on my flights I finished ""Good Omens"" for the first time (spoilers)","I'm a big fan of sci-fi epics and literary classics, but I've never gotten into fantasy before. Then this year I've dived into Neil Gaiman and Brandon Sanderson and greatly enjoyed them. A good friend asked if I'd read *Good Omens* and was aghast when I said no, so of course I had to read it.

I was pleasantly blown away. I admit I saw the shorter length and was a bit skeptical, but the quality of the writing put me at ease immediately. There are so many great lines I couldn't bring myself to clip them on my Kindle, I'm just going to re-read it at some point anyway.

And I think it would be very tempting to compare Pratchett to Douglas Adams, because they're both hilarious and British. But having read the whole Hitchhiker's series (and nothing else of Pratchett) I had a slightly different comparison in mind: Mark Twain. The worldbuilding is apparently a different scale (Twain never did anything like Discworld, which is now on my short list of big series to dive in) but man...those sections about Adam and Them could have been straight from the pages of *Tom Sawyer* or *Huckleberry Finn.* It was equal parts familiar and exhilarating. The relationship of Crowley and Aziraphale was particularly Twain-like and fit perfectly in his love of blue-collar humans sticking it to the bureaucracy.

I'm sure many people here love this book too so I won't go on and on (and I could, at length), so I just wanted to share my feelings about the Twain comparison because I honestly never thought I would say that about an author. Twain always seemed like such a unique writer, and he still is, but Pratchett comes damn close and I'm happy I discovered him with this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9erzc5/just_got_back_from_a_long_trip_on_my_flights_i/,2018-09-10T22:54:53Z,16,52,books,Good Omens,POST
362cji,Reading Good Omens but it's not a page turner. Will I still like Discworld?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently halfway through **Good Omens** and while it's kooky and witty, it's not a page turner. I'm finding it slow and difficult to get into the characters since they switch so often (or new characters randomly pop up). Actually I fall asleep every night after half a chapter :/

I guess I like novels with a stronger narrative. It might make more sense when it all comes together at the end.

Is Good Omens a typical Terry Pratchett novel? Will I even like Discworld? I am a big fan of fantasy stories woven with wit (and as a woman I even loved Xanth) but if the narrative jumps around a  lot I might have to lower my expectations. (PS, I really disliked American Gods and didn't read more than the first few chapters, so it may be a Gaiman issue).

I planned on starting Discworld with The Witches stream, or the YA books to ease into it. 

Now let's discuss!

5x7tcs,"Finished Good Omens; or, What am I missing? (SPOILERS)","Hi everyone, I just finished Good Omens, which I know is beloved by a lot of people on this sub, and I can’t say that I didn’t enjoy it. So far I’ve read the first four chronological books in the Discworld series; I’ve enjoyed all four, and I hear the later books are even better. As for Gaiman, I’ve read Neverwhere, which I adored, and Coraline, which I really liked. Naturally, I was excited about Good Omens.

Now, it is a good book. It has its fun moments. I liked some of the characters. But I was underwhelmed by it in almost every other respect. I figure I’ll post my issues with the book in list form.

- The plot is a hot mess. It’s non-linear and not in a good way. It jumps way too quickly between characters, some of which we barely see (like the red-haired woman who becomes...War, I believe? Pollution?). I felt the authors jerked me around too quickly and too often. All of this would be fine if the book had a really sharp satiric edge, but the book only had a few good satirical jabs at its subject: the Apocalypse, the idea of a rapture, religion, etc. It wasn't as pungent as a satire or a critique of religious ideas, the end of the world, and so on. If it were, I'd have enjoyed the book more. Instead, it was more scatter-shot and rambling than anything.

- The younger characters (Adam, Pepper, and so on) felt really out of place. I felt like I was reading a different novel, more like a PG version of Stephen King’s It or a book version of Stranger Things. I'm not opposed to having such characters in this kind of book. It's a pretty cool idea to have kids like this participate in the apocalypse. I'd love to see the characters of Stranger Things get involved in apocalyptic goings-on. I also really liked Adam’s little soliloquies at the end of the book, but before that point, I was generally bored by the scenes with the children.

- I LOVED Aziraphale and Crowley, but there weren’t enough scenes of them.

- I also enjoyed Anathema and Newt, but again, there’s not enough for them to do it seems. And Newt is introduced way too late in the book.

- Really happy to see a cameo by Death, one of my favorite Discworld characters.

- I enjoyed the scene where Aziraphale speaks through the fundamentalist preacher on TV. 

Most of all, I didn’t really laugh all that much. I smiled here and there. Maybe I missed something. It was also way too long. I do want to read it again sometime. And I actually can’t wait for the proposed TV adaptation. I think the book could become an excellent mini-series. I’d love to hear what people who love the book think. Where am I wrong?

15zra9w,What makes a good book Adaptation?,"I recently watched the show Silo on Apple TV , loved it so much that I'm currently reading the first book.

I started thinking what makes a good book adaptation. I will use some examples to illustrate.

For Silo specifically the book has some major changes comparing to the show like >!the fact that we as readers know that the outside world is not beautiful since basically the beginning of the book as opposed to the show which we only find out in the end, also the end of the season is only half way of the first book!!<

So I came to conclude that accuracy alone is not what defines a good adaptation.For me it boils down to this:1 - Keep the core of the book(be it the characters , some crucial scenes, some crucial dialogue)2 - Adjust what needs to be adjusted for the media, if something is told for instance in a narration you need to make it work for tv/movie , either that becomes a conversation or some detail that explains some background , or maybe it is lost in translation)

3 - Create or fill in  the blanks if necessary , I feel Silo did this very well in the series by showing us Holston's wife and showing the relationship between Juliette and her father for instance

Another good example I believe is the adaptation of ""A man called Ove"" which became ""A man called Otto"" with Tom Hanks. I love this book , didn't like the choice of Tom for the part but to be honest they kept what worked and changed what was necessary there. The good parts of the book were kept(the conversation between him and her neighbor in the car was just like the book) and others were adapted(there is a scene narrated in the book of a memory of his , this became a small conversation between him and the neighbor that worked perfectly. It's not a perfect adaptation but it was really good IMO

Now for a small rant , a bad example of this is the adaptation of ""Daisy Jones and the Six"" , I could go on a very long rant here on why this adaptation is a slap in the face of anyone who liked this book , suffice to say that no scenes or dialogue that I loved from the book are in the series , the songs have absolutely nothing like the ones in the book , and the main character was IMO completely changed from book to series.

ivw7ji,Recommendations of books which were made into good shows/films.,"
Here is a list of underrated shows/films that I think did justice to the books they were adapted from. (Will try to include most genres) 

1. Good Omens - Listen, the blasphemous,witty, crazy and sarcastic combination of the writers named Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman gave us this gem of a book. Extremely hilarious moments from the book adequately incorporated into the series (available in amazon prime) were due to made the best casting of David Tennant and Micheal Sheen in the leads. The unexpected age-old friendship of an angel and a demon couldnot have been portrayed by anyone better them. 
The book was a 9/10. The series was a solid 8/10. Much of the book and the series were aligned with one another except the towards ending. 
2.  Girl, interrupted - Now this was a book vastly different from the movie although key points were taken from the book. Both the book and the movie are equally amazing. The book starts off exactly how it is depicted in the movie. 
This movie has some epic actors in it with Angelina Jolie, Winona Ryder, Brittney Murphy, Jared Leto to name a few. 
The movie is set in a mental asylum where the writer (played by Winona) ends up due to an attempted suicide when she was 18 and for once I felt the movie was better than the book but that’s just me because I felt the book became to analytical towards the end. 
It’s a beautiful movie. (8/10) 
And a good read. (7/10) 
3. Me before you - while writing the manuscript, Jojo Moyes probably knew  that it would pull audiences in the theatres if made into a movie. To top it off, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, Janet McTeer Sam Claflin and Mathew Lewis (Yes our Neville had a glow up here) were cast in the main leads.
Louisa Clark is a cracker for a woman who had an eccentic sense of style who was forced to look for a job and ended up caring for a man who is paralysed from the neck down. Love doesn’t have a timing, you see, when it hits, it hits hard. The movie or the book doesn’t end like it should and that’s what makes it special. 
Both the book and the series get a solid 7/10 from me. 
4. Unorthodox - Another book that has some extreme differences with the plot of the series. The series is in netflix and has the same name. 
This book opened me to a world I had no idea about, the closed off, secluded world of Hasidic Judaism. The world are women and men (esp women) were not meant to know even about their own bodie, sexual education toh dure thak. A world where women aren’t meant to be too educated, so similar that world is to what we see happening in parts of our own country. 
The series is dramatised but the book is a memoir about finding freedom from a more realistic perspective.

It's not just a book about war, it really is a book about life and the absurd contradictions that we face. And the way it's written is almost like a giant shitpost at times. I still remember the first summer I read it I couldn't get through it at all because it didn't make any logical sense, and then suddenly it hit me that it wasn't supposed to be logical, it was supposed to intuitively speak to me.

1alsfo2,I'm reading Catch-22 and I'm awe by Hellers ability to make me question if I should hysterically laugh or cry almost every chapter.,"I don't know how I managed to not read this book for such a long time, it has become and instant all-time favorite of mine.
The way Heller describes the devastating ridiculousness of everything happening in great detail is such a crazy contrast to important characters getting killed off in just a short sentence.





>“Four times during the first six days they were assembled and briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forward most position of the Allied ground forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.

>For hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because it would not move up high enough to encompass the city.

>When night fell, they congregated in the darkness with flashlights, continuing their macabre vigil at the bomb line in brooding entreaty as though hoping to move the ribbon up by the collective weight of their sullen prayers. ""I really can't believe it,"" Clevinger exclaimed to Yossarian in a voice rising and falling in protest and wonder. ""It's a complete reversion to primitive superstition. They're confusing cause and effect. It makes as much sense as knocking on wood or crossing your fingers. They really believe that we wouldn't have to fly that mission tomorrow if someone would only tiptoe up to the map in the middle of the night and move the bomb line over Bologna. Can you imagine? You and I must be the only rational ones left.""

szij7h,Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.,"LMFAO. I always wondered how can a book make you laugh opposed to movies and series. This book proved it to me. Even though at most instances it’s very hard to apprehend the description due to the surfeit amount of inscrutable wordings it was a vivacious, effervescent and jovial read. 

Lol the above paragraph is just me trying to do like Heller and increasing word limit so that the mods dont remove this

Coming to the point. I love how Heller made the dialogues between the characters. Of course thats the highlight, as those dialogue deliveries is what made me cackle many times or should I say almost all the time. Maybe I found most words hard to understand because English is my 3rd language. One annoying thing is the repetition of dialogues (annoying because it confuses tf out of me) but otherwise I love the dialogues as I told you thats the highlight.

Lol another Heller I pulled off repeating stuff.

But when you look closely it’s a tragic book. >!Seeing how almost all of Yossarian’s friends dies except Orr!< kinda makes you think about life eh? Death is imminent and inevitable. Ngl but most characters are not really likeable. And I wanna fucking punch the shit out of Arfy for what he does. 

IMO it’s a must read and just have a dictionary next to you or ask SIRI for meaning lol.

Until now that is. It made me laugh so hard, I ended up searching google if that was even normal, is this supposed to make you literally cry tears of laughter (see Major Major Major Major)? Perhaps I was just getting it wrong?

The second half was way darker, but it still retained the nuances of satire and dark humour that were very much present in the first half.

sfqmmo,"I did it. I FINALLY finished Catch-22 and man, was it worth it.","I started this book 5 years ago and found it amusing and interesting, but hard to get through, so I dropped it. Picked it back up again a year later and got half way through before dropping it again.

I suddenly had an urge to try again and I guess I was in the right mood this time. I don't know how I didn't find the book funny before, but it was absolutely hilarious to me this time around. Vonnegut is the only other author who's made me actually laugh out loud before. It was still a bit tedious at times, but I made myself read through it in a week to make sure I wouldn't drop it again. So glad I did, because the ending was amazing and ties everything together in a disturbing, heart-rending way.

I laughed. I cried. It's one of the best books I've ever read and I'll definitely read it again someday. If you've struggled to get through this book, I hope you give it a second (or third) chance.

 This has to be hands down one of the best books I've ever read. Catch-22 is as funny as it is twisted; one second you'll sit there laughing at the absurdity of a character only to have your heart sink a few sentences later. Heller did a fantastic job in creating such complex characters (except for Aarfy, fuck Aarfy).

The only issue I had with the book was just how hard it was to read. I remember the reason for my frustration being that I had to have a dictionary or translator app open at all times.

wr2kpx,Thoughts on Catch-22,"So in July I just finished Catch-22 and I thought it was a good book other than some questionable content. After reading I thought it was about how society (or capitalist society) is made to crush us and there's no way out, how no matter what we do or what we try it's pointless. I think it also says quite literally that we need to leave a Fascist, Authoritarian society (Italy) and go towards a more Socialist model (Sweden), and to do this, all we need to do is work together and trust the people around, like how Yossarian should have trusted Orr.

I think at the base of it Yossarian is a deeply paranoid character and how he could represent us and society and how we don't trust the people around us, and think everyone's out to get us. Yossarian is right in the fact that everyone is trying to kill him, and if we are supposed to represent Yossarian we need to leave this society behind and start over. It could also just be a witty satire.Thoughts?

13dqds8,Adjustment Day and Catch-22,"Hello,

I am currently reading Adjustment Day by Chuck Palahniuk and I couldn't help but notice some similarities to Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. If anyone else has read both, would you care to discuss? Do you think Palahniuk was heavily inspired by Heller?

Here is what I noticed: 

* Both authors unravel the plot in a non-linear fashion
* Both books share a level of absurdity that straddles the line between comedy and the grotesque
* there is a similar exploration of the social and personal consequence of corrupt social hierarchies. In Heller's case, the consequence seemed to be irrationalism and disillusionment. For Palahniuk the story devolves into full fledged anarchy. For both: relativism. 

Here are some quotes that made me think this connection was more than superficial:

""The way Walter saw it, he hadn't been slacking. He'd been bidding his time, conserving his resources, waiting for his one main chance. He'd made a list of what he'd believed in: *Santa Claus, Catholic God, Baptist God, Buddhist God, Pagan God, Satan, The Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, The Seattle Sonics and the Oklahoma Outlaws, Gary Hart and Walter Mondale and Al Gore, Circumcision*

To date he'd believed in democracy and Manifest Destiny. He'd believed in capitalism and moral relativity and Social Marxism. If he could put his faith in them, he could believe in anything. Maybe believing in those ridiculous abstractions was an exercise in believing, period."" - Adjustment Day

""He had Orr's word to take for the flies in Appleby's eyes.  
""Oh, they're there all right,"" Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight in the officers' club, ""although he probably doesn't even know it. That's why he can't see things as they really are.""  
""How come he doesn't know it?"" inquired Yossarian.  
""Because he's got flies in his eyes,"" Orr explained with exaggerated patience. ""How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes?""  
It made as much sense as anything else, and Yossarian was willing to give Orr the benefit of the doubt because Orr was from the wilderness outside New York City and knew so much more about wildlife than Yossarin did, and because Orr, unlike Yossarian's mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle-in-law, teacher, spiritual leader, legislator, neighbor and newspaper, had never lied to him about anything crucial before."" -Catch 22

""There were too many dangers for Yossarian to keep track of. There was Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, for example, and they were all out to kill him. There was Lieutenant Scheisskopf with his fanaticism for parades and there was the bloated colonel with his big fat mustache and his fanaticism for retribution, and they wanted to kill him, too. There was Appleby, Havermeyer, Black and Korn. There was Nurse Cramer and Nurse Duckett, who he was almost certain wanted him dead, and there was the Texan and the C.I.D. man, about whom he had no doubt. There were bartenders, bricklayers and bus conductors all over the world who wanted him dead, landlords and tenants, traitors and patriots, lynchers, leeches and lackeys, and they were all out to bump him off."" -Catch 22

&#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts! Are these similarities only stylistic?

ybs9iz,I just finished my fourth book of 2022: Catch-22,"and overall I enjoyed it. I will admit I struggled in the middle chapters, I probably went a month without reading a single page, but I picked it back up determined to finish it and started enjoying it again. It was pretty convoluted, yet calculated. The humor was exactly up my alley. (i.e. ""I always didn't say you couldn't punish me"", ""disappearing"" someone, and all of the 'doublethink'-eqsue moments such as the chaplain's interrogation). 

Early in the year I remember reading something that said the average person reads four books a year. After reading that stat I made it a goal to beat it, so I'm starting book five tonight. I had actually never read a real ""book"" besides manga outside of educational requirements/assignments until 1984, my first book of the year. I followed it with Animal Farm, then Fahrenheit 451, then of course Catch-22. I'm going to change lanes and read something a little lighter, Howl's Moving Castle next!

So maybe this belongs on congratsliveimfive more than it does here, but I'm enjoying it nonetheless.

Sidenote: I'm curious as to the happenings in Closing Time, but 99.9% of what I've read about it says it doesn't match the style of Catch-22 at all and doesn't come anywhere near close to being as interesting.

tx68jt,Theory about Orr in Catch-22,"Something that occurred to me recently. Those who have read the book know that Orr was secretly trying to escape the war the entire time, either by repeatedly crash landing his plane on purpose, or by paying a prostitute to hit him over the head and injure him badly enough to go home. 

Throughout the book, Orr is also shown to be pretty easy going, almost always smiling and giggling to himself. There is one instance however when he seems to lose his cool, and even gets violent. That’s when he jumps over the ping pong table and hits Appleby in the head with his paddle. 

Now, early on in the book when this incident is described, we’re lead to believe that Orr was angry at Appleby for always winning and being so good at ping pong (and everything else he tries). This is how Yossarian feels after all. 

However, I recently started to wonder if instead Orr attacked Appleby to try and save him from the war too. I wonder if Orr saw this young, handsome, athletic kid, good at everything he tries, who was probably going to die before the war was over all so Colonel Cathcart could put another feather in his cap and Orr couldn’t stand the thought of it. So he jumped over the table and hit Appleby in the head to try to get him sent home. Just like how he tried to get himself sent home by having that girl in Italy hit him over the head.

jqs8gk,Catch 22 by Joseph Heller,"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one of the best satirical novels I've ever read. The endless barrage of oxymorons and completely rational but simultaneously insane perspectives presented by each of his characters lead to an engaging and amusing story. Despite this, Heller always brings it back to the darker undertones, the death and loss experienced by the protagonist, along with the fundamental flaws of humanity as a whole. The author critiques war, social organisation and human nature in such a brusque and outlandish manner that one cannot help but be deeply engaged, while simultaneously in stitches with laughter.

xb3hwi,Pronunciation of people's names in Catch-22,"Catch-22 is one of my all-time favourites. It's equal parts hilarious and tragic. I've read it maybe half a dozen times.

Here are a few particulars that vex me, and what I've been going with so far:  


Major —— de Coverley (Major ""blank"" de Coverley)  
Chief White Halfoat (just like ""half"" and ""oat"")  
Milo Minderbinder (""ai,"" like ""mind"" and ""bind"")  
Huple (like ""supple"")

jaondo,Why is Catch-22 so beloved?,"I’m starting chapter 8 of Catch-22 and I’m not sure if I want to keep going. I’m reading it as part of a self-created trilogy of anti-war books.

The last time I tried reading, I didn’t understand this paragraph and it put me off reading the rest of the book for some reason. Paragraph is below:

“The colonel was in Communications, and he was kept busy day and night transmitting glutinous messages from the interior into square pads of gauze which he sealed meticulously and delivered to a covered white pail that stood on the night table beside his bed.”

kpzquz,The Mastery of Catch-22 from the view of a Vet,"\- Rarely, has a book given me such an experience as Catch-22. A Clockwork Orange made me learn and become addicted to a new form of slang. That was close, but this...this was something else entirely.

\-I currently serve the U.S. military in a relative time of peace. Though I have deployed myself, and travelled the globe, I often wonder what those who served during the World Wars or Vietnam experienced. Catch-22 attracted me in being such a famous written about this time period. I picked up the book knowing it to be a satire, and yet wow it actual spun an incredibly deep narrative. It's absolutely absurd in points, but heart wrenching and real in others. The portrayals of rank structure and command are humoursly sort of realistic in a way, but also the loss felt of compatriots seems perfectly captured here as well. Joseph Heller wrote a damn masterpiece. 

\- Catch-22 was published in 1961, well before PTSD started being truly studied in the late 70's. Throughout the novel, we are given snapshots of events involving quirky soldiers, like Yossarian. And, while many of these events are quite laugh out loud funny, Heller is in a way showing life under extreme stress. It's brilliant, yet sad. In constant fear, cowardice, sexually charged, heroic, conniving, indecisive, self-conscious- these characters may display these emotions to the extreme, but they are humans in one of the world's worst meat grinders of a war. I found this incredibly compelling. I also saw glimpses of many of my fellow men-in-arms in some of these characters. This book has become an instant favorite for me.

\-Just a couple insights on a few of the characters. My opinions changed completely on Yossarian. Thought he was a quirky bastard in the beginning, and by the end was rooting for him as hard as I have any other protagonist. Same with Orr, and maybe Nately to some extent. Fuck Milo, profiter of war. Fuck Aarfy to hell. That scene in Rome with the servant girl pissed me off more than any other. As an enlisted man, I often wonder if rank structure and command exist in such a similar, ridiculous form for officer folk. With how many times command changes, or who exactly is in charge of what changes, these scenes resonated somewhat with me. I have read that in World War II, the Soviet Union followed orders so strictly from Stalin and headquarters, that if they were order to march over an unforeseen river, instead of questioning leadership they dove in. Men who couldn't swim were drowned without giving resistance to the order. Gear was lost. All of this so the commanding field officers could confidently tell headquarters an order was carried out, for fear of implying Stalin and HQ were wrong or misguided in their intelligence. This reminded me a lot of those historical narratives. So, maybe it isn't just the United States.

\-Ultimately, read Catch-22. It is a humorous account of a fascinating war. More importantly read it for its ability to mirror humanity. A wonderful variety of characters exist in extreme tenuous times, and it is impossible not to see ourselves in these men. It is how some of us would act when faced with the ludicrous, and others would act when faced with loss. Heller wrote a magnificent book, and I swear it'll give you some type of experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kpzquz/the_mastery_of_catch22_from_the_view_of_a_vet/,2021-01-04T03:05:54Z,28,72,books,Catch-22,POST

ayzm4n,Rereading Catch-22 and I absolutely love this sentence (major spoiler),"[Spoiler](#sI'm near the end of the book when things really start to go bad, after Colonel Cathcart has raised the required missions to 80, and the men are rushed out unprepared, and the flak is really awful, and Dobbs flies the wrong way trying to avoid the flak and hits another plane.

Heller focuses on Dobbs' plane going down, how quick it was, no smoke, and no parachutes, it just hit the water and was gone. And then comes the gut punch: “And Nately, in the other plane, was killed too."" And the chapter ends.

I love how it's an afterthought. Heller really makes you feel it by focusing on the other plane, when the character you really care about is treated like a footnote. It really drives home the point of the randomness and awfulness of war.

Probably has been done to death, but i've recently finished catch-22 by Joseph Heller and I loved it. I loved the light themes, the dark ones, the humour, the absurd and I think there was a great cast of characters. 

I really liked the way the sentences flowed from one into another. Nothing felt forced or out of place. I thought Heller also used quite a variety of words so each chapter remained fresh. Heaps of words i'd never come across before. I did think however, some of his sentences were miles too long.

581izf,Thoughts on Catch-22,"For school we were given a list of 8 or so books. We were to choose one, read/analyze, and then have a conference with the people who picked the same book. Doing a little research I saw that Catch-22 was very highly regarded by many critics and people and that it was a black comedy. So I chose it. And boy am I glad I did. It's probably my favorite book of all time and I kind of want to just re-read it instantly. The dialogue is fantastic- the conversations feel so real, like they actually happened. I was crying with laughter at so many different scenes. The characters are incredible. The ending brought a smile to my face. 

Catch-22 reminds me a little of Eminem's songs of his first couple of albums- there's always a joke in the serious bits, and always a serious under current in the joke. I love all the ironies and paradoxes. This book brought about so many varying emotions- anger with Cathcart, joy about Orr's escape, sadness and emptiness with Snowden's chapter, joy and humor with Yossarian, etc- that it feels like a complete experience for me. 

But, most of the people in my group weren't crazy about it and the ones who were said they'd probably never read it again or had wished they had picked another of the books.

It's been sitting on my nightstand for a long time now and I just can't get through it.

Is there any special event that will make it more interesting, is there some shift I am about to pass or is there something interesting going on that I have been missing this whole time. Did anyone else have trouble with this book and if so, did you finish it and like it?

c6nclg,Catch-22 ruined in the Preface,"I started up the Catch-22 Hulu series and I'm absolutely loving it. It made me want to get into the book. I went ahead and read the (updated) preface before I finished the TV series, just to see what the author had to say. HE RUINED THE ENDING IN THE PREFACE.

At the point of reading this, I had seen a single episode of the show, I just new the concept of Yoyo in the army and getting the run around. Since it's a book about war, death is a fear at all times, Yoyo in danger, is a major force moving me forward. The book completely ruins this in the Preface by noting ""But Yossarian is alive when  the novel ends...At the end of the successor volume I've completed, Closing Time, he is again still alive.""

mm6cvw,I have a theory about Catch-22,"Granted, I’m 85 pages into my first read, so I don’t know if the rest of the book contradicts or supports this, but my theory goes as follows:

Many of the described characters are flaws in man, or products of flaws in their society. They themselves can’t see it, but other people, especially Yossarian, can. I believe that Yossarian is the only sane and logical thinker, and the way he thinks about and presents his observations makes him appear as the craziest in the room, due to his love to speak unclearly and confuse people. In a similar way characters sometimes break the fourth wall, except he doesn’t go as far to recognize they’re in a story and not real.

For example, he knows what Orr means when he says Appleby has “flies in his eyes”, while everyone else takes I literally. And when he warns Clevinger about the Action Board, saying they’re after everyone, the way he phrased it is confusing and not entirely clear, but he saw the Action Board for what they were when other people couldn’t. 

(I don’t know of any other theories or  confirmed facts about the book that others have made/presented, therefore if this is totally wrong please let me know, as long as it doesn’t spoil the story to a large degree)

m9xzth,(SPOILERS) I finished Catch-22 last night and I was kind of underwhelmed by it.,"Catch-22 is a book that's been on my To Read list for years, and earlier this month I saw Audible had a sale on the audiobook version for it so I bought it. I usually listen to an audiobook on my way to work and at night I read a few chapters of a physical book before I go to bed. Anyway, I've heard a lot of great things about Catch-22 and have been meaning to read it for a while. I read Slaughterhouse-Five last year, it was my first Vonnegut novel and I absolutely loved it. I'd always kind of associated Catch-22 and Slaughterhouse-Five as they're both war novels that highlight the absurdity of war. I finished listening to Catch-22 last night and, with some trepidation, I've got to admit that I didn't like it very much.

Before you start sharpening your pitchforks, I want to make it clear that I am not saying that Catch-22 is a bad book, clearly, a lot of people regard it as a modern classic and my opinion is in the minority, I'm just saying that it didn't do much for me. Before I go into why I didn't like it, I want to highlight the things I did like about it. Firstly, there's no doubt that Heller is an excellent writer. He has a unique way with words and a distinct style. I was also impressed at how well he balanced the comedy and tragedy of the book and the final part where he really exposes the reader to the true horror of the war is intense, I was interested to truly find out what had happened to Snowden, but kind of wished I hadn't once the details were revealed, it's a truly tragic part of the book. 

While the comedy didn't tickle me as much as it seems to have tickled many other readers, there were still some excellent moments, especially when Scheisskopf is asking for the last line of the transcript to be read back to him but he keeps getting back the last thing he said. I'm not explaining it very well but I found it very funny. I also think it's a very interesting idea to write a novel about WWII that doesn't feature any of the Axis powers as the enemy. It's very interesting to read a novel set in a war where the main character's real troubles come from his allies. It's something you don't tend to consider but a reckless commander can be more of a threat to a soldier than the soldiers he's fighting against. The book also does a great job at exposing the craziness of war, and I particularly liked the scene where Nately is having his ideology torn about by the Old Man, as well as the character of Milo Minderbinsder who, as far as I'm concerned, isn't really meant to be a literal character, but represents the corporations that \[profit in times of war, even to the point where their profit puts people's lives in danger. 

I've just written a lot about things I liked in a book I didn't like very much overall, which is kind of confusing, but that somehow seems apt given we're discussing Catch-22. So, on to why I didn't like the book as a whole. This may sound harsh but I mainly found myself feeling either bored by the page-to-page action or just outright frustrated. The book seems to go out of its way to go into details about characters that could be said in a line or two but will take up an entire paragraph instead, and many of the conversations between characters do nothing to drive the narrative and just go back and forth with no resolution. For instance, the scenes where Yossarian is trying to ask Orr why he put crab apples in his cheeks were just painful, not to mention the times Yossarian tries to figure out why the prostitute was hitting him over the head. I know that the part about the prostitute is to do with Orr's escape, but did it have to be so incredibly frustrating to read/listen to? Yes, the prostitute hitting him over the head is revealed to be part of his plan, but when I learned that it didn't make me retroactively enjoy the excruciatingly drawn-out interactions between him and Yossarian. I still have no idea what the hell crab apples had to do with any of it. I'm sure someone will say there was a point to all that, but it won't make it any less tedious. I felt as though, through the entire novel, no one asks a sensible question and no one gives a sensible answer. Yeah, this is a book about the absurdity of war, but that doesn't mean it makes for good reading. 

Lastly, and this is more of a minor point, but I struggled to care at all about any of the characters in the book. There are plenty of protagonists in books who have unlikable qualities that I can still root for, from Holden Caulfield to Captain Ahab, but I felt no connection to any of the characters with the exception of Nately, who I hoped would survive the book, though I knew pretty early on he wouldn't. On the one hand, the characters failed to connect with me because most of them were so frustrating, and on the other, I felt no inclination to root for them because most of them were pretty horrible people. That scene where Yossarian and Dunbar sexually assault Nurse Duckett was extremely awkward and I really couldn't tell if that was a moment the reader is meant to find humorous not. There's another nurse who Yossarian gropes and it all gets even weirder when, later on in the novel, he sleeps with both these women. Is this Heller's way of trying to mitigate what his character did as the women he assaulted both wanted to sleep with him anyway? I'm not trying to clutch pearls here, an author can make their character do whatever they want, but the reader is able to react to that how they want and I really didn't care what happened to many of the characters in the book. I lost any sympathy I had for our protagonist at that point. 

I did enjoy the final part of the book a lot more than the rest of it, but the sog didn't seem worth it to get to that point. To be honest, I just felt relieved when it was over. Again, I want to stress that I'm not calling it an objectively bad book, and if you like it then I don't want to take anything away from you and I'm certainly not saying anyone who likes it has bad taste. I guess it is good to take a critical look at books that enjoy a lot of success since the conversation gets kind of stale if everyone just heaps praise on a piece of art. If you take issue with any of my points then please feel free to let me know your take on it, I want to try and understand what others see in it. I will probably give the book another go in the future, and I'll try reading a physical copy to see if that helps, though I thought the narrator of the audiobook did a very good job and I can't find any real faults in his work. 

I will say that I kind of feel like Heller has me trapped in my very own Catch-22 with his novel, which is amusing since I have plenty of good things to say about it despite not liking it overall. If someone asked me if I liked the book and would recommend it, I'd probably say ""No, but you should read it,"" which is odd. Well played, Heller, well played. In my opinion, if you want a great war novel that highlights the madness of war, read Slaughterhouse-Five. If you like Catch-22 and haven't read Slaughterhouse-Five, then you absolutely should, and I'd be interested to hear how fans of Catch-22 rate Slaughterhouse-Five. I understand there have been several well-received adaptations of Catch-22 over the decades, including a recent TV series with George Clooney which I'm interested in checking out. Maybe they will help me like the book more?

Snowden’s death is the obvious go-to, but I’d also include Yossarian’s voyage through Rome at the end of the novel, Orr’s disappearance, and Kid Sampson’s/McWatt’s deaths.

Doc: Oh, sure. I have to. There's a rule saying I have to ground anyone who's crazy.


Yossarian: Then why don't you ground me? I'm crazy. Ask Clevinger.


Doc: Clevinger? Where is Clevinger? You find Clevinger and I'll ask him.


Yossarian: Then ask any of the others. They'll tell you how crazy I am.


Doc: They're crazy.

Doc: Why don't they ask me to ground them?


Yossarian: Because they're crazy, that's why.


Doc: Of course they're crazy, I just told you they're crazy, didn't I? And you can't let crazy people decide whether you're crazy or not, can you?


Yossarian: Is Orr crazy?


Doc: He sure is.


Yossarian: Can you ground him?


Doc: I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That's part of the rule.


Yossarian: Then why doesn't he ask you to?


Doc: Because he's crazy, he has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he's had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.


Yossarian: That's all he has to do to be grounded?


Doc: That's all. Let him ask me.


Yossarian: And then you can ground him?


Doc: No. Then I can't ground him.


Yossarian: You mean there's a catch?


Doc: Sure there's a catch, Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy. 


Narrator: There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane then he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.


Yossarian: That's some catch, that Catch-22.


Doc: It's the best there is.

191ggp0,Catch 22 (another one),"I posted this as a comment on a thread but it was pretty old and thought I'd ask the question myself..

I'm half way through this book and started googling about it to see if others felt how I did in not really following it, I get all of that now and happy with the explanations, but I'm left with a question still.. how do people find it funny, let alone one of the funniest books ever written?!?

I get that it's silly, and humorous, i've cracked a few mental smiles, but I've read people say they've laughed out loud, or have tears in their eyes, that's some serous laughter! In my mind comedy is set up by so much more than words, and it's left me thinking maybe I'm not able to create the joke in my mind, but in my real life network I'm literally always the funny one!? 😙📯

Maybe I'm trying to read it too quickly so it just becomes words not jokes, saying that i'm already a slow reader, I can read much faster but it feels like watching something on fast forward and not enjoyable if I go too much faster than my talking voice, and a joke in anything more than a talking voice certainly can't have the timing right?!? I do listen to podcasts on 2x, but not for the entertaining aspect, just the information.

Anyway, suffice to say I just don't really get it, but seems many don't, maybe I'm just part of the uneducated bunch. I'm going to finish it because I hate only part way getting through anything, and sometimes the end is where it makes sense, fingers crossed!

If there are specific parts that people find really funny can you please point them out so I can read again and see where I'm going wrong? Cheers 😀",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/191ggp0/catch_22_another_one/,2024-01-08T08:27:02Z,30,0,books,Catch-22,POST
2n5ueo,MFB: Catch-22,"Hi /r/books! I thought I'd just make a thread to explain why Catch-22 is my favourite book of all time, without spoiling the content of the story - hope that's ok. 

Catch-22. The only book I can think of that actually spawned a phrase people say *all the time*. Maybe that's what it will be remembered for, but if that's the case what will be forgotten is just how incredibly well-worked of a novel it is. It's satire at it's absolute best, because it frames an incredibly dark subject matter with consistently side-splitting humour, then strips all of it away at it's close and leaves us feeling almost shellshocked. 

>“They're trying to kill me,"" Yossarian told him calmly.  
No one's trying to kill you,"" Clevinger cried.  
Then why are they shooting at me?"" Yossarian asked.  
They're shooting at everyone,"" Clevinger answered. ""They're trying to kill everyone.""  
""And what difference does that make?” 

The structure should be confusing - it jumps between events, people and places almost on whatever whim the author has, but ends up creating a dynamic verve reminiscent of a TV show with multiple story lines - except it does more. It repeats events from different points of view, and when it returns to show another side of an earlier chapter the event is always funnier the second time around. I'm not really a public laugher - books make me laugh internally, but I've laughed on packed trains and buses *on my third or fourth read* of Catch-22.

>“From now on I'm thinking only of me.""  
Major Danby replied indulgently with a superior smile: ""But, Yossarian, suppose everyone felt that way.""  
""Then,"" said Yossarian, ""I'd certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way, wouldn't I?”   

But to pretend this novel's a pure comedy piece would be to do it an injustice. It's take on the futility of war and it's general critique of bureaucracy is only strengthened by the comedy around it. Without the comedy, we would be left with a relentlessly bleak book - so it's the juxtaposition of the two that makes both aspects really shine through. But it's also written quite beautifully at times, and as I mentioned earlier when the book draws to a close Heller gets right into his sweet spot with the sheer quality and thoughtfulness of what he's writing.

>“Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window, and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.” 

I don't have much else to say but; read this book. Whoever you are, where ever you are. Almost everybody I've recommended it to has said something like ""Oh, I doubt that would be my kind of thing!"" and then when I've strong armed them into reading it, end up absolutely gushing over how good it was. On that note, I'll leave you with this absolute corker:

>“When I was a kid,"" Orr replied, ""I used to walk around all day with crab apples in my cheeks. One in each cheek.""  
... A minute passed. ""Why?"" [Yossarian] found himself forced to ask finally.  
Orr tittered triumphantly. ""Because they're better than horse chestnuts... When I couldn't get crab apples,"" Orr continued, ""I used horse chestnuts. Horse chestnuts are about the same size as crab apples and actually have a better shape, although the shape doesn't matter a bit.""  
""Why did you walk around with crab apples in your cheeks?"" Yossarian asked again. ""That's what I asked."" 
""Because they've got a better shape than horse chestnuts,"" Orr answered. ""I just told you that.""  
""Why,"" swore Yossarian at him approvingly, ""you evil-eyed, mechanically aptituded, disaffiliated son of a bitch, did you walk around with anything in your cheeks?""  
""I didn't,"" Orr said, ""walk around with anything in my cheeks. I walked around with crab applies in my cheeks. When I couldn't get crab apples I walked around with horse chestnuts. In my cheeks.” ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2n5ueo/mfb_catch22/,2014-11-23T12:26:51Z,8,14,books,Catch-22,POST

uj8xfw,Catch 22 by Joseph Heller,"Okay, so I just finished reading it, and I'm honestly surprised it isn't talked about more often. I mean, I'm aware that it's sold tens of millions of copies and its title has literally become a proverb, but having read it, I'd say the book is still underrated.
One of the things that really caught me off-guard was how funny it is. Definitely didn't expect something this old to still be as humourous as it is. And the humour too isn't aged, like I would've expected a book from that period to have Boomer humour, but nope, it's legitimately good. And to top it all off, the author could seamlessly switch from the funniest shit you've ever read, to something heart-wrenchingly depressing, and it still wouldn't feel weird. I found that really impressive.

As the story progressed though, I felt like Heller focused more on the cynical aspect of their reality and the horrors of war, and toned down a bit on the light-heartedness. 
>! In the beginning, I didn't really think that any of the characters would actually die. A few could've died, but never would I have imagined nearly everyone would. Orr becoming MIA, Dunbar's disappearance, the incident with McWatt, Hungry Joe and Snowden's death; to me, these helped paint the depressing, unpredictable, and most importantly, unfair nature of war. The death which personally saddened me the most was Nately's. Poor guy. And that too after all the trouble he went through to finally get his girl. :( !<

I also loved the various themes touched on in the book; the ridiculous bureaucratic red-tape >! which prevented anyone from acknowledging Doc Daneeka was still very much alive !< , the physical embodiment of capitalism *Milo*, the blockheaded generals, the colonels willingly to throw away lives just to get famous, the completely logical oxymorons, Nately's unbridled patriotism, Yossarian's anti-establishmentarianism- I could go on and on about these little things that made me like this book so much, but I'm too tired right now.
I
t's gotta be the top 3 best books I've read thus far. I've got a whole bunch of quotes from the book saved, and I'm definitely gonna be using them later lol.

And also Yossarian's complains against God a lot, really great stuff. This one below is my favourite;

*""And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways,"" Yossarian continued, hurtling on over her objection._x000D_
""There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about_x000D_
us. That's the kind of God you people talk about-a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited,_x000D_
uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary_x000D_
to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world_x000D_

control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?""*

rdqwo,Anyone else find Catch-22 deeply disturbing? (spoilers),"First, let me say that I loved the book.  I read through it in only three or four days, which is pretty quick for me.  


I found the book absolutely hilarious starting off.  There were times that I could hardly focus because I was laughing so much.  However, there seemed to be a turning point for me first when Orr ""died.""  Soon after there was the incident with the Kid and McWatt, which I thought  was a huge change in tone from what I was reading into the story earlier.  After this, I started seeing less hilarity and more insanity with each crazy story.  I actually feared for the chaplain when he was taken into the cellar, instead of expecting something funny to happen.  This all culminated in the chapter ""The Eternal City"" which, for me, was a gut-wrenching read. 


I've only ever seen *Catch-22* referenced to as a funny book full of absurd, nonsensical craziness.  Which I did find -- in the first half or so of the book.  The rest of it was actually hard for me to read.  I wanted to get out of the craziness just like Yossarian did.

4mj991,Some Catch-22 Questions (Ending and Spoilers),"Hey all! 
I have just finished Catch-22 and I really enjoyed it. It's really the first book I've ever finished and immediately wanted to flip back to the beginning and start rereading. One of these reasons is I feel there is a lot of characters and symbols to unpack from the book. 
I'm mainly concerned with Nately's Whore (Ch 38-42) and the mysterious stranger who pops into Yossarian's hospital room and says, ""We've got your pal, buddy"" (Ch 41). 
I've been doing some reading on explanations for these two but have not been fully satisfied. From what I have thought up and read it seems that Nately's Whore only ever succeeds at stabbing Yossarian when he makes the deal with Korn and Cathcart symbolizing a betrayal to his fallen comrades. Then I'm wondering if the mysterious man is referring to his real pals, the people he fought along side, who died and mocking Yossarian for making the deal to be 'pals' with the colonels who keep making them all fly more missions. 
This is my take and I would love to hear more about what you all think of these symbols or any other symbols in the book! Thanks!  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4mj991/some_catch22_questions_ending_and_spoilers/,2016-06-04T17:22:13Z,4,7,books,Catch-22,POST
6l8p3b,I just finished Catch-22 and I'm a little confused [SPOILERS],"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the book, however there were some points which caused me some confusion. My lack of understanding for certain sections is such that I might have to resort to reading the book again at some point in the future. 

The first of these is the lack of clarification for the setting of different chapters, namely in regards to time and place. 

The most pertinent example of this for me was the fact that the book starts in Pianosa, seemingly after the bombing which Yossarian has received a promotion and medal for (the name escapes me). The book later seems to go to some training base in the US at a time several years prior, suggested by the idea of ""running off south to Mexico"", and the fact that at the end of the Scheisskopf/Parade chapter (which seems to switch between present and past more than once within itself) it is announced that they are going overseas. 

While the switch in setting is clear at that point, it is far more difficult to pick up on at certain other points in the book, and I was wondering if some sort of clarification was available. 

The other source of confusion is the fact that a lot of the events which Yossarian experiences in Rome seemed (at least to me) somewhat surreal, and I got the impression that he may have been imagining some of this. This is also something which was extremely unclear about Nately's whore, given how she kept reappearing in somewhat incredible manners. 

I understand that some of my confusion likely comes from the fact that Heller intended for a lot of the characters to act in an irrational and confusion manner, to reflect the ""logic"" in the idea of Catch-22 itself. I appreciate any clarification which anyone can give me over this.

Some people say that it's a funny book, and I've never experienced a book to make me laugh out loud or scare the shit outta me, so I may as well start with Catch-22, and probably move on to ""The Shining"" and see if these books can move me.

She was never without a good book close by, not even  when she was lying in bed with nothing on her but Yossarian and Dori Duz’s dog  tags. She bored Yossarian, but he was in love with her, too.

Or will I not be able to understand what is going on (more than I currently don't) when I come back?

I should probably explain what I like about it and how I'm reading it.
I think I'm reading it like a sit-com. I am focusing on the situational comedy of the moment and this kind of causes problems because the author will often bring back things that have already happened and I it's kinda confusing to me because I don't entirely remember all of the characters personalities and what the author wants me to know about them. I just remember that ""some guy did a thing and it's funny because this was the result""


Idk how to explain my problems except that it feels like it goes on forever. I'm 250 pages and maybe what my problem is is that it kinda feels like there's no reason it shouldn't have ended by now. I mean it kinda feels like what Matt and Trey were saying you shouldn't do in writing (use ""and then"")

x7pmu7,What's so amazing about Joseph Heller's Novel Catch-22?,"The novel Catch-22 has become so famous that it has come to be used in life applications and phrases. Catch-22 combines satirical scenes and dark humor with deeper meaning, one of the many reasons why it's so praised. It's absurdity makes the reader laugh as if watching a comedy.

But I just don't understand how it can be marked as one of the greatest novels in American Literature. While some of the paradoxes have made me laugh out loud, the Heller reuses the idea over and over again, making it feel repetitive and uninteresting. The plot is not linear, which isn't necessarily a problem, but I feel like Heller makes it confusing, for instance when Milo is described to bomb their squadron despite he being apart of that squadron. Moreover, the book does a poor job focusing on the real intensity and hardship of life during/post war. While that may have not been Heller's intention, it feels like the book is unable to mix war and comedy fluidly, focusing too heavily on dialogue instead of emotion or some sort of meaning.

Perhaps I am looking at the book through a narrow minded lense. What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/x7pmu7/whats_so_amazing_about_joseph_hellers_novel/,2022-09-06T23:45:50Z,14,0,books,Catch-22,POST
h9jefq,Catch 22,"I have just finished catch 22 and it’s one of the best books I’ve ever read. The story occurs during ww2 and follows Yossarian, an official who is going crazy because of the fear of dying in battle,he tries to go home but a ridiculous law (catch 22) makes it impossible,the law states in that every soldier can go home if he is insane,but you must be sane to inforce this removal from combat,which leads to a contradiction, this kind of circular logic is used to criticize war bureaucracy, savage capitalism (which is embodied by Milo IMO the most fascinating character of the play) corruption of the police, religion and above all the idea of dying for the country and for god, this book de-dramatizes the idea of war and reminds us that nationalism,religion and money are not excuses to end human life. The way Joseph Heller plays with time and space gives the novel a big degree of complexity, but it ends with all the loose ends closed, if I had to make any critics it would be that it leaves asides the holocaust , which could be a good reason to fight and is not even mentioned,but despite of this I think this is a book worth reading,that truly encapsulates the bad sides of human nature and our absurdity.

vhfthq,"Thought I'd share my treasured haul at a recent auction with /r/books, a signed copy of Catch 22 by Joseph Heller.","[Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/noQq4JU)

I've never been one to spend too much money on anything, generally being quite frugal, but when [this](https://imgur.com/a/noQq4JU) came up for auction here in the UK, I knew I had to go for it. Catch 22 remains my favourite novel to this day, especially with it's memorable opening. It seemed like a great opportunity to grab something so close to my heart and a bit of history. 

When it came to the day of the auction, I fully expected a bidding war - but was somewhat surprised that I managed to snag it so easily. I quickly got to work trying to decipher the [inscription](https://i.imgur.com/EdrfCMi.jpeg). 

It reads:

>To William Forbes  
>  
>In answer to your request in the ""Action Line"" column of the *Philadelphia Inquirer* (9/18/1970) and with very sincere good wishes to you for now and the future. I'm honored that you thought so well  of the book.   
>  
>Joseph Heller, 9/27/70  
>  
>New York City

It took a while to get through the cursive, but once I did - I managed to find the [exact column](https://i.imgur.com/StJz0dn.jpeg) referenced in the inscription. It was a front page column at the time where the paper would help people with various requests. It was around the same time that the film Catch 22 was in cinemas, so there was once again - quite the focus on Catch 22 and Joseph Heller. 

I can't find much information on the actual copy itself. The large type edition was published in the same year (1961) but it's absolutely huge. Essentially A4 size.

Still chuffed I managed to snag it, and it brings me happiness daily. Definitely something I'll treasure for years to come.

opwsr,"Does anyone have a copy of Catch-22 ""with character""? I'm trying to surprise my girlfriend, with a modern twist. ","Hi bookits, 

Bear with me for a second...
My girlfriend and I are complete opposites:

She|Me
-|-
Read her entire life | Just starting reading recently
Loves old/used things (Clothes/Books) | New, Clean, Modern. Always
(Was a) Vegetarian | Fervent Meat Lover
Art | Science

It goes on, but I figure you get the idea. 

Anyway, since I just really began reading this summer (Here's what I've read thus far...)

* Brave New World
* Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman
* Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
* The Acid Diaries
* The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy
* The Hunger Games
* Catcher in the Rye

We thought it'd be fun to have a bf/gf book club. We tried reading The Divine Comedy, but it wasn't really something we were enjoying so we dropped the book, and the idea faded. Anyway, we've been talking about maybe trying again with Catch-22 and the first thing she told me was to check my local used book store for my copy. :P

So I got an idea, and I was hoping bookit could help:

I want someone's used copy of Catch-22. Something that's noticeably used, but not in ""bad"" shape. It's a casual book ""club"" so it doesn't need to be signed or anything fancy. The idea is basically to mix something old:

* Your (To be her) copy of Catch-22

with something new:

* My new copy of Catch-22

using a very ""me"" medium of accomplishing the task. Opposites Attract after all. ;)

Of course, the idea is corny, but I am really hoping someone will be willing to go to a bit of trouble for me. I can pay for your book, and I would be deeply grateful. (Shipped to Canada)

Thanks so much, even if this post doesn't get me anywhere. :)

2oii7o,"What was Joseph Heller getting at in Catch-22 with all that talk of ""flies in his eyes""? Orr makes that claim about Appleby, and I don't get it.","Near the beginning of the novel, right after Doc Daneeka's infamous explanation of the logic of Catch-22, the narration veers toward an aside about something Orr said to Yossarian. For those who need a reminder (big spoiler) [Orr is the soldier who acts like an senseless smalltown idiot throughout the novel, including crashing his plane into the sea 17 times, but surprises us and Yossarian at the end when it's revealed that instead of dying in a plane crash as was believed, Orr had excecuting a brilliant escape to Sweden where he'd live out the war in safety while the US military presumed him dead.](/spoiler)

Here's the passage in question, as Yossarian tries to convince the Doc to deem him insane and unfit for duty. It feels like an important idea and is situated just after the Catch itself, but I haven't the foggiest notion of what it's supposed to add up to, if anything. Thoughts?

**From Catch-22:**
   
""'*You mean there's a catch*?'    
 
   '*Sure there's a catch*,' Doc Daneeka replied. '*Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy*.' There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute 
    simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
    
 '*That's some catch, that Catch-22*,' he observed.
    
   '*It's the best there is*,' Doc Daneeka agreed.
    
   Yossarian saw it clearly in all its spinning reasonableness. There was an elliptical precision about its perfect pairs of parts that was graceful and shocking, like good modern art, and at times Yossarian wasn't quite sure that he saw it at all, just the way he was never quite sure about good modern art or about the flies Orr saw in Appleby's eyes. He had Orr's word to take for the flies in Appleby's eyes.
    
   '*Oh, they're there, all right*,' Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby's eyes after Yossarian's fist fight with Appleby in the officers' club, '*although he probably doesn't even know it. That's why he can't see things as they really are*.'
    
   '*How come he doesn't know it*?' inquired Yossarian.
    
   '*Because he's got flies in his eyes*,' Orr explained with exaggerated patience. '*How can he see he's got flies in his eyes if he's got flies in his eyes*?' It made as much sense as anything else, and Yossarian was willing to give Orr the benefit of the doubt because Orr was from the wilderness outside New York City and knew so much more about wildlife than Yossarian did, and because Orr, unlike Yossarian's mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, in-law, teacher, spiritual leader, legislator, neighbor and newspaper, had never lied to him about anything crucial before. Yossarian had mulled his newfound knowledge about Appleby over in private for a day or two and then decided, as a good deed, to pass the word along to Appleby himself.
    
   '*Appleby, you've got flies in your eyes*,' he whispered helpfully as they passed by each other in the doorway of the parachute tent on the day of the weekly milk run to Parma.
    
   '*What*?' Appleby responded sharply, thrown into confusion by the fact that Yossarian had spoken to him at all.
    
   '*You've got flies in your eyes*,' Yossarian repeated. '*That's probably why you can't see them*.' Appleby retreated from Yossarian with a look of loathing bewilderment and sulked in silence until he was in the jeep with Havermeyer riding down the long, straight road to the briefing room, where Major Danby, the fidgeting group operations officer, was waiting to conduct the preliminary briefing with all the lead pilots, bombardiers and navigators. Appleby spoke in a soft voice so that he would not be heard by the driver or by Captain Black, who was stretched out with his eyes closed in the front seat of the jeep.
    
   '*Havermeyer*,' he asked hesitantly. '*Have I got flies in my eyes*?' 
    
   Havermeyer blinked quizzically. '*Sties*?' he asked.
    
   '*No, flies*,' he was told.
    
   Havermeyer blinked again. '*Flies*?'
    
   '*In my eyes*.'
    
   '*You must be crazy*,' Havermeyer said.
    
   '*No, I'm not crazy. Yossarian's crazy. Just tell me if I've got flies in my eyes or not. Go ahead. I can take it.*' Havermeyer popped another piece of peanut brittle into his mouth and peered very closely into Appleby's eyes.
    
   '*I don't see any*,' he announced. Appleby heaved an immense sigh of relief. Havermeyer had tiny bits of peanut brittle adhering to his lips, chin and cheeks.
    
   '*You've got peanut brittle crumbs on your face*,' Appleby remarked to him.
    
   '*I'd rather have peanut brittle crumbs on my face than flies in my eyes*,' Havermeyer retorted.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2oii7o/what_was_joseph_heller_getting_at_in_catch22_with/,2014-12-07T02:12:47Z,4,25,books,Catch-22,POST
cn92td,Catch 22 is one of the first books I've put aside.,"I haven't been reading for a while so I've gone on a bit of a book binge lately.  I searched new arrival sections at my library, this subreddit, Pultizer winners/nominees, and various top 100 lists, and have acquired a collection of library books that fill nearly half of one of my bookshelves.  I've introduced myself to classics like *I, Robot* and *Fahrenheit 451* and *Things Not Seen* over the past week or so.

But Catch 22?  I just couldn't read it.  I appreciate the posts I've seen recently about it being okay to put down a book, because otherwise I would have guilted myself into reading all 400+ pages of this.

I tried to read through it, but after reading over 100 pages I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like it.  I'm bored by it and I don't find it interesting.

i3elj,DAE Give up on catch 22?,"I started getting back into reading and after finishing hitchhiker's guide in 2 sitdowns one day, Catch 22 was another favorite on the reddit list that sounded like it was interesting. After considering it for a little bit, I was tipped over the edge when some book lover started raving about it in an unrelated threat about cats or old 4chan memes. I finally started reading the book and powered through it, and I find myself oddly conflicted by it. On one hand I do love the absurd humor and the dryness does not bother me one bit, but my issue with the story is that the narrative seems to jump around a lot. It's as if the book starts on one thing and slowly moves to another before fully completing the joke, or the character story, or whatever is going on in the book. It almost reminds me of a cutaway joke in family guy, only it's clever and the stuff that comes out of them does wind up being relative in the end.

Catch 22 is far from a bad book in my eyes, I just feel it's too decentralized and jumps around to much. I get what they seem to be trying to do, and I do find some of the humor amusing enough, but I'm somehow not entertained by the whole experience. It's likely because the book has an annoying habit of cutting itself off by mentioning something, and like a kid with ADD deciding to give us the back story and history of that entire little name, and then mentioning something within that one side, and then something within that one side, and then finally bringing us back somewhere near where we started, but usually not at the same spot where the book started going off on tangents and describing people who I didn't care about for a smirk or a chuckle, or some point about war and bureaucracy sucking.

I get what the author seems to be trying to do. It's a book with absurd comedy full of confused characters doing and saying some absurd and weird things and the way the narrative jumps around enhances that.The symbolism an anti war and bureaucracy sentiments run thick even early on in the book, but despite all this I just can't finish it because while I can tell that the style the book is written in is a choice and not just poor writing, and on some level I can even appreciate it, I find it's tedious. I feel as just as I'm getting interested in something it cuts away to give me 3 more less interesting little blurbs about people before coming back to the first less interesting blurb and finishing that, before coming back to what interested me. I want to power through it, but I just don't feel like investing time in a book that is more tedious to me than entertaining.

Does anyone else feel this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/i3elj/dae_give_up_on_catch_22/,2011-06-19T05:15:11Z,45,14,books,Catch-22,POST

g0q579,My main takeaway from Catch-22: Servicemen are some horny motherfuckers,"The absurd contradictions of the novel are fun to chew on,  and I enjoy the disjointed narrative, but holy crap is there SO MUCH SEX. Every fifth line seems devoted to graphically describing Yossarian's escapades with prostitutes (or those of his squadmates). Women are barely mentioned in the book other than to describe their bodies.

Now, I'm not so dense that I can't see much of the apparent sexism is a deliberate attempt to reflect the realities of serving in World War II. Of course you think about beautiful women and how much you want to fuck them a lot, and 20-something guys aren't known for romantic sophistication.

As the book progresses, the timeline gets more 'real' and stops jumping around, but at the same time it gets darker and more grimm: everyone's dying, the absurdity levels go insane, the whole writing gets more intense and fast. It felt like Yossarian was actually losing his mind, as the book-long joke was suggesting. Why did people disappear? Did they just kill them? Or for example, his last visit to Rome was completely surreal — man beaten by a police, child beaten by a man, dog beaten by a man, a woman thrown out the window — was it all real? If so, what was the point of that chapter, why does he needs to see so many atrocities at once? Why is Nately's girl trying to kill him? It's not his fault he died. At some point I thought maybe it is his fault all along and people are dying because of him being around, but that can't be true, right?

And in the last chapter he just decides to run from it and that's it? Tahts the solution to everything? And what's the moral of the story, then? Why is Danby even there, that's the most random choice for the person he sees last. And why do we get to see Snowden's story there?

I'm sorry for so many questions, but I felt like the book just ends in nowhere, just *stops*. The books is so good, hillarious and witty, but the ending just left me feeling empty.

3ntop2,Milo Minderbender's Syndicate - How it works - Catch 22,"During my first reading of Catch 22, in between painful, ab-developing bouts of laughter, Milo Minderbender confused the bejesus out of me. No one online has an answer good enough for me. But, I believe I have solved his paradoxical syndicate once and for all. Would love your thoughts.

&nbsp;

**Milo buys Eggs in Sicily** -1c

- Buys using reinvested syndicate profits
- Sicily sells to Milo and makes +1c per egg – Sicily is happy
- This is the cheapest price Milo can buy eggs. 
- Military does *not* know about this transaction

&nbsp;

**Sells Eggs to Malta** +4.5c

- Malta only buys because they know Milo will buy them back at a loss
- Otherwise Malta would have simply bought from Sicily
- Milo *keeps* the profit for the syndicate
- The Military *does not know* Milo is doing this transaction

&nbsp;

**Buys Eggs back from Malta** -7c

- Malta makes +2.5c profit per egg – Malta is happy
- Milo buys using the Military’s money
- Military/Mess Halls ignorantly believe this is where the eggs are sourced

&nbsp;

**Sells Eggs to mess halls** +5c

- Mess halls buy thinking they are getting a good deal from Milo
- This money goes back to the military.
- It appears as though Milo’s operation is only costing -2c per egg (-7+5= -2)
- Mess Halls ignorantly believe Milo is giving them a good deal considering Malta buys for -4.5c
- Therefore, Mess Hall ignorantly thinks Milo is saving them +2.5c per egg
- It appears to the Military that Milo is not making a profit
- This makes Milo seem benevolent

&nbsp;

**Where’s the money really going?**

- Milo keeps the profit from the transaction in Malta +3.5c.
- Military forks out -7c per egg believing they will make +5c back from the mess hall which is still funded by the military, so overall they are only spending -2c per egg, which Military is okay with considering they have heard through rumour that Malta buys eggs from Sicily at -4.5c each.

Everything else is just a huge overwhelming wave of officers, captains, generals, soldiers, and colonels that seem unimportant and I forget, but then they pop again.

4mkm2u,Catch 22 and Infinite Jest very similar?,"I remember when I finished reading Infinite Jest for the first time, I had searched high and low for suggestions on similar books and from there found authors like Thomas Pynchon; however, I just finished reading Catch 22 for the first time and I am beyond surprised that I never saw this book in suggested readings.

Am I the only one that finds these two novels incredibly similar? I find them similar in almost every facet be it tone and style, plotting and pacing, ect. 

To be honest, I'd even go so far to say that Infinite Jest might be blatantly inspired by Catch-22. Some of my biggest reasons for thinking this: 

. Although obviously not an original concept, both have fragmented plotting and as they progress the timeline becomes clarified in relation to the plot and vice versa. This is achieved by different perspectives contributing fragments. 

. Both use the method of setting up a joke in one chapter, only to have the ""punchline"" revealed in later chapters. Not to mention the humour in both is due to quirky, bizarre dialogue and behaviours.

. There is a similarity between Yossarian and Don Gately, in that both the novels end with these characters in the hospital recovering from being wounded; these scenes are also temporally contiguous with both characters witnessing deaths of partners. 

. Although these qualities are more exaggerated in IJ, both novels contain long floral descriptive passages and also contain long, run on sentences. Catch 22 does use a lot of long sentences, but only contains a few long, multi paged paragraphs.

4892ns,"Halfway through Catch-22, not sure if I will finish","Almost half through I’m having a very hard time finding the motivation to finish this book. It is really not what I expected, but then again, I kind of went blind into it… 


It feels there really is no story, just characters in a backdrop setting. The characters themselves really feel like caricatures of real people. And all they do is endlessly repeat their own traits over and over and over. Although some of the discussions can make me laugh, it now starts to annoy me, more than I find it pleasing.


I get the fact that the writer wants to show a version of military completely opposite of what is (stereo)typically displayed in books and movies (Heroism, Brotherhood, defeating evil) and I also can appreciate that. The paranoia, endlessly trying to escape having to wage war, hating your superiors just as much, or even more than your real enemies (who are the real enemies for you personally?).  The condescending attitude and overly ambitious behavior of the superiors. This is what I think is done very well in this book, but this is already completely clear to me after 200+ pages. 


Will the book bring me anything more? Or will it stay similar to what I have already read in the previous pages?


It kind of drains my joy for reading books at this moment. But I did make it this far already. Perhaps you can help me decide what to do with this book, motivate me to keep going or perhaps I should just throw the towel in the ring on this one.

The other two books that I can think of in this vein are **Beach Music** by Pat Conroy and Stevie Toltz's **A Fraction of the Whole** (which I will not tire of recommending on reddit). The latter is a zebra of mood, alternating between laugh out loud comedy and the depths of darkness.

2pevgn,Can you clear some of my doubts from Catch-22?,"Here are some lingering paragraphs that I was not able to understand completely while reading the book. Please explain.


A. In Catch-22's chapter 'Chaplain', his wife has been described 3 times in one long paragraph. What does it emphasize? 

>The chaplain’s wife was the one thing in the world he could be certain of, and it would have been sufficient, if only he had been left to live his life out with just her and the children. The chaplain’s wife was a reserved, diminutive, agreeable woman in her early thirties, very dark and very attractive, with a narrow waist, calm intelligent eyes, and small, bright, pointy teeth in a childlike face that was vivacious and petite;........

>.....The chaplain’s wife was a sweet, soothing, considerate woman, and he yearned to touch the warm flesh of her slender arm again and stroke her smooth black hair, to hear her intimate, comforting voice. She was a much stronger person than he was......

>...The chaplain’s wife was intuitive, gentle, compassionate and responsive. Almost inevitably, his reveries of reunion with her ended in explicit acts of love-making.

B. What does this phrase mean, 'Snowden'? Maybe it is some common phrase from U.S.

>Cut,’ said a doctor.

>‘You cut,’ said another.

>‘No cuts,’ said Yossarian with a thick, unwieldy tongue. (*Note: he was the patient here)*

>   ‘Now look who’s butting in,’ complained one of the doctors.**Another county heard from.** Are we going to operate or aren’t we?’


C. In chapter Peckem, can you explain this.

>General Peckem laid great, fastidious stress on small matters of taste and style. **He was always augmenting things. Approaching events were never coming, but always upcoming. It was not true that he wrote memorandums** praising himself and recommending that his authority be enhanced to include all combat operations; **he wrote memoranda.**

D.  Chapter, 'Lieutenant Scheisskopf'?

>Lieutenant Scheisskopf was so elated by his unexpected achievement that he gave his wife a sharp crack over the head with the pole when she tried to drag him into bed **to celebrate by showing their contempt for the sexual mores of the lower middle classes in Western civilization.**

E. Chapter ""Hungry Joe""

>‘Me big man,’ he would shout. ‘Me big photographer from Life magazine. Big picture on heap big cover. Si, si, si! Hollywood star. Multi dinero. Multi divorces. Multi ficky-fick all day long.’ Few women anywhere could resist such wily cajolery, and prostitutes would spring to their feet eagerly and hurl themselves into whatever fantastic poses he requested for them. Women killed Hungry Joe. His response to them as sexual beings was one of frenzied worship and idolatry. They were lovely, satisfying, maddening manifestations of the miraculous, instruments of pleasure too powerful to be measured, **too keen to be endured**, and too exquisite to be intended for employment by base, unworthy man.

F. Chapter Clevinger

>But they couldn’t touch him, he told Clevinger, because he had a sound mind in a pure body and was as strong as an ox. They couldn’t touch him because he was Tarzan, Mandrake, Flash Gordon. He was Bill Shakespeare. He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees. He was miracle ingredient Z-247. He was—’Crazy!’ Clevinger interrupted, shrieking. ‘That’s what you are! Crazy!

>   ‘—immense. I’m a real, slam-bang, honest-to-goodness, three-fisted humdinger. I’m a bona fide supraman'
  
> ‘Superman?’ Clevinger cried. ‘Superman?’
  
> ‘Supraman,’ Yossarian corrected.
  
> ‘Hey, fellas, cut it out,’ Nately begged with embarrassment. ‘Everybody’s looking at us.’
  
> ‘You’re crazy,’ Clevinger shouted vehemently, his eyes filling with tears. ‘You’ve got a Jehovah complex.’
  
> ‘I think everyone is Nathaniel.’ Clevinger arrested himself in mid-declamation, suspiciously. ‘Who’s Nathaniel?’
  
> **‘Nathaniel who?’ inquired Yossarian innocently.**
  
> **Clevinger skirted the trap neatly. ‘You think everybody is Jehovah.** You’re no better than Raskolnkov—’

 Why does Yossarian repeats Nathaniel who? when Clevinger asks Who's Nathaniel? By next line I can assume it was some kind of trap, but what?

4lhc24,12 Books In 12 Months Post 11: Catch 22 by Joseph Heller,"Wow. At no point during this book was I enjoying the overall experience, and yet it's one of only two books (this and TKAM) that have made me sad when I finished them in mourning for the characters who I can no longer be with. It's one of those novels that reminds you of why we really read.

Tonally, the book was a roller-coaster - it's the second book to make me laugh out loud more than once, and yet simultaneously one of the most depressing ones I can remember reading. The exploration of the horrors of war coupled with the funniest scenes I've ever known creates a truly unique book that I'm sure I'll never forget. as I said before, it seemed fairly average up until the very end, and from then on it seemed brilliant to me. Looking back now (I finished it Friday night) it's definitely in my top 5, if not my top 3 books.

The comedy aspect might not seem to square with my 'not enjoying it', but they seemed like brief moments of joy scattered across an endless (hyperbolically speaking, of course) field of depression and almost boredom. But now I can see that there is just the right amount of comedy in the book; enough that it *is* comedy, but not too much for the book to not be taken seriously. Oh, and I've never known better satirical comedy to exist.

If you haven't read it, then please pick up a copy. If you get through it then I'm sure you'll find the same thing as I have. A definite 10/10.

ckiavq,"In Catch-22, what is Orr getting at when he says that women don’t seem to like Yossarian??","In chapter 28–the scene when Yossarian gets out of the hospital for his leg injury and goes into his tent , Orr is fixing the stove he is making for Yossarian, and the two have their last conversation before Orr’s disappearance. In this conversation Orr is asking Yossarian about the girls in the bordello, he says “ They don’t like you either” ... “ They like Aarfy, and they like Nately, but they don’t like you. Women just don’t seem to like you. I think they think you’re a bad influence.”  

What does Orr mean by this? What is the point of the dialogue in this scene between Yossarian and Orr? I’m on chapter 32 so maybe it’ll come out in the end. 

Is Yossarian not liked because he’s not affluent like Nately? But then, neither is Aarfy.  I really like Orr’s character and he is one of the few genuine characters in the novel, which makes the information he says seem more reliable? But maybe it’s more misinformation, as misinformation seems to be a common theme throughout the novel. Also, Nurse Duckett likes  Yossarian at the moment, despite his previous sexual assault on her in the hospital. 

Later in the scene, Orr tells Yossarian he should really fly with him, and that he knows Yossarian requested to never fly with him. This I understand what Orr is getting at, that Orr is going to escape and that Yossarian should come with him or prepare to escape himself. Ironically, it’s Yo’s fear of death that makes him not want to fly with Orr, but if he did then Yo could actually escape, avoiding death. 

But I’m confused at what Orr is getting at in the conversation about women not liking Yossarian?? Maybe it is just making a parallel between Orr and Yossarian?

prb9g,Catch 22 - The Soldier In White,"This may just be my favourite chapter of this book so far. I love when he describes how much better death is inside a hospital is then outside of it:

""They didn't take it out on the lam weirdly inside a cloud the way Clevinger had done. They didn't explode into blood and clotted matter. They didn't drown or get struck by lightning, mangled by machinery or crushed in landslides. They didn't get shot to death in hold-ups, strangled to death in rapes, stabbed to death in saloons, bludgeoned to death with axes by parents or children, or die summarily by some other act of God. Nobody choked to death. People bled to death like gentlemen in an operating room or expired without comment in an oxygen tent. There was none of that tricky now-you-see-me-now-you-don't business so much in vogue outside the hospital, none of that now-I-am-and-now-I-ain't. There were no famines or floods. Children didn't suffocate in cradles or iceboxes or fall under trucks. No one was beaten to death. People didn't stick their heads into ovens with the gas on, jump in front of subway trains or come plummeting like dead weights out of hotel windows with a whoosh! accelerating at the rate of thirty-two feet per second to land with hideous plop! on the sidewalk and die disgustingly there in public like an alpaca sack full of hair strawberry ice cream, bleeding, pink toes awry.""

b5mc9x,Some questions about the theme of Catch 22 and the mindset of Yossarian.,"Hello r/books! I finished Catch 22 and thought it was a masterpiece, but I did so for an essay I need to write in my English class and some of the restrictions left me feeling confused as to how they tie into the book itself. The specifics were that you need to write about what the main character lost, and was trying to recover, and how that ties into the theme. This post is a pseudo discussion/question post about what Yossarian individually lost and what the corresponding theme is, as I think with this book especially there are multiple interpretations for that.

**What is Yossarian trying to recover that he lost?**

This one is the confusing one for me as I've no idea if there's anything physical Yossarian lost in Catch 22. The only ideas I could come up with were emotional or part of your character, and that's Yossarian's morals and integrity. From the whole book it seemed as though Yossarian knew he was being used to kill and harm others against his will as the number of missions he needed to fly was raised, and when he finally ran to Sweden at the end of the book it signified him finally choosing his integrity over his authority as he didn't want to harm his fellow soldiers, knowing that the US would try to find him. This seems like it would be hard to explain to anyone who didn't read the book though, so I'm not sure if that's right.

**How does what Yossarian lost and him trying to recover it tie into the theme of the book?**

I also struggle finding a general theme to this book as there are so many applicable options. A few I thought of are that Death is Inevitable (Yossarian realizes this after Snowden dies, and thus starts thinking about escaping), War is absurd (the individual absurdity of all the characters and how Yossarian thinks of the war itself helps convey that War is a crazy idea in the first place. Maybe my favorite theme I can think of but I have no idea how something he'd lost would tie into this), and finally The Corruption of Power in Modern Societies (Characters like Minderbinder who profited off the war and Colonel Cathcart who continued to raise missions needed).

cxgt9,"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and Catch 22. Two novels i was recommended and cannot stand.","in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b2368/i_will_read_the_top_ten_books_posted_in_this/) thread i was asked to write a review for the books i read. And here are two that i couldn't go very far in.

Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! was probably the most boring thing I have ever read. I love biographies, but it felt so much like listening to a math teacher blather on about his life (which is what it is), that I couldn't relate too. It also felt so condescending. But I really felt like i was just listening to some boring person ramble on about his life.

Catch 22, I liked some of the ""silliness"" of the book, and I had a clear idea of what was going on but I didn't really care. I was just bored. I wanted to be in love with this book (like i was with dune or 1984)but after reading those I thought this was rather boring. I reached about  page 100 when i just couldn't continue on.

What do you all think? anything I am missing?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cxgt9/surely_youre_joking_mr_feynman_and_catch_22_two/,2010-08-04T22:26:48Z,24,1,books,Catch-22,POST
32mt2w,"With all the police brutality allegations these past few weeks, is anyone else re-reading Catch-22?",">""Help!"" he shrieked shrilly in a voice strangling in its own emotion, as the policemen carried him to the open doors in the rear of the ambulance and threw him inside. ""Police! Help! Police!"" The doors were shut and bolted, and the ambulance raced away. There was a humorless irony in the ludicrous panic of the man screaming for help to the police while policemen were all around him. Yossarian smiled wryly at the futile and ridiculous cry for aid, then saw with a start that the words were ambiguous, realized with alarm that they were not, perhaps, intended as a call for police but as a heroic warning from the grave by a doomed friend to everyone who was *not* a policeman with a club and a gun and a mob of other policemen with clubs and guns to back him up. ""Help! Police!"" the man had cried, and he could have been shouting of danger.

272i94,"Question about the end of Catch-22, spoilers inside","I recently finished Catch-22, and I thought the ending was relatively uplifting, at least with regards to the rest of the novel. Yossarian seems to have found a way to beat the system, and the Chaplain has renewed confidence in himself. Even Danby seems gung-ho with it.

I was reading some analysis though, and it indicated that the sequel to Catch-22, Closing Time, implies that Yossarian ended up taking the deal with the Colonels. Doesn't this undermine the ending?

6skl4g,Up until now I haven't had an issue with getting into books and end up finishing them fairly quickly. That was until I stumbled upon Catch-22.,"Most of the books I've picked up this summer have really intrigued me, so I've finished them in less than five days each. I read all of 1984 in three days and Into the Wild in five. I started Catch-22 two and a half weeks ago and haven't got past page 120. I'm loving the tone and the narrative is hilarious, but I just can't get into the story. I'm starting to get annoyed by this.

Has anyone had any similar experiences, or is willing to share some tips on how to spark my interest for the book? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6skl4g/up_until_now_i_havent_had_an_issue_with_getting/,2017-08-09T10:26:22Z,19,2,books,Catch-22,POST
