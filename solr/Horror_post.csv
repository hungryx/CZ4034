1adgp9x,The Housemaid and Goodreads,"I'm currently halfway through The Housemaid (Frieda McFadden) and quite honestly contemplating literally throwing it away. Maybe even taking the trash to the curb 4-days early just to assert dominance. I haven't been this disappointed in a novel in a very long while.  The writing is juvenile, the pacing is somehow simultaneously fast and slow, and the characters are one dimensional at best. The ""twists"" are glaringly obvious and I haven't even finished. 

Typically I'll use Goodreads as somewhat of a guide as to whether or not a book is worth the money and time.  How in the world this book has a 4.34 star rating with 854k ratings is making me question the legitimacy of this site. 

Any app/resource suggestions for an avid reader to utilize in these circumstances?

18p94r9,The Housemaid question,"I just finished The Housemaid by Freida McFadden and really enjoyed it. I finished the last two hundred pages in one sitting which is quite unusually for me!

I just have one major question which I might be overlooking the answer to because it's 3am here - when Millie is locked in the attic and she can lock the door from the outside - why wouldn't her key work from the inside? I imagined when they talked about locking the door from the outside that it was a bolt or something, but she specifically locks the door with a key. Why wouldn't that work from the inside to get out? Nina makes a big deal of giving her the key so it must be important?

Your help is appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18p94r9/the_housemaid_question/,2023-12-23T16:22:27Z,2,11,books,The Housemaid,POST
1asadxf,The Housemaid by Freida McFadden (possible spoilers),"I’m new to leisure reading. I mostly only read nerd wallet and investopedia articles and self help books 🤣. So I’m trying to get into reading for fun. I saw this book on social media and after reading the summary I was immediately hooked. Ashamed to say in all my 28 years I’ve never read a 300+ page book in two days but I have now! This book had so many twists and turns and it moved pretty quick which I loved. But I have some unanswered questions. At the end when Evelyn told Nina she was happy she taught Andy a lesson about his teeth ,why didn’t Nina think that Evelyn could have possibly abused her daughter( CeCe) as well? And is Evelyn the reason Andy was sadistic or was it his father who Nina described as perfect ( similar to how everyone described Andy himself ) like maybe Robert (Andy’s dad) does to Evelyn what Andy did to Nina . And also I still think Nina is an awful person for what she did to Millie( setting her up to kill Andy through manipulation and poor treatment ) .",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1asadxf/the_housemaid_by_freida_mcfadden_possible_spoilers/,2024-02-16T14:49:38Z,12,2,books,The Housemaid,POST
19dlehz,The Housemaid’s secret by Freida McFadden,"Seriously - this book has an average of 4.28 stars on goodreads and won a goodreads choice award - however it’s one of the worst books I’ve ever read! The first was barely passable, and I only read the second because I accidentally bought it mistaking it for the first (don’t even ask how) 

The writing is sloppy, the plot feels like it was made up as the author went along, and the entire plot is dismissed as the MC at the end even ACKNOWLEDGES the victim could’ve been overdosed this entire time and it would’ve been easier… 
Don’t get me started on the “villain” Wendy. Her motivations are: I’m an asshole and that’s just how I am! She doesn’t talk like a human, she just SAYS she’s a horrible person and DOESNT justify her thoughts and motives AT ALL. 
Starting to think an AI wrote this book actually. 

ANNOYINGLY at the end of all these housemaid books, the police KNOW and even ACKNOWLEDGE somebody got murdered by the MC and they let it slide…? 

I don’t think I’ll ever read another book from this author again, especially since there’s rumours that she plagiarised some of her books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/19dlehz/the_housemaids_secret_by_freida_mcfadden/,2024-01-23T10:25:45Z,10,12,books,The Housemaid,POST
15rhl4o,Question about the housemaid,so the main goal of Nina was to bring Mille and her abuse husband together so she could escape with her daughter. yet there were some things she did that didn’t make sense. Like why did she mention Mille went to prison at dinner In front of her husband? you would think she would keep that under wraps or hidden. Also why did she call a security guard on Mille at the grocery store to say she was stealing? What if she did get caught and violated her parole and went back to prison?  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15rhl4o/question_about_the_housemaid/,2023-08-15T04:01:52Z,12,21,books,The Housemaid,POST
1941i1d,"I just read ""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden, and I liked it.","SPOILER!

Yes, I admit, it's not the best book I've ever read, but it's a thriller that captivated me and that I managed to read in 4 hours. I appreciate the fact that the book put me in a kind of trance and I couldn't put it down. I had a few missed calls and messages on the phone, but honestly I didn't care about anyone or anything, I was caught up in the story and I just wanted to finish it. I liked the ending, totally unexpected, a real turn of events. On the other hand, there are certain things that made me laugh and roll my eyes. For example, I was amused when Millie and Andrew had sex or how quickly Andrew threw Nina out of the house, it seemed to me that some things did not connect and something squeaked in the middle. However, if you want an easy read that you can read quickly and that will grab you, I recommend this book. I've heard that the author has many other books like this, but unfortunately, only ""The Housemaid"" and ""The Housemaid's Secret"" have been translated in my country.  I have already ordered “The Housemaid’s  Secret” and I am waiting for my order to arrive😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1941i1d/i_just_read_the_housemaid_by_freida_mcfadden_and/,2024-01-11T13:17:59Z,20,58,books,The Housemaid,POST
19dfloo,What are your thoughts on Iron Flame and The Housemaid?,"Hello guys, 

I hope you guys are doing good. I was wondering what is your thought on iron flame if you've read it, because I liked fourth wing. There were some parts that were slow, but it was good still. My partner told me that he saw people were saying it's bad so i'm curious to see what you guys think. I really loved the characters in it, the whole concept of the dragons. It felt just so woah. What do you think of the main OP and her love interest? Personally I believe the concept of enemies to lovers is bit cheesy. 

For the housemaid, I really loved it to be honest. It was an unexpected twist, i've read the second book as well, it was similar plot but it still was very good. I am excited for the one coming out soon, what are your thoughts on that? The main character development is crazy, I loved it so much. I didn’t expect a plot twist like that, I kept wanting to read it. I finished both books in a sitting.

17egid7,"I just finished reading ""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden and these are my honest thoughts and opinions. This post contains SPOILERS so please be aware. I'd love for anyone who's read the 1st book in this series to weigh in and discuss it with me :) I haven't read the 2nd book yet but will be soon!","This review contains spoilers. I wrote my thoughts down about the book as I went, in chronological order.   
''The Housemaid"" (on page 160 right now or about to begin chapter 32) - up to this point some things have been pretty predictable like I knew Millie and Andrew would end up sleeping together. I think that it's pretty crazy why Nina got sent to the psychiatric ward... definitely different I'll give the author that but the reason given for her psychiatric stay was odd in a way of ""trying too hard"" to give some shocking reason that was well.... pretty ridiculous... given the fact that Nina never got charged for such a horrendous thing. I think you can tell that Millie has low self esteem due to her background and how she tries to justify the mistreatment she gets from Nina. At this point I'm wandering what Enzo knows. And thus far it was a very interesting read when Nina called Millie out for being in prison and how she called her out - that has definitely been one of my favorite twists so far that I wasn't expecting to go down quite like that. Nina roasted Millie with her comments. And it was pretty predictable that the playbill Millie kept would be found that she just so happened and HAD to save. Knowing Nina is a psycho she should've known better than to save that even if it was sentimental because Nina already caused her problems and was vulgar in her speech to her on top of Cecelia being a brat.   
I do have to mention this has been a page turner thus far and I'm now staying up late at this point and would rather read this book than do just about anything else, so that's always a good sign.   
It was totally predictable that in some way, form, or fashion that Nina would be monitoring Millie's phone somehow and I was right... Patrice said she had a tracker on it to see where Millie was at all times!  
I think this book is an easy read for people like me with ADHD (mine is currently not being treated) because the author makes sure to get the point across, which I appreciate. Some parts definitely remind me of a small taste of nostalgia from some of the happenings in my childhood R.L. Stine books  like when Nina gets locked into the bedroom and asked to pull out her hair and then told to redo it. I think it's horrifying how Andrew framed Nina, and what he did to Cecelia. Crazy, honestly. And his reasonings behind locking her in the room are stupid like ""your roots are showing"", and ""appreciate electricity"" - but then again that just show cases how demented Andrew is and how calculating he is with how he staged and premeditated everything. He truly made Nina think she was crazy which I have no idea how, I mean I'm sure she wanted to believe he was perfect and she definitely had a lot of naivety. I honestly just think she wanted it so bad to be this perfect relationship. I can say it's not too far fetched when I think about it in my own life dealings for her to put with some of the things that went on because as a victim you try to justify the behavior of the abuser and it's a vicious cycle of the abuser being super mean and then super super super nice. Then top off the fact that he threatened that if she did leave then Cecelia would be taken away from her and she would be thrown into a psychiatric ward. Andrew was the worst thing that ever happened to her in contrast to what she thought was the best thing, for sure.   
Looking back at the beginning of the book I was thinking how Nina was such a psycho and now I'm thinking how Andrew is such a psycho. omg.  
At this point, if I were Nina I would take Cece and go to a different country and just try starting life over. But I know it's not as easy as it may sound. (revision: I see she tried doing that and he found her new license and passport in the safety deposit box. ughhh. I knew it couldn't be THAT easy.)  
Wow, I'm at page 290 and this book has really got me interested and FAST page turning at this point. I did not expect at ALL for Andrew to be locked in the room. I figured it would be another predictable scenario where he goes on to marry and torture Millie but... wow I'm so glad Nina left the pepper spray in the bucket. This really is such a good twist written by the author for sure. I find it ludicrous that Andrew locked Millie in the bedroom for ""treating books the wrong way"" because she didn't put them up.   
I honestly was not expecting for Andrew to die. For a second, I thought that he got out when Millie said she didn't see him on the camera and then she did. I think it was pretty bizarre of a reaction at the funeral that Evelyn gave to Nina about ""teaching her son a lesson"". I think it's coincidental that the police that showed up ended up being Andrew's ex-fiancee's dad before Nina and he happened to have a connection in the coroner's office to make it look like a tragic accident and ""cautionary"" tale, but the again there are crooked politics everywhere.   
Then you get a small preview of the second book and what it may look like. I can't believe Millie accepted the job at Lisa's house when she put together what Lisa meant by ""helping her out"". But I guess she believes she needs to help people.. I just think at this point she ""helped her friend who got raped, spent 15 years in prison"", killed Andrew and got away with it, and now will put her self back in a position to kill possibly and probably a third time and undoubtedly get away with it somehow.   
All, in all, the very last few pages and chapters of this book I absolutely could not stop reading. It makes me excited to read the next book in this series which I will get through just as quickly as this one, I'm sure. I already wish the third book was out, because I'm a completionist for definite.

v22xnv,All the books I read in May 2022 (w short reviews & no spoilers),"I’ve never done one of these, but making an effort to read more, and I read like 12 books this month (which is a record for me), sooo 

***My May 2022 reviews (no spoilers):***



- Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo 4.75/5⭐️
- Siege and Storm by Leigh Bardugo 4.5/5⭐️
- Ruin and Rising by Leigh Bardugo (DNF)
   
      I really enjoyed this trilogy up until like 1/4 into the third book where the main character falls into the worst YA female lead tropes, which was super disheartening 




- The Idiot by Dostoevsky 2.5/5⭐️

      My GOD this book was tedious. Eventually I felt like I was only reading it bc I wasted so much time on it. The philosophy was interested for like 5 minutes and basically nothing particularly interesting happens and this is conveyed in a way which is unreasonably complicated. A guy is so virtuous people think he’s mentally ill. Two hot chicks have a thing for him at different times. That’s basically it. For 800 pages. 





- Ariadne by Jennifer Saint 4.75/5 ⭐️
 
       Great book! If you liked Circe, this one is a must! Only reason it’s not 5/5 is because i know the story of Ariadne and the author doesnt include what is imo the best parts of Ariadne’s mythos




- Bag of Bones by Stephen King 4/5⭐️

      What can I say? I’m an SK fan and this book is nothing out of the ordinary for him. Very classic 90s era King. Haunted house, dead wife, cute kid. Great book. The only qualm I have w King in this era is he’s still in the phase where women only exist in the story as a tool to demonstrate either that the male character lost something, or that the male character learns a lesson. In either case, she’s just there to die and further his character development. But what can ya do? And no this isn’t a spoiler, dw it’s like the first page of the book




- The Housemaid by Sarah Denzil 5/5⭐️
      Holy freakin COW! This book blew me outta the water. I listened as an audiobook for free on the audible Plus catalogue. I don’t usually expect free books to be so great. And this also isn’t the typical genre for me! Girl becomes a housemaid in the spooky house where her mom worked when she abandoned the girl as an infant. She receives an incredibly creepy package which contains a diorama portraying a gruesome murder that seems directed at her. The entire time I was guessing at answers and on the edge of my seat. Plus the prose was really good. 





- Daughter of the Burning City 4.75/5 ⭐️
      Another free audiobook that I was not expecting to love but darn it I did! It is such a fascinating creative concept! It’s a murder mystery set in a traveling festival’s freak show. The world building is awesome. It’s mysterious and magical and you spend the whole book mentally vetting everyone. I suspected literally every person at least once. I picked this up bc I really enjoyed The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern last month. It’s not the same story by any means but the setting feels so similar and it definitely gives the same vibes just darker. 





- Fuzz by Mary Roach 4/5 ⭐️

       This one I have not technically finished, but it’s non-fiction and I don’t usually read nonfiction like “cover to cover”. This book is really great though. It addresses the intersection between wildlife and the law. It follows the author through these wildlife training seminars for how to protect yourself from wild animals, and to protect them from you. Also chronicles seminars on wildlife forensics, and non-animal wildlife. Plus some absurd anecdotes about government systems trying to force legal accountability onto wildlife   Which is like the most human thing ever. The author has a knack for conveying humor through informative text. It reads like a collection of short stories.




- Queen of Dreams by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni 4.5/5 ⭐️
      Idk what to say about this except I love Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. I discovered her books a couple of months ago and I’ve read like 5 since then. She’s such a great author and her prose is so beautiful. 




- Duma Key by Stephen King 4.5/5 ⭐️

      This was a great book. One of Stephen kings better books. It does feel like it could have been 2-3 different books, but a lot of his stuff does so that’s ok. It’s kind of like Picture of Dorian Gray meets Pet Sematary, meets Bag of Bones. Picture of Dorian Gray is my favorite classic and one of my favorite books of all time, so this is an easy thumbs up for me!




-Spy X Family (manga) 5/5 ⭐️
I’ve been watching the show as it premieres, and reading some of the manga along w it. The concept is SO GOOD I love it. This is the first Manga I’ve ever read, and I just watched my first anime in my life like a year ago, so this is a very new dimension for me.

gwz4jo,The Help,"A few weeks ago I began reading The Help by Ms. Kathryn Stockett – I had seen the movie a couple times and not only loved it but deeply identified with the character of Skeeter. I grew up in 1980s South Carolina, and I definitely witnessed the vestiges of this 'housemaid' system. In retrospect it's interesting that even though my family was – at best – middle-middle class, they still afforded these housekeeping/nanny services (that was for my aunts/uncles – by my time it was Nintendo and cable tv).

I am now in the middle of reading this book during the wrenching uproar surrounding the murder of that man in Minneapolis, and it's just sickening to continue this read. I am really struggling to finish this amazing book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gwz4jo/the_help/,2020-06-05T06:17:04Z,2,5,books,The Housemaid,POST
hjuz0q,'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro: An analysis of the character of Stevens and his notion of idealistic professionalism in the novel,"In Kazuo Ishiguro's [*The Remains of the Day*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28921.The_Remains_of_the_Day), the character of Stevens is something of a tragic hero – flawed but sympathetic at the same time, and evoking equal parts admiration and pity. An ageing butler who has dedicatedly provided his service to a great house for over three decades, Stevens is in the twilight of his career in the post-war England of the mid-twentieth century where the book begins. As he sets out on a holiday in the countryside at his current employer's insistence and launches into a series of reflections on his past, the narrative becomes by turns a travelogue and a memoir. These dual but parallel journeys – the literal one through the countryside and the metaphorical one through the past – become by extension a probe into class, culture and politics. But they also simultaneously tell a story of loss and regrets; a story of a man who gives his all to duty and as a consequence achieves little in the way of desire.  

At one point in the narrative Mr Farraday, Stevens' current employer and the new American owner of Darlington Hall where Stevens has served all this time, demands of Stevens to confirm (in a rather demeaning manner for someone who has otherwise been portrayed as a genial man) that the latter is 'a genuine old-fashioned English butler' and that he has paid for 'the real thing'. Ignoring this obvious objectification of his person and the borderline fetishization of his descent, Stevens responds in the affirmative. And he is indeed a butler of the highest order. Earnest and precise in his tasks, unwaveringly loyal, conscious of propriety, and refined in both manner and speech, he is what remains of the old days – an embodiment of what has now come to be termed as Englishness and a representative of the class of great English butlers who were a part-and-parcel of prominent estates.   

But underneath the mask of cold professionalism, there is a turbulent soul that seeks to reconcile the past and the present, or more precisely, the choices made (or not made) in the past and their consequences in the present. This interplay of choices and consequences, duty and desire, takes place on the larger plane of identity, which emerges as a key theme in the novel.  

Stevens' identity is inextricably linked to his profession as a butler. Almost everything that he thinks or does is directly or indirectly tied to his profession. And this fact becomes evident from the very opening scene where Stevens prepares to undertake a trip to the countryside and decides that it could be 'put to good professional use', which indicates a certain obsession with work. In modern lingo he would be easily dubbed as a 'workaholic'. Even while deliberating on the clothes to wear on the trip – which his employer expressly and generously sanctions as one for leisure rather than work – he makes the calculations through the lens of his job as a butler at Darlington Hall, and concludes that he must be dressed appropriately as there is no saying when he might have to reveal his association with Darlington Hall over the course of the trip. This literal (and seemingly trivial and pompous) choice regarding his attire actually extends to and is interwoven with his principles of professionalism and the interconnected ideal of 'dignity' at large.   

> *'The great butlers are great by virtue of their ability to inhabit their professional role and inhabit it to the utmost; they will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. They wear their professionalism as a decent gentleman will wear his suit. [...] It is, as I say, a matter of ""dignity"".'*   

Stevens inherits this code of professional conduct, as we eventually learn, from none other than his father who was once a 'great' butler himself. Back in his day Stevens Sr had confronted a certain dilemma in his career, and his response to it had been as poignant as it was awe-inspiring. The dilemma, as Stevens narrates it, had been this: A certain General had arrived as a guest at the estate of his father's then employer. It turned out that this General was the man responsible for the death of his elder son in the South African War. His personal feelings towards the guest had therefore been anything but fondness. Meanwhile, a series of circumstances demanded that someone serve as a substitute for the General's valet through the entire duration of his stay. Aware of the significance of the General's visit for his employer's business aspirations, Stevens' father volunteered himself. And not only did he carry out his duty, he carried it out to the best of his abilities, despite having to suffer close proximity to the man he loathed and without giving the slightest inkling of his personal feelings. Between his professional commitments and his personal feelings, he prioritized the former while suppressing the latter.  

It becomes evident over the course of the narrative that, among other things, the account of this event in his father's career leaves a significant impact on Stevens' psyche and contributes to the making of his own professional ambitions. The 'dignity' which, in his view, his father came close to being an embodiment of, is what he strives to achieve himself, and as a result he finds it difficult to divorce his professional identity from his private one. Furthermore, underpinning this pursuit of 'dignity' – as the story of Stevens' father demonstrates and as Stevens himself is to put into practice over the course of his career – is the ability to exercise emotional restraint in the face of challenging situations, or in any situation where one is in a professional capacity, for that matter.  

Essentially, Stevens sees emotions as an impediment to professionalism. Being reticent and self-effacing is, in his view, the proper conduct for any butler worth his salt. And he makes this point by drawing upon the presumed 'greatness' of the English landscape owing to its 'lack of obvious drama or spectacle'. Like Wordsworth who reminisced about his life as he gazed at the beauty of the countryside in his poem *Tintern Abbey*, Stevens takes in the sights around him and comes to the following conclusion about his country's landscape, straddling the line between patriotism and prejudice.    

> *'...I would say that it is the very* lack *of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart. What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint. [...] In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness.'*    

The irony of this dogmatic critique lies in the fact that until now he has hardly ever ventured anywhere outside of the premises of Darlington Hall, let alone having toured a foreign country. But he goes on to correlate this perceived quality of the English landscape to the existence of butlers as being an exclusive attribute of England.  

> *'It is sometimes said butlers only truly exist in England. [...] I tend to believe this is true. Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race is capable of.'*  

This is one of the first glimpses into how opinionated Stevens can be. For all his gentlemanly behaviour as necessitated by his job as a butler, Stevens is internally quite critical of anyone who does not live up to his standards or share his views on what constitutes 'good' professionalism. His tirade against the conduct of fellow butlers, housekeepers and servants who have proven to be anything less than perfect in their work, paints him as a rather snobbish and intolerant man.  

In a similarly opinionated manner, Stevens asserts at one point that a butler's professional prestige is determined by the moral worth of his employer, and that true 'greatness' for a butler lies in serving gentlemen who work for 'the progress of humanity'. As such, as he looks back on his years of service to Lord Darlington, his late former employer, he claims that he takes great pride in having served his lordship who dedicated his life to many a great affairs of both national and global significance. This adulatory narration around Lord Darlington is, however, undermined by a recurring emphasis on the low opinion of the man among the general public owing to his antisemitic inclinations and liaison with Nazi sympathizers. Stevens' attempt to defend his former employer against allegations of treachery is ironically marred by his own narration of the political affairs the latter was involved in. One notable instance of this is when Lord Darlington orders the dismissal of a pair of housemaids on the grounds that they are Jews. Stevens knows in his bones that it is wrong but complies, despite the protests of Miss Kenton, the housekeeper.   

> *'...my every instinct opposed the idea of their dismissal. Nevertheless, my duty in this instance was quite clear, and as I saw it, there was nothing to be gained at all in irresponsibly displaying such personal doubts. It was a difficult task, but as such, one that demanded to be carried out with dignity.'*   

Stevens therefore maintains his professional integrity at the expense of his conscience and morality. Lord Darlington's political exploits turn out to be unethical and misguided. But Stevens, who has conditioned himself to believe that his employer is invariably a 'better judge' than he can ever hope to be, pacifies his prickling conscience by justifying it as his professional duty. What he repeatedly insists is a matter of pride to him therefore unravels itself as a matter of disgrace, though he never explicitly refers to it in those terms.  

Most of what Stevens calls the 'turning points' in his career pan out in a similar manner – with a sense of loss underlying his successes at every turn. His professional achievements are always at the expense of something of personal significance to him.  

When his father, who has been tentatively serving as an under-butler in Darlington Hall, falls critically ill and requires both medical attention and moral support, Stevens simultaneously has another crucial matter to take care of downstairs – the smooth running of an international conference of immense significance to Lord Darlington and his political aspirations. In the tug of war between professional and personal duties, Stevens ultimately lets the former prevail. In the process he takes a decisive step towards being the 'great' butler he aspires to be, and earns much admiration from his employer, his employer's guests and his peers for his flawless execution of duties in the face of numerous difficulties and distractions. But these are at the expense of his duty as a son towards his father and, perhaps more importantly, his own emotional wellbeing. He justifies his choice by reminding himself that what he does is exactly what his father would have wanted him to do, and he might not have been wrong on that account in another situation. However, it is possible that, lying on his deathbed, the old man would have wanted deep down for once nothing more than having his son close by. When he regrets that he has not been a good father, which Stevens neither confirms nor denies, he most likely alludes to his own sacrifice of duties towards his family for the sake of his profession and his role in having his son grow up with the same mindset.   

Years later Stevens finds himself confronted with a situation that eerily mirrors the day he lost his father – a day of importance for his employer and a group of eminent guests to attend to, requiring him to be on his toes at all times – and it brings with it yet another loss. When Miss Kenton announces her decision to get married and resign from her post in Darlington Hall, Stevens tries to maintain a calm and composed exterior, and hastily excuses himself under the pretext of attending to 'matters of global significance taking place upstairs'. At the end of the day he claims feeling a 'sense of triumph'.   

> *'...a deep feeling of triumph started to well up within me. [...] I had, after all, just come through an extremely trying evening, throughout which I had managed to preserve a ""dignity keeping with my position"" – and had done so, moreover, in a manner even my father might have been proud of. And there across the hall, behind the very doors upon which my gaze was then resting, within the very room where I had just executed my duties, the most powerful gentlemen of Europe were conferring over the fate of our continent. [...] I can see few other explanations for that sense of triumph I came to be uplifted by that night.'*   

Stevens rationalizes that the 'sense of triumph' he feels that evening is on account of having successfully executed his duties in the presence of 'the most powerful gentlemen' whose meeting under the roof of his employer is to have a global and historic significance. However, it is more than that. The evening was 'extremely trying' not only due to the physical exertion of his work and his confrontation with Mr Cardinal regarding Lord Darlington, it was so also due to Miss Kenton's sudden announcement of her intent to get married. The emotional turmoil he experiences, however, is so incongruous with his self-imposed code of professional conduct that he refuses to acknowledge his dormant romantic interest in Miss Kenton. The 'sense of triumph' then stems from a sense of relief for having been able to exercise restraint in the face of emotionally distressing news that threatened to tear down his walls.   

This detached response to most things – especially those that are of a personal significance, such as his father's death and Miss Kenton's resignation and subsequent marriage – become an exercise in not only deluding the reader but also in deluding himself. Peter Beech, in [an article in *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/07/the-remains-of-the-day-by-kazuo-ishiguro-book-to-share#comments), describes Stevens as an 'unwitting narrator' – a unique variation on the literary device of the unreliable narrator – who 'remain trapped in self-preserving fictions, mysteries even to themselves.' Many of Stevens' claims, assertions and reflections, on closer inspection, only serve to remind the reader that the man doth protest too much. It almost makes one wonder if his intent to use the trip to the countryside as an opportunity to persuade Miss Kenton to rejoin the housekeeping staff at Darlington Hall – a purpose as professional as it can get – is perhaps, at some level, also driven by a very personal longing to simply meet the love he had let go of (though of course he knows better than to admit this). There are several instances where he unintentionally reveals too much, deconstructing or contradicting the point he attempts to make. These constant attempts at self-deception come to a head when he's forced to finally look the truth in the eye and confront the hollow and meaningless shell that his life has become.    

Stevens' single-minded pursuit of 'greatness' in his profession leaves one to wonder: To what extent is he simply a product of his time and upbringing, shaped by the demands of his professional circuit and society at large; and to what extent are his principles self-imposed?   

There's certainly the influence of his father to account for. And there's certainly a degree of importance attached to household management and butlers in Stevens' time, as is evidenced by the existence of the Hayes Society and its set of stringent criteria for membership. But there are also instances scattered throughout the story where butlers and servants of varying ranks put their personal desires over their professional commitments and prospects of career advancement, and get away with as few repercussions as they can avoid. Sure, they probably forever lose their chance to make a name for themselves or get recruited into more prestigious households; but that was never a concern for the housekeeper who elopes with the under-butler or the maid who elopes with the footman, in the first place. Miss Kenton herself chooses to (legitimately) resign in order to marry and start a family, and her choice is never contested from a professional angle. Thus, commitment to one's profession, while valued and sought for, is not such a matter of life and death as Stevens makes it out to be. Stevens, with his extremities and rigidity, is more of an anomaly than a reflection of the general populace of his time.     

But that is precisely what sets Stevens (and his father and their likes) apart from the rest – that is, the 'less ambitious' crowd that is content with being average to decent at their jobs, never aiming higher than the bare minimum of what is expected of them, and sometimes even willing to forsake their achievements and prospects in exchange for fulfilment in other areas of life. Meanwhile, Stevens is on the other, extreme end of this spectrum – his obsession with achieving perfection and that thing he calls 'dignity' in his profession so strong that it overrides everything else in his life. It therefore seems to be almost an inevitable fact of life that to achieve something, one must sacrifice, either consciously or inadvertently, something else in the process.   

The tragedy of Stevens' situation, however, lies in the fact that all his sacrifices ultimately come to nothing. Miss Kenton goes on to achieve a degree of contentment in her life post her resignation as the housekeeper of Darlington Hall. It is not all roses and rainbows for her but she has things to look forward to, in contrast to Stevens' initial assumption that her marriage has fallen apart and she is unhappy. Presumably things also turn out well for those eloped love birds of whom Stevens has been so critical; and even if they are not leading perfectly happy lives, they can be content with the knowledge that they at least *tried* to pursue happiness instead of running away from it. Stevens, on the other hand, dedicates his whole life to the pursuit of an ideal at the cost of his emotional wellbeing, only to find – to take a phrase from Miss Kenton's letter – his life stretching out emptily before him.    

In a way, both Stevens' and Lord Darlington's lives play out in a similar manner. Their commitment to their respective principles only begets loss, regrets and a sense of futility in the end. The difference is, Lord Darlington lives for a cause he believes in, even if it proves to be a misguided one and eventually leads to his downfall. In contrast, Stevens never really lives for himself or something close to his heart. He instead blindly places his trust in his employer and believes that the path to glory lies in playing a part in helping the latter work towards the noble causes of 'justice' and 'the progress of humanity'. One digs his own grave with his own hands, and another digs his own grave by merely deferring to the former. One suffers loss through his doings; another suffers loss through restraint. Neither is desirable, but while Lord Darlington's regrets are a direct consequence of his own actions, Stevens' regrets are borne of *inaction* and therefore cut deeper for him.  

> *'... at least [Lord Darlington] had the privilege of being able to say at the end of his life that he made his own mistakes. [...] He chose a certain path in life, it proved to be a misguided one, but there, he chose it, he can say that at least. As for myself, I cannot even claim that. You see, I* trusted. *I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. All those years I served him, I trusted I was doing something worthwhile. I can't even say I made my own mistakes. Really – one has to ask oneself – what dignity is there in that?'*   

And perhaps that is what lies at the root of Stevens' regrets: All this time he looked for 'dignity' where it never existed and believed that he was doing something 'worthwhile' in the process. The existential horror lies in this bitter realization. Stevens, however, does pick himself up, and resolves to put the past behind him and throw himself anew into polishing his bantering skills to be employed in the presence of his American employer – a matter he has been preoccupied with since the beginning of the book. In a way, it may be argued that instead of learning a lesson, he goes back to square one. But there is a crucial difference here – while previously his commitment to his profession was fueled by idealistic notions, now it is a fatalistic choice that he makes after confronting the reality and realizing that there is really nothing else to do other than to keep going.   

> *'The hard reality is, surely, that for the likes of you and me, there is little choice other than to leave our fate, ultimately, in the hands of those great gentlemen at the hub of this world who employ our services. What is the point in worrying oneself too much about what one could or could not have done to control the course one's life took?'*    

And perhaps that is a poignant truth of life in general, and not just that of Stevens: We must latch onto a purpose in order to give meaning to an existence that is inherently meaningless. When one purpose fails or becomes redundant, we must find another one. And, to quote Kurt Vonnegut, so it goes.

17c0z5a,Bram Stoker’s Dracula is a straight up banger (a not so hot take),"I just finished Dracula. Spoilers for the 120+ year old book incoming.

 I read a lot of classics, so I was prepared to enjoy it but maybe find it a bit slow, not super thrilling, and dry (while still being well done and an interesting read in terms of the history of horror in general.)

Totally wrong. Dracula is so much fun. It was genuinely scary at times (I even scared myself reading it too late at night) and I really loved the way the story was woven together through the diaries of the main characters. 

The opening chapters at the castle set a great scene, and I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck in some of the descriptions of Harkers suspicions of Count Dracula not being everything he seemed.

And just when I thought the story would just be a series of almost short stories about Dracula’s victims, it took a turn into all the main characters joining together to form a Dracula Hunting Squad to take him out. Turning the hunter into the hunted. 

It got a little slow in the middle, and there were certainly some plot holes (I still don’t understand why he let Harker live at all) but overall I just really enjoyed this book in not at all the way I was expecting. 

Turns out it’s one of the most influential classics for a reason /s",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17c0z5a/bram_stokers_dracula_is_a_straight_up_banger_a/,2023-10-20T02:49:54Z,151,1118,books,Dracula,POST
jis1cx,Dracula by Bram Stoker,"Wow, I am not sure what to say. I walked out on the other side of Dracula loving it way more than I thought I would.

It was tough to get into at first with the first chapter. I had just finished The Silmarillion by Tolkien and it was such a shift that I was just not in to it at first. But after a week or so letting myself sit on The Silmarillion I picked Dracula up and boy after that first chapter up to about 60-80 pages I was just enthralled with Jonathan’s stay at Castle Dracula. So terrifying and spooky. After the break away from Jonathan to the other characters it felt like a dip but it started to pick up again after a bit, and I was captured again.

At first I was not a huge fan of Mina as a character, but as the book continued she slowly became my favorite character. The compassion she shows for Dracula is so interesting and admirable. To know how he is more than the others and therefore be able to sympathize with him more makes her character so much fun to read. The continual notice and sorrow for how she is “unclean” by her and the other characters is heartbreaking, yet she holds hope, even though as Seward says she is cast out from God himself.

This was my first time reading a horror book and I had never understood the appeal before. However, man did I enjoy it! There were some things I had thought I knew about Dracula, but I was off a bit. I thought Reinfield would play a much larger role for some reason, I assume I just heard the name often and thought he had more of a part to play in taking Dracula down. One of the walk aways that has creeped me out most is the ability for Dracula to travel as mist and fog. Living in the north west we get mist early in the mornings sometimes during the year, and the thought of Dracula rising like a shadow from the mist is absolutely horrifying. I also loved the description of the slayings of the vampires. Compulsing, screeching, and blood foam at the lips leading to a look of peace and beauty. So cool!

It has also been my first book told through letters/journal entries and I find it a super intriguing way to write a story. I can’t wait now to pick up Frankenstein in the near future. Anyway, Dracula was a great read for this Halloween season.

I hope you are all staying safe and reading great stories!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jis1cx/dracula_by_bram_stoker/,2020-10-27T01:33:56Z,231,559,books,Dracula,POST
4nl229,I read Dracula last week and I'm dying to discuss it with someone!,"I knew the rough story like everyone else does, which was why I put off reading the book for so long. I also had the misfortune of being 13 when Twilight was all the rage, and that ruined vampires for me for a long time. But a few days ago I finally downloaded the ebook from Gutenberg and settled down to read it.

I really liked the epistolary format. I've encountered it a few times, and I don't know if it was the era, but the format really enhances the narrative. I knew the obvious spoiler, yet watching Harker stumble through confusion, denial, and finally horror and resignation in the course of his letters really brought out the menace of Dracula's existence. Even lying warm under a blanket with family sleeping right next to me, I was afraid and couldn't quite look out of the window into the night for fear that a pale-faced man or even a bat would appear. 

Then the narrative moved to Mina, Harker's fiancee. Quite honestly, I expected the story to take a turn for the worse, not really expecting the women to play much of a role. However I was wrong; the buildup there was as good, if not better. Reading about Lucy's deterioration and the attempts to save her, I was equally hopeful and in despair. Also, the letters that Mina writes to Lucy when she doesn't know about her death touched me. 

I think the last third of the book was not quite that exciting; once they'd figured out how to kill the vampires it seemed a mere matter of time. It did give more depth to the characters, especially to Harker, who up till that point had narrated but not been described much. The ending, though it dragged a little, was quite satisfying, and I was relieved to see, not the sort of open ending which leaves room for another book. 

What did you think of the book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4nl229/i_read_dracula_last_week_and_im_dying_to_discuss/,2016-06-11T11:29:44Z,547,2323,books,Dracula,POST
1azn1xj,Dracula was such a page-turner <3,"IT WAS AMAZING. Not even one bit of it felt like a drag to read. 

I did watch ""So you haven't read: Dracula"" from Extra History both before and after finishing the book. They mentioned sexual undertones and whatnot, and I didn't exactly latch onto that, minus the fact that both Lucy and MAYBE Dracula himself both have 3 suitors each. That is, if the vampire women are even Dracula's mistresses.

As for their point on good ol' Victorian Mina being saved compared to the more modern Lucy... that was... meh. Because the way I see it, Mina had a bigger harem than Lucy towards the end. I mean come on, even if Art. Seward or Quincey aren't exactly suitors, VAN HELSING HIMSELF FELT LIKE A POTENTIAL. Or perhaps I am misreading it. Oh well.

This is one such book where annotations felt appropriate, I even indulged in it for the first time. While it did take me out of the story, it helped when tracing Dracula's appearances throughout Whitby and Carfax. And when Van Helsing finally summarized all of Dracula's abilities towards the end of the book, the notes are there to recall the mist, the different forms, and even the wolves. It also helped during Jonathan's detailing on tracking down the cargo porters and with Renfield's antics until his death.

Renfield was a fun character to read, I laughed at the part where he literally ate his ""pets"" as a way to clean up before Mina could visit him. Interesting fellow but he is still an engima to me. When he pleaded with the men to be released before they invaded Carfax, why? Was it because he knew that they were walking into a trap considering how Dracula could control mice?

Part of me wished there was more action towards the end, especially on Dracula's part. He just... got killed from having his box opened. Granted, it was pretty epic to have Quincey and Jonathan team up in literal battle like that, it felt like something straight out of an anime. Like there could have been more of a battle, and more than just the scar on Mina's forehead just disappearing after Dracula's true death. Speaking of which, it did mention that there was a brief look of peace just before he turns to dust. And I've read inputs that say Dracula might have been a pitiable villain, perhaps that's where it came from?

The epilogue was quite brief, I think maybe even the shortest so far from the few classics I've read. It feels rushed, but at the same time isn't because its kind of irrelevant as well for the most part. I do wonder who ended up marrying Arthurt and Seward.

nrrkvc,Bram Stoker's Dracula Does Not Get Enough Love,"By 'not enough love' I mean more people should read the unabridged 400+ page old-English original version of the classic novel.  Pop culture's portrayal of Dracula clearly shows the original interpretation is often bypassed and unknown by many.

I have been trying to tell anyone who will listen how great this book has been.  I read a lot, and I think it is at least equal to all my favorite books.  It is not just great, reading it was a beautiful experience.  The themes are simple, but the imagery, tangible and emotional, are the pinnacle of what can be accomplished with words, and the two victims are the most well written victim-experiences I've ever read.  Why is the book so rarely talked about or recommended?  I randomly picked up myself from the library.  Is its gothic darkness too much for people?  Maybe it is too hard of a read?  Everyone loves Poe and this is right up that alley, so what gives?   Personally I give it the highest recommendation as one of the best book ever written.

18mps1m,Started Dracula - Massively Disappointed,"Okay, so as a lover of the genre I figured it was high time I finally read the holy grail of vampire novels— Dracula. I am just a little over 100 pages in (which is taking me forever given that the pages of the copy I have are a bit wider than usual), and… I am so very bored with it. Possible spoilers for what I’ve read so far, and I’ll put my request for no spoilers on what I haven’t read (even though I obviously know how the tale goes lol).

I was initially excited by the fact that it was told in journals, letters, etc., but I’ve quickly become annoyed by that. It makes me feel so detached from the story, like an outsider looking in (perhaps that was Stoker’s intention?) as opposed to engulfed in the story as it happens, which is my favorite part of reading. It also makes the action less… action-y, and the lengthy descriptions of scenery and lunches a complete and utter bore when that’s actually something I would have enjoyed elsewhere (tell me, don’t show! I’m lazy lol).

Am I the only one who feels this way? Does it get any better? The chapter I finished on was when Renfield was brought back to the asylum. The next to read is a letter from oblivious Mina to Lucy the blood bank.

Instead of doing that when the vampire wasn't even able to fight... that's not even nearly as dramatic as I would've liked it to be.

It was a surprising review for a story from the 19th century, so when I stumbled upon it I thought I'd try it.

&#x200B;

Well to start off simple, no doubt, Carmilla has a lot more LGBT representation than Dracula, if that's an asset to you I do suggest to give Carmilla a read. You can only interpret so many ways how much time Carmilla spends caressing or necking the main character. Hard to not also attach the concept of her unholy appetite to that of lust, as in Dracula. Is it more progressive ? I... don't think so, no. Aside from giving lesbianism the spotlight, there's no big jump in female empowerment compared to Dracula. The wikipedia article says the book subverts the usual tropes by having helpless unproductive males, but... I mean, a guy did solve the whole problem. Laura, the main character, mostly just spends her time being sexually confused or terrified. Her entire role in the book is being victimized.

Now, the Baron (someone you can only describe as a Van Helsing-like fellow) is the deus ex machina : the dude just resolves the whole situation the moment he puts down his suitcase. He was such a pro that he even murdered the tension, everything got taken care of way too fast the moment he put on his vampire-killing apron. He even delivers an ""elementary my dear Watson"" speech ! It's like the author himself goes ""I don't know man, I was writing this vampire horror story and this Blade guy just showed up"".

The initial reddit thread that recommended me the book depicted Carmilla as a sympathetic character but I didn't see that, to be honest. She murders people continuously the whole book, all female characters. I think people get confused because she uses the main character as a plaything and doesn't attack her straight away. Also, personally, her attitude towards Laura feels salacious, not romantic.

Anyway, if a feminist aspect is what's sold to you by someone, take it with a grain of salt. It's not a factor in my appreciation at least, but it's often a point that follows discussion of the book online from what I gather.

&#x200B;

In terms of writing, Dracula wins. Not sure if there's debate around this. There's much more suspense and the epistolary format is what really makes Dracula fun to read in my opinion. Even among the other classic monster books like Frankenstein and Jekyll&Hyde, Dracula always was the most dynamic. The ""pursuit"" in the last act of Dracula ramps things up a lot, whereas the ending in Carmilla is a bit too abrupt in my opinion (it's the Baron I tell you, it's that fucking Baron). But I'm not going to insist on comparing a novel with what is almost a short story. Both have functional prose and neither delve into nobel lit territory, that's it. However, Carmilla was fun to read in the sense that the author nurtures the *mystery* rather than the *suspense* : who is that character that we cross only a few times and what is their link to Carmilla, was that really her mother, where did the henchmen come from and were they in on it, why do so many years pass before they meet again,  what's a dream and what isn't etc. You still have a few questions when you reach the end. It's a different approach but makes for good food for thought.

&#x200B;

Now in regards to vampire lore, this is where it gets fun to talk about : overall I prefer the super-powers in Dracula and I like the imagery of bats (Carmilla being just a black shape when zooming around). The mind control also gets a bit more of a focus, though in Carmilla it's more open to interpretation : is Laura being mind-controlled or is her affection genuine ? The fact that it's less explicit makes it more interesting to think about, if a bit less overtly suspenseful than for Dracula's brides. Either way, I enjoy the link between vampires and telepathy. Carrion Comfort was also interesting for that aspect (can't say I recommend that book overall though).

There's more pseudo-science in Dracula, Van Helsing's explanations being a bit more fun to follow than the Baron's. But, where Carmilla gets an advantage is that it depicts a ""vampire bureaucracy"", which to me was super interesting. There's a whole administration ready to file paperwork to get rid of vampires ? It's almost as if they brought an official notary to execute vampires. Le Fanu should have expanded the concept more, I think, he only barely touches on it.

&#x200B;

**In conclusion** : Carmilla is a fun short book, however I woudn't call it a better version of Dracula. I definitely recommend it to see how the concept of vampires evolve through the ages in Ireland. Is it the creator of the modern vampire ? I don't know, it's the earliest vampire story I've read, I should still read The Vampyre by Polidori for example to compare better.

&#x200B;

Anyway, anyone here read it ? what you think ?

164j544,My thoughts on Dracula,"The first part with Jonathan in the castle was quite fun. Then it was like a train diving downward at light speed into an endless abyss of pain and suffering. I have no idea how I managed to finish this one. I wanted to DNF this so bad but I had only 100 pages left and so I pushed through. 

My main problems with this book were the prose and the characters. I usually like Victorian style prose, it doesn’t bother me. But the prose in this one felt completely off and disjointed. It was kind of the equivalent of wattpad writing but for the 19th century. Bram should have stuck to being a theatre kid because writing… not his strongest suit.

I have read about one dimensional characters, and they’re usually not very fun. But the characters in this book felt more like zero dimensional characters; they’re not even lines, they’re points. Jonathan was good. If Bram had spent more time with him maybe he could have been better. Van Helsing was bearable. John was ok as long as he was dealing with Renfield. Quincey was absolutely unnecessary. Like why is he there. Arthur should have stuck around up until Lucy’s death and then left. Despite all this they lack a personality. They seem like copy-cats of one another. Jonathan had the potential at first but then he is reduced to the same level as the others. And don’t even get me started on how strong and brave and strong and loving and fu*cking strong these guys were. 

Lucy was kinda ok but I was really hoping I would see more of her as a vampire. When Van Helsing was looking at her in her grave he says something about her voluptuous beauty and I actually thought there for a moment that Bram was going to make a 180 about the way female beauty and figure and sex were treated during that time but nooo. He instantly tells us how wrong this is and kills her. Also, Wtf was with her and blood transfusions. She’s ill and Van is like: give her a blood transfusion. Oh she’s ill  again; let’s give another one. Oh she’s ill once again; let’s give AND SHUT UP DUDE! At this point I’m convinced she actually died because of all the blood she got. Like I know blood groups were discovered much latter but still. All this was kinda stupid.

And then we have Mina; our poor, sweet, dear, poor Mina. And how lucky she is to have all of these strong and brave men around her to protect her ( girl RUN) at all times. She is actually clever but doesn’t see because she’s a woman. I was kinda hoping she was gonna be the one to kill Dracula in the end but oh well… guess we can’t have nice things. 

I wasn’t expecting a miracle or anything from this book but I was expecting something better than this. Dracula was a very interesting monster but like everyone else he is reduced to an idiot. Wish there had been more of him and also some insight into his psychology.

A warning to anyone who actually read all of that. This is just how I felt about this book. Don’t let it stop you from reading it and enjoying it. We all have different tastes. I like a lot of books that other people don’t enjoy so don’t let my opinions get in the way of your own experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/164j544/my_thoughts_on_dracula/,2023-08-29T13:53:46Z,30,16,books,Dracula,POST
18734px,Dracula: Feminist or Misogynistic (SPOILERS FOR A 100 YEAR OLD BOOK),"Note: Yes I know this was written a hundred years ago, Im looking for legit discussion please.

&#x200B;

Ive been reading Dracula and have noticed a lot of seemingly sexist themes throughout the first 13 chapters. Lucy is portrayed as a damsel in distress with no idea of whats making her ill. The men in her life seem to think she's a child in need of caring for. When Helsing was doing the transfusions, he only asked the males to help and totally ignored the maids (who Stoker says were all very fond of Lucy, seems like they could've given a few drops).

The males in the book treat women like they are subservient and weak willed. Seward is very closed off and feels embarrassed at Helsing when he cries at Lucy's demise. He treats any emotion as a weakness and continually attributes having feelings to women. Arthur isn't much in this book so far, but for some reason he thinks giving Lucy his blood is a sign of marriage. Dracula himself keeps a harem and is intent on expanding it.

Despite this, Ive heard several points that make me think Stoker was an early feminist. Later in the book, Mina seems to save the day. She researches and uses modern science to help dispatch Dracula. The guys all say she has the ""mind of a man"", which at first seem silly but rethinking it a little, maybe it means women can be taught the same way as men and therefore have the same capabilities.

Note: Im not triggered or offended by anything inside this book, its a product of its time. Im looking to hear opinions on why or why not it is sexist, or a little of both.

17qo9lo,Dracula by Bram Stoker - a great classic,"This book creates a horror atmosphere that has been copied constantly over the years but never quite captured again. You'll be experiencing with Harker the castle and what he faces there. Battling the Count in England...and the terror of the ship's crew that carried his earth boxes across the sea, all will stay with you. Again let me urge you no matter how well any movie has been done, if the movie Dracula is the only one you know, you haven't met the proto-vampire who resides in this book. He/it still walks through literature and even more in the dark fears that lurk in the back of our minds when we're alone on a stormy night or we have to walk alone past that old rundown graveyard (not cemetery) where the city has never gotten around to installing those street lights._x000D_  
_x000D_  
This isn't Twilight, nor is it Buffy the vampire Slayer, there aren't any friendly, helpful, romantic vampires here. (None sparkle either) There is quite probably a reason (or maybe more than one) why we wish so badly to laugh at this book. It does what it does very, very well...and that's be frightening._x000D_  
_x000D_  
This book is a classic that has been around for over a hundred years..there's a reason for that.

&#x200B;

I don't know why Francis Ford Coppola felt he had to spice up a story that has stood up for generations of scrutiny as a classic story of good vs. evil and dress it as a love story. There is a reason that other horrible characters have been created in literature, but there are only a few that endure. Dracula is one of them, and it is because of the chills a reader feels when in his presence in the world Stoker created. The novel has suspense, feeling, and good, noble characters throughout. The movie has none of these qualities.

Dracula is just a bloodthirsty psychopath hungry for power like Hitler. Sadism and the desire for power can lead human beings to commit cruelty.  Just read what the Nazis did in the concentration camps. They were not tragic heroes, but sadistic scoundrels.

The adaptation with Louis Jordan is better.

yor63l,Dracula Daily finally wrapped up today. Did anybody else participate?,"For those unaware, Dracula is written in an epistolary format comprised of newspaper clippings and diary entries going from May 3rd to November 7th. The website Dracula Daily would email the ""chapters"" or entries on each day (completely free!) so it's sent in the time that coincides with the story. So, for the past 6 months, I've been reading Dracula little by little...

I enjoyed the book quite a bit. There are some genuine creeps throughout and you can see how Stoker really helped create the modern genre of horror. Van Helsing & The Count are both great characters too. I think the pacing stalled in the second half, especially considering Harker's time at The Count's castle was so good, but it's still a great read.

Reading it for 6 months, however, sort of drained me and I wasn't as attached to the characters as I had hoped. The idea is great and I think it may be good for people who don't read a lot but this will be something I'd never do again.

14b9mmq,Dracula. The king of all vampire stories. Bram Stoker is really good at painting a secne.,"I've been hesitating to post this cause Dracula is one of the most reoccuring books on this sub, and it's porbably irratating. But I just wanted to share some hype with people who might appriciate it and feel the same way I do. I've been on a book marathon for a month or two now. A while ago I read Carmilla & The Vampyre in preparation to get a grasp on some early vampire fiction before starting Dracula. I'm now 9 chapters, about 100 pages into Dracula and I'm on cloud nine. Although the PDF scan I'm reading is the ancient Country Life Press. The text is so compressed and condense on the page. It feels like I've read way more than 100 pages.

Anyway, what an amazing book. I adore how Stoker can describe things so vividly. It might be a screenplay for how exact and life like everything is. I have a habit of looking up things when i'm reading. Locations, tools, clothing etc. When I got to the Whitby chapters I decided to look up some 360 videos of Whitby Abbey, the town and the church steps. It's exactly the way the book described it a 125 years ago. It was a surreal experience.

I have had a lot of excited moments so far into the story.

The Calache ride to castle Dracula. Meeting the devil himself and speaking to him sitted beside the fireplace. 

I got shivers running up my arms when he was passionately speaking about transylvanians history, his lineage and the Dracula pride. Fucking poetic. I love how there are implications that he was Vlad The Impaler himself. Even the descriptions of his appearances match up with that famous portrait painting of Vlad. Domed and high forehead, high and boney cheeks and pronounced browline, aquiline nose and weird nostrils and of course long and thick mustache and broad, firm jawline. The man himself.

I have to admit the Whtiby chapters have been my favourite bits so far. Reading the described typhoon that preluded his arrival in the Demeter was a mesmarizing experience. The Demeter itself, a short horror story on it's own. The imagery of man tied to wheel. Wicked.

And oh my god the terrifying scene of Lucy getting bled on the seat in the church yard.


There's a reason Dracula reigns high and mighty above all other famous vampires. Other vampire stories are like ghost hauntings or succubi. Creepy demons that haunt you in the night and drive you mad slowly.

Dracula is a centripetal force of darkness and evil. He is beyond powerful and so evil he effects the world around him. He commands the weather, the beast and the souls of man. He drinks the blood of children. He drinks blood excessively. He's extremely charismatic and polite. He is above you. He makes you feel small before him. He was a menace in both life and undeath. 

I'm baffled that such a magnificent character could be so...misinterpreted in pop culture.

I like the Bela lugosi version, but it's so...underwhelming compared to the grim and ghastly nature of the book.

The 92 Gary Oldman Dracula is a close adaptation. But they sexualized the story a bit a much and too much focus on romance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14b9mmq/dracula_the_king_of_all_vampire_stories_bram/,2023-06-16T22:20:27Z,41,182,books,Dracula,POST

12u89qd,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker","I took a long time to read this. Started it last October and only finished it this week.

I was surprised to find it was written ""documentary style"". I'm not sure I'm using that term correctly, but the entire book is composed of letters, telegrams, and journal entries by the various characters. It made the book feel a little more modern and fresh, even if some parts were not really written like an actual journal entry would be. The meticulous journal entries of some characters end up being pivotal to the plot, which makes things a bit more immersive.

The first few chapters are fantastic. I'd seen them depicted in various films before, but really enjoyed the journey to the castle, all the imagery, and Harker's stay there.

Back in London, the story slows down quite a bit. When Lucy is being slowly killed by Dracula, things get tedious as she is fed on night after night, and these supposedly smart men are repeatedly foiled by stupid little things like an unlatched window or clueless housekeeper.

I liked Arthur, Seward, and Goldaming well enough. Quincy Morris was walking stereotype -- an earnest Texan included so they'd have someone uninteresting to kill off. I'm ambivalent about Van Helsing. Something about him got on my nerves. But I also liked how he'd vacillate between being a bumbling professor type and a cold, ruthless vampire killer who wouldn't hesitate to decapitate a young woman's corpse to make sure she didn't resurrect as another vampire.

Mina was my favorite character by far. Smart as whip, humble, even-keeled, and the real hero of the story, in my opinion. Stoker can't decide whether she's strong and resolute in the face of adversity or whether it's time for her to faint again for plot purposes. Similarly, her psychological connection with Dracula is inconsistent and adjusted constantly for plot purposes. Dracula's intellect and cunning are also somewhat discarded toward the end of the story, unfortunately.

I did like the last few chapters in which the several parties closed in on Dracula's carriage for a pincer attack. Very cinematic!

I wish I had been attentive enough to better understand Renfield and his connection to Dracula. I'm still not clear on how they first became connected, and how it relates to Renfield's insanity. Renfield is a sort of anti-Dracula who ends up being a connection between sanity and insanity, and life and death. Dracula is too dangerous for these intellectuals to hang out with for long, and Renfield supplies some of the vampire ""logic"" that we wouldn't have gotten to see otherwise.

13yhcj9,"Bram Stoker - ""Dracula"" - should I push through?","First off sorry for my english and chaotic way of writing...  


Last year I started reading Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I couldn't get though the first page. The version of the book that I bought has around 500 translators notes (I'm not sure if that's the correct therm in english, but its the notes/descriptions of words/phrases that the reader might be unfamiliar with) and all of them are on the last page. So I have to read a sentence that contains 2 words (for example one word is a city/area/whatever located in southern Romania for example or whatever) that are listed way back on the book. So I have to shuffle to the back and go again to the page I'm on. Then on the very NEXT SENTENCE there is another 3-5-20 words that have explanations to them, and I have to go back again on the last page. Some of the words were kinda obvious/familiar with, but others not really. If I remember correctly there was an explanation for the british museum or something like that, that I wasn't really obliged to read but I did. The novel was written a long time ago so some things might be quite obvious while others not really.  


In general I'm really interested in the story and I've read that its a fantastic book, but this keeps me from reading it. How should I proceed? Should I ignore most/some of the billions of translators notes (read only the important ones that I think should be read) try another version/copy of the book that doesn't have that problem? Not finishing a book for a stupid reason like this seems... well stupid?  
   
Also why are the notes on some books (I have seen notes on the same page and have seen all the notes on the last page) on the last page? That seems extremely annoying to me. But I guess if you re-read the book it seems pretty logical for that.  
After writing this rant/complaint I find the post to be very ironic... because I'm doing the same thing that stops me reading the book. I write explanations that make it hard for the users to read the post, but whatever.  


Sorry again and thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13yhcj9/bram_stoker_dracula_should_i_push_through/,2023-06-02T16:27:39Z,22,0,books,Dracula,POST
ycx5qq,Van Helsing seems over credited in modern depictions of Stoker's Dracula.,"So I just recently finished the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. First of all it was great. I've seen many depictions of Dracula over the years, but in my opinion nothing measured up to the magic of this novel.

The one main thing I took note of was Van Helsing. In almost every single adaption of the Dracula story, Van Helsing is often painted as the archenemy of Dracula. He is frequently the one to hunt down, fight, and kill the immortal vampire.

Reading this novel I have to disagree. I don't know where exactly this all got lost in translation, but this was not really the case.

SPOILER ALERT

Okay so this may be a matter of opinion on my behalf and people are certainly welcome to disagree. Reading this book, outnof all of the main characters that had a reason for wanting the vampire dead, Van Helsing arguably had the least (if not any) reason to want the vampire dead. There is some implication that he owes one of the main characters a debt, but his involvement isn't really a personal matter. The main characters simply run to him for help in curing Lucy, and then he deduces that they are dealing with a vampire. 

Throughout the course of the novel, Van Helsing has little interaction with Dracula. Definitely not as much as other depictions have him doing. He does break into several of Draculas properties and sabotaged his crates of soil with holy objects, which is important, though not portrayed in modern media very much.

Now Van Helsing does have some pretty alpha moments. He shows to be extremely quick on his feet despite his old age, and he can come up with a solution in seconds. He proved himself to be valuable in killing the brides of Dracula, and also holds up well in the fight with the gypsies. 

Even in the climax of the novel, Dracula is slain by Jonathan Harker, who selfomly ever seems to get credit, and Quincey, who was perhaps my favorite character, but is almost never portrayed in anytjing. The latter is also crucial in the climax of the story, and gets the hero's exit he deserves.

Point is I feel Van Helsing, while a very well rounded character, gets a lot of credit in the Dracula universe for accomplishing something that others actually did. Now I do think he is awesome in his own right, as he had no immediate obligation to save Mina and help the others, but still acted as a wise, seasoned, and overall noble hero.

157vow9,Discussion on what are some ideas behind Bram Stoker's Dracula?,"I've just finished reading Dracula and found it a brilliant read. It is different for me because most books I read quite heavily focus on a central idea, where Dracula seems to be more up to interpretation since it's more about the story than idea.

I am curious as to what some of you see it as about. Personally for me it seems like good vs evil, but also seems to imply people should still be rational in the face of the unknown.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/157vow9/discussion_on_what_are_some_ideas_behind_bram/,2023-07-24T00:55:01Z,17,17,books,Dracula,POST

Perhaps I'm missing something but it seems like the movie has diverged from the book when it comes to the relationship between Mina and Dracula. AFAIK, Mina has no romantic attachment so ever for Dracula. She despises him as an ordinary person would do to such a monster.

16eekrk,Lucy’s Vampiric Transformation in Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula,"In the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker does anyone feel like Lucy Westerna’s diary entry from September 9 (below) suggests she was already displaying some vampiric-like qualities even though she had not yet been killed? It seems to me like this is an allusion to her being able to feel Arthur’s essence of blood inside her. This would mean that somehow Stoker was trying to portray vampirism as a pollution or a disease that becomes more prevalent until the person is killed. Any thoughts?

“Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/16eekrk/lucys_vampiric_transformation_in_bram_stokers/,2023-09-09T19:35:57Z,6,20,books,Dracula,POST

141ioi1,"Carmilla, The Vampyre & Dracula. The corner stones of modern day vampire mythos","I've been on a 19th century horror classics marathon since past May. I'm now five books in. I read Phantom of The Opera and Frankenstein (godtier book) and decided to go for Dracula next, but since I've read an abridged version of it before and knew the general synopsis of the story, I decided to do a short trilogy about vampires instead. Working my way through and finishing off with Dracula since it came out last. There was also Varney The Vampire but I heard it was really long and not that good, if you've read it, tell me how it is. Maybe I'll read it sometime in the distant future when I'm bored.

**FIRST**: I went and read Carmilla by Sheridan La Fanu. This book is THICC with gothic atmosphere. La Fanu paints a picteresque vista of the Styrian setting of our story. Thick european forests, gothic castles with moats, abandoned villages and ruined estates, hot teen lesbian vampires...this book is fucking HORNY! I was suprised by how steamy some of the scenes between Laura and Carmilla can get. It was also quite spooky at times. The descriptions of how the vampirism in this story works is kinda unusal compared to our more modern and established streotypes. It reminded me more of a ghost story. The mental image of watching from the bed as a blood soaked Carmilla floats out of a room while locked doors open and close before her is a pretty horrific scene to imagine. The ending to this story is pretty hardcore, gorey & magical. When you think about killing vampires you think maybe a stake through the heart or sunlight. >!Not corpses floating in tombs filled with blood, getting staked, beheaded, burned and the ashes spread on a river.!< Brutal. But for all it's merits, I found it also had some flaws. Some elements of the story remained unexplained and that makes it a bit unsatisfying. Although you can brush them off as vampire magic but getting details would have been more fulfiling. 7/10.

 Moving on...

**SECONDLY**: I read The Vampyre: A Tale by John Polidori. This is the oldest book on my list and some might consider it the basis of what vampire stories are built on. It was drafted in that fateful night in Geneeva, alongside Frankenstein in the presence of some of the greats of the romantic era. It was aight. The prose felt a bit too...verbose and difficult at times. Especially compared to Frankenstein it's contemporary which flowed by smoothly. And yet, it also felt very fast and poorly paced. I barely had any time to reflect on some events. It was a short story and did good for what it was set to do, but I still felt it could have used a few more pages. I give it this though >!I was not expecting Ruthven to triumph so fucking hard at the end. Aubery died, his lineage destroyed. The vampyre lived to kill another day. You don't often read about evil struting out victories.!< I loved the depiction of Lord Ruthven the Vampyre. A creature that exists solely to spread misery and misfortune as much as he possibly could. Something that would go out of it's way to defile beauty and virtue. And I loved how his influence worked more like a haunting on Aubrey, slowly driving him mad. And he's utterly supernatural, evil, and beyond defeat.
If I have to be honest though, my favourite parts of this book were the excerpts of letters regarding Lord Byron at the begining and the end of the book, especially the one about his residence in Greece. What a beautiful picture it described. Lord Byron was a fascinating character. I wrote down the poems of his that were mentioned in this book for later study. That is Childe Harold's pilgrimage & Giaour. Over all, I give the Vampyre 6.5/10.


And lastly...

**THIRD**: I'm reading Dracula. Now, it's unfair to compare this to the other two books since it's more than 200 pages longer than them and a proper novel, and also more recent compared to the other two, but I can already tell this is going to be a way better experience. I love how much time Stoker spends describing the natives and the rustic scenary and culture of eastern europe as we approach the castle. The abridged version I read doesn't compare to this in regards to establishing ambience and slowly getting introduced to the setting of the story. The text is smooth and easy to follow yet posh and eloquent. I love how oafish and dorky John Harker the paprika man seems to be and I love how seductive and meek Dracula starts off. I'm really eager to get to the meat of the story where the Brides are tormenting John and Dracula sets sails on the ship. And who can forget Carfax Abbey.


**TLDR**: Vampires have been horny fiction for hundereds of years. Lord Byron was a fucking chad. We all could use more paprika in our food. R.I.P.

yixejx,A timely review of Dracula,"'Tis the season, after all.

As much as I've been familiar with the omnipresent depictions of vampires around Halloween, only recently did I realize how little I actually knew about the original work. We all know the clichés to death now, but ironically enough, it was strangely refreshing to see them develop organically in Bram Stoker's novel. Some of the Count's traits are a bit silly, such as the need to be carried over water and to be invited into houses, but I guess they were part of his charm.

The epistolary format ended up not bothering me one bit. I have no idea if it was common for Victorian novels to be written that way, but it was a good method of sharing different POVs while keeping the story mostly coherent. The writing style was a bit jarring, however: coming from a guy who mostly reads science-fiction with cold and straightforward descriptions, all the flowery fluff was a bit much for me at times.

The most interesting part of the story for me was the beginning, when Harker visited Dracula's Castle and the mystery was slowly unfolding. I never thought that real estate would be the thing to set all the events of the novel in motion, but it made perfect sense in retrospect. It also helped me understand and rationalize why Count Dracula is often depicted with a weird accent but a great vocabulary: he has all the English books that he wants but no one to speak English with. The various intricacies of his Transylvanian castle were really fascinating, and I completely sank my teeth into the early chapters.

That being said, some of the characters were definitely less interesting. It took me a while to care at all about Lucy, and I think I would've completely disregarded her if she hadn't been Dracula's first victim. Both her and Mina are first depicted as basically the epitome of feminine purity, I get it, you don't have to remind me every single time. Again, I understand the basics of Victorian literature, but it only makes me glad that I live in a period where I have access to books and characters with more nuance.

On the other hand, I do appreciate that Dracula has such a clear and straightforward conflict between good and evil. Again, a nice departure from the bleak sci-fi that I'm well used to now, and it doesn't take a devout Christian to appreciate all the imagery that the novel offers. After many a depressing speculation on technology and society and where we're heading, something more sanguine was more than welcome. I am open to recommendations if you want to suggest novels similar to Dracula.

All in all, I'm glad I got to finish the novel in time for the most appropriate holiday. I was in dire need of new blood and this novel delivered. I got a neat little history lesson on Central Europe in bonus! I know it's a classic that many people have already read, but it's a classic for a reason.

Happy Halloween, everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yixejx/a_timely_review_of_dracula/,2022-11-01T03:22:17Z,11,24,books,Dracula,POST
17i5rdm,The Werewolf of Paris by Guy Endore (the Dracula of the lycanthropes),"Hi everybody! _x000D_  
_x000D_  
Today, I want to share with you an authentic cult book: “The Werewolf of Paris.” This is the quintessential lycanthropic bible. Most of the werewolf archetypes frequently seen in movies originate from this forgotten novel by Endore. This paperback, like almost any other gothic tale, begins with the discovery of an accursed manuscript, which tells us the tragic story of Bertrand Caillet._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Bertrand was the product of a non-consensual sexual encounter, and also he was born on December 25 overshadowing Christ’s birth. For this reason, he will be cursed with the werewolf metamorphosis. Bertrand is adopted by Aymar Galliez (who is the manuscript owner). Aymar realizes that Bertrand poses a threat to humans, and he attempts to control his killer instinct. Eventually, Aymar fails in his duty, and the beast breaks out of his home to move to Paris and torment humanity. In Paris, Bertrand takes advantage of the bloody context to act with impunity, because he arrives in Paris during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the establishment of the Paris commune of 1871. The characters’ most critical moments coincide with the most awful events of the war, the subsequent social revolt and the future counter-revolution. In fact, as we read the novel, we meet worse “wolves” than Bertrand in this Parisian society: bourgeois, aristocrats, the clergy, and even commoners._x000D_  
_x000D_  
I could not speak about this novel if I do not speak about its author, Guy Endore (1900-1970) an American writer, screenwriter of Hollywood movies, and activist. He lived his childhood between New York and Vienna, and when he reached adulthood, he moved to Hollywood to write movie scripts. Endore could be ranked among the great American horror writers, alongside Washington Irving, Edgar A. Poe, Ambrose Bierce, R.W. Chambers, H.P. Lovecraft, Anne Rice, Stephen King and Joe Hill. However, his novel, The Werewolf of Paris, never received a successful movie adaptation that would have brought him global recognition. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
Critics and specialists in literature, translation, and demonology, such as Brian Stableford or Jacques Finné, have said that Endore’s opus magnum, “The Werewolf of Paris”, is for the lycanthropes myth what Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” is for the vampire’s myth. The lycanthrope and the vampire, together with Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein”, make up a trilogy of dream chimeras that have fascinated, then as now, the human collective unconscious.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17i5rdm/the_werewolf_of_paris_by_guy_endore_the_dracula/,2023-10-28T04:14:20Z,3,15,books,Dracula,POST
17qdx2a,Dracula the Un-Dead by Dacre Stoker & Ian Holt is a mediocre book,"Words cannot describe how awful this book is, but I'll give it a try. The authors basically say that everything in Bram Stoker's Dracula is wrong. Vampires don't fear crosses. They're not villainous. Dracula wasn't a villain, he was a good guy. Dracula didn't die as outlined in Bram Stoker's novel but somehow survived turning into dust, only to die a horribly-written and ridiculous death in Dracula the Un-dead. Mina Harker didn't hate Dracula, she loves him and had an affair with him back when they were trying to hunt him in Bram Stoker's novel?! Are you f\*\*\*\*\*\* kidding me?!_x000D_  
_x000D_  
To boot, the authors make Bram Stoker a character in this novel, and they kill him! It really seems like Dacre hated his distant relative and was trying to slander his masterpiece. The fight scenes are also hilariously bad, and mostly consist of people throwing other people across rooms over and over again. Where Bram's masterpiece is foreboding and terrifying, this book is never once even remotely scary. It fails fundamentally to even remotely resemble Bram Stoker's Dracula._x000D_  
_x000D_  
The writing also tried to be somewhat elegant and sometimes used words from the early twentieth century, but then slipped horribly past the halfway point, as if the authors stopped trying. Once they referred to a man riding in the front of a horse-drawn carriage as ""riding shotgun"". Early in the novel there are also lots of historical references to buildings and events, making the book feel well-researched, but later in the book these completely disappear in favour of terrible writing right out of a B-movie script, further proving the authors gave up past the halfway point of the book._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Disgraceful, ridiculous, horribly written, and above all insulting to Bram Stoker, his masterpiece, and vampire mythology in general, Dracula the Un-dead may just be the worst book ever written._x000D_

I loved the beginning with Jonathan in the castle and I enjoyed it up until the part where Lucy dies but then it went downhill for me. Van Helsing's dialog is very hard to read and when it gets to the part where they're trying to catch Dracula before he gets back home I found it unbearable.

181w0cy,An interpretation of Dracula from the perspective of someone who is confused on what the novel was trying to say 👍,"So, I’ve just recently read *Dracula* and am a bit confused on what Stoker was trying to say. The main reason being I feel like whenever I came up with an interpretation, there’s something in the text that would contradict it (like saying Dracula was a representation of new ideas that the British detested at the time… except for the fact that Van Helsing and Co. also displayed traits of those those ideas as well). So, naturally, I just had to go on Reddit to post my interpretation and to obtain some other opinions:

I knew a big idea of the novel was good vs evil (even more specifically, purity vs. sin). However, I couldn’t exactly tell *what* he was saying was evil and what was good. At one point, like I said earlier, I felt Stoker was saying Dracula was a representation of the ideas that the British were rejecting at the time (sexuality, immigration, change in general), whilst also being a representation of the conservative British. I felt like he was basically saying the act of vampirism was a metaphor to what the conservative thought they’d “turn into” if they accepted these ideas (Lucy, containing a view of traditional marriage and home life, turns into a vampire (or gives into these new ideas) and dies. Then there’s Mina, who’s described as a “new woman”, also gets bitten, but survives). I thought the good guys going after Dracula was perhaps representation of trying to get rid of the stigma that these ideas were bad. However, when Mina got bit, she kept saying she was “unclean”. And when J. Harker and Van Helsing were being tempted by Dracula’s brides, they felt guilt / were disgusted when they snapped out of it (and the fact choice words by Stoker also constantly portrayed a repulsed feeling of the whole situation in general). That’s when I got confused. And if Dracula was supposed to represent those ideas, what were the good guys supposed to represent since, again, they already exhibited traits of rejecting the status quo (independence when it comes to Mina, and vulnerability with our male cast, not to mention the usage of modern tech)? The only difference is that these traits weren’t portrayed in a shameful or in a reprehensible light. So maybe they were also supposed to represent these new ideas, but in the view of the liberal British?

I really don’t know. At some point, I also thought it could be a satire of British society and how ridiculous it was (in Stoker’s view). Again, in this view, Dracula would be the representation of these new ideas, minus also being the representation of the conservative British. This could explain the repulsion when it came to being bitten, or of Dracula himself (or vampirism in general). Although, I don’t know how the good guys being “enlightened” would fit into this view. Perhaps irony?

Anyways, that’s kind of what I got from reading Dracula, though I’m not entirely sure how accurate it would be. That’s where the discussion part of this post would come in. What are y’all’s opinion on the novel and it’s theme(s)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/181w0cy/an_interpretation_of_dracula_from_the_perspective/,2023-11-23T07:46:04Z,27,0,books,Dracula,POST

I think the over popularity of the character of Dracula has really made the boom a lot less enjoyable than it was when it was originally written, the whole mystery of the beginning of the book about who Dracula is and the journey of the man writing isn’t very suspenseful simply because of the fact that we know so much about Dracula as a character.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ikb8qc/dracula_is_pretty_underwhelming/,2020-09-01T01:39:41Z,32,20,books,Dracula,POST

So what is going on there? Is this a regular illness that Dracula's arrival exacerbates? Or is his malign influence somehow reaching Whitby way ahead of him? There is some discussion of Renfield's increasing 'zoophagus' madness in the same few chapters, which would indicate so. But really?

vca4w9,Did Dracula strike anyone else as progressive (for the time)?,"Lucy is able to choose who she loves instead of marrying for money. The suitors she doesn’t choose respect her decision and are even friends afterward. There aren’t any arguments over who deserved her more (as far as I’ve read; I’m on chapter 18 now)

Mina spends time with men who aren’t her husband and she isn’t seen improper for doing so. Van Helsing and Co. don’t try to shield her from the truth about what happened to Lucy in order to protect her “gentle woman spirit” as I’ve seen in other books. 

It also has friendships between men where they’re compassionate and cry, which I’m not used to seeing in literature, classic or not. 

Did it strike anyone else or am I just being overly analytical?

Edit: Just finished the book. Got very anti-foreigner in the second half; I definitely jumped the gun with this.

5y7inh,Just finished Dracula by Bram Stoker!,"Recently I was looking for something to read while waiting for another book to arrive and while I was going through the old books in our library, I´ve come across really old version of Dracula (about 50 years old). I was avoiding it was a few years because I´m not really a vampire fan but I gave it a shot and I´m so surprised!

It is almost completely different than whole pop-culture Dracula and vampires things we know. I did not expect this at all! [well, for starters, vampires don´t burn at sun. No problem for them to be at sun or whatsoever, they just loose their special powers at day. Dracula can change not only into bat but also into mist or rat or a dog (or what he wants) and have powers over storm and snow and wind and wolves. There is a blood in vampire´s vains. Transformation into vampire is not because of some bites.. you have to drink HIS blood. He has a beard (!) and gets younger by drinking the blood. And is like super clever.. etc. etc. Some things are probably in other shows or older films as well, but I´ve never seen Dracula with a *beard*, lol.](#spoiler) 

It was really great read and one would never say that it was written more than century ago. I really recommened it for anyone interested or someone who hesitates if he should read it.

It just.. whole popculture is different than this book of Dracula. But if I´m not mistaken, it is probably because his of portration in famous Vampire Nosferatu movie by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Then it all started and went into popculture like that depiction. 

And from what I remember, Dracula movies are pretty close to book, but still do differ from this in some ways.

Anyhow, my point was about how different whole Dracula is from how he is written.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5y7inh/just_finished_dracula_by_bram_stoker/,2017-03-08T12:01:53Z,56,65,books,Dracula,POST
g1t1db,Dracula - Bram Stoker,"After two unsuccessful attempts in recent years, one in the original English version, the other in its French translation, I have finally managed to finish this classic of fantasy literature, Bram Stoker's famous **Dracula**. I had chosen the original version in order to benefit fully from the text of the British author.

If I hadn't managed to finish it the first two times, it was because after some captivating first chapters, which plunges us into the strange then terrifying atmosphere of Dracula's castle in Transylvania, the remaining chapters are slower, less gripping. I had the same feeling again this time, but I held on to go all the way to the end.

>!As I said, the first part takes place in Transylvania, where the young English lawyer Jonathan Harker has been invited by the mysterious Count Dracula in his isolated castle to finalize the purchase of a house in England. The young Englishman discovers a strange place, out of time, and an eccentric and disturbing Count Dracula.!<

>!The second part deals with the fate of Lucy Westenra, the childhood friend of Jonathan's fiancée, Mina Murray, who is being courted by three different men: psychiatrist John Seward, American Quincey Morris, and the aristocrat Arthur Holmwood, whose proposal she accepts.!<

>!The third part tells the story of the struggle between Dracula, now in England, and the group formed by Jonathan, Mina and Lucy's friends, led by the Dutch professor Van Helsing.!<

The first part, as I have said, is dark and icy, and the Victorian horror atmosphere is evident. The rest of the book is less successful, for the chapters follow one another, sometimes repetitive, often boring, and the end seemed to me to come abruptly after the rather slow rhythm of the previous chapters.

So we're dealing with a classic of fantasy literature, a cult book that gave rise to the still-living myth (no pun intended) of the vampire Dracula, but it's also a book that hasn't necessarily aged very well. Some classics are timeless, both in narrative and style; this is not, in my opinion, the case with this one, beyond its undeniable place in the history of fantasy literature.

eoeufo,Bram Stoker's Dracula is great (the first part that is),"Hello all, 

It's currently 4.30 am, and I am in bed frankly wishing the Count himself would come and put me to sleep, but  I have something to say about Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.

The first part of Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula is qenuinely great. When Jonathan Harker is trying to survive in Dracula's castle, I was filled with dread and excitement. The whole first section is filled with interesting details that bring this dark castle to life, and is qenuinely great. The reader wants Jonathan to escape, and the pages turn quickly one after another.

But then something changes. After the book switches its POV from Jonathan to his girlfriend Mina, the book slows down dramatically. The book becomes seemingly stuck in time as Mina worries about his husband's fate and cares for her friend Lucy, who has mysteriously turned ill.

The problem is, that these characters aren't that interesting. This really hurts the book after the POV changes from Jonathan to Mina. I wasn't really worried about Mina or Lucy, but I was worried about the fate of Jonathan, because I spent the first part of the novel with him in a much more interesting milieu. But its a long way back to Jonathan, as Lucy falls ill over and over again dragging the narrative to a hault.

This sudden shift in narrative really hurts the book, and makes it less likely for me to pick up the book anytime soon, which is a shame, because it has some really good and exciting parts.

After all this, I still remember the book fondly. As I said the first part of the book is great, and the sea captains journal still brings shivers down my back.

z97vq1,"In the mountains of Transylvania: Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"".","Before I even was aware of Stoker's famed novel, my only conception of Dracula was the 30s film featuring Bela Lugosi and a myriad of pop culture references. My own discovery of the novel would come much later and eventually would come to read the book itself when I had checked it out at one time (and now I finally have my own copy which I've just finished!).

Stoker's story, with the setting being in Romania in the beginning and end to England in the middle section, about several individuals pitted against the vampire Count Dracula is a spectacular piece of horror fiction. The way it is written is something that is quite interesting and is something I've seen before.

The story is told via by the main protagonists through diary entries, mail correspondence and also including various clippings as well. And in the writing Stoker mixes in some bizarre and conventionally polite behaviors as well as religious and vague sexual themes.

The novel, since its publication in 1897, has left a huge mark in both literature and pop culture. The book has been adapted into film multiple times and there are countless references in television as well. Plus there are also many writers who created their own spin on the novel and of the vampire lore as well, both good and bad.

q6hpc1,What is the most realistic movie version of Dracula?,"I've read many reviews and just finished watching Coppula's version of Dracula. Gary Oldman was great as always, but frankly it seems like everyone making these movies are missing the point. Sure, there is a lot of sexual innuendo that is fun to build on, but if you've read the books you know exactly why I'm complaining. 

The characters aren't true, and honestly who has ever done Mina justice? The original books have their own version of male/female stereotypes, especially considering the 'times', yet every movie I've seen seems way more misogynistic than the book itself.

iz7rai,"Currently reading ""Dracula.""","I actually tried reading it before, but I only made it halfway through. Now though, I'm enjoying it a lot more. Probably because it was written for an adult audience, not tweens. :p

djihzp,Dracula is just such a fun read,"Dracula really stands the test of time in my opinion. It’s so well written, there’s a Shakespearean quality to the language, and the pace of the story is perfect. It’s a treat to read, I highly recommend it. I avoided it because I’ve always found Vampires so corny (Twilight, bleghhhh) but this book really makes you scared of, yet care for a demonic creature that wants to die and can’t. The vampire lore is fascinating of course, but the book is really about the relationships of the people that unite to stop Dracula, and they’re just such...good people. Quincey, the rugged American with his Winchester rifle, Seward, the psychiatrist who cares deeply about his patients, Harker, a brave and passionate badass, Mina, intelligent and organized, Godalming, a generous and connected statesman, and of course Van Helsing, who’s a bit nutty because he knows too much...such a fun book!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/djihzp/dracula_is_just_such_a_fun_read/,2019-10-18T04:46:25Z,28,77,books,Dracula,POST
43owab,"[Discussion] Dracula, by Bram Stoker","So I recently read the progenitor to the modern vampire tale, and found it interesting. I'm always glad to knock a classic off my list (this counts, yeah?), and I love a good horror romp. Just to start the discussion off, here are some of my impressions. Given, it's been a couple of weeks since I finished:

I impressed with the genuine chills the book gave me. Even after all the cliches and rip-offs, some elements still manages to take me off guard. For example, the Count kidnapping children to feed his thralls or what have you. That's not something you see in the parodies and it was genuinely disturbing. Also, this idea of an insidious horror gradually sucking the life out of you, night after night with no one, not even you the wiser (no on ever suspects the bat!). I'm sure that's what made the vampire such a horrific concept and a classic monster today.

Having said that, I found Bram's prose extremely difficult to get through, particularly in matters of characterization. Everyone was always weeping or collapsing it seemed, to the point that such extremities of emotion seemed ridiculous. Once or twice I understand, but consistently and at different points, it becomes less believable. I'll grant you that they were under unnaturally stressful circumstances; but real people don't act that way. 

As well, there was a lot of what I call emotional exposition-people talking about how they feel as opposed to showing us. This is repeated over and over again, and is probably the main fault of his prose. I want to be shown how people feel, in their body language or a quick phrase. Not a dissertation. And to use this to segway into his characters, I found them lacking.

There were certain aspects that differentiated the characters, but all in all they were basically the same. All of them were basically good, kind, and noble. I had little sense of establishment between them all. Dr. Seward was perhaps the best established, and probably my favorite character. My own impression of him was that he was more clinical than the rest, more distant, and therefore, more capable considering what they were facing. But like I said, this is just my own biased opinion of the character. 

All in all, I'm glad to have read it. It's staple of the horror genre, and the origin of the modern form of one of the most famous and prolific monsters to date. The story and horror elements were fair to good, but how the story was often conveyed left much to be desired. But please, let me know what you think, and or, what I got wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/43owab/discussion_dracula_by_bram_stoker/,2016-02-01T15:24:32Z,43,57,books,Dracula,POST
q9eww4,Dracula by Bram Stoker is the most misogynistic book i have read thus far.,"Since the start of the pandemic and the destruction of regular television I have started reading again.  I decided to read the classics and have been choosing at random books to read from various top 100 lists on the internet.  Since 2020 i have read:

Albert Camus
- [ ] The Plague
- [ ] The Stranger

Dostoevsky 
- [ ] Crime and Punishment
- [ ] The Idiot
- [ ] Brothers Karamosov

Tolstoy
- [ ] Anna Karenina
- [ ] War and Peace

Stendhal 
- [ ] The Red and the Black

Mary Shelly
- [ ] Frankenstein

Voltaire 
- [ ] Candide

George Orwell
- [ ] 1984

Harper Lee
- [ ] To Kill a Mockingbird

Gabriel Garcia Marquez
- [ ] 100 years of Solitude

Ralph Ellison
- [ ] The Invisible Man

Aldous Huxley
- [ ] Brave New World

Jack London
- [ ] Call of the Wild

Bram Stoker
- [ ] Dracula

Truman Capote
- [ ] In Cold Blood

I have enjoyed most books on this list, save for one.  Dracula, though written well after books like Anna Karenina or The Red and the Black, seems like it was written by a more basic and primitive human.  From quotes like

 “I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears”

or

“we want all her great brain which is trained like man’s brain”

And there is even a whole bit about killing your wife before another man can get to her and how “noble” it is.  Its like some incels fan-fic about how women are completely powerless in the arms of a “foreign” man and incapable or thinking or acting for themselves.  They seem to be nothing but the prize for the men in the book as a reward for their efforts in banding together to kill off a dangerous foreigner.  

Maybe i am reading it all wrong but compared to all the other books on my list this one felt so simplistic and skewed to one view point that i feel like it should never belong on any top 100 lists of the greatest books of all time.  Is it purely because it outlined the modern view of vampires that it is so well regarded?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q9eww4/dracula_by_bram_stoker_is_the_most_misogynistic/,2021-10-16T16:05:45Z,41,0,books,Dracula,POST
xsvk7x,What do you think of the idea of Dracula (1897) as an allegory for infectious diseases?,"I have always liked this idea, which has been proposed multiple times. That the concerns about the spread of diseases from foreign lands, take the form of the eponymous Count.

The big infectious killers at the times of Dracula were smallpox, and tuberculosis as well as yellow fever.

Plague had been banished from Britain since the 18th century, but there was always a concern it could return.

odc5ou,Dracula as metaphor for the end of feudalism,"I have come up with an analysis of the book which I feel might be interesting.

One of the central themes of the novel, in my opinion, is the battle between modernity and antiquity. I believe this is a recurring theme in a lot of art and literature in the Victorian era. Because in the 19th century, Western Europe was going so far ahead of everyone else in the world with rapid technological advancements. Due to this rabid industrialisation and the ever-expanding British Empire, there was a feeling of invincibility and superiority in the global level.

The art of the 19th century defied this notion, and asked the question, ""are we truly invincible? Is science and machinery everything? What if we forgot about the value of the metaphysical?"" or something like that. As a result, artists would romanticise the past, the time when religion and superstition held sway on the Europeans. The time when peasants worked for warlords. The time when the weapon against disease and tragedy was not science, but faith. As Harker states:

>It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.

In my opinion, Count Dracula is a walking artifact of this past. The Count boasts of how he and his race of Draculas ruled over the land with an iron fist, and how his subjects obeyed his every command. Although that world of his is long gone, his hypnotic powers and refusal to die enable him to still bring a remnant of that past, when he had so much power and control. And now, Dracula wants to bring that old era with him to ""modern"" England.

>The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”

This is why, in my opinion, the characters who vanquish him are middle class intellectuals. Van Helsing, Seward, Harker, Mina, and Quincey are all products of the new enlightened age. It's only Lord Godalming, the landed gentleman, who is in need of instruction (although he does provide them with horses and dogs).

I think it can be seen as the end of the time of feudal dictatorships and the rise of the enlightened middle class. Although the protagonists start out rather naive and overconfident, they quickly learn that they need to adapt to a new enemy - the supernatural. They have to use their brains and teamwork to fight Dracula. Dracula might rely on minions, but the protagonists work as a team, and in the end, when they are able to learn the key to dealing with the vampire, they win.

So maybe this is one lesson from the story. The new, enlightened era of modernity, democracy, and science provides advantages, but it must never overlook the past, and learning about the past is always essential.

And I think this is also why so many people take an invasion literature route of analysis to the novel. Because in the 19th century, Western Europe saw itself as much more advanced than any other part of the world. They thought every other country was behind and a backwater. In this sense, Dracula is also an Orientalist tale.

I wonder if this is a common analysis people have of the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/odc5ou/dracula_as_metaphor_for_the_end_of_feudalism/,2021-07-04T03:15:29Z,18,12,books,Dracula,POST
29g92f,"Finally got around to reading Bram Stoker's ""Dracula""...","Spoilers, I guess.

So far, I hate it. Van Helsing is strange to me, calling everyone ""friend _____"" and the fact that he waits so long to share information drives me crazy. He also takes a whole page to get to his point.

I also dislike that everyone's lack of communication leads to unfortunate events, such as when Mina was starting to appear pale and worn out. These people have read everyone's diaries, they saw what Lucy went through, but only until they see Dracula in the act, do they realize ""d'oh, it wasn't that she was worried, she was being drained of blood!"" These are supposed to be brilliant men, yet they couldn't see that. 

Everyone's also too nice and that bugs me as well. They are so quick to understand and accept things. 

The only thing I do like is the character Dracula himself and the description of the vampires, especially in the beginning when Harker sees Dracula sleeping and his head turns towards Harker. He's hardly in this, though, and it seems as if he's being defeated so easily (I have fifty pages left, and I'm dying).

I'm just disappointed because I heard how great it is, but I find myself reacting like how I react when I watch a scary movie (""no, don't go in there!"" ""You're so dumb!"").

n38wir,"Opium and Absinthe, and Dracula","Do you ever read a book where another book from a different  time period or genre is referenced or part of the plot, and are inspired to read it? For example I recently finished a book called Opium and Absinthe by Lydia Kang. It’s a murder mystery set in NYC at the turn of the nineteenth century and Stoker’s Dracula was referenced heavily as a plot device as it had just come out at the time. Opium and Absinth was a very enjoyable read unique in it’s medical history and realism (the author is an internal medicine physician). The passages from Dracula were intriguing so I started listening to that next on Audible and it is amazing! I always thought it would be stodgy or hokey given how overdone vampires have been since, but wow it is full of true horror and dread! 

It had a much more modern tone than I was expecting, especially in the ‘found diary’ format giving the female characters almost as much of a voice as the males. While ultimately the messaging reinforces traditional female roles of chastity and subservience to men, it does flirt with progressive feminist ideas which seem ahead of it's time but maybe that was the time those ideas were starting to become more acceptable. Anyways, just wanted to splooge about these two books and delightful it was to discover Dracula after reading a book written over 100 years later. What other books not written in the same period or genre but somehow connected have been fun to read back -to-back?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/n38wir/opium_and_absinthe_and_dracula/,2021-05-02T15:37:05Z,7,27,books,Dracula,POST

tczku6,"Dr Van Helsing from Dracula makes me uncharacteristically, unjustifiably angry and annoyed","I don’t really know what it is about him. Ok, thats kinda a lie, I know exactly what it is about him; he’s arrogant. I feel like if I had a conversation with him, he’d look down on me. He’s just pretentious. Even his syntax puts me off; it’s so? Unnecessarily complex? And over the top? I can’t tell if it’s to highlight that hes smart OR if it’s to show that he’s a foreigner; that would fit with the theme of xenophobia. Like, okay, I get it. But just because you have level 5 sentence structure doesn’t stop you from being annoying. He just speaks so metaphorically and it puts me off.

The thing is though, I’ve started questions if this is a pride thing; I literally had to read one of the first sentences he uttered like 5 times, at 0.25 speed, just to have *some degree* of understanding. 

I don’t know but I feel like if I could slap a character in this book it would be him. The most annoying part is that he’s a “good” character so I know he’s not going to get slapped. 

Emphasis on slap tho; I don’t want to punch him, I want to employ the most passive aggressive, petty, self indulgent form of violent onto him. Slapping has minimal and short lived physical pain in the person getting slapped and the sound from slapping is the most satisfying sound out of all the sounds of violence. It’s like, sharp and clean. Unlike the dull and flat sound of, say, punching someone. So, yea, I’d want to slap him for full self satisfaction because I want to. (Yes my understanding slaps and violence in general is limited to film, but film is at least loosely based on real life so I will continue to use it the basis of the slapping argument)

To be fair, Dracula isn’t that bad of a character, imo. He isn’t shown much so you can’t really hate him much. Plus, what are you going to hate him for, being sexually active? Idk I feel like dracula would be kind of chill. Like, he’s totally go to a pride parade if he lived in this time. Although I do think there was a purpose in not showing much of him; I wrote a review on dracula for school going over this, I might post it

Anyways, yes. A definite shitpost. But I had to get my thoughts out because I can’t see any hate towards this guy and it makes me angry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tczku6/dr_van_helsing_from_dracula_makes_me/,2022-03-13T05:06:48Z,12,0,books,Dracula,POST

Frankestein and Dracula were almost the first one i've read. And, oh boy, they are fabulous. The story, the characters, the ambience, EVERYTHING!

*Dracula* by *Bram Stoker* is a horror story about a big castle with a vampire living in it, called ""Count Dracula"". One day, the pain protagonist ""Jonathan Harker"" went to visit this castle, not knowing that the man that lives in there has a thirst for blood.

gn0vhx,Finished Stoker's Dracula Finally,"\- After being on a tear of reading a book a week, I encountered Stoker's Dracula and it broke that streak. I had just finished Shelley's Frankenstein, and it made sense. Comparitively, I was surprised. This book was much more a bit of a slog, but not necessarily in a bad way. It definitely took its time building up the story, the Dracula lore, the character's themselves, and the London setting. I appreciated that greatly, as it helped me get immersed even when I could only read the book in small doses. I think the story taking place in the format of letters and journal entries broke up the momentum more than I would have liked at times, but it is neat that I have heard others point out it is like a ""found footage"" film of today.

\- What I really found quaint was the relationships between the characters themselves, and therein lies the book's true power. Everyone treats each other so friggin' endearingly, I thought wouldn't that be so, I don't know, rad? if people held each other in such esteem in today's world? You become so engaged with these characters, that it really hits home when something awful happens to them. You feel Lucy's fate depressing through the lenses of the many men who love her. Johnathan's events at the castle are made all the more horrific by the constant worry of his wife. And, I think what happens to Mina, is the first time in a long time I actually felt enraged at a book. It felt like a rape. And it is made worse because of how Stoker shows how beloved she is through the sweet interactions she has with the other characters. Really well done.

\- As with Frankenstein, Dracula is naturally steeped with both science and religion. The cultures and attitudes of Gothic London is never more felt than here. It is interesting to really get a glimpse of the attitudes towards women as well. We live in distant time periods, and the chivalrous natures of the men of this story were likely well recieved by the initial audiences that read Stoker. Women hold power in their beauty, loyalty, faithfulness, tenderness and obedience. Both Lucy and Mina rejoice in their hearts of the bravery of all the male characters. Yet to me, is there one greater or braver than Mina herself? Mina not only ""rescues"" Lucy barefoot in the middle of the night from Dracula, she selflessly cares for all souls heavily throughout, gets infected by the Count, makes everyone promise to KILL HER if she turns, and then powerfully holds off the curse of the motherfucking VAMPIRE. What the fuck, Mina rules. But  yet, Van Helsing will command her to do something and she obediantly obliges. Not complaining, just interesting to see the attitudes of the times.

\-Lastly, as scary as the Count is, and really every vampire, I find it so silly the natural laws they live by. When the Count is in his Final Form, he is overpowered as hell. Can vanish, become mist, turn into bats or dogs, commands wolves, can scale towers, strength of like 100 men (RIP Renfield), immortal... but when he is between sunrise and sunset, he blows. The first half of the book through his liasons with Mina, I percieved him as a horrific, unstoppable brute. He is a fiend. Through the chase sequences he is like a baby who needs gypsies to defend him in the climactic scene.

\-Overall, well done. I am glad I have read it after so many years ignoring it.  Madame Mina rocks. Renfield didn't deserve it ( a whole other rant could be made on how the book portrays mental illness). Treat each other well, and hold one another dear. Comment with your thoughts!

g4nprz,Just stayed up til 2:30AM to finish Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Man what a spine tingling and page turning book. I recently got back into reading over the quarantine and after having read wind in the willows and Steinbeck's Travels with Charley I decided I needed a good horror book. I thought, what better horror book to start into than what is known as the greatest of all. 

I just loved the style that the book takes with all the diary entries and quirky characters the good vs evil and such vivid descriptions and philosophy. I will be thinking about this all night now, not sure how to go to bed after such an epic story. 

I have a couple questions, one is about Ravenfield, why is it that ravenfield was able to speak with such dignity, was it because he was under the influence of the count, or was it because he was never mentally unstable? 

Second, with Mina, was her mark on her forehead the sign that she was becoming a vampire, or was it that she had been marked by God? And was she turning into a vampire before the count dies or was she just getting weaker as he was going to turn her into a vampire? 

I have more questions, but I will let some people answer these two first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g4nprz/just_stayed_up_til_230am_to_finish_bram_stokers/,2020-04-20T06:35:56Z,10,113,books,Dracula,POST

fflprx,(Spoilers) Just finished Bram Stoker's Dracula...Questions!,"I see that this book is actually discussed pretty often on Reddit which is pretty cool, and a lot of people had the same thoughts as myself: Those being that the first third of the book at the castle is the best, and it slows down at parts.

That being said, I really enjoyed the book and the London chapters. I think I was more disappointed with the quick death of Dracula than anything at the end, but I understand it.

I guess as I finish the book, I'm left with a few questions and hoping Reddit can shine some light.

1. My main question...Do we ever find out why Dracula lets Jonathan return to London and does not turn him to Un-dead? I know London had that terrible Brain Fever upon his return but it seemed mostly from shock. I feel like I must have missed something because why did Dracula let Harker carry on his life as normal?

2. Was there an implied lesbian relationship between Mina and her best friend Lucy or was that just the style of the times? I thought especially in their initial diaries to each other, their language felt much more romantic than just platonic, but I admit that I can see that being a function of the era.

3. Was this novel the ""Lord of the Rings/Hobbit"" of Vampire/Dracula stories going forward? What I mean by that is that did Stoker borrow from common Vampire tropes (garlic, staking the heart, turning into bats, blood sucking at the neck, Transylvania, etc), or did Bram Stoker create these tropes that Dracula/Vampire films/stories/media have used going forward?

Would love any info and discussion on this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fflprx/spoilers_just_finished_bram_stokers/,2020-03-09T00:00:28Z,7,16,books,Dracula,POST

I recently finished Bram's Dracula, and (like most) Loved the first parts, was quite fed up with the middle and underwhelmed by the ending. I slogged through, and was happy I finished.

They are TRUE to the original characters. Everyone you know is there (in some fashion). Then take everything you hated about the book, and get rid of it (Ok Except Lucy, but no spoilers here).  They did an AMAZING job diverting from Bram's version, flipping certain plots on their head, and actually giving it an ending I believe the story deserved.

fht91i,Just finished Frankenstein and Dracula back to back and I must discuss!(spoilers),"Had a post a few days ago Dracula. Really enjoyed the book and was excited to read it for a while. Loved the horror elements, the history, and seeing the birth of the modern day vampire tropes.

I didn’t have as high expectations for Frankenstein, but still wanted to read it since I knew it was another classic and never knew the full story. Wow- I was completely blown away. 

Dracula was a wonderful horror novel, but Frankenstein was just an incredible, depressing novel that constantly provoked philosophical dread. Of course I heard the story of Frankenstein and knew the age old adage “wisdom is knowing Frankenstein IS the monster”, but the book is so much more complex than those basic themes that it is known for. 

I love that you are constantly on a roller coaster of pity and frustration for both Frankenstein, and his monster. I pitied Frankenstein at times, and hated his decisions at others. I pitied the monster for being outcast, but still hated that he resorted to killing innocents to make up for it. 

And the entire time I’m left wondering: was Frankenstein *really* wrong? In many ways he was, for creating a child and then abandoning it and refusing to give it a chance. But when his monster showed clearly that it was capable of death and vengeance, it *killed* his brother, was Frankenstein wrong to refuse to create another? He was right, what if they didn’t get along and the female monster was violent and didn’t share his desire for peace? 

The whole time I just wanted him to create the second monster and go on with his life, but his logic actually made sense, and then seemed supported when the monster did go on a killing spree of innocents just for revenge.

What was interesting too is that in common media, the creation itself of Frankenstein’s monster is mentioned like it’s a big part of the novel, but the details of it really barely encompass a few pages. 

I really can’t stop thinking about this book. Pure excellence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fht91i/just_finished_frankenstein_and_dracula_back_to/,2020-03-13T03:24:27Z,17,32,books,Dracula,POST

I really enjoy Dracula as a book, but it always seems to come up as a recommended ""Gothic Horror"" or ""Victorian Horror"" title, but it's not very scary, or even suspenseful. Was is intended to be scary when it was written? 

Are there good examples of scary books from around the same time? Is it even possible for a book written that long ago to be scary now? I guess I feel like there are enough cultural (and linguistic?) differences that it would be hard to put yourself in the same situation the characters are in.

jenyzf,Bram Stokers Dracula and Lovecrafts Mountain Of Madness.,"Made another thread comparing King but wanted to make another thread comparing two great architects however one of them is just adjectives and no real story/character development (Lovecraft).

In Both cases we have intellectuals onboard, we have Van Hellsing and we have some Paleontologist in Mountains Of Madness. Can Hellsing takes a few chapters and Bram Stoker shows how the investigation is done in understanding the supernatural entity compared to Lovecraft who writes about the explorer walking right into enemy territory and making things up out of the blue (targetting my favorite book Mountains of Madness) like wtf? And thats not the first time he does that, his characters seem to have this knack of discovering things happening because of the Elder gods....oh my shoe laces are untied yea well thats just Cthulu alright. No sit down, no exploration on the thoughts of the characters, just conclusions made....it just doesnt seem right. 

Theres no character development, theres no ahowing how any investigations are done, ifs just a bunch of word diarreab on paper slammed into a 150 page book and sold for 10bucks.

mw79eg,'Carmilla' by Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu written originally in 1871 pre-dates the more well-known 'Dracula' by 26 years,"What are the reason(s) that Carmilla is not as famous or well-known as Dracula?

Carmilla is thought to be the original vampire fiction novel and although I've never read Carmilla myself, reading the Wiki summary reveals that Bram Stoker stole a lot of ideas from Carmilla. For example, both stories take place in Styria, Austria at some point. Both stories have a ""Van Helsing"" character. Among other similarities. 

Furthermore, it was revealed that Bram Stoker never even visited Romania or Hungary and basically got all his folklore knowledge from reading newspapers and magazines of the day.

Carmilla was the more ""authentic"" and the original vampire fiction piece of literature. So, how come Carmilla never achieved the fame of Dracula?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mw79eg/carmilla_by_irish_author_sheridan_le_fanu_written/,2021-04-22T15:27:31Z,20,67,books,Dracula,POST

40d19k,Dracula: An Appreciation,"*Dracula* automatically made my list of the best books I read in 2015, as it does every year during which I read it again. It is one of my favorite books.

The story has been with me nearly all my life. The children's adaptation by Stephanie Spinner went home with me from the library countless times during my early elementary school days. John Badham's 1979 film, starring Frank Langella, was nearly too much for me to watch when I first saw it at age seven—nearly, but not quite: usually while wearing my 99-cent plastic glow-in-the-dark fangs, I spent untold hours making flip-books of the scene wherein Mina, with her glowing red demon eyes, is impaled in an underground crypt. Often I would give these books to my teachers as presents. (Eventually, my third grade teacher pulled me from the regular English/reading class, sat me at a large table by myself in the back of the room, and let me spend that period making books for the rest of the school year.)

My fondest memories of spending time with my dad include those Saturday afternoons together watching Christopher Lee (still my favorite cinematic Count) in the Hammer films. And when, on Halloween night 1989, while conducting my annual post-trick-or-treat ritual of sticking my head deep into my bag of candy and inhaling (the smell of nirvana, I tell you), I was simply overcome and spontaneously resolved to eat every single Reese's peanut butter cup right then and there, back-to-back, it was none other than Bela Lugosi in *Dracula* (1931) who kept me company for the next hour or so as I tried not to yack.

But despite so many great Dracula associations—stories and memories and movies and Halloween masks—everything instantly paled in comparison to Bram Stoker's novel when I finally read it.

I know it's probably asking the impossible, but try to forget all the hokey cape-waving and cobwebs and arched eyebrows and rubber bats that spring to mind when you hear that word, that name: ""Dracula."" Now try to replace these things with the idea that Dracula, the character, as written by Stoker, is absolutely, hands-down, still the only truly and purely evil character I've ever read in any book.

This is no lovable villain. Dracula is not a Hannibal Lecter, who you're, yes, afraid of, but also kind of amused by as he spouts witty, memorable lines. No, Dracula is a cancer. Stoker has written a villain who, despite his supernatural powers and un-dead status, is terrifyingly believable because the loathing he inspires in the reader is real. I actually find myself actively hating Dracula as I read the book—he's that bad. And Stoker's other characters, the crusaders against Dracula, the good guys—Jonathan Harker, Mina Murray, Dr. Seward, Van Helsing and the rest—are, you find as you get deeper into the book, such believably good people that you hate Dracula even more for targeting them.

Probably the single most thrilling reading experience I've ever had came the first time I read *Dracula*. Now, as a word nerd, I love and obsess over the written word and all related tools, matter, products, etc.—books, pens, journals, letters, notebooks, office supplies in general. You get the idea. *Dracula* is not only an epistolary novel, told as a series of letters, diary and journal entries, newspaper articles, etc., but late in the book there comes a moment (!) where the protagonists team up and decide to combine all their personal papers related to Dracula as a means of learning all they can about him in order to destroy him. Once all these pages have been collected and put in the proper order, Mina (the true heart of the novel; everyone should have a daughter named Mina) volunteers to sit down and type up copies of this document so that each character has his own—and then it dawns on you: the very book you're holding in your hand, what you've been reading all along, IS that document! You literally have your own copy of the BOOK the characters will now use to fight and conquer the embodiment of evil!

If you haven't already (or even if you have), I urge you to read *Dracula*. Full of horror that will, I promise, shock you (the Count's face, blood-bloated after feeding; the three ""sisters"" and that awful bag; vampire heads chopped off and the mouths stuffed with garlic), romance that will, I promise, move you (Mina!), and characters you will come to love and want to return to again and again, *Dracula* is the ultimate horror novel, in all its power and popularity, for a reason.

—

Bonus: This video is pretty much the single best thing on YouTube, in my opinion. The brilliant and hilarious Sir Christopher Frayling, cultural historian and *Dracula* expert/enthusiast, straps on his hiking boots, ties on his mustard-yellow scarf, and travels around the world, from Transylvania to Philadelphia, to tell you all about Bram Stoker, his creative process, and how *Dracula* came to be. Highlights include Frayling presenting Stoker's actual notes and papers from the six-year process of writing the novel (photographed here for the first time!), Frayling demonstrating the conflicting ideas of how vampires bite necks, and stories of Stoker, the ""humorless, preoccupied figure, who would shout at the sea when he went for his solitary walks along the bleak coastline of northeast Scotland."" https://youtu.be/88edGlW3DT4",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/40d19k/dracula_an_appreciation/,2016-01-10T20:32:25Z,9,30,books,Dracula,POST

gwn3ic,Just finished Dracula! Some constructive criticisms though....,"Overall, 7/10. Great gothic horror, and a fun adventure novel overall. 

But...

* Dracula was barely in it. I feel the overall threat he posed wasn't sufficiently displayed. Being ""the king of vampires"", and a former warlord who can command wolves and rats, transform into mist and other animals, command the weather, AND turn people into his undead slaves.... He really doesn't do too much that would be considered threatening.  This would be fixed by just saying there are a ton of new unexplained murders popping up as soon as Drac ends up in London. But no, he >!kills!< >!Lucy!< and>! Renfield, !< and >!legally moves to London, while chartering a boat there and back, and hiring people to carry his boxes around, while legally purchasing different houses in London!<.  Real threatening guy. The most interestingly evil thing he does in the book is >!when he kidnaps some peasants child to feed to his wives. Then he sic's some wolves on the peasant when she starts to scream for retribution.!< That's the type of evil I personally wanted to see more of. 
* Most of Van Helsing's monologues could be shortened to: ""Just trust me, I know what I'm talking about.""  Van Helsing talks all the time. And it could really be chopped down significantly without affecting the story. 

And really, that's it. I personally preferred Frankenstein, and I would love to see Adam meet Drac.

8gkm0a,An objective review of Dracula.,"I can certainly attest to the fact that Dracula, as a movement for the gothic genre and horror in general , is a big deal. However, as a book itself (controversial opinion alert) I seriously think it's overrated.
The whole story revolves around this supernatural creature terrorising aristocrats in London, madness, and has the subtext of new technology vs old/ xenophobia/ post modern feminism yadda yadda I get it. While I'm appreciative of the effect its had on the book world (such as Department 19, a series I personally love) and the movie world (Keanue Reeve's british accent in Bram Stokers Dracula by Coppala), everyone wants to look at the effect its had, how its the ideal gothic novel and its statements about feminism and industry, but honestly? 30+ of coursework has seriously saturated me of all that. So here's an entirely biased personal view on Dracula.
The novels strongest moments are in Jonathan Harkers diary in the opening, with the introduction of Dracula and his own personal character traits and the setting being shadowy enough to leave you wondering about the true nature of  the place, that loses it's charm really suddenly when leave his Diary and the rest of the story is told to you through various letters, newspaper articles and phonograph recordings. 
I personally hated this narrative structure, as the fractured storytelling and lack of detail in certain places, and too much inference in other places irritated me. 
The main characters of Van Helsing, Morris, Seward, Holmwood, Lucy and Mina (as well as Dracula and Renfield, as well as Harker) were extremely dull characters with little to no depth. Honestly half the time I felt like Dracula was being a bit of a misunderstood hero because I can entirely sympathise with wanting to get Van Helsing to STOP TALKING. Even if fangs are required. 
The ending is entirely predictable even if you didn't know the story already, and I was bored by the time the last 50 pages hit.
Ending thoughts? Read The Picture of Dorian Grey instead. After 30+ hours of coursework, I can sufficiently say its much more interesting, and Dorian himself is much more relatable in interesting. 
Again, this review is entirely biased and I do appreciate Dracula for what it was and what it did, and I can get why people enjoy it. But personally? Not my cup of vampire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8gkm0a/an_objective_review_of_dracula/,2018-05-02T20:28:42Z,8,0,books,Dracula,POST

a3fq6d,"Just finished Bram Stoker's Dracula... a bit underwhelmed, but what strikes me is how religious it is, so much so that I would qualify it as Christian spiritual horror","I've seen some people talk about their reactions to famous books before, so here goes mine... I just finished Dracula, the original novel, and I wish to communicate some feelings about it. I don't think I'm spoiling anything to anyone and I'll avoid describing things too much in detail in case anyone doesn't know about it.

First, it felt a bit like a chore for me to go through, I must admit. I like the first-person narrative well enough (my favorite horror author is Lovecraft and he did it over and over), but I felt it was hideously badly exploited in this case. The book pretends to be a collection of writings from many different people's diaries, but they all write the exact same way, and they report conversations verbatim which makes it hard for me to suspend disbelief... especially considering how atrociously long and convoluted some discussions are, including those involving Van Helsing. The writing and the dialogues felt stilted, unnaturally long and convoluted.

Second, the book's first act with Jonathan Harker in Dracula's castle is great. The last act is good, though a bit fast. But the part in the middle is a drudge to get through, people keep telling each other the same thing over and over. It was hard to keep reading through it at times. It may not help that the main parts of the story are well-known, so I didn't have the shock of not understanding what is happening.

Third, I never knew how profoundly Christian and religious the book was. God is constantly mentioned, and not only that, but the protagonists make it clear over and over that their greatest fear is not to die, but to be corrupted by the vampire and thus shut out of heaven by committing mortal sins while under its taint. Interestingly, it makes the part of the 1931 movie where Renfield begs Dracula to punish him, to torture him, but not to kill him, because he doesn't want to die with sins upon his soul, a very thematically faithful moment of the movie, even if it's not anywhere in the novel. It made me conclude that Dracula is actually a Christian spiritual horror story, because the fear that animates the story is the fear of being damned and excluded from God's love and from heaven, of falling from an enemy that doesn't just hurt and murder you, but destroys your chance at eternal life. (Note: I am not a believer, I'm agnostic)

It really is unusual today to see people or a work of fiction be so relentlessly religious and preoccupied about the afterlife.

4q0m5a,H. P. Lovecraft and the Dracula Revision,"> Speaking of Cook, he hath just lent me two books, one of which is Bram Stoker’s last production, *The Lair of the White Worm*. The plot idea is colossal, but the development is so childish that I cannot imagine how the thing ever got into print—unless on the reputation of *Dracula*. The rambling and unmotivated narration, the puerile and stagey characterisation, the irrational propensity of everyone to do the most stupid possible thing at precisely the wrong moment and for no cause at all, and the involved development of a personality afterward relegated to utter insignificance—all this proves to me either that *Dracula* (Mrs. Miniter saw *Dracula* in manuscript about thirty years ago. It was incredibly slovenly. She considered the job of revision, but charged too much for Stoker.) and *The Jewel of Seven Stars* were touched up Bushwork-fashion by a superior hand which arranged all the details, or that by the end of his life (he died in 1912, the year after the *Lair* was issued, he trickled out in a pitiful and inept senility.

- H. P. Lovecraft to Frank Belknap Long, 7 Oct 1923, *Selected Letters* 1.255

(Notes: “Cook” is W. Paul Cook, “Bushwork” refers to the tiresome revision work Lovecraft did for David Van Bush.)

> Have you read anything of Stoker’s aside from “Dracula”? “The Jewel of Seven Stars” is pretty fair, but “The Lair of the White Worm” is absolutely the most amorphous & infantile mess I’ve ever seen between cloth covers; & that in spite of a magnificent idea which one would ordinarily deem well-nigh fool-proof. Stoker was absolutely devoid of a sense of form, & could not write a coherent tale to save his life. Everything of his went through the hands of a re-writer, (except, perhaps, the “White Worm”) & it is curious to note that one of our circle of amateur journalists—an old lady named Mrs. Miniter—had a chance to revise the “Dracula” MS. (which was a fiendish mess!) before its publication, but turned it down because Stoker refused to pay the price which the difficulty of the work impelled her to charge. Stoker ha a brilliantly fantastic mind, was was unable to shape the images he created.

- H. P. Lovecraft to Donald Wandrei, 29 Jan 1927, *Mysteries of Time & Spirit* 20

MT&S 22n7: Edith (Dow) Miniter (1869-1934), an amateur journalist and author of a professionally published novel, Out Natupski Neighbors (1916). This account of her involvement with Dracula has not been confirmed.

> I never heard of the Stoker book you mention—is it any good? Stoker was a very inept writer when not helped out by revisers, & his “Lair of the White Worm” is so bad that many have mistaken it for a burlesque. I know an old lady who almost had the job of revising “Dracula” back in the early 1890s’s—she saw the original MS., & says it was a fearful mess. Finally someone else (Stoker thought her price for the work was too high) whipped it into such shape as it now possesses.

- H. P. Lovecraft to R. H. Barlow, 10 Dec 1932, *O Fortunate Floridian* 44-45

> As for the old lady who almost revised *Dracula*—I know that she has not any reliquiae of the incident. She never was in direct touch with Stoker, a representative of his having brought the MS. & later taken it away when no terms could be reached.

- H. P. Lovecraft to R. H. Barlow, Sep 1933, OFF 81

> [...] have one elegy to write …. the latter on Mrs. Miniter (the lady who almost revised “Dracula” in 1893), who died last June.

- H. P. Lovecraft to R. H. Barlow, 1 Sep 1934, OFF 173

> He had with him some tremendously interesting antiquarian material—old papers of the ancestors of the late Mrs. Miniter (prominent amateur journalist who 40 years ago turned down a chance to revise “Dracula”), whose literary executor he is.

- H. P. Lovecraft to August Derleth, 4 Dec 1934, *Essential Solitude* 2.669 (“He” is W. Paul Cook)

There is apparently no independent collaboration of Lovecraft’s oft-repeated tale about the proposed Dracula re-write, and in *Dead Houses and Other Stories* (a collection of Miniter’s short fiction & other materials), there is no mention of it, though in the introduction Kenneth Faig adds:

> From the time of her marriage to John T. Miniter (1864?-1900) in 1887, she was also engaged in professional newspaper work, most notably with the society weekly *The Boston Home Journal* from 1892 until 1906.

77favo,Dracula vs Hitler was a missed opportunity (spoilers),"I liked the conception of the novel as an epistolary novel like the original Dracula, but the early goings of the novel had dreadful pacing. It takes more than half the book for the action sequences to start happening ""on screen"". 

At this point, the book kicks into high gear and becomes super entertaining, but I couldn't shake the concern that because it took place in 1941 and was not presented as an alternate history but as an ""untold"" history, that it would have an unfulfilling non-ending. 

I was right. The final third of the book was extremely entertaining and then the ending left me completely cold. I went in skeptical, remained skeptical for a large portion of the book, suddenly started to really like it, and hated how it wrapped up.

2f5mev,"I read Dracula, what a lousy book.","It was a decent story, but man, such bad writing. It's hard to see how it fell into the collective unconscious aside from it being and early example. (Carmilla is much better.) 

The essay at that the end mentioned its place in Gothic romance. Going from memory it said that these stories involved a dark skinned foreigner (often Italian) pursuing a noble born woman with ill intent. Stoker just plugged in a Vampire where an Italian would normally go.

Now when I look at the cover I can only see Brahm Stokers ""Vito"" in old English typeface and wonder how it would have gone without the folklore.

Yes, I get it, you all adore Mina. You have all donated blood to her, and also you adore her. Now stab some Gypsys, open the box and stab the Italian.

1vqq95,Hi /r/Books! Question about Dracula- Bram Stoker,"First, I'm reading this for pleasure because I'm a huge book nerd. Second, being an American I have to mull over some of the English usage and terminology but I can normally get by using context clues. That being said, this one passage has me stumped: Chapter 17, Jonathan Harker's Journal, 29th September.

""Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add to the simple description `fifty cases of common earth', except that the boxes were `main and mortal heavy', and that shifting them was dry work. **One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any gentleman `such like as like yourself, squire', to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form.** Another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. **Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, forever and adequately, this source of reproach.**"" 

Ok, so:
1. The first bolded section, I don't understand what they mean by ""liquid form"" are they wanting him to reward them for lifting the boxes? And if so, in what manner is liquid form? Are they wanting him to buy them drinks?
2. The second bolded section (which may be explained once the question above is answered) what source of reproach is he talking about? Did they insult him in some manner? And why did he take care? Were they threatening him?

I fear that I cannot continue reading until I figure out what's going on here as I am very confused and don't wish to miss anything which may leave me blindsided for later on in the book.

Thanks for your help!

And you chose what I assume to be jaundice corpses because you refer to him as having yellow skin and it took you 2 years so theyre decomposing (embalming does not last forever especially not back then if any of his corpses here embalmed). So then you finish and the guy wakes up and while you're like I made him symmetrical and have beautiful features but hes uuuuuglyyy and you run away. Dude?! Its your fault. You created him.

13i6qiv,Frankenstein is blowing my mind. It's exceeding all my expectations. Marry Shelley couldn't be praised enough.,"A while ago I finished Phantom of The Opera and decided to start Frankenstein. Phantom of The Opera became an all time favourite of mine. Gaston Leroux wrote a sensationnal story full of thrill and drama bound in the gilded wrapping of late 19th century french art and high society.

Now, Frankenstein is an entirely different vibe. Mary Shelley is a poet. A painter with words. The many ways she finds to describe emotions and scenaery are incredible. And oh, so very gothic.

I'm only about 160 pages in, so halfway through the story but I already think this is gonna become my number one book for a while, as there couldn't be anything I would dislike that could come my way. It's like nothing I've ever read. There's this heavily dramatic and engaging story delivered with intense emotions and stakes that keep rising, but through the entire thing there persists this underlying theme of existentialism, religious symbolism and mythology. What it means to be a man and a god, a creator and it's creation. Which is not surprising considering the events and circumstances behind how Mary was inspired to write this story or the direct refrences to Paradise Lost.

Also it's a genuinely scary book. It manages to give me shivers. It's far more terrifying than what the pop culture monster movie Frankenstein could ever be. It completly drags me in with a few sentences. The atmosphere is thick and it engulfs you instantly.

I was not prepared for the Monster or the Wretch. The element of body horror surrounding him and his creation gets under my skin. But what suprieses me even more was how he's both pitiful yet despicable. So gentle and meek yet capable of terror beyond imagination. A being fighting for survival. His dialouge is so quoteable and potent. He's like a dark reflection of Victor. As if he poured a part of his soul and intellectualism into the creature.

The sequence of events leading to the monster's introduction to Victor atop the icy Swiss mountains will forever be etched in my mind

TLDR: Frankenstein deserves it's status as a classic. They use the word ""Countenance"" in this book a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13i6qiv/frankenstein_is_blowing_my_mind_its_exceeding_all/,2023-05-15T12:24:06Z,391,5553,books,Frankenstein,POST
10eutgn,I finished reading “Frankenstein”,"While this book is said to be one of the greatest horror novels of all time, it also is perhaps one of the greatest tragedies of all time. The fact that it was written by an 18 year old is shocking to me.

Victor in particular was a fascinating character. For one, he’s a self absorbed egoistic asshole with a god-complex who pettily rejected his own creation, & is responsible for 7 deaths (William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, his father, himself, & the monster). He should be completely unforgivable. However, I am nonetheless forced to sympathize for him.

prn9pp,"Read Frankenstein for the first time and WOW. Classics aren’t bad, at all.","My self yearns to embark on an undertaking to draft a whole essay on the jewel this book turned out to be but the limited time and skills as such has been endowed to me keep me away from this noble pursuit. Instead, I will at every possible opportunity,  make people conscious of their reading list if they claim to have not read it. Utilising this post as the first materialisation of a mass broadcast of this act of mine, I say one thing - ‘to hell with popular culture, fellow human. this is not a horror book as we have been made to believe. nope. this is science fiction with a strong revenge story and reflection on human loneliness and wretchedness in as fluid and beautiful a language as possible. calling it a horror story is akin to calling interstellar a comedy.’ 

And by the way, the more I read Classics which have stood the test of time filter, the more I realise how bad and pretentious many of the current writers are. This book was written by a girl in her late teens more than 200 years ago - I am in sheer awe of her control over language (her words are like honey-drops, measured and never wasted or futile), layered narration (at one point, there is a story in a story in a story in a story in the story), philosophical maturity, and a near-perfect masculine portrayal.

Why has there never been a faithful adaptation, either in movies or tv? There are so many smart period dramas nowadays, I feel like the time is ripe for a good, serious Frankenstein adaptation.

Or the outdoor scenes, with lightning playing around the mountain tops. Or the story of the monster spying on the fugitives in the mountains.

It’s a very weird and off putting thing to be reading something that sounds like first person character narration but then realizing it’s not because it’s a character dictating another character’s words and emotions. And it’s also odd that at no point during Victors story Walton never interrupts him to ask questions, like going into detail about how he created the monster which victor doesn’t mention until the end.

okms3f,Just finished Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.,"I recently finished Frankenstein and loved the book, the themes and the story was really good but I still don't get one thing. I have read from many places that in the book real monster was Victor Frankenstein himself but I still don't get how?

Yes, he was responsible for the monster, he created him and then abandoned him instead of helping him.

Talking about the monster, People say that The monster killed people because of Frankenstein but I think it's not that simple. 

1. When the monster killed William it was not because that Frankenstein abandoned him. I think that he was angry because of his previous incident with the De Lacey family and when he heard the name Frankenstein from William he just had an excuse to do his deed.
2. A friend of mine also said that the monster just wanted a companion and Frankenstein refused that also which forced him to kill more people, to that I would like to say that Frankenstein did try to make the companion but he stopped because I think he was right to fear that what if the next creature had her own free will and she didn't want to live with the monster wouldn't then the original creature get angry and then try to kill Frankenstein or worse.

I am also not saying that Frankenstein was innocent, He was partially responsible for the deaths around him but to label him a monster is very extreme in my opinion in fact he was a deeply flawed human just like every other human that faced the monster in the novel and if that makes Frankenstein a monster I believe then every other person is also a monster.

lefgpi,Frankenstein by Mary Shelley,"I finally finished Frankenstein. I’ve been wanting to read this for years. I’m not going to lie, this was a hard read. Not because I couldn’t understand it, it’s because it’s in what I like to call “old English”... words that are long forgotten or sentence structures that we don’t use anymore. 

Written in 1816-1818 Mary Shelley, who was an educated woman (not all women went to school back then let alone college) entered the writing as part of a challenge set by her friend along with other friends. The challenge: who could write the best horror story. Mary won. Her own personal story is interesting and marked with tragedy. She died in 1851. 

While this was a good read and part of it pretty horrific by standards of those days... writings of creating a living creature through scientific methods were extremely taboo at that time. Honestly she could have been thrown into an insane asylum if her father hadn’t always encouraged her to write. He could have easily said yeah you know what we’re going to commit you and that would have been it for her.. anyhow a good read but a difficult one. There were times I had to force myself to keep going but then BANG! It got super good and from there to the end it kept my attention. 

At times I felt sorry for the creature that was created. It dawned on me that a self aware creature “born” into this world with no one to guide it was lucky to make it day to day. Some how it did. It was missing companionship and love. Those desires drove it to try to reach out for humans who shunned it because of its looks. (We do this to people everyday in the world). It was by that shunning that it became a monster. In the end it hated itself more than its creator ever could. 

I’ll leave it there. Way more interesting than the movies made around the story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lefgpi/frankenstein_by_mary_shelley/,2021-02-07T04:38:02Z,75,228,books,Frankenstein,POST
18t3tn9,"Just finished Frankenstein. Loved every minute, one of my favorite novels to date.","Seriously. This book has more to say in less than 250 pages than most books say in 600. I won't go on and on here about its technical qualities, because I believe they have been praised to hell and back, for good reason. But suffice to say I've seldom come across authors with such talent to embed emotion in their words. Sorrow, anger, solitude, joy, regret, despair, I felt it all every time, for every character, and held back tears for both Victor and the creature. The way she conveys the creature's loneliness and fall into hatred after being abandoned is absolutely brilliant.

I also would like to say, I kind of disagree with the ""Frankenstein was the true monster all along"" idea. I understand where it comes from, but I think it lacks nuance in a very important way. I dislike calling people who do evil ""monsters"", because no one (well, maybe some of the worst serial killers, but that's besides the point) is all darkness inside. That's true for real people and it's true for Victor.

We live around ""monsters"". They have friends and families whom they love. They sometimes have children whom they care for. They do charity. They go to work, they tell funny jokes, they sometimes are very smart, handsome and talented. But they are also sex offenders, pedophiles, blackmailers, manipulators, liars, kidnappers or murderers. Stating their good deeds is not, in this context, an excuse for their behavior: it's a necessary acknowledgement that extremely gross things can be done by people who are _not_ perfectly evil villains. You don't have to be a ""monster"" to do evil things, you can just be human.

We shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking everyone who does bad things must be all bad, all the time, because that blinds us for the bad behavior committed by our friends, neighbors and loved ones. We know _they_ are not ""monsters"", so whatever they did, mustn't have been _that bad_, right? It's easy to fall into that binary, and be left with weak excuses when it is challenged. But, sometimes, yeah, it is that bad.

We shouldn't distance ourselves from Victor Frankenstein by calling him a ""monster"". Aside from creating the creature (that involves way too much blind obsession and grave robbing for the average person to be ok with), I wouldn't put most of Victor's actions past most people, given the right circumstances. Abandoning his creation at the sight of its hideous appearance, hiding from his mistakes, breaking his promise, neglecting to protect his loved ones, etc. He's extremely obsessed, neglectful, selfish, stubborn and prideful, but he is still very human, warped and mad as he is. In a way, I think that's the point, or one of many points, of the novel.

What are your opinions on Victor and the novel as a whole? 

One thing I also loved is the theme of good being the default for humans (and for the monster) and evil being unnatural and forced by outside factors. That's so beautiful and optimistic. 

PS: I think the author herself didn't want anyone to think of Victor as a perfectly evil villain either. She emphasizes in the beginning, through Robert's letters, how caring and kind he is to the crew, and how good friends they became. He is constantly thinking about how much he loves his friend and his family, even if he expresses it in a selfish way and inevitably thinks of their safety second to his own. I think he's just a case of extreme darkness existing alongside light, but progressively growing and growing until it obfuscated it completely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18t3tn9/just_finished_frankenstein_loved_every_minute_one/,2023-12-28T20:35:48Z,29,242,books,Frankenstein,POST
s963jk,Victor Frankenstein is the most infuriating character I have ever read in a Book (Mild spoilers for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein),"I'm reading this for the first time right now, and he is so infuriating. Seeing his guilt as a worse punishment than the execution is next level douchebaggery.

when the monster says ""I will be with you on your wedding night"", your first and only thought is ""oh, hes going to kill me on my wedding night""? really? the monster that so far has exclusively gone after your friends and family as a means of making your life shitty is going to wait to kill YOU on your wedding night? despite the fact that hes had plenty of opportunities to kill you if thats what he was after? the thought never even crossed your mind that he might be after your bride? he said this line to you right after he watched you destroy the female companion you were making for him, and you don't even consider for a second that he might intend to kill your wife as some sort of equivalent?

He has a serious god complex which manifests in a number ways throughout the book. One such way is his inability to consider other people. He’s a deeply self-centered person and it’s not absurd that he’d fail to understand the monster’s threat. I know this is meant to be the point but even though I'm intrigue by him, I just get more and more frustrated reading about his antics.

17yiq2z,Questions from Frankenstein,"I have a few questions after reading Frankenstein and I don't know where to ask them. So hoping some people can render light to these

1.  Why did no one ask Victor Frankenstein who the murderer was, when he told them that he knew who the real murderer was and it was not Justine? I understand why he didn't want to tell them it was the monster he created but no one even asked him ""Well who is it if it's not Justine?"". They were just happy he knew and continued to feel bad for Justine. 
2. Victor advises Walton to stop his ambitious pursuit of knowledge and narrates his entire story as a warning to him. Why the does he encourage the sailors to go north when they say they don't want to? He talks about honour and valour to them but continues to take lessons on how taking care of your loved ones is the best thing you can do. Is this to show that victor is self-serving or an oversight from the author?
3. Why did Victor think the monster was coming to kill him on his wedding night? The monster told him that he'll make him feel the same loneliness he feels. So it was obvious he was going to target his wife Elizabeth. Was this another way of telling Victor's lack of empathy to the monster's life or was it just a plot device for a 19th century plot twist?

jhkx2s,Frankenstein and Ted Kaczynski’s Unabomber manifesto are about exactly the same thing,"Yes, as ridiculous as this sounds I am completely serious. 

According to Kaczynski, the Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. He believed that large industrial life had decimated the quality of living and that it had caused a monstrous amount of harm upon humans and the environment.

Frankenstein, on the other hand, focuses on the harms of Victor playing god and using technology and his knowledge of academia to create something that was an abomination. The author and those during this time focused around the school of Romanticism, which stressed a natural and pure agrarian society and rejected large urban industrial life. This theme can be seen in the book considering bad things happen to Frankenstein whenever he leaves his countryside to go to urban centers or universities to use technology. 

Strangely enough, both books have exactly the same theme: the harms of the industrial revolution.

17dgohp,What was your initial opinion when reading Frankenstein?,"I just finished the book today; this is probably my third classic book. I am not a very proficient reader and know very little of the theories behind Frankenstein. I’m quite ecstatic at recognising the contemporary thought that both Victor and the monster are the same being when reading more into it online.

This initial guess was consummated when the monster spoke and used a similar choice of vocabulary as Victor. But I wandered towards the conjecture the day after the monster was conceived. In that the monster had vanished and that Victor had no recollection of the monster's whereabouts.

As well as the contradictory ‘fact’ that Victor is the only man to have seen this monster (besides the sightings made by wanderers that come from Victor, an unreliable narrator).

Contradictory because, in the very last pages, it is revealed that Robert too sights the monster and goes as far as to converse with him.

But I do believe I have my own explanation for the theory.

Victor is tenacious in the discovery of science, and early on in the book, he enlightens the reader of his love for natural philosophy. This was later counteracted and frowned upon when arriving at higher education by his lecturers.

Still, Victor pursues his passion with the alignment of modern science, specifically chemistry. He collects human remains in graveyards for his abominable concoction and drained himself for many months and many sleepless nights.

Victor gives it his all to fulfil his contract—the contract to reanimate the dead.But all his hard work and ill-torn labour come amiss; all his trials and tribulations, all his toils and troubles have been for nothing.

The monster, I believe, is the embodiment of grief.

The grief of time lost during his great lament and the sacrifice in his disposition.

He ventured forward into the discovery of science and wished to prevail in his chosen area of expertise, only to succumb to failure. His hopes and dreams are blown to smithereens. This monster, I believe, is an abstraction of this turmoil. Whether it’s mental illness, the lies of a broken man, or the coping mechanisms of a depraved killer The monster is this metaphor.

The evidence is within the contradiction of its own theory—that too, Robert sees the monster himself. The reason for this is because he too is experiencing his own grief in his employment.

Robert is a tenacious character, but one of exploration and navigation. He is just as avid about his pursuits as Victor. Sacrificing much wealth, time, and company for his aspirations, he tirelessly builds himself a crew after much time and hardship, setting forth on a journey to the North Pole to explore unventured lands beyound.

His efforts are later squandered by a stalemate. The ship he procured is landlocked by surrounding ice and is left marooned. Mutiny is succeeded by this, and all his efforts are exhausted. He, too, has failed.

Before Victor died, he bestowed the completion of his vengeance upon Robert. Riddling Robert with the same inescapable manifestation of grief as Victor passing the torch, so to speak.

The question about this theory now is: How did Victor die? Was it suicide? Or a man at the end of his spiritual wick? Or does Robert too hold the torch of torture and become the monster of his predecessor?

It’s been a brilliant, thought-provoking book, and I've grown all the wiser for reading it. I’d love to know anyone else’s theories in the comments. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17dgohp/what_was_your_initial_opinion_when_reading/,2023-10-22T00:24:42Z,30,26,books,Frankenstein,POST

12inv5w,Frankenstein: a review,"

""The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel it's warmth.""

I started Frankenstein right after I had finished War and Peace. I was a little scared at first because I had spent a lot of time with the characters of War and Peace and I didn't know weather I would enjoy my next read as much as my last one. Frankenstein was the right choice, because I fell in love with it from the first pages. Mary Shelley has crafted a truly beautiful and haunting tale. I wouldn't call it blood- curdling mostly because my view on horror is probably different from someone from the 19th century but it did give me a few uneasy drams. One thing that I found quite surprising about this novel was the writing style; for something written nearly 200 years ago it did feel quite modern and simple especially compared to others writers from the same period. The only bad thing about this book is that it was over too quickly. I would have been to have spent some more time with the characters but mabye it's for the best it finished where it did. 

The monster is quite an interesting character. I don't really blame him for his actions but I don't love him either. I mostly feel pity for him. His story is a tragic one. I can only compare him to a child who is left alone by his father who didn't want him and who goes to search for love in the wide world. But the world doesn't love him either, it doesn't accept him. What is he to do now, naive as he is with no one to guide him and teach him? He turns against his creator and the world and gives them a taste of their own medicine. Was he right in doing so? I don't think one can truly judge his actions as right or wrong. He started his life as a ""tabula rasa"" as every child does but he also had love in heart, love for his makers and the world around him. At the very first moments of his life his maker denies him and it is only downhill from there. If he had been guided and shown just a bit of love he would have returned it to the world one hundred fold. That's why I can't judge him, because his actions aren't really his own.

Victor Frankenstein. I found nothing sympathetic about him. He is interesting enough to read about but his nature canard did not evoke sympathy. He is constantly preaching how vile and evil the fiend he has created is and while he does blame himself for the deaths of his friends and family I didn't find his guilt genuine. To me it seemed more like he was trying to make others feel pity on his situations rather than truly feeling guilty. And even if he did feel guilty he didn't feel guilty about the right thing. He should have been more sorry to have left ""a child"" alone without any guilty, a child he had created. He is constantly telling us how he wishes to die so that the fiend can stop hunting him and his family but he keeps on draging the rest down with him in the abyss he has made. Until the very end he chases his child wishing only to kill him and even on his last moments he tries to convince another to keep up his task after he has gone never having realised where his faults truly lay. There is only one thing that he did that I agree with and this not making the female. His reasoning in that part I feel to be true and if things would have gone astray it could have launched ""the monster"" on a killing spree and would have also unleashed a second one who could have  been worse upon humanity. 

I won't say anything about the other characters because there isn't much of them to form an opinion. 

Despite this being a gothic science fiction novel, I think it has some really good messages concerning children, parents, responsibilities etc. When you decide to bring another being into this world, you should be prepared to bear full responsibility for it's education and actions. A bad parent that fails in his duty and then blames the child for the crimes they have committed and calls them 'a demon, a criminal, not my child', is only lying to themselves about who is truly guilty. Try as they may to set their conscience at peace by lying to themselves, if they fail in their duty, if they don't give their child the love and guidance they need, they deserve no sympathy when karma gets back at them.

4ldsx0,"If Victor Frankenstein is a monster for what he did, I am just as much a monster as he is.","So I constantly see comments about Frankenstein specifically with people calling the monster Frankenstein, and someone says ""Knowledge is knowing Frankenstein isn't the monster, Wisdom is knowing Frankenstein is the real monster.""

I always read this and get confused. What exactly makes Victor a monster? He just seems like a scientist who made some really bad choices and runs away from his mistakes. That doesn't sound like a monster. That sounds like a human. I mean if he Victor is a monster, aren't most people monsters?

They don't know how to react to certain situations, so they escape it? 

Not only that, but every time he didn't stop the monster he came to a logical conclusion why to not do it. He could have built the monster a bride, but he feared that it wouldn't like the monster and he had created two monsters, that seems logic to me.

So don't be so quick to call him a monster for what he has done, because we all are monsters just as much as he is for our past mistakes.

What is your take on this? Am I just thinking nonsense or are you a monster too?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4ldsx0/if_victor_frankenstein_is_a_monster_for_what_he/,2016-05-28T01:18:24Z,268,403,books,Frankenstein,POST
hpwhxb,"I recently read Frankenstein for the first time, and have a hard time understanding how Victor Frankenstein is unequivocally thought of as the real monster rather than his creation.","Frankenstein is one of the most well-known novels in history, but after having read it for the first time recently, I can't help but feel that most people that discuss it either have not read it or remember it incorrectly. Everywhere you look, you basically will not find a single person that doesn't consider Frankenstein to be the real ""monster"" of the novel. However, as I continued reading, I could not feel that this was wrong in some ways. The creature does some very horrible things to innocent people, while Frankenstein himself doesn't really do anything out of malice or hatred. Either it is morally ambiguous which one of them is truly to blame, or they are both evil in their own ways.

Frankenstein does build a new body out of parts and gives it life, but he doesn't do it to create a servant, a soldier, or a monster. He does it out of (admittedly misguided) scientific curiosity and expects that his experiments will help mankind. After giving life to the body, he realizes his mistakes and flees his laboratory, only to later return and find the creature missing. This is pretty much the only thing that Frankenstein does wrong in the novel, in my opinion, rejecting his own creation at first. This does mean that Frankenstein is somewhat responsible for everything that happens next, but it is not all too different from a regular child in my opinion. A father cannot be blamed for the crimes of his son, regardless of how they were raised.

The creature, at first with the mind of a newborn, unable to speak and with no memory, flees into the forest and lives of nuts and berries. Eventually, he finds refuge in a hovel next to the house of a family, from which he learns to speak and read by eavesdropping on them. When he tries to approach them to take him in as a friend, they are scared away by his hideous appearance. The creature starts hating all of humanity after this, but especially his creator, whose name he has now learned.

This is the turning point for me when considering which of the two of them are the most monstrous. I think that many people have gotten the idea that the creature is either a mindless beast or has the intelligence of a small child that doesn't know what they are doing. After this point, the creature is just as intelligent and eloquent as any other adult. In fact, since the family he was learning from was a noble family, he is probably more intelligent by the 18th-century standard. It is only now that the creature begins performing actions out of hatred for Frankenstein. He travels to Frankenstein's hometown of Geneva, finds Frankenstein's younger brother and kills him. He then frames one of their childhood friends for the murder, for which she is hanged.

It is at this point you wonder; surely it would be morally justified for the creature to attack and kill Frankenstein himself, but how can it be justified that it kills his brother and gets their friend sentenced to death? Neither of them knew anything about Frankenstein's work or had anything to do with it. The creature is fully sentient, sapient, and aware of its action, so surely it must be evil at this point? Many people have been rejected by society for a number of things but do not go on killing sprees for it.

After this, the creature demands that Frankenstein build him a female companion, after which they will disappear in the South American jungles forever. If he does not do it, the creature threatens to kill Frankenstein's bride on their wedding night. After initially agreeing, Frankenstein changes his mind and destroys the female. He does not do this either out of hatred, revenge, or malice. He is worried that the female will either hate the male creature, turning him even worse, that she will be eviler than him, or that they will have children that eventually destroy humanity. For betraying him, the creature kills Frankenstein's best friend and his new wife.

Am I wrong in thinking that the creature himself did just as much wrong or more than Frankenstein did? Frankenstein has only himself to blame for his misery, but what about all of the innocent people that the creature killed, all of them after he gained the intelligence of a normal person? I honestly expected a much different story based on what I have heard about it over the years, with the creature often discussed as misunderstood or friendly in nature, rather than the hateful, revenge-seeking, murderer it is in the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hpwhxb/i_recently_read_frankenstein_for_the_first_time/,2020-07-12T15:48:23Z,71,156,books,Frankenstein,POST
wwudjn,In highschool I read Frankenstein by Mary Shelly and it's fantastic.,"I never knew how different the media portrays him compared to the story. He's not some simpleton only wanting love. He's smarter than that. I mean learning french? I never knew. His description is also different. Long black hair with yellowish leathery skin. Not green skin and no short flat head. The only accurate part is that he's really tall, has black fingernails and lips.

The part that hit me the most is when he finds a bible and reads about how God loves his creation and him wondering why his creator won't love him. It's depressing and sad. You feel bad for him. He only wants acceptance and Victor won't give it to him. He hates what he's created and so you wonder who's truly the monster. They see each other that way but from opposing sides.

zectyy,Question concerning Victor Frankenstein and fevers,"I just finished an audiobook of Frankenstein and overall I enjoyed it very much, and I've kept thinking about it for the last few days. One question that lingers in my mind is probably mostly concerned with medical history, but I'll give it a go here.

Several times Victor Frankenstein is inflicteded with fevers, usually immediately following some significant and emotionally important event in the story. These fevers usually renders Frankenstein bedridden or even unconsious for months at a time, and one time he only recognized the nurse (who had cared for him for two months already) by her voice, as this was all that he remembered from the months of illness. Was this something that would regularly occour back in the 19th century or earlier? Did people become bedridden with fevers for months at a time after periods of emotional distress?

The writing sucks you in and the pacing/chapters are written in a somewhat monthly timeline where it involves anyone’s POV Cleo, Frank, Quentin, Zoe, Santiago, Anders and Eleanor. Everyone has baggage and it’s like watching a train wreck of a movie that sucks you in even when the plot is non- existent. 

This book is a definition of NO PLOT JUST VIBES. And mind you, it wasn’t all good vibes. The two MCs are toxic to each other and to themselves, personalities most of the times where pretentious with a lot of woke undertones. Nonetheless, I have underlying masochist tendencies and like to experience painful conversations and dialogues of entitled, privileged, pretentious people. 

With that said, two of the characters that had great character development much early on was Santiago and Eleanor.

10nay49,Memories of Elizabeth Frankenstein is so utterly stupid.,"I can't find the strength to hate it, because I am so tired of it.

In the beginning author mentions Shelley's mom being a feminist and then writes a whole book about women being amoral and mad. Yeah, the narrator might be a time appropriate character, but I don't care. Every bit of Elizabeth's expierence is doubted and the narrator dismisses every woman of the story, feeling free of their secrets at some point.

It's a cursed circle of stripping Elizabeth Frankenstein of her integrity and dignity. If the author had left her an actual murderer, I would not be so mad. But her whole journey in the woods dismissed as hallucinations and hysteria. What the actual fuck?

Not even mentioning the puberty chapters. Who asked you? Sexual maturity and sexuality in the rituals are put as distastefully as possible. The whole narrative is so dragging it never feels like there is any movement in the story. Victor Frankenstein is still the one pitied the most in the story. 

I might be not getting something here, but I don't care. The book was written in 1995. Author reminds me of men in Sandman's Calliope story. Like Richard Maddock, who graciously pointed to Mary Shelley and Shirley Jackson as his inspirations. He also did to Calliope what Victor Frankenstein did to Elizabeth. And she forgave him. If you know, you know.

It's absolutely unnecessary to read. Read the original again. I need therapy now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10nay49/memories_of_elizabeth_frankenstein_is_so_utterly/,2023-01-28T09:19:28Z,5,18,books,Frankenstein,POST
108ybb5,Book review of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley,"I enjoyed the format the story is written in between a combination of first person stories between the main characters and a series of letters written to different people. I think the original story is much different from most of the film adaptations and evolutions which have been made. The story arch of the monster I found to be the most fascinating and somewhat relevant today as an analogy to some of the dangers we may face in the coming age of AI. Consider the monster Frankenstein created’s search for purpose in a new and alien world akin to what it may look like as AI with general intelligence struggles similarly into existence. There may be frightening occurrences and ultimately a being born which once taking account of the nature of itself in relation to the world it resides feels a sense of resentment toward its creators. Let’s hope not because that would be pretty scary but ultimately I believe there’s a high likelihood that a vastly superior intelligence to our own wouldn’t necessarily have anything similar to the same set of values we have. So it raises an important question as to what we should do with a profoundly dangerous and powerful being akin to the monster of Frankenstein’s creation. 

Otherwise I felt the story lacking a little in depth and would’ve liked to see more interaction between the monster and its environment. Although I can see how leaving this up to interpretation makes for some fun use of the imagination. Like what if the monster had decided to learn cosmetics or dawn an adequate disguise in an attempt to enter the job market and participate more fully in the human world? Or what if he’d been able to find a way to utilize his strength and agility to show usefulness to humans as a means of endearing them to him regardless of outward appearance?

Possibly it would have been useful to know better what the monster were to look like more specifically so as to have a better idea of how these eventualities may have played out. You can put lipstick on a pig so to speak. Yet therein lies another example of how leaving things more up to interpretation allows the reader to better use their imagination.

Also, a sequel would’ve been very interesting although with the details on how the story developed I can see how that may have been impossible unless someone were to have discovered Frankensteins notes on the science he used to create his monster then proceeded to go all willie nillie in their own lab. This manner of definitively ending a story can also lend itself to the reader being more appreciative of the literature also though. I mean how many Avengers movies did we need before getting somewhat bored with them.

Anyway these are obviously just my opinions and I’m happy to hear what others think. Thank you for taking the time to read this far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/108ybb5/book_review_of_frankenstein_by_mary_shelley/,2023-01-11T07:01:05Z,4,6,books,Frankenstein,POST

3i5rv3,"""Knowledge is knowing that Frankenstein is not the monster. Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the monster."" Can we discuss this?","Hey /r/books, I've recently finished re-reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein.* I've read this book three times so far, each at different stages of my life, and each time I'm always blown away by how engaging and intelligent it is. This last time I read the book, however, was the first time I've gone into it with the titular ""knowledge/wisdom"" quote in mind. As I was reading, I was actively trying to look for evidence to justify Victor Frankenstein as a monster.

Long story short, I simply couldn't view Frankenstein as a monster. You could fault him for hubris, for sure, and I would absolutely call him a coward, but I think ""monster"" is unfair, even melodramatic.

What, exactly, does Victor Frankenstein do that readers would label him monstrous? I discussed this briefly with my dad, who could only offer that Frankenstein is a monster because he attempts to play God. I'm not buying this, one because I'd call that hubristic more than monstrous, and two because Frankenstein immediately and consistently demonstrates profound regret for creating his monster--hell, he even sticks to his guns and refuses to create a mate, knowing now what a terrible idea that is. Is he monstrous because he abandons his newborn creature, viewing him with disgust? Well, sure, that's undeniably a shitty thing to do, but I think to call him a ""monster"" for this goes too far.

The more ways I consider that Frankenstein could possibly be viewed as a monster (he doesn't come forward with the truth about William's death? he doesn't warn Elizabeth or any other family members about his creation?), the more I view him with a sense of... really tragic sympathy, I guess I'd call it. I believe absolutely that Frankenstein is a pure, weakly coward, but I think what holds me back from the ""monster"" label is that he never intends to harm anyone, not even his creature (at least not before the creature starts killing his loved ones). He just... makes a series of unfortunate, stupid, and, of course, cowardly decisions that end up hurting people, and I can't help but sympathize with that. Who among us hasn't regretted a decision made in short-sighted pride, who hasn't feared the fallout and tried simply wishing it away? Frankenstein's not a hero, he's not an upstanding or even necessarily a good guy, but I'd stop short of calling him ""bad."" He is just afraid, and he makes mistakes because of it, just like the rest of us.

Anybody want to explain where the quote about Frankenstein being a monster might come from?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3i5rv3/knowledge_is_knowing_that_frankenstein_is_not_the/,2015-08-24T03:47:58Z,33,156,books,Frankenstein,POST

Since the book club traditionally concludes every month with an AMA by the author of the selection, we never really have the opportunity to collectively explore older works; so during the month of October, we thought we would try something a little different. We will be reading the classic horror novel (and novella) **Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus** by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley & **The Yellow Wallpaper** by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, we will have an AMA with author and professor of Modern and Contemporary Literature in the Department of English and Humanities at Birkbeck, University of London - **Roger Luckhurst**. Roger specializes in Victorian literature as well as Gothic & weird fiction and is notable for his introductions and editorships to the [Oxford World's Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_World%27s_Classics) series volumes: **Late Victorian Gothic Tales***,* **Dracula**, **Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde***,* **The Portrait of a Lady***,* H.P. Lovecraft's **Classic Horror Tales***,* **King Solomon’s Mines***,* and **The Time Machine** among others. If you ever have had any questions on classic (or contemporary) horror, he is the one to ask. 

From the BBC (Frankenstein):

>Frankenstein tells the story of gifted scientist Victor Frankenstein who succeeds in giving life to a being of his own creation. However, this is not the perfect specimen he imagines that it will be, but rather a hideous creature who is rejected by Victor and mankind in general. 

From Goodreads (The Yellow Wallpaper):

>A woman and her husband rent a summer house, but what should be a restful getaway turns into a suffocating psychological battle. This chilling account of postpartum depression and a husband's controlling behavior in the guise of treatment will leave you breathless. 

Since both works are in the public domain, you may find copies of each through Project Gutenberg - [Frankenstein](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324) and [The Yellow Wallpaper](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952).

8fpbd0,I read Frankenstein,"And it was so awesome. To transport yourself to a different era, the language is so different, *so* hard to get through but so worthwhile. It's like walking through mud. You can do it, it will just take longer and more effort. 

What a heartbreaking story, the creation is like any of us, innocent in the beginning and tainted by circumstances in our lives. And to think this story, this classic was written by an 18 year old girl.

d0wegm,Frankenstein confusion,"I just finished listening to Frankenstein, and I had read it also in high school, however I remembered the book from high school entirely differently than what I just listened to. I thought it was common knowledge that the monster was killed by villagers and I also thought Dr. Frankenstein did create a partner for the original monster, yet after listening to the story that was not the case at all. Am I confusing the original novel with a spin-off of the story?

6z99jh,Frankenstein by Mary Shelley,"Just finished this today! Contrary to some pretty heated reviews on Goodreads or other platforms, I actually found it quite engaging. It drabs a little nearing the end and Frankenstein's inner mental torment perhaps got occasionally repetitive, but overall, it really is quite a landmark novel in the larger sphere of science fiction. 

I found the monster really intriguing: as many probably did, but I don't quite agree with some calling Frankenstein the true monster. Throughout the novel he expresses extensive remorse of his mere act of creation, unforgivable though it may be, and takes the deaths that occur on his head. So his ambition becomes his downfall: still, he carries it with such a responsibility that it practically demands respect.

Altogether, it's a pretty fascinating read. Not entirely familiar with Shelley's other works but it's no surprise many regard this work as a forerunner to other science fiction works. It raises the pertinent questions of things we should and shouldn't do, even if we can. 

It's pretty damn good.

73z3a9,(Spoilers) Mary Shelley's Frankenstein surprised me. What books have surprised you?,"From the pop culture references, I was expecting the doctor to be an old man, and the monster to be a brainless dolt. Turns out, that wasn't the case at all. 

I loved how the prose moved so smoothly, and the inner conflict of the doctor was more intense than I expected. It kind of calls in to question themes about parenting in general, especially for those who aren't ready for it.

bt9qfv,Frankenstein!,"I've just finished the original January 1, 1818 Frankenstein. We all know the story, but if you haven't read the original, you need to! 
I remember reading an abridged version in school and, of course seeing the various movies. The original book is so vastly different. It really delves into what the monster went through. How he learned what he was, and what it was to be human. Not to mention that all the cues that have become culturally connected with the story aren't necessarily part of the original book. It really is eye opening when you realize just how much was added by the screenwriters.
And...to top it off, aside from speculation about the origins of the idea, this fairly substantial manuscript was written in only a few months, by hand! And by a teenage girl!

p4l1r7,Unpopular Opinion about the original Frankenstein,"My opinion is... it simply wasn't that good.  After reading, I was struck with disappointment.  Perhaps it is because we are all accustomed to the film adaptations being wildly different, but nonetheless, it was bland.

Most parts that seem worth listening to are glossed over.  The building of the monster and the undeniably gruesome finding of body parts always interested me, and yet it is barely mentioned, focusing most time on the monster's journey and Frankenstein's regret.

I can understand few points of interest.  One is that the monster's treatment is a sad social commentary.  People say it's the start of the science fiction genre, but I simply don't see it.

g8eozs,Frankenstein by Mary Shelley rekindled my love for reading again,"It's probably a story you've heard countless times already but I suffered clinical depression for a couple years and during that time, a lot of my interests and passions died off. 

So long story short, I had Frankenstein for more than a year now that I bought but never picked up. So I decided to force myself to read again and I genuinely enjoyed it from start to finish!

To be honest, I started the book with the expectation that the story would be  like what I always see in pop culture. The sort of mad doctor who yells ""It's alive!"" after he created a green monster with screws embedded at the sides of its head. But the actual story was much deeper and way more interesting, and I'm glad that my shallow expectations were subverted.

I can see why Mary Shelley and her work are solidified in history. She writes in such a very articulate manner, adding so much depth and colorful detail to each of her sentences that it makes the book very engaging and gives the reader a good perspective on her characters' thoughts and emotions.

I'd like to share a very good example of this, which is found in chapter 4, during the construction of the monster:

>One secret which I alone possessed, was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed upon my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding places

It's such a creative and profound way of saying ""I worked tirelessly day and night on this monster"" that it really gave me a good long lasting impression early on in the book.


I could go on and on about this book to be honest, there's so much ideas and themes presented in this book that I honestly couldn't let it go easily. I mean, I just doesn't seen fair for me to start with another book before I write a proper analysis and review of this book (Is it just me or do other people do this as well?).

Anyways, one last thing that I would like to talk about is the theme of loneliness that is portrayed by the monster of V. Frankenstein. I kind of relate to him deeply, I wasn't very lucky when it came to receiving a steady source of love, not even the familial kind of love. So for him to declare that he is the loneliest being by saying something along the lines of: ""Even Satan has his demons"", it really hurt me deeply and made me sympathize greatly for this creature. He just wanted to partake in the goodness and beauty that surrounds him, but the constant rejection turned him into the monster that the people judged him to be. 


TL;DR  Anyways, I've said a lot and this experience really taught me to love reading again and it left such a great impression on me. I highly recommend this book for those who haven't seen it yet, it really is amazing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g8eozs/frankenstein_by_mary_shelley_rekindled_my_love/,2020-04-26T13:54:08Z,28,91,books,Frankenstein,POST

k71ccp,Was Frankenstein’s Monster a sympathetic character when it was written?,"The thought occurred to me that Frankenstein, while one of the ‘classic’ and among the first horror stories in the genre isn’t even itself really horror, it’s a tragedy. If it were written today it would be science fiction and while I imagine it would win a Hugo I think it would probably not be met with much praise outside of the genre.

Were the people in Shelley’s time completely abhorrent to the Monster, or did they find sympathy in the figure the way that modern readers do?

wv483d,"I’m having such a fun time reading Frankenstein, but it’s not for the reason you’re probably thinking of","I’m reveling in the fact that Victor is such a dick. I was empathizing with him at first, I rolled my eye a bit when he kept insisting how ugly the monster it (seriously, he could not get through a single thought about the monster without mentioning how hideous it was), I was giggling at how silently dramatic he was during the whole Justine and William debacle - I get how the whole situation is very fucked up, but he kept crying and (I’m sure) making faces without telling people why he was the way he was.

But after the monster’s monologue on the mountain he completely turned his heel for me and became the full on villain of the story - like, this asshole heard through the whole story, somehow skipped all the parts about the humanity of his creation and refusing it the last shred of hope of ever getting acceptance from another being, and poor Clerval had to pay for his dumbass. And after that he still thought the next victim is NOT gonna be his loved ones but himself?

I don’t know if it’s Shelley’s intention, but aside from the big picture, his assholery really shines through during his incarceration in small doses too. He woke up, saw the nurse sitting beside him, immediately judging the shit out of her, “her countenance expressed all those qualities which often characterized that class”, then dramatically whined to her. Victor then pondered about Mr. Kirwin and how nice he had been, preparing the best room in the jail, and then this dickhead had the gall to quickly add that while it’s nice, it’s still “wretched” lmao. Mind you, he was, til that point, the number one suspect of a damn murder. 

A small, delightful bit: I cannot get over the moment when this scrawny 20-something-year-old dude faced his 8 feet tall monster on the mountain and screamed bloody murder to its face, fully intending to jump it right then and there. I have never seen a single Frankenstein film, which really helped my reading experience I think - every of his whiny monologue becomes 100 times more ridiculous in my head.

am0qgh,"Finished Frankenstein, here are my thoughts.","Hi all, as per the title i recently finished Frankenstein. I knew next to nothing about it, who wrote it, when it was written and how it would all end. Here are my thoughts:  

**Pacing**: I think the story had quite a slow start. I didn't need to read of hills upon hills flowing greenly down every mountain for the first third (or quarter, or whatever) of the book. Once i passed halfway and Frankenstein's monster was roaming around and doing stuff I though it was much better as the actual story moved along. It was also a bit annoying having to read a story in a story in a story.  

**Characters**: I felt the majority of the cast was repetitive, flat and 2D with exception of Frankenstein and his monster. Or perhaps it was the way they were described but they had golden hearts and rosy cheeks and beamed more than the sun in all their happiness and splendor when times were good and they were all wretched buckets of misery when things weren't. Or maybe what i'm trying to say is I couldn't connect to them at all, or felt nothing for them. I dunno. Frankenstein's monster was perhaps the best character, he had the most motive, more realistic feelings and i enjoyed reading his character.  

**Ideas**: I was disappointed when Frankenstein was finally created, i thought there would be build up and details, but there was not, and he was just born. I did like the moments of conflict such as Frankenstein's monster wanting a mate/woman/friend. It drew out all sort of questions from me. Is a creator responsible for the happiness of their creation? What is a creator responsible for? Is Frankenstein's monster more human or more monster? etc. I enjoyed some of the themes; loneliness, seclusion, playing god, guilt, etc. I feel some of those themes relate to Mary Shelley at that point in her life; she had a strong father influence in her life (strong father figure in the novel and no mother figure), created/had a baby and it died (Frankenstein created a monster and it too, supposedly died in the end or at least heavily indicates it), and had pangs of guilt (Frankenstein is riddled with guilt). But overall, i enjoyed the themes and ideas that Frankenstein played around with and alluded to.  

**Other things**: Wasn't really sure why Frankenstein never told anyone about his creation, or was he too full of pride and/or shame? He could have prevented deaths, slain the monster or at least have people on their guard? I'm not sure about the ending. I'm not convinced the monster should/must die, but i'm not seeing an alternative to that ending either.  


Overall, I'm happy I read it, I think there was a good story with interesting and thought-provoking themes behind it, although i feel it could be written better or edited further at the very least. I think Mary Shelley did well considering her age at the time and the period that Frankenstein was written in.  

What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/am0qgh/finished_frankenstein_here_are_my_thoughts/,2019-02-01T10:32:01Z,28,19,books,Frankenstein,POST
5uy4nb,Frankenstein,"I finished reading Frankenstein yesterday and, I can't help but feel sad. 

The story is told in a way that is easy to understand and there is alot of dialogue. It's told through letters at first, then biographical notes taken from Victor Frankenstein's account, then the last letters from the other character. He created the monster out of sheer, blind ambition, and because of this, he feared his own creation. 

To create a man so hideous in form and so massive, it frightened Victor. And the monster who has no name, he is not at fault for what he is and yearned for companionship and love like any other human being. But, when everyone scorns you for what you look like, you'd become angry and bitter. The monster even asked Victor to make him a woman, someone to love who had the same deformities as he. 

But Victor couldn't do it, he didn't want to spread his curse through future generations of procreation from his creation. Because of this, the monster robbed Frankenstein of everything and drove him into death. But, the monster felt severe remorse and, after his master passed, vowed to kill himself to free himself of misery and regret.

To me, this tale reminded me of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the hunchback being the object of humiliation and mockery because he was deformed and deaf from ringing the marvelous bell high in the church tower. A tragic hero is Frankenstein, and a tragic villain is his monster.

Frankenstein is always portrayed for the monster and how he murders people and even obtaining his bride. But, in the original story, his bride was destroyed by Frankenstein because he was scared that they would have kids that would cause misery as well. And even if he did make the woman, like God made Eve from Adam's ribs, both male and female monsters are forced to live in exile. Would she be more malignant and persuaded towards evil than he? Frankenstein refused to let that happen, even though he promised he would make his monster the companion after the monster told him his side of the story. To have a sentient being for a monster, it's an example of humanity and how we can be altered to destruction by the vices dealt to us. But the monster...Despite being made by the pieces of corpses and being hideous, he is still like everyone else. Human. Does he not deserve to be happy? To be able to pursue knowledge and love and freedom like anyone else? 

Why should anyone, even his creator, shun him? Just because he's ugly? That's silly! 

Sorry, this came out more like a rant but I had so much to say. I know Mary Shelley references Paradise Lost and other works as well as her own life, like when her little son William died and how she works that into her book. To me, it's like she's trying to illustrate how her child's life was taken away and the despair that ensues. Mary Shelley described how after listening to a philosophical discussion about life with Lord Byron and her husband Shelley, she had a horrible nightmare and upon her husband's constant encouragement, she made the Frankenstein tale. 

Anyway, what did you guys think of Frankenstein when you read it? And if you saw the old movies, how do they differ from the source material?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5uy4nb/frankenstein/,2017-02-19T12:59:22Z,22,13,books,Frankenstein,POST
94a0ut,Just finished Frankenstein. It was different than I expected.,"This book was nothing like what I expected. I figured I knew Frankenstein from pop culture but so many aspects that I thought were Frankenstein staples are apparently made up out of no where. This may contain spoilers so be aware.


First of all, in almost every pop culture reference I can think of the monster is shown as slow, lumbering, and dimwitted.
In the book he is faster, stronger, and more agile than a regular man. Additionally he speaks extremely eloquently, often in long detailed paragraphs.


I also initially thought a large portion of the book was about Frankenstein raising the monster and trying to teach it about civilization and culture. Turns out Frankenstein is immediately terrified at his creation and runs away. The monster, not knowing what else to do just sort of leaves and wanders off into the country side for TWO YEARS! I had to reread those pages a couple times to make sure I understood correctly that multiple years just passed while the monster sort of just figured stuff out on its own.


How the story was written is also unexpected. I thought it was written in the third person, as a factual telling of what happened. Instead the story is narrated to us through multiple narrators. A sailor, Robert Walton, tells us what was told to him by Frankenstein, who in turn narrates a large portion of his story as was told to him by the monster. What is lost in the translation? How reliable are these narrators?


The story is also much more active than I thought it would be, spanning many European countries, and the North Pole.


Going into it I also thought that generally, the stereotyped opinion of this book is that ""Frankenstein is the real monster."" Yes, Victor Frankenstein does seem to brush off his creation rather irresponsibly, and seems to make a lot of poor choices. I certainly think he isn't necessarily a hero in the story but he is also described by the main narrator as a saint.

The monster on the other hand, although very sweet and well meaning at first, and put into a terrible situation, literally kills multiple people because Frankenstein refuses to create a bride for him. Frankenstein is essentially a modern incel. He just wanted friends at first, and then a lover, and when he couldn't attain those things because of his hideous appearance he became extremely violent and vindictive.


Anyone else read it recently and find you were surprised too? Does anyone know where so many of these inaccurate pop culture references come from?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/94a0ut/just_finished_frankenstein_it_was_different_than/,2018-08-03T14:25:38Z,34,62,books,Frankenstein,POST

Most people identify deeply with the monster, seeing in him a poor children with a terrible father, but from a modern perspective you can find Frankenstein’s work noble, he is able to create life!

7abuto,Questions about my ‘Frankenstein’ analysis?,"Hi, I have a test coming up on Frankenstein in my AP Lit class, and I wanna make sure I fully understand it. I read it once with no prior knowledge of the book, then read it again with an analytical perspective in mind and this is what I’ve gathered pretty much:

1.) I feel as though the monster is supposed to be the “protagonist” for this per say. Even though he is bitter and evil, his is created pure. He is made bitter by public ridicule. Kind of like how we always root for Wile E. Coyote. Even though Wile is supposed to be ‘bad’ and eat and kill another character, we root for him, because of the roadrunners actions towards him, even though the roadrunner is just trying to live. So is the monster supposed to be the ‘good character’ who is turned evil?

2.) Is Mary Shelley trying to say humans shouldn’t play god? I get that it’s pretty obvious, but it’s just strange to me, because this was written far before the sci-fi genre was huge, and I can’t find any cases of life creation at the time of this book, so I would wonder why she would write such a thought provoking literary masterpiece, centered around a problem that didn’t exist at the time.

3.) Lastly, If Frankenstein’s monster truly felt remorse, then decided to kill himself at the end of the book, why didn’t he do it earlier? I get he feels remorse due to the revenge he took on Victor, but I feel like I’m missing something, and that this untold suicide is deeper than just “even evil can feel remorse.”

dy5oof,Another love letter to Frankenstein,"So I, like many before me, have recently read Frankenstein, Mary Shelly's incredible novel. 

And I love it to death. 

Couple of thoughts, spoilers involved:

* Book-to-movie adaptations are very difficult... But the Universal classic now seems to make a bit more sense.  Liberties are taken here and there(No mention of HOW the monster is crafted in the book, as opposed to a mad doctor taking body parts from corpses), but Karloff's brutish and clunky iteration makes sense now, because the monster was almost exactly the same way at the beginning of his creation, unfocused, mute, and horridly confused! 
* Loved how little the monster was described. Black lips, white teeth, watery eyes.... But everybody's mad reaction to the monster made me imagine what a living example of uncanny valley would look like.... So that's how I pictured the monster. 
* I loved Frankenstein's first reaction to the beast himself. We witness in the span of a few sentences, a man who is so in love with life and enamored by his achievements, turn into a raving lunatic who spends almost a year in an asylum! Just by looking at his creation, he goes crazy, and spends the rest of the book stressing over his being.... It's as if he has PTSD, that's how I imagined what was wrong with him.   

* The writing.... I loved it, but it's obviously a turn off for so many. Lot's of words, insanely eloquent, everybody talks like an astute and educated poet. I loved it, and would love to see it adapted for screen. 
* The monsters threat to Frankenstein when Franken destroyed the monsters female compatriot.... ""I will be there on your wedding night"".... Pure gold, for a book from the 1800's. I love how Frankenstein, so wrapped up in his own issues, thinks that that is a threat to him.... and not his wife. And on that night, beholding his dead wife, he looks out the window to see the monster there, smiling and laughing... genius and horrifying.

I love this book, I got a million other things I can write about it.... But oh well. Let's talk about it, eh?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dy5oof/another_love_letter_to_frankenstein/,2019-11-18T16:45:53Z,11,33,books,Frankenstein,POST
kv3lwl,Question about Frankenstein by Mary Shelley,"I just started reading and took a test for class I did fine on it but there is one question something along the lines of “What did victor build the body of his creation from?” (Paraphrased) which doesn’t make sense. 

The two choices I flipped between were:

1. Large body parts 

2. Fresh bodies 

I’m aware that large body parts is the (more) correct answer but I feel like they go hand and hand. 

Is there a quote that mentions the body being fresh or at least not entirely decomposed when Victor builds the creation? 

It just doesn’t logically make sense that the body would be decomposed while he’s attempting to create it. I’m picturing it just falling apart when he assembles it if it’s not fresh.

jua6yk,I'm finishing Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and I don't know if I like the phylosophy of this book,"Before I begin I would like to warn you I'm French so I might do some mistakes sorry about that. 

I'm reading Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (in English) for the first time and clearly one of the most known idea of the book is that one does not born a monster but is made a monster (in the case of the creature by the rejection of the humans). 
Although I think this idea might be true I don't know if I love it or not. 

I mean this idea makes me think about those serial killers who became bad because they suffured during their childhood. It is often explained in some documentaries as if it was an excuse for what they did. I think that having a terrible life is not an excuse for doing terrible things and I don't want to forgive them. 

That is exactly my ""problem"" with the creature in Frankenstein, I don't know if I despise him (even if the word despise might be too violent to express what I may feel) or if I feel sorry for him. I don't know if I want to forgive him.

Quite literally the only thing they talked about (or yelled and cried about) to each other was ""you bear me down like chains!"" ""I'm so alone!"" ""I made you wretch!"" ""I'm ugly!"" ""You killed all I loved!"" ""Give me a mate!"" ""Wretch!"" ""WRETCH!""

it became really exhausting, especially in the last third of the book.

Victor was annoying as well. He made a person. A literal. PERSON. and was surprised to see it walking about, deformed and huge, and he was surprised and frightened? Like, what did you expect was gonna happen? You saw what it looked like as you made it, and you didn't make a plan for what happened if/when it actually worked? Idiot.

I want to enjoy the story, I really really do. I came in blind, knowing only the hollywood version of Frankenstein and was really surprised that the whole ""it's alive!"" Scene not only really didn't happen, but the whole experiment took only like, what, a page? But Shelley's writing became super repetitive; a paragraph taking a whole page consisted of one sentence forwarding the plot, and the rest was describing the same scene or emotion using the same words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kx5qy3/i_just_finished_frankenstein_last_night/,2021-01-14T13:36:03Z,6,12,books,Frankenstein,POST
z2ryqd,Does anyone know the purpose of these superscript citations in my copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?,"I picked up a copy of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* from my local library recently, and there are these superscript numbers all throughout the book: https://imgur.com/a/CCJiUac

There are no footnotes or citations at the end of the chapter/book. I tried googling the publisher/edition and I can't find anything about a companion read-along that might contain the citations. Does anyone know what these numbers are referring to? Is this something anyone's seen before?

As an aside: the book was pretty cool. Definitely felt a little clunky reading the 18th century prose, but as a fan of Sci-Fi and fantasy it's fascinating to see the fingerprints that continue to weave themselves through modern fiction.

gcawp6,Mullings over Frankenstein by Mary Shelley [Review],"\- I always begin these reviews amazed at how pop culture and film can change a novel's characters, events and, at times, whole message. Recently, I've covered I Am Legend, I Robot, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, A Clockwork Orange, and so on... and am always tickled at the liberties taken by Hollywood to rework these classics- and often times their reworkings are what sticks in the minds of our society when reflecting on a character, or story! Case in point: Frankenstein. Most people, young or old, have been exposed to Frankenstein in some fashion, yet I'd be really interested to see how much about Mary Shelley's creation people truly know. I mean, there is still a contingent of people who believe ""Frankenstein"" is the name of the Monster. I was always taught, and envisioned, that Frankenstein's monster was slow, inarticulate, bumbling, timid, afraid of fire and so forth. That truly could not have been more incorrect, and I chastise myself for falling for pop culture re-creations. This Monster is mammoth, agile, fearing nothing but loneliness. Far from a bumbling oaf, HE IS MURDEROUS, and quite clever. He is eloquent, philosophic, capable of reflection, extreme emotion, and a surveyor of natural beauty. But, he absolutely is heinous, and I could see why The Monster became part of 19th century gothic horror lore.

\- Examining that this book was written circa 1818, it is interesting the amount of science and philosophy that is steeped within. The 1700's and 1800's were historical periods of exploration and scientific advancement, and as a fan of history, it is kind of neat to see the attitudes towards these subjects play out in this book. For example, I think of how the Theory of Evolution really wasn't polished until the mid-1800's, and how the absence of theories like this plays here in Shelley's writings. Dr. Frankenstein attempting to improve man toward a more immortal state by reanimating that which is already dead, decayed and degraded speaks of this. I just really find these little missing links (pardon the pun) in older books adds a historical value to them which make them more meaningful to me. I'd be interested to see if others feel the same.

\- I am unsure how Shelley intended us to feel about Victor Frankenstein, but I for one liked him and found him wholly undeserving of his fate. Yes, in being ""The Modern Promethius"" and trying to gift humanity with the fire of immortality, he seemingly angered the gods and birthed a hideous abortion of ""man"". But, to that extent was his folly, and I found myself trying to really understand the evil Victor had caused to deserve his misery. If curiosity and genius is evil, many more masters of the sciences should have met with a wretched end as well. Throughout the tale Victor is tender, affectionate to loved ones, humble, quite obviously intelligent, a gentle soul, strict and disciplined with his studies, a caring son... yet what a fate he is met with! This was quite a heartbreaking tale, so beware of melancholy if you desire to read this book. 

\-I have several questions which by no means take away from my enjoyment of the book. Firstly, Victor is extremely intelligent but... why could he not see the Monster was referring the Elizabeth when he told Victor he'd ""see him on his wedding night?"" And, why not tell his father, or Henry, or Elizabeth of his ""creation""? They had been so eager to help and understand him! Ughhhh Victor you killed me in that chapter. Also, no one better come at me with sympathy for the demon. I thought he may be misunderstood up until his first murder. After that, no way. He had the power to create ""his funeral pyre"" this whole time, if he were truly that of a good soul, he would have just done so after his incident with the cottagers. Yet, he waited until Victor's end. Bastard. Victor was right to break the deal with him. A trickster that deserved his misery.

\- I feel like I am always recommending books in these reviews, and it's because I've been reading the classics and have enjoyed them all. Frankenstein is no different. Put away your pre-conceptions about the Monster and enjoy this masterpiece. It is charged with history, science, philosophy and horror. It is a gothic piece, yet it is also wildly adventurous as the settings range from Switzerland, Germany, France, England, Russia and the North Pole. I didn't find the writing to difficult to comprehend, and taken in slowly, draws quite a vivid picture of the attitudes and the times of the early 1800's.

\- Frankenstein is the name of the Creator, not the Monster!

To be honest, when I picked up the book I wasn't expecting much beyond the cheesy monster story portrayed in pop culture. The intelligence and depth of the monster was incredible, and the whole sequence with the cottagers was brilliant.

The Penguin Instagram post pointed out that the 1818 edition is a symbol of feminist achievement.

j3vcp9,I found Frankenstein kinda hard to read,"I just finished the audiobook for Frankenstein, it's always been on my bucket list. The story was fine, a decent morality tale, monster story, allegory. Whatever else. But I found the prose so hard to get through. I understand the writing style is a product of its time, but it was like sitting through a 200 page version of the Declaration of Independence. Such wordy ways of saying simple things. I appreciate the writing style in short bursts, it's infinitely quotable. But I found it to be a real chore to get through the whole thing, and it's not even that long a book.

I guess I'm just venting. The only other book I've read from a similar time period was The Count of Monte Cristo, but I'm guessing the modern Robin Buss translation made it much more palatable.

97ay3e,Do you guys sympathize with Frankenstein or his so called monster,"I think Frankenstein is at fault for judging his creation solely upon his hideousness. But I guess its a natural reaction, because he was so lost in his frenzy for his magnum opus of a discovery, the end result shocked him. But after that the plot becomes so complex that you can take neither side of Frankenstein or his creation. During their second encounter he was enraged by the death of his beloved brother and Justine and his creation was angry at the humanity for judging him only for his disfigurement so he decided to revenge his creator who bestowed it upon him. I can also understand his creation reasons for requesting him to create a female version as he thought only a fellow disfigured person could love him unconditionally but on the other hand Frankenstein's reasoning that if he created a similar being he can never guarantee what the future entails as he explains that she might not like his first creation or wouldn't have the same temperament and this goes on.After finishing the novel I couldn't sympathize with just one of them and hate the other.

So, after going through various adaptions of Frankenstein including the manga version (which was really awesome). I finally read the one by Mary Shelly. It was really good. I still empathize with the Daemon. And what was up with the old English society. They hated ugliness, didn't they? Like Victor hated his own creation because he looked so ugly. Damn. And all the while I just felt the novel was justifying Victor's character (that's what I felt personally, although the author might've meant the opposite of it. I guess I'm not really good at this stuff). He shouldn't have abandoned it. Victor was a truly wretched creature.

x6cbwn,The monster of Frankenstein is a victim of negligence and an example of Nature vs Nurture. A discussion,"I've read Frankenstein several times, for my BA, before and after too. I always think of it as an example of nature vs nurture in the development of personality and how a person is not born bad but becomes so.  


  


You have this ""monster"" with not even a name, which says a lot, as a name would give him from the beginning a place in the world, and without it, he just becomes an addition to someone else ""Frankenstein's monster"".

  


At the beginning, he is a white canvas:

  


“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. I gazed with a kind of wonder. ""  (chp. 11)

  


Even after being deserted by his father:

  


""I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity"" (chp. 10)

  


But finds himself in a world that turns him away from the beginning for been different, who gives him the name of 'monster' before he even knows the meaning. He crashes with the cruelty of humans.

  


""You, my creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why should I pity man more than he pities me?"" (chp. 17)

  


And while yes, he becomes a murderer, what else would he have become when all he's known is hate?

  


After being seen as inhumane, the ""creature"" becomes so. Society does not welcome him, and all the good he might have been born with becomes a weakness against the hate and abuse that humans inflict on him.

  


“Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation."" (chp. 24)

45z93l,Frankenstein: Is it just me?,"I've read Frankenstein and I really enjoyed it. I've looked around at general commentary of it and like cars in GTA all of a sudden I find loads about Frankenstein. EXCEPT everything I've read so far comes from people who absolutely fucking hate Victor. Don't get me wrong I understand all of their points: Victor only really cares about himself and glory, moves away from home and never writes home, creates the monster and then leaves it to fend for itself. However despite all of Victor's flaws I still think he's a better person than the monster. I get that you're supposed to think that the creature is just a victim of circumstance and had Victor looked after him then everything would be fine but I can't see it. The monster goes off and lives in the woods for a while, life is tough sure but he manages. He gets an education of sorts, reads, learns to talk and all that. The monster recognises that he is obviously hideous, tries to be accepted but is rejected. I can understand that the monster would be angry (Heck, who wouldn't?) and I can understand why he might burn down a cottage. However my sympathy with him ends when he travels crosscountry to try and kidnap William, then frames Justine, then kills Clerval, and then kills Elizabeth. So what I'm asking is am I some freak of literature (Or Monster if you will) who just doesn't get it or are there other people like me who really think that the Monster is given much more praise than he deserves?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/45z93l/frankenstein_is_it_just_me/,2016-02-15T22:39:32Z,16,26,books,Frankenstein,POST

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the third and final discussion thread for the (first) October sub book club selection, *Frankenstein; Or the Modern Prometheus* by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley! This thread will be openly discussing everything in the novel. 

I was reminded this week that the fine folk over at r/ClassicBookClub also read through Frankenstein [not long ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/ClassicBookClub/wiki/index/frankenstein) and some of the prompts this week will borrow from their discussion points. If you have enjoyed this classic selection for book club and find yourself wanting more or simply desire additional opinions of Frankenstein from fellow bookworms, definitely visit this wonderful community.

Below are some questions to help start conversation; feel free to answer some or all of them, or go your own way and post about whatever your thoughts on the material.

1. What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?
2. How do you feel Frankenstein's understanding of free will changes over the course of his life and his studies? How does he apply this estimation to his own actions, to that of his creation, and to the potential mate for his creation that he ultimately refused to animate?
3. What morals do you feel Shelley wished to impart on her audience with this tale? For what purpose do you feel the novel was made to include the subtitle ""Or the Modern Prometheus?""
4. Why are Frankenstein and his monster both ultimately miserable, bereft of human companionship, and obsessed with revenge? In what ways are their respective demises similar or different?
5. Why do you feel Walton abandoned his journey in the end and how are his purported or true motivations revealed to his sister and to the audience?
6. What further reading, by Shelley or another author, would you recommend to someone who loved this novel and wants more?

Reminder that next week we will be reading the entirety of [The Yellow Wallpaper](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1952) by Charlotte Perkins Gilman then discussing the work on **October 29th**. *One day before this,* the AMA with professor Roger Luckhurst will take place - on **October 28th at 10am ET**.

fht91i,Just finished Frankenstein and Dracula back to back and I must discuss!(spoilers),"Had a post a few days ago Dracula. Really enjoyed the book and was excited to read it for a while. Loved the horror elements, the history, and seeing the birth of the modern day vampire tropes.

I didn’t have as high expectations for Frankenstein, but still wanted to read it since I knew it was another classic and never knew the full story. Wow- I was completely blown away. 

Dracula was a wonderful horror novel, but Frankenstein was just an incredible, depressing novel that constantly provoked philosophical dread. Of course I heard the story of Frankenstein and knew the age old adage “wisdom is knowing Frankenstein IS the monster”, but the book is so much more complex than those basic themes that it is known for. 

I love that you are constantly on a roller coaster of pity and frustration for both Frankenstein, and his monster. I pitied Frankenstein at times, and hated his decisions at others. I pitied the monster for being outcast, but still hated that he resorted to killing innocents to make up for it. 

And the entire time I’m left wondering: was Frankenstein *really* wrong? In many ways he was, for creating a child and then abandoning it and refusing to give it a chance. But when his monster showed clearly that it was capable of death and vengeance, it *killed* his brother, was Frankenstein wrong to refuse to create another? He was right, what if they didn’t get along and the female monster was violent and didn’t share his desire for peace? 

The whole time I just wanted him to create the second monster and go on with his life, but his logic actually made sense, and then seemed supported when the monster did go on a killing spree of innocents just for revenge.

What was interesting too is that in common media, the creation itself of Frankenstein’s monster is mentioned like it’s a big part of the novel, but the details of it really barely encompass a few pages. 

I really can’t stop thinking about this book. Pure excellence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fht91i/just_finished_frankenstein_and_dracula_back_to/,2020-03-13T03:24:27Z,17,36,books,Frankenstein,POST
e7d6qj,"Which version of Frankenstein do you prefer, the 1818 one or the 1831?","Mary Shelley published Frankenstein in 1818, with a second more successful edition in 1823 (and that already credited her work). The second version of the book (1831) comes from a revision by the author and a reaction towards the more critical and conservative lectures of the novel, warning about the dangers of unchecked scientific progress in an attempt to reach a utopian and unexisting future, and with a more fabulistic tone. Whether the first version was more realistic and explores the psicological depth of its characters more, treats the Monster more humanly and remains with some of its radical and strange plot points to further deeper into the ideas of responsibility and social perception. Neither is objectivity better but the second one seems to be more culturally successful, given how many works adapted it and ignored the first version. But I can't help but love the original. It's more creative and weird, and wasn't influenced by the critics that tried to simplify the original's value because Shelley was a woman or whatever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/e7d6qj/which_version_of_frankenstein_do_you_prefer_the/,2019-12-07T11:14:38Z,13,75,books,Frankenstein,POST

iwoepp,Can someone help explain this passage in Frankenstein?,"This is the passage that I’m struggling to understand: 

“Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.” 

My interpretation is that research that Victor compiled was still early enough to inform his pursuit in re-animating a lifeless object, rather than prove that he could already do so. This points to him saying that his research is still akin to a “glimmering” and “ineffectual” light, not a strong and confident one. 

Is this the “correct” interpretation? 

Shelley also has the line, “Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.”

fpe2q7,"Fans of Frankenstein, I finally found it, a faithful adaptation!","If you’ve read Frankenstein, I’m sure you know how different the film adaptations and the original are, but I finally found an adaptation that is remarkably close to the source material. It’s called Frankenstein: A New Musical, and the music/live performance is available on YouTube. It shares many of the same themes as the novel but doesn’t feel like a carbon copy either. The ending is sort of weird, but I’d highly recommend the musical to fans of the book who want to see a live rendition of the classic story.

javhra,Frankenstein and its influences on modern pop culture (TLOU 2 and Star Trek TNG)," I recently finished reading Frankenstein in the original 1818 text. I expected it to be quite plain when I went in, but I could relate many of the themes and structure to what I have seen in films, video games, and television shows. Spoilers to the book ahead.

 The Last of Us Part 2 is one of the biggest and most controversial games of 2020, and deals with a similar theme of pursuit of revenge that ends in destruction. The game is split into two parts played from the point of view of each character involved in the conflict, Ellie and Abby. In the end, the player is left thinking about the actions taken by the characters and caught in sympathy for both tragic stories of conflicting characters. This structure now feels like it was pulled straight from Shelley's 200 years-old novel, which had the perspectives of both Frankenstein and his Creature from the first person. The objective viewing of each character leaves a lot to think about in the end, which is by no measure a clear and unambiguous conclusion. The lessons that characters in both books learn, or do not learn, from the pursuit of revenge and violence also contribute to the way readers and players might feel in the end. The story of Ellie and Abby very much reflect the story of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature in the third volume of the book.

 Star Trek TNG characters Data and Lore obviously took inspiration from Frankenstein, especially the latter character. Lore is an android, created by Dr. Soong. He has far superior intelligence and physical strength compared to humans, and is capable of feeling emotion. Sound familiar? It gets better. The colonists who lived with Lore were afraid of him, because he was so eerily human despite being an artificial lifeform. Resentful of this treatment, Lore devastates the entire colony. Frankenstein's creature is much the same. He too, is an artificial life form despised by humans for no good reason, and he is driven to violent acts by this treatment. Both characters seek and exact revenge on their creators for giving them life, emotions, and qualities by which humans are repelled. Lore's story was clearly inspired by that of Frankenstein's Creature. Star Trek is different in that it goes on to show how Lore turns out after the death of his creator, unlike Frankenstein, which I very much appreciate.

 Frankenstien really surprised me, as it just kept giving me things to relate it to from modern pop culture. I highly recommend this book, just for the value it seems to hold in inspiring media we consume today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/javhra/frankenstein_and_its_influences_on_modern_pop/,2020-10-14T06:32:28Z,6,12,books,Frankenstein,POST

ao3wiu,The average English teacher would rail Frankenstein if it was written today,"Massively over-expository. A man on an Arctic expedition writes to his sister, and in the middle of his letter says ""let me tell you my life's story""! His own sister! Nothing he says is relevant to anything, and worse, it's riddled with some of the clunkiest sentences I've ever read.

*""But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil.""*

...The absence of the object of this ""want"", I gather. I'm generally fine with ""old books"" but good god I feel like I need to bring myself back to grammar lessons to understand some of this. It isn't flowery in a good way; It's sentences like this that cause English teachers to warn students to avoid ""flowery language"" because they aren't capable of writing that well.

And when Victor Frankenstein finally snaps out of it to tell his story, his two-hundred page story being related by a sailor in a letter to his sister, how does he start? By relating the story of his parents before even reaching himself, along with explaining when and how his siblings showed up.

While I find this frustrating, I'm still going to read the book, and I imagine I might end up enjoying it. It's just been making me think about the insistence that modern literature must avoid expository dialogue and must be written as simply as possible, or at least succinctly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ao3wiu/the_average_english_teacher_would_rail/,2019-02-07T13:49:06Z,12,0,books,Frankenstein,POST

fvm2m0,"The divine and the dreadful in Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus'.","After *Chocolat* I decided to move on to an entirely different genre, so I picked up *Frankenstein* and surprisingly, it turned out to be a far longer read than I expected.

This book (the 1821 edition) is far beyond any criticism, and is rightfully accepted as a classic. Still, during the course of my reading, I cherished certain aspects and loathed some, which I felt to put up on this platform to hear the opinions from a wider audience.

First, the divine;

- Even before it identifies itself to be a work of science fiction, *Frankenstein* is a work of literature; and it is equal parts astonishing and inspiring to see a novel from the 19th century to be so ahead of its time, not only in terms of its plot, but its style of narration. It consists of multiple layers of narration; beginning with the letters of R. Warton, to the stories of Frankenstein himself, to the conversations and letters in Frankenstein's narration.

- Perhaps, the beauty of the book lies in the name itself; *The Modern Prometheus*. It took me quite some time to decipher this metaphorical word play, and in the end realised Victor Frankenstein himself to be the representation of the Greek Titan, who stole the power of the gods (*fire* in mythology, *life* in the book) and suffered its consequence not hastily, but in intermittent periods of time throughout their lifetime.

Now, the dreadful;

- At the time when the book was first published and henceforth, readers might have enjoyed the concept of multiple narrations (as do I) so that they have overlooked a certain detail; as I move in from one narration to another, there is no change in the tone, dialect, rhythm and precision of the text. To explain it better, When Warton is writing letters about Frankenstein's narration to his sister, we expect Warton to forget certain aspects of the story skip the unimportant parts. But no; despite the clever change of narration, the dialogue remains the same. This, in my opinion is an inaccuracy.

- Throughout, the second half of the book I had but one question hovering over my mind; what was the role of Safie (the Arabian girl) in the whole book? Yes, Felix, Agatha and their father have contributed to the monster's knowledge of the world, but I feel Safie's story was irrelevant to the story and would cast no change over the plot if removed. Same follows for Frankenstein's vivid descriptions of nature; they were irrelevant to his narration (to Warton) and Warton's letter (to his sister).

Nevertheless, these are my own anguishes, and need not flatter your opinion about the book. Above all, I've learnt about how, even what we perceive as a daemon craves for a speck of *humanity* which humanity fails to show him as an utterly disappointing reflection of itself.

Happy reading to everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fvm2m0/the_divine_and_the_dreadful_in_mary_shelleys/,2020-04-05T21:45:32Z,3,8,books,Frankenstein,POST

6jm0dc,Has anyone here read all of Mary Shelley's novels? How did they compare to Frankenstein?,"Let me start off by saying that I love Frankenstein.

Based on my wiki reading of Shelley, she wrote a decent number of novels, yet I've never heard of them. Apparently she wrote an apocalyptic novel titled The Last Man which sounds interesting but was universally panned by her contemporaries. Would I enjoy reading her other novels (including The Last Man) the same way I enjoyed Frankenstein or are they less impressive?

I also wanted to ask if many themes overlap among her books (much the same way that Jules Verne's novels tend to maintain similar themes (I read and loved them all though)).

9jei8r,The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein by Kiersten White,"Rating: 4.75
Link: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38255342-the-dark-descent-of-elizabeth-frankenstein

A book will always start at 3.00/5.00 for me. What happened here was 3-4-5-4-5-4.75

I guess this is fairly biased as I have always leaned towards this type of genre/theme: dark, psychological, female protagonist

I have always been partial to dark themes but for some reason, authors seem to interpret this genre as a bdsm fantasy for some reason. It's not, btw. Other books that executed this theme well enough either as it central theme or merely just a subtheme are Grisha Trilogy (Leigh Bardugo), King's Cage(Victoria Aveyard), Six of Crows series(Leigh Bardugo) and A Long, Fatal Love Chase (Louisa May Alcott) 

This book pretty much has many things I've been looking for. It fed me what I've been starving of and made me feel what I wanted. 

Good narration, preferred theme and right execution. Of course, this will get a high score from me. 

The reason it kinda lost a 0.25 is because it failed to make me feel what I NEEDED to feel.

I like the characters and the protagonist is not whiny and annoying. 😊

3pf0o1,Frankenstein; The Modern Prometheus...? Did I get the Prometheus bit right?,"So I didn't want to google this but formulated my own reasons why the story correlates to Prometheus. Before I begin: I didn't study this book in school, I don't really know anything about it (he doesn't even say *'It's alive'*...I was really expecting that). So I'm going into this knowing virtually nothing about it, only reading it as a standard reader would any decent, classical book, not in an academical setting. That means that if I'm way off the mark, don't be mean, let me down gently.

So, knowing Prometheus story (which I know from Greek myth not the damn film); Prometheus gave fire to the humans, which lead to war and death, and for it Prometheus was punished by the Gods again and again.

So Frankenstein is Prometheus. And instead of fire he gifts (almost) the ability to reincarnate life. By doing so he almost sets up himself up as a god - like Prometheus. And then his punishment comes again and again in the form of the many deaths he then has to endure. I think there's something in there about the monster (his own creation - his fire: which brought death to the humans) killing all of his loved ones. 

Also, whereas Prometheus stole fire from the Gods, Frankenstein steals electricity in the form of lightning. I think that's the tie, that's the missing link between the story of Prometheus and Frankenstein.

Ever since I opened the book and saw 'A modern Prometheus' I've just been wondering what it means, and this is the only solution I can stumble. I 100% expect I'm way off the mark - but it's always nice to give it a go, no?

No? Guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3pf0o1/frankenstein_the_modern_prometheus_did_i_get_the/,2015-10-19T23:07:33Z,12,5,books,Frankenstein,POST

  Frankenstein : The Horror Beyond Man
 
September 12th
 
I am finally returning to England. I have lost a dear friend  which I will explain with such horrifying details. Three days ago, the ship freed itself of the surrounding ice and began to move on the 11th where an open passageway heading south appeared. Sailors cheered with ardor ; I could not deny their request to return to England for I could not lead them into further calamity, but my dear friends time was quickly passing by and at most a day or two was left before he rest his soul in peace. He called onto me and as I came to his side. He said, “ I have no more strength inside of me to finish the promise I have tried to procure: To finish off this most atrocious and evil creation which I  created and greatly deplored after. Alas! I can do nothing now. I am weak and ill, ready for death to appear and take me at any moment! I hope you, Walton, will take on my promise to efface this indefatigable monster who has caused these desponding feelings upon me and a horrifying end to others. And when you do reach England, do remember to share the story I have told you, so that perhaps others could understand my anguish and despair.” I reluctantly responded, “I will do my best to share this tale, but I will find it easy for them to think of this as a incredulous tale.” Frankenstein replied, “There are those who will not believe it, but there will be those who will. As for now, I fear that this creation will take me away at my weakest moment, when nothing is left of me, so that he could end me off with the final satisfaction of this unforgiving battle. Promise me one last thing, Walton, that you will not allow him to capture my body so that it could rest in the mountains of Geneva, where in the bright blue sky the gentle wind blows against the verdure and the flock of sheep rush towards the river near a small hut to fulfill their thirst.” Hours passed by as Frankenstein’s conditions worsened and most of the sailors went to bed. The more I heard Frankenstein, the more I wanted to tell other of his story. I had gone out onto the deck to look at the night sky and not to discompose Frankenstein.. A dark, gloomy night where winds were low and precipitous glaciers rise higher than the ship itself. If it were only warm it would have been a very amiable sight of the frozen and calm sea. I spent a mere half an hour before returning to Frankenstein’s room from the cold icy air. It was in the middle of the night when we both heard turmoil coming from the deck of the ship. Suddenly, one of the sailors up late at night made a shrieking noise and a quick silence came after. My heart started to throb and I glanced at Frankenstein, whose eyes were filled with terror, then whispered “Oh Walton! Here he comes! You must do something quickly before h…” and his words were cut off by the sound of the door violently bursting open. A multifarious and hideous monster appeared. His distorted face looked furious with a large rugged body and skin with the color of dark moss. He execrated with provocation “You! You could have taken care of me, taught me the ways of the world, giving me acts of benignity! Instead, your silly determination brought upon me these paroxysms of misery! Why?7 I gave you countless chances to cease your pursuit for my destruction but you did not choose wisely. And now I shall deliver the same malignity you yourself have given me in the past.” The creation lunged towards his only target: Frankenstein. He put his large hand around his neck and started to tighten it. Frankenstein started to choke, gasping for help ; I cried out for help and grabbed a nearby book, striking the monster across the head in hopes of getting him off. The monster was startled by the sudden attack and fell back onto the wooden wall of the ship, giving out a moan of despair. In these moments I felt a burst of effusions running throughout my body, a feeling of courage and repugnance to fulfill my friend’s absolution. I once understood this creations reasons for all his unhallowed acts, but I felt no more pittance. I had to protect this vessel from grave danger. The monster stood up and gazed at me in interest, as if I was not to protect my friend. With no conciliation, I stood up, blocking his way towards Frankenstein’s final living hours. The monster, looking dilatory at first, then grabbed me with powerful hands and threw me across the room. My fragile body hit the wooden wall right by the open door feeling a burst of pain on my left side; I suddenly felt weak and smitten with fear. I trembled with terror while the monster approached Frankenstein once more. One sailor, a tyro, ran through the door and saw me, immediately kneeling over by my side. He looked horrified by the sight of the monster. Multiple other sailors came through the room, gasping at the sight of the monster. The sailors were shocked - gazing at the also shocked monster. Before the pandemonium was over, I saw the monster grab Frankenstein, who looked at me with weary and liquid-filled eyes. He let out one sorrowful mourning wail, almost sounding human, and jumped out of the window into the cold night with Frankenstein in his hands, never to be seen again. “That,” I told the sailor, “was Frankenstein’s monster,” moments before blackness engulfed me.

You can ask me anything about the genre – and here also to focus on those specific classics, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The Yellow Wallpaper. AMA!","I’ve been teaching the Gothic and Science Fiction at university for over 25 years here in London, and I’ve edited classics such as Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker’s Dracula and H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine. I’ve written books about topics that range from the invention of the concept of telepathy to the history of the science fiction genre, and short books on the films Alien and The Shining. Princeton University Press asked me to do an illustrated history of the Gothic, which is just out for this Halloween, and tries to cover the whole field, from start to finish. I’m up for the challenge for you to Ask Me Anything about the genres of Gothic and Horror – but also, we thought people might like a narrower focus too: so ask me about Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper. The Female Gothic is a whole tradition in itself, one worth exploring!

2. Should Frankenstein's monster have tried more in interacting with people (he had tried it only twice: with an old man and his children and with a little boy) before he had started killing them?

At the same time, Dr. Faustus incites sympathy from us, so I was wondering what makes such similar characters appear so different.  Thoughts?

My personal take is class difference; Dr. Faustus is ""base of stock"" and works to become an accomplished polymath, exchanging that for the easy life, which seems fair. Frankenstein on the other hand, is born with the golden spoon in his mouth and chooses to exchange that for misery and oodles of self loathing in pursuit of knowledge.

6do0v0,"Hello! I'm Simon Thalmann, author of the kids adventure/horror series ""Professor Nightmare Recommends,"" and I just released book two: ""Frankenstein and the Monster""! I'm back to do an [Author Spotlight] on writing for kids, self-publishing, cover design and anything else you want to talk about. AMA!","Hey, r/books! It's good to be back! I'm here this time around because I just released the second book in my kids adventure/horror series ""Professor Nightmare Recommends,"" titled ""Frankenstein and the Monster."" The concept behind the series is to introduce kids to classic works of horror fiction they may encounter later in high school or college at a younger age, in a fun way so they're perhaps not as intimidated by reading them when they come across them later in school. Reminiscent of the ""Magic Tree House"" or ""Time Warp Trio"" books, the books center on three fourth grade classmates who get magically pulled into a book written by the mysterious Professor Nightmare. Each book in the series sees the kids pulled into a different book, where they have to learn about the plot and other literary devices in order to get back home. This time around they get pulled into Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein""; in book one it was Shakespeare's ""Hamlet.""

I call the books ""horror"" but it's more spooky adventure than it is scary, particularly for older kids, but there are ghosts, monsters and (hopefully) funny dialogue throughout. I started writing the series with my then almost-7-year-old daughter and her friends in mind, but the books would probably be most appropriate for kids 5 to 10 or so. Ages 8 and 9 are the likely sweet spots, depending on the individual's reading level. 

You won't get too lost if you read book two without reading book one, but if you want to catch up on the series you can click here to read a PDF of book one: [""Hamlet and the Ghost King""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uxomdx3c0h3bu28/Hamlet%20and%20the%20Ghost%20King%20by%20Simon%20A.%20Thalmann.pdf?dl=0)

j1a18t,"I just finished reading The Shining. Wow, no wonder Stephen King hated Kubricks movie.","Stephen King has a long history of poor adaptions, but The Shining might be the worst offender.(And yes, I've seen all of King's movies, even Dark Tower)

The Book has such warmth, such love for family, and Jack's struggle. Danny is a complex character, as is Wendy.  None of the actual scary spooky monster stuff happens until near the end...and that's brilliant. 

I know this book was near and dear to King due to his own drinking problems.  I also know authors sometimes tend to get a little heated about adaptions and it's overblown sometimes. Not in this case.

Kubrics movie, while an enjoyable watch, has lost all flavor to me after reading the book. It's liked someone ready a summary and bullet point presentation, but missed the entire point.

I finally decided to read it after watching Doctor Sleep and loving it.  Decided to read them both. I know Kings books are often pretty different than their TV or Movie Adaptions, but this one...wow.  It feels so shallow now. Jack in the movie feels crazy from the start, ready to murder his own family at the drop of a hat.

In the book, his struggle is so heartwrenching.  His desire to be a better man. To resist the hotel. Seeing him ultimately lose in the end, knowing it was coming because of the movie and Dr.Sleep of course, I still was like ""Please don't do it Jack, resist!"", I couldn't help myself.

It really touched me on an emotional level, Jacks internal monologues.  I don't drink or have kids, but it resonated with me so strongly, the feeling put into those.

Instead Kubrick made it a generic horror movie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j1a18t/i_just_finished_reading_the_shining_wow_no_wonder/,2020-09-28T11:09:35Z,1703,19272,books,The Shining,POST

They don’t show the hotel manipulating Jack barely at all. Ullman is totally different. The characters are barely explained or fleshed out. The Danny and Dick Hallorann conversation is just a one-way show in the movie that doesn’t seem to have much consequence at all. The ending in the book is so much better in my opinion too.

uffvs5,The Shining is amazing!,"After finishing Haunting of Hill House I needed to scratch my reading itch so I ended up with The Shining after a recommendation from my mum as I waited for my other books to arrive.

I gotta say the book is absolutely phenomenal! I found myself lost in the pages countless times almost in a trance like state  just envisioning what I was reading.

I love how descriptive Stephen King is, he's great at building up tension and fear for the reader. I also loved how he gives glimpses into the characters thoughts without taking us away from the story. I have a whole heap of Stephen King books that I'm now looking forward to reading due to my mum being a huge fan. 

If you haven't read the book but watched the film definitely take your time and read the book as it's so different and a great read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uffvs5/the_shining_is_amazing/,2022-04-30T17:32:41Z,60,220,books,The Shining,POST
wfg3rv,"[Minor Spoilers] I finally started reading Stephen King and started with The Shining. It's great, but I wasn't expecting such a relatable story about struggling with alcoholism.","I've always kind of rolled my eyes at traditional alcoholism narratives. Too often, they follow the cliché of a character who ""drinks to forget"" some traumatic event in their life and is eventually cured at the end when they either fall in love with a woman or vow to change after they do something tragic to or around a loved one. I recently encountered this a well-known book series that I won't name just to avoid contention. While the latter situation does happen in The Shining, the book understands that Jack didn't cure what *caused* his need to drink.

In The Shining, Jack Torrance's drinking problem begins like mine did, where I would use the effects of alcohol to calm my racing mind and settle my edginess. While I never got blackout drunk or drove drunk, I almost always had a buzz or a tipsiness in any off hours of the day as it meant that I didn't have to deal with the more intense aspects of my depression or anxiety. It didn't help anything that I spent my teens and twenties working in kitchens with other alcoholics in a stressful and depressing environment. This created an atmosphere where regular drinking was perfectly acceptable to my peers.

When I finally quit drinking on my 29th birthday, I felt good for a year, just like Jack did. It wasn't difficult to notice that I had extra money in my pocket, a slimmer figure and better skin, and that I was now around different people who weren't put off by me always being buzzed or tipsy. Unfortunately, impulses and urges returned. Like Jack, my racing thoughts would make me irritable and I'd snap at people who would ask me too many questions or wouldn't understand that I can't relay what my ADHD-addled mind was thinking at any time. I'd get very upset over perceived offenses like Jack does with Ullman and go on self-destructive behavior over my desire for some kind of revenge or perceived justice.

I developed physical ticks like Jack's mouth-wiping, all of which gave me the urge to drink in order to quell them. Quitting cigarettes made it all even worse. I relapsed during the 2020 shutdown when I was working nothing but 12 hour shifts as an ""essential"" $11/hr. employee in a sweltering factory, which meant I could drink six pounders of beer a night and not gain any weight. Long story short, the factory's management got rolled out for gross mismanagement and the new CEO raised our pay and added mental health coverage to our company plan, so I'm now in a position where I'm off alcohol again and working on the issues that cause my addiction.

This is all to say that it's actually really heartening to see a book get things right, or is at least is relatable to my experiences. Sometimes it's really helpful to see a tragic storyline that you can relate to in a real, tangible way as it feels like the person writing it is sympathizing with you when nobody else around you can understand. On the other hand, it can be really disheartening to see a story get something like this so wrong to the point that it honestly feels kind of isolating.

I don't know how to close this out besides the fact that I'm now staring down my mom's copy of The Stand that she loaned to me.

P.S.: While the Shining movie is impressive, I can understand why King was unhappy with it. It really just feels like a slasher movie with really impressive cinematic choices attached to it. I've always been kind of either hot or cold when it comes to Kubrick. I don't share King's love of the miniseries he worked on, though.

Oh, I'm also reading Twilight because I had to finally know what the deal is, and it's not what I expected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wfg3rv/minor_spoilers_i_finally_started_reading_stephen/,2022-08-03T19:47:17Z,159,1848,books,The Shining,POST
18bwktu,The Shining and bastardry of Jack Torrance,"I’m almost finished with it. Jack is such a selfish, arrogant bastard! I love King’s writing of him. He goes so deeply and clearly into the mind of a broken, self-indulgent, pitiful abuser. He’s just so perfectly written. I know that there are supernatural forces at work on him, but they’re not using anything that wasn’t already there, waiting for any source of extreme stress to erupt from him in terrible or petty bursts of violence.   

I just find myself gritting my teeth and building hatred for him, steadily, as the story unfolds and his awful, childish, completely self-absorbed rage is painstakingly uncovered layer by layer with a narrative archeologist’s brush. I do, of course, have some pity for him. He’s the broken remnants of a man who was spiritually murdered by his father and just doesn’t know it yet and goes on and on bringing his father to anyone that loves or helps him.  

Point of this post is that I hate him! That’s all! He’s just making me so angry, page after page. I want to grab him and shake him and give him his fucking medicine! Every drop! That’s what he needs!

enqb6i,Stanley Kubrick was able to adapt The Shining in a remarkable way.,"**Spoilers for this 43 year old book and 40 year old movie**

I just finished reading The Shining for the first time, after finishing Doctor Sleep and realizing that some plot points in Doctor Sleep rely on you having read The Shining ... and not just seeing the movie.  

And you really can’t just see the movie. Kubrick was able to make a classic by retelling King’s story and changing **so much of it.**. I loved the novel, but I realized when I finished it that almost every iconic scene of Kubrick’s movie are **not** in the book. 

Blood elevator. Not in the book

The outdoor maze. Not in the book. 

The twins.  Not in the book.  

Here’s Johnny.  Not in the book.  

Danny isn’t here Mrs. Torrence. Not in the book. 

The iconic carpet is jungle themed in the book. 

I am just astounded at how much the source material changed and yet how good of a story he still told.  In a world of Eragon’s and Percy Jackson’s, I’m just blown away at how well the adaptation worked. 

Now I just want a mini-series that’s true to the book.  It would be an entirely different story so people wouldn’t really struggle too much by comparing it to Kubrick’s film and I think it would do really well.  HBO, get on it. 

(I admit I haven’t seen the 1997 miniseries, but my understanding is that I shouldn’t).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/enqb6i/stanley_kubrick_was_able_to_adapt_the_shining_in/,2020-01-12T17:26:20Z,177,436,books,The Shining,POST
io5052,Just finished reading The Shining and now understand the hate for the movie adaptation.,"First off, Wow. What an awesome reading experience that was. I enjoyed this book from start to finish and am grateful to SK for the enrichment to my life since starting to read. 

** Possible Spoilers From Here On **

The atmosphere of this book was astounding. I have never read the book before and only ever depended on movies - which I now know is a bad idea - to fill the gap.

The movie really never puts across just how alive the actual hotel is. It's not just a few ghosts and a man going crazy with cabin fever like the movie seems to suggest but the whole thing had its own life and presence.

Also you get no sense of just how powerful Danny is and how grown up a 5 year old has to be in this terrible situation the family find themselves in.

I also enjoyed how Dick had a much more important role in the rescue. The movie really was dire on this aspect.

It's crazy how a movie i once saw as a masterpiece of cinema can really just dissolve into the floating turd it really is when compared to the novel. There is no wonder SK hated it,it missed out so much of what this book really was about... I mean what the hell is the talking index finger all about (Tony).

I'm am just so grateful and thankful that I'm finally able to read these books after such a long time of basically being in the dark and missing out on this whole new world of enjoyment. (anyone wondering why see my old post, it's a long story)

Anyway, amazing read and experience. Now on to Night Shift 😁


EDIT.. Having discused this with everyone here I feel I may have treated the kubrick movie a little too harshly. I think I was just on a high from finishing the book last night and vented my frustrations perhaps too quickly. I'm glad you guys have helped me process better and understand they're both good in their own separate ways. I take back the floating turd comment I made above.

EDIT 2.. Seeing as this post seems to be getting a lot of traction I just want to state that this was by no means intended to disrespect anyone else's opinions, just meant as a discussion and my own opinion on having just finished the book. 

Great discussion though guys 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/io5052/just_finished_reading_the_shining_and_now/,2020-09-07T10:21:50Z,249,270,books,The Shining,POST
18zo5wh,Just finished the Shining by Stephen king,"Great book much better than the film I’ve been reading a lot of books lately at a strangely fast pace I read Frankenstein in one sitting the other week and I finished reading Carrie on the 1st of January.
 And I’ve read this in about 3 days. I really enjoyed the book and I saw Jack as a more sympathetic character who had problems and was torn apart by the hotel and my favourite characters were Danny and Halloran.
 I honeslty felt kind of sad when Jack started to go crazy and when he died. 
As it seemed like he could be saved at the end if he could stop being cursed by the hotel and I enjoyed his character before they got to the hotel. Also I just feel weird for the fact that I have done nothing with my free time but read.

 It feels wrong and out of character for me also I’m feeling a bit sad that the books over I really enjoyed Danny and Halloran and it’s weird because I’ve never felt like that about a book before.

upyct9,The Shining,"Just finished The Shining. All I have to say is… wow. I’m the kind of person who’s brain really gets into books. This one only took a couple days to get through cause I had to keep putting it down to digest what was happening. I’ve only read a couple of Stephen King books, but I really enjoy his work. I never know what’s going to happen. 

The way that Jack slowly became part of the hotel. The fact that there was not one drop of liquor in the entire hotel, but he still got drunk because that’s how the hotel needed him. The way that Danny knew that the hotel was bad, but hey, he’s just a kid, of course his parents wouldn’t believe him. It was crazy how he got through to Dick all the way in Florida. And Dick’s willingness to go through all of that trouble just to help the kid. Wendy fighting for her life against Jack to save her son even after she had her back and ribs broken. Danny outsmarting Jack with the boiler and all of them narrowly escaping. And then the hotel trying to get Dick to kill them instead when they were trying to escape. My mind is just a blown right now. Kind of like the Outlook (haha) 

I have a whole shelf of Stephen King books from my mom, and I can say with confidence that I will probably read them all.

zn24oe,Reading The Shining made me like the movie less.,"I really love the depth they go into the family, where Jack seems genuinely remorseful about what he did to Danny and his drinking. Wendy seems to be a strong and loving mother/wife. His descent into madness was great, because he just keeps slipping and recovering, before giving in.

134xlmd,The Shining by Stephen King really messed me up.,"After years and years of putting it off, I finally decided to read **The Shining** because I really wanted to watch or read **Doctor Sleep** and knew I would miss something’s if I didn’t read the original. I avoided reading it this entire time because the movie is one of my favorite films ever, and felt like that satisfied my need to read the book. I am so glad I decided to read it, I definitely rank it pretty high on my list of Stephen King books. I cannot believe how many plot points were left out of the Stanley Kubrick film. I still love the movie, but where the movie lacked in emotion and minor themes, the novel excelled. King’s description of “getting on the wagon” and the agony of alcoholism was perfect. The suspense of the creeping boiler stayed in the back of my mind throughout the entire book.

One thing that really struck deep with me is the ‘becoming your parents’ theme. I love my Dad with all my heart, but he can be cold, harsh, and mostly emotionally unavailable. These are traits that I have loathed as long as I can remember. While reading **The Shining**, I started to relate to Jack in the most innocent way possible. I see so much of my dad in my actions. I am starting to become so self conscious to the way I speak to my loved ones and hyper-aware of any behavior that reminds me of my father. I am very grateful that my dad wasn’t as brutal as Jack’s, and that I’m not being brain washed by a hungry hotel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/134xlmd/the_shining_by_stephen_king_really_messed_me_up/,2023-05-01T18:43:07Z,41,130,books,The Shining,POST

Also I feel like it was so long for just almost nothing happening in the first like 500 pages. Also it wasn’t scary at all like I had read reviews of it and people were saying it made them pee their pants it was so scary but I finished it at night on Halloween and nothing I put it down and was just upset that I wasted my whole October reading this book that I thought would be scary and it wasn’t when I could’ve read an actual scary book.

ydcmxw,Reading The Shining at 30 vs at 14,"I decided to to a reread of The Shining this month in honour of spooky speason. The last (and first) time I read it, I was 14. Since then I have watched the movie several times, and there is a lot that is not touched upon from the book. 

I feel like I understand so much more of the underlying context now than I did as a young teenager. Jack is an extremely unreliable narrator, he is constantly contradicting himself, even lying to himself. If it were not for Wendy's POV, I don't think I'd trust that he and Al Shockley didn't actually kill a kid that night when they hit a bike while driving drunk. 

So much of what happens in The Shining is psychological in nature rather than physical. You really get a sense of Jack's slow decline into madness, of the hotel getting into his psyche and taking over. There is a ramping up of tension throughout the book that is very palpable near the end of the book. 

I had completely forgotten that in the end, the one the hotel wanted was Danny. That Danny's shine would have enabled the hotel to become something much different than the shade it was. 

It's actually pretty heartbreaking. Danny is only 5, but he has already been exposed to so much darkness because of his 'gift'. Jack fought so hard to be better for his family and it seemed to be working, until the hotel gets it's hooks into him. In the end he manages to fight through one more time to try to save his son. 

I also wonder, if somewhere deep inside, Jack purposely forgot the boiler. If he knew that he was too far gone and it was the only thing he could do to possibly save his family. 

I wonder what the thing in the concrete tunnel was. Was it a child who died in the tunnel somehow? I wonder what caused the hedge animals to become what they did. Is it the hotel creating them to protect itself, or is it something darker? 

Just some thoughts I had after finishing the book last night. I think I need to move onto Doctor Sleep next now that The Shining is fresh in my mind. 

I know a lot of people think that The Shining is not as scary as it is made out to be, but I think it definitely is. It's more the atmosphere and the underlying fear and tension that make it scary. That these regular people, with normal issues, can have something like this happen to them.

ybvx2u,Just Finished The Shining (Spoilers!),"Earlier today, I finished listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's *The Shining*. The narration was absolutely fantastic; I listened to the Campbell Scott recording and really enjoyed it. I debated with myself whether to read this or *The Green Mile* first, as I previously hadn't read any of King's work. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I do love stories that get inside the heads of characters, particularly those who don't think like normal people. I think the genre I'm describing is known as ""thriller,"" but I'm not entirely sure. It's why I love *Lolita* by Nabokov despite never having finished it, because in spite of my four(!) attempts to read it, I have to put it down a little over halfway in every time because it makes me want to vomit.

I think I can say confidently that I was looking for the wrong thing in *The Shining*. I absolutely *adored* the first half of this book, the primary reason for this being the in-depth portrait that King painted of the Torrance family. Danny's shining thing was neat, I suppose, but what really fascinated me was Jack. (Don't get me wrong, Wendy was really great too at points, but she never quite stole the show like Jack did in my opinion.) Underneath the skin of Jack Torrance is a thick layer of boiling venom that only occasionally breaks the surface. But even deeper than that is an intelligent man who cares deeply about his family. He dominates every scene he's in because of the balancing act he has to carry out between these two facets of his personality.

It's important to note that, even before the family settles into the Overlook, Jack is already an incredibly interesting character with a lot of layers and motivations that run counter to themselves. As the story progresses, he slowly loses his grip on what's important to him and even who he is. His insecurities about his ability to provide for his family, his past trauma, and his alcoholism all cause him to devolve and slowly become cold to those around him before finally going cuckoo bananas with the mallet.

And then the ghosts happen.

Not imaginary, ""he's hallucinating manifestations of his own broken psyche"" ghosts; actual *ghosts*. And the thing is, I think the ghosts are fun and effective to a certain extent. I loved all of the scenes with Danny in Room 217; I particularly liked the one really early on with the fire hose that doesn't *do* anything. I like the way Jack refused to acknowledge that he saw the hedge animals move. That was all great stuff. But the hedge animals, the fire hose- the key thing about these is that they're *subtle*, and their effects are purely *psychological*. The scene where Halloran (God bless him, I love this character) fights off a living hedge lion by setting it on fire, while fun and engaging in its own way, is largely symbolic of what disappointed me about this novel. It's evil spooky forces trying to kill people, and the good guys have to survive.

There's nothing wrong with that! I love *Resident Evil* and consider *RE4* to be one of the best games a human being can play. But I guess it's just not what I wanted from this book. I was initially hooked because of the characters' interesting backgrounds and traits, and I was excited to see how they would develop. I think the fact that I'm making this post is kind of funny, because although I do enjoy being a deliberate contrarian, such is not the case here. I Googled ""shining gets worse in second half"" expecting a ton of posts like these, but I haven't found any. What I have found, though, are a lot of people asking when the book ""gets scary"" or ""becomes interesting,"" with a lot of people answering with things like ""the Room 217 chapter.""

To me, this book was at its least engaging when Jack had gone full sicko mode and was trying to kill his wife and son. This was because, at this point, there wasn't really any depth to his character. He was just a walking ball of murder and anger, repeating the same few phrases over and over again like his AI was broken. I understand the point of this; don't think that it's lost on me that he was off his rocker and wasn't engaging in the deepest of thoughts at this stage in the narrative. I don't really care for ""action sequences"" in books, which feels like a weird thing to say, but that probably contributed a lot to my overall disappointment with this part.

So, do I think *The Shining* is a bad book? No, definitely not! I'm really glad I read it. I understand that it's considered to be a seminal work in horror fiction, and I was mostly just curious about what it did to reach such a status. I really enjoyed the time I spent with it and encourage everybody to read it at least once if only for that really engaging first half. What do you guys think of *The Shining*? Someone please agree with me on this one, I feel like I'm crazy over here.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: First half of *The Shining* is leagues more interesting than the second half, Halloran is a Chad and I love him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ybvx2u/just_finished_the_shining_spoilers/,2022-10-23T23:17:40Z,13,24,books,The Shining,POST
vm6gj3,I just finished The Shining and then immediately watched the movie again,"Was jack already dead in the book when he was stabbed and said to Wendy, ""you killed me""? I think he was. 

Kubrick is masterful with the camera. He uses wide angle shots, up close, steady, unsteady, like he's conducting an orchestra. Love that. 

The ending of the book was much better. Halloran to the rescue. I enjoyed the description of it all going up in flames, including jack.

In the book, Wendy can smell gin on Jack after he ""drank"" at the Colorado lounge. In the movie, we don't know if he smells like it, and it could just be his delusion. 

The scariest chapter to me was ""Halloran, going up the country"". Omg. I still have nightmares about my parents driving up huge mountains in Colorado. Without the blizzard.

But just reading the in-depth back stories of Jack and Wendy and knowing how things end it's a really beautifully written sad book. I even feel terrible for Ullman who reveres the hotel and doesn't know how things finally end for the Overlook.

King goes into so much detail with Jack's thoughts and his genuine love for Danny after the incident with the arm. You can truly forgive Jack and want see past his many faults.

I know I'm being played when King writes about Jack and Wendys' healing as a couple at the Overlook but I can't help enjoying their peaceful time together.

17p233w,The Creeper by A.M Shine,"Found this scrawling through kindle unlimited, desperately trying to consume all I could before my free trial ended. I'm glad I found this. I had a good time with it. 

I enjoyed the character work in this one. The protagonists had an easy-going relationship. I enjoyed following them going into a weird, mysterious situation. Sparling was a great antagonist, his chapters really painted the picture of a lonely, selfish son of a bitch. I was a bit disappointed in his ending though. After Chloe, Ben and Sparlings demise felt more than a little pedestrian.   

The book had some really well done creepy elements. Entering the village for the first time stands out in my mind. It could have done with more of such. The creeper at the window was genuinely tense, the descriptions really painted a picture. 

As mentioned, I enjoyed the book a good deal, but it wasn’t without its flaws. In fact, the main flaw was a pretty glaring, laughable plot hole. Are you telling me the horrible maimed creeper stands outside their window all night like a muppet, hoping the don’t glance out into the garden instead? What do they do during the day, kip in a bush and clock in for some window time at sun down? I didn’t mind the old bait and switch with the supernatural elements, though I can see it pissing a few people off. I like the body horror elements. The plot holes didn’t ruin the book for me, but it isn’t something I can look back at and not remember.

16axoin,"My thoughts on The Shining by Stephen King, What are your thoughts on this book?","**Synopsis. Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect for a fresh start. As the off season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels even more remote...and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five year old.**

So this was a really great book, loved the atmosphere and writing being detailed which helped me imagine the story even better.  My favorite part is how confining everything feels once we get to the Overlook parts of the book, feels like something is closing in as you read. Locking you in with the terror the characters feel.

Jack was the most interesting character in the book and so much better then the movie version. With the book version you can feel sympathy for him and the guilt he feels at his actions, learning bout his history helps you understand how he became addicted to alcohol, None of which excuses his actions but you can understand the path that was laid out for him. I also felt sorry with his fate in the hotel, You see how hard he fights the hotel's power and many points and the outcome of him>! losing himself to the hotel only to regain a tiny bit back to try and get Danny to run away was hard to watch.!<

Wendy and Danny were also interesting along with Halloran. I cant really say much with out spoiling too much. 

The horror in this was just great, you can feel the tension and feel like you are being confined with them.

Now my only con would be the slurs used. I know the book is set in a different time period and everything but it still bothered me.

My rating. 4.5

Now I do have a few questions that I would like to discuss here

What do you think was up with the hotel, do you think it was just haunted by a powerful ghost, was it cursed or was there more to it? Any theories on it?

Any theories on Tony? 

Why do you think wasp imagery was used so much in this book?

And finally what are your thoughts on what the Shining truly is?

**Note: This was a re read after reading it years ago. I have read Doctor sleep but plan on re reading that.**

fs6xjb,"Finished The Shining a day ago. However, only after watching the movie, did I realise what a genius Stephen King is","So I finished reading The Shining yesterday, and i really liked it. The story made my flesh creep and I was really satisfied with the ending 

My favourite parts were
1) Jack going into 217 and not finding the woman but  feeling her presence 
2) The ballroom scene where Jack meets Grady
3) The wasps stinging Danny at midnight


I then decided to watch the movie, and I have to say, very good acting by Jack Nicholson. However, IMO, the movie doesn't even come close to the book

It was then I realised the true genius of Stephen King.  The way he builds up his characters(Jack's history with his violent dad, Wendy's bitch of a mom),  his understanding of abuse and trauma, and the way he spins the story to make a hard hitting impact is truly brilliant. When I watched the movie, Jack came across as an evil bastard who was excessively selfish, but when I read the book, I really felt pity for him inspite of his violent ways. 

This was my second book by King. I read Pet Sematary a year back and that too was amazing. Right now, I have IT, Salem's Lot, Cujo and 11/22/63 lying in my bookshelf .

7pz3av,"Haven't read any adult fiction voluntarily in my life. I'm now about 300 pages into The Shining, and it's been one if the most rewarding feelings I've had in a long time.","So I'm a senior in college and my entire life up to this point has been readings force fed to me growing up. My school system forced kids to read fictional books every quarter and take tests on them for a grade. I absolutely hated it. Some kids soaked up fiction like it was liquid sugar, and others just couldn't read very well.

I was the weird kid with his head in a non fiction book. They were always on space or weather usually. When I was a kid I had wanted to be a storm chaser.
I just liked soaking up usable information rather than fiction, I suppose. 

Everything I had read was always forced for a grade. I read RL Stein, those books about the kid who could use a baseball card to travel through time, and later in highschool we had to read all of the usual fiction essentials. Shakespeare, The Odyssey, Catcher and the Rye, Of Mice and Men, and a lot of Poe's short stories.

Poe's stuff was always my favorite. I've always loved horror and science fiction, but never read it. I've usually just watched it. I was so into movies by the end of high school, I decided to start writing screenplays.

Now by the end of college I've still dabbled in screen writing, but I felt like I was missing some core story telling techniques. So I decided I wanted to start reading to perhaps get a different perspective.

I decided to go with Stephen King. Being a horror movie fan, you can't escape a King movie. You've all seen one or another. I've always seen people say ""the book was better"", so I decided to try out The Shining. I've always wanted to see what King did originally that Kubrick changed for his film.

I'm now 300 pages into The Shining and it has been one of the most rewarding and entertaining experiences I've had in a long time. All I do is read a chapter before bed instead of looking at my phone screen. It's such a rewarding way to put my phone down, and get a better night's rest. 

The book is just so much richer with character descriptions and background information you never got in the film. I also just see all of the actors from the film as the characters in the book, even though Wendy is a blonde haha. If only Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance had this much characterization.
I just liked every character even more than I did in the film. Not that the film isn't good, but with the book it's like I'm getting like 2 extra serving of cake and ice cream.

I can't wait to finish this book and go onto something else. I'm not even sure what to do next. I think my entire life I've just been looking at the wrong genres. I highly doubt my school library back in the day could have carried anything like this haha.

I think I want to try Lovecraft next, but I'm not sure if I want to perhaps go to another King book. I like the concept of cosmic horror, and who's better to read than the creator. I've also wanted to read Christine and perhaps The Langoliers, but I'm pretty sure those are short stories. 

Aside from horror, I think I may also want to go from movies to the books they are based on, and see what I'm missing. I want to see what inspired a lot of these amazing films I hope to write one day. 

That's all I really had to rant about. Just another person who re-discovered reading I suppose. I still love my comics and graphic novels though, but I've found the value in a thick wall of text, and one's imagination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7pz3av/havent_read_any_adult_fiction_voluntarily_in_my/,2018-01-12T19:40:41Z,102,716,books,The Shining,POST

5sl8e7,Stephen King 'The Shining',"So my preamble, I've always been a bit of  King fan, randomly picking them up here and there, but I'd never made the effort to read the older ones, never working through the Dark Tower line etc. 

So over my last few holidays, I've made the effort to read The Stand, Salems Lot and finally The Shining.

I cannot whole heartedly recommend it enough, I've always liked the film, but assumed it was another mismash of a film based on his story. A good film, unlike most of them but in essence similar. Wow, was I wrong, it's brilliant. I can see how much deeper the characters are, Danny is no longer a 2 dimensional moppet, the wife has depth, Jack Nicholson while truly brilliant in the role misses some of the depth and pathos of the book version.

I'm not finished yet, but it's been a page turner so far.

Honestly, if you've not read it, pick it up. He's describing a time before I was born, but I feel like I was picked up and dropped in the Overwatch.

8z5epx,The Shining,"Would this be a bad time to bring up The Shining? I read it when it first came out in Hardcover. I was 12. It scared me so much I had to hide the book to go to sleep at night. Stephen King is amazing and I was a King Junkie from Carrie to It,  and still am to some degree. Dr.Sleep was an amazing sequel to The Shining. Perfectly written in my view. All that being said,  the 1980 Kubrick film was, in my humble opinion a masterpiece. I realize that it was not an exact adaptation of the book. It was a visualization. The main changes to the film did not alter the themes of the novel. My main complaints involving the film are the character of Wendy as portrayed by Shelly Duvall,  and the fact that Jack seemed angry and cruel to some extent before the hotel got control of him. I cannot understand the vitriolic hatred that King has for the film. The two pieces of art can stand side by side as masterpieces in their own right. Why does one have to take down the other?  I would truly appreciate some info on this. And opinions of course.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8z5epx/the_shining/,2018-07-15T21:58:54Z,27,7,books,The Shining,POST
tf3pm4,I’m reading The Haunting of Hill House and I’m scared.,"I’ve read a few horror books here and there but this one genuinely scares me. I’ve been texting my husband, who’s up working, to come to bed because I don’t want to be by myself right now. 2/3 of the way through. 

I can’t pinpoint exactly what I’m feeling except scared. I can’t tell you why I find it so scary. But I’m scared. 

I feel as though I’ve invited Hill House to my home, or my mind, by reading it alone, while in bed - the wind is howling, doing me no favours. I feel like Hill Houde and Eleanor are so close to me, in a way, it feels real. The characters are so opaque and the dialogue so natural, it makes me feel like I’m in the house with them, observing. Too tangible for my liking right now. 

The thing is, I know it’ll be best if they all leave yesterday, but I don’t want them to leave either. 

It’s peak sinister. It slowly builds up, but it also sneaks up on you. There isn’t anything melodramatic. The shocks are gentle, nothing garish - but more terrifying as a result. I don’t know why. I suppose because the absence of theatre lends an air of realism?

I wish i was actually scholarly enough to put into words how i feel. But Hill House is sinister and I’m scared is all I can muster. 

I can’t help but compare it to The Shining. I know I’m not done yet but The Shining seemed so much less real to me. More melodramatic. Just lacking the warmth (contrasted against the dread) and flow this book has. 

I have genuinely not been scared like this about a book in a long time.

Edit: I’m done with the book and I have been utterly mesmerised.

o3uj6m,Questions about The Shining [spoilers],"Overall I really enjoyed the story, but have these questions nagging at me:

1. Who was Tony? Was there a brief reference to it being an older version/alter ego of Danny, or am I totally off base?

2. What was the relevance of the memoir book of the Overlook that Jack found? Who left it?

3. Why was the unmasking / masquerade ball so significant? I thought it would play into the ending more, but it really only serves the purpose of drawing Jack 
further into madness.

4. Were all of the ghosts in the hotel people that had been murdered over the years?

5. Why did al/the manager not want Jack to write a book about the overlook?

lpfgtt,Read The Shining and watched its movie adaptation over three days [spoilers],"I read the books over the last two days, and just finished the movie five minutes ago. 


The book was great. I’m a huge horror fan, but have never really delved into Stephen King. I’m planning on doing that now, and The Shining was my start. It wasn’t necessarily as scary as what I’m used to, but the characters were deep, and I was reluctant to finish the book because I loved the setting so much I didn’t want to leave it behind. Also, I’m used go horror having not-so-happy endings, but I was thrilled that three main characters managed to make it out alive.


Now, my friend told me to not compare the book and the movie and regard them as two separate stories entirely to avoid disappointment, but I just couldn’t do it. My favorite thing about the movie was Jack Nicholson, but all of the positives end there.


First off, every individual character was slaughtered. Jack Torrence is literally not even the same character. Wendy was just as one dimensional and spineless as Hotel Jack made her out to be in the second half of the book. Danny . . . I can’t even get my thoughts together enough right now to complain about that character as in depth as I’d like too. He was just a stereotypical child-in-a-horror-movie trope, and Tony wasn’t explained at all. Halloran was the closest to spot on they got with a character, but I almost turned the damn thing off after he died 30 seconds after arriving at the Overlook.


Now, I understand that they can’t shove a book’s worth of details into a film, so I forgive some of the omissions like the notion of the Red Death, roque, and some of the ghosts - although the hedge animals were my favorite monster and I was disappointed to see them replaced by a maze. However, omitting the entire motive for them going to the hotel was a gaping plot hole. Instead its just, “Oh, this family with a father figure with a history of abuse and alcoholism is going to isolate themselves in a Rocky Mountain hotel for six months for funsies! And oh, by the way, its on an Indian burial ground. :)” Nothing about the boiler either? Damn! 


The movie is about a man who already has the potential to murder his family, who moves into a hotel also that happens to be haunted. The novel is about a damaged family moving to a hotel, which because it is haunted, takes it upon itself to undo all of the family’s healing and spins itself the worst case scenario. 


So, if you’ve read the novel and want to watch the movie, dig deeper than I did and view it as a separate story.

6j3c09,"Recently finished Stephen King's, ""The Shining""...","Overall, it was a extremely well made story. This is my first Stephen King novel and I already enjoy the way he writes. The book is well detailed and keeps you invested yet it's always easy to understand.

Something I think the book definitely handled better than the movie was Jack Torrance himself. He felt like a truly developed character. He was flawed but tried to do what was best in the end for his family and it's ultimately tragic what happens to him. 

My only complaint is that I feel like it takes maybe a little too long for something really interesting to start happening. It's like halfway through the book before Danny encounters the woman in Room 217. I know that time was taken to build up suspense and to develop the characters but I wouldn't have minded if one or two things occurred before than.

fwx39c,The Shining whats your interpretation on Wendy?," i have read through ""the shining"" by Steven King and generally thought it was a alright 300 page novel, that was 600 pages. Joking asside, I was left perplexed on how the book portrays the wife and mother Wendy Torrance. 

The begining of the book she is struggling to reconcil keeping her family together and protecting her son from Jack. I really loved that set up especially how tense, human, and realistic it is for all parties involved. What started to lose me was as the story goes further it seems to just drop a chunk of responsibility on Wendy for why her husband is a drunk. I understand victims can often blame themselves for causing domestic abuse and Jack will want to blame anyone else, but the book treats it as a generally agreed fact.

Maybe Wendy was partially at fault? a sort of everyone is wrong here situation? But Wendy has done nothing in the text that warrent that idea. The best Wendy has as reason for her fault is that, when she scolded her drunk husband for dropping their newborn son, she sounded like her crappy mother. I think she is justified in that situation. Maybe she had been just constantly giving him passive agressive assides that pecked at him? but we would see that while they were in the hotel and King spent 150 pages showing how happy the family is when together and something about Five Nights at Freddies with hedge animals. Even when she thought jack assaulted their son again she was able to be convinced otherwise and apologize.

Also in regards with the psychic child, Danny has at multiple times read Wendy's mind and performed actions to keep his parents together. Of course that is understandible as he is a child that loves his parents, but that is still someone manipulating her to stay with a dangerous drunk. They even had a chance to leave to her mothers house but Danny nixed the idea do to the tension she and her mother has that he can feel. I also might be reading into it but it is hinted that Jack had weaker powers similar to danny, if that is the case then has she been both unintenially and intenially maniplated like a chess piece by both her family members? Is this all intentional by the author?

cyerv4,Just finished The Shining by Stephen King,"The Shining revolves around Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy and their gifted son Danny who've come to take care of the Overlook hotel during it's off season. What takes place in this eerie hotel makes up the rest of the story

Stephen King is an absolute beast at storytelling, no doubt. I felt that sometimes in the book, he went too far, explaining everything in excruciating detail which I thought was hindering me from progressing.

The story genuinely creeped me out at some places that I felt a tinge of fear everytime I looked into my bathroom at night.

The characters were well developed. King took a lot of pain to detail every character and shape them into what they are.

1be952k,Are there any Stephen King stories that take place in the same reality?,"I know that most if not all of of King's stories take place in the Dark Tower multiverse, but do any of his stories take place in the same reality plane? Aside from Dr. Sleep and the Shining, one being a direct sequel to the other. 

Like there are are a bunch of small references to Pennywise in the Derry of 1963, but does that mean that It and 1963 take place in the same version or Earth? Or does that mean simply there is a version of Pennywise in the 1963 verse but not the antagonist we see in It? 

Is there a 'central hub' world of King's stories, not Midworld but where if you read a story that doesn't have world ending/changing repercussions, it's probably this story hub world. I mean in theory you could have Cujo, the Shining, Salem's Lot, Misery, From a Buick Eight and most of his non horror stories set in the same universe and they'd work together just fine because their events are so localized and plausibly deniable by society at large.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1be952k/are_there_any_stephen_king_stories_that_take/,2024-03-14T01:31:41Z,89,43,books,The Shining,POST
kagszf,"Just finished Stephen King's ""The Shining"", feel like I missed something...

Jack's descend into madness begins with the discovery of the scrapbook, and finishes with him spending days digging through accounting books to find a ""missing piece of this puzzle"". I felt like King was building up some mystery that was Overlook's ""heart of darkness"", which would tie together all the bad things that happened there... But it didn't go anywhere. Hotel blew up, and that was the end of it.

I‘ve written award-winning books, a New York Times-bestselling comic, screenplays, and I’ve worked in kids’ animation and journalism.

EDIT: 11am ET / 5pm South Africa time: Phew, thanks for all the awesome questions. I have now descended into deathmatching Twlight Sparkle vs X. (Twlight Sparkle wins, obvi, against all comers except maybe Nightmare Moon). So I'm out, for now. Thanks Reddit! I'll come back tomorrow and answer some more questions if there are still lingerers. xxxL

I write twisty novels that don’t like to be boxed up with tidy category labels. Critics have described my work as “crossover” or “supernatural thrillers” or, my personal favourite (considering the first body in Broken Monsters) “hybrid”.  But also “horror” and “SF” and “weird” and “speculative”. It’s not my fault; the books  just come out that way. 

If I wasn’t a writer, I’d want to be a detective or a journalist again or a Godzilla Girl YouTube star stomping miniature cities for ad hits. 

Ask me anything (within sanity, unless you’re entertainingly insane, but not obnoxious) about my books, writing, journalism and how that feeds into my research on my books, the lengths I go to with my research, interrogating ruin porn in Broken Monsters, social media and Reddit in Broken Monsters, working on comics and that hilarious incident where I thought Inaki Miranda had drawn Rapunzel doing something obscene and we had a huge fight about it, making a documentary, writing for the Disney channel, how awesome it is to have Joey Hi-Fi as a cover designer, awesome kids books recommends, or hey, the details of the rainbow cake recipe I stole from my sister-in-law, as featured in Good Housekeeping.  I’m happy to discuss plot stuff, but please mark Spoilers!

A bit more about my books: 
Moxyland is a neo-apartheid thriller about how we live right now compromised by our cell phones and our complacencies. 
Zoo City is a black magic noir about a girl with a sloth on her back and the magical ability to find lost things.  It won the Arthur C Clarke Award in 2011.
The Shining Girls is about a time-travelling serial killer and the survivor who turns the hunt around. I’m really proud that it’s won a major horror, mystery and lit award (The BFS August Derleth Best Horror, The Strand Magazine Critics Choice Award and the University of Johannesburg Prize) www.theshininggirls.com
Broken Monsters is my brand new book about hybrid bodies turning up in abandoned places in Detroit, a killer possessed by a terrifying creative vision and the people caught in his orbit. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akRGS5E4w34

fe2yjr,Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’ (spoilers),"I’m new to Stephen King, having read ‘The Institute’ first and now this. I’ve got my list of books I’ll be reading that align with the recommendations I’ve received from other fans. I’m into action, horror, thriller, emotions and characters. Meaning ‘Pet Semetary’, ‘The Green Mile’, ‘The Stand’, ‘Carrie’ and ‘The Outsider’ are on my ‘up next’ list. 

I’ve just finished reading the book and as I expected, it was brilliant. There were some parts that I admit, genuinely bored me but I was won over by the intensity, suspense and thrill. Overall, I really, really enjoyed it. The ending was spoiled for me when I was searching for the synopsis before reading the book, because I had heard of it, I knew it was horror but I didn’t actually know what it was about. 

The ending was emotional, It was so sad for Danny having to watch his own father kill himself right in front of him. And then Hallorann saves the day! I really liked him. He travelled all that way, went through all that trouble for a boy. What a guy! He was amazing. 

The scene that I remember the most that bored me was the boiler scene. Where Jack was being shown how the boiler worked. Boilers don’t interest me in the slightest, I was surprised I was able to read past it and didn’t put the book down. I suppose it was the horror I was waiting for kept me reading. 

Other than this, I enjoyed the horror. From Tony, to the moving hedges, to the spirits in the ballroom. That and the connection to the characters was the stuff that kept me reading. 

I liked Jack but it’s a shame that he became such a horrible person to the point where he destroyed his family.

Wendy deserved better! Gosh, I felt so sorry that for months on end she had to put up with her abusive husband. 

Poor Danny! He deserved a better childhood. And that thought popped up in my head again in the fishing scene in the Epilogue. He needed a break, a break to talk about his emotions and to clear his mind. The experience at the Overlook was an undeserved hell of a ride for such a tender age. 

It’s a horror book, but I wasn’t scared when reading the book. I don’t consider that as a bad thing at all because they were such a thrill to read. The scenes that were supposed to scare me were the scenes I read the fastest because I was so...in the moment. I was constantly asking myself: “what’s going to happen next? How is this going to end?”. I’m not sure why the book didn’t scare me. Because it’s because I know it’s not real, or maybe because I have a dark sense of humour. 

Despite the boiler scene, I’m going to give it a 10/10. Because Stephen King, the master that he is, was able to hook me on. I couldn’t stop reading, even when I had work to be done. I loved the way he describes things, the way he builds up to things, the master of suspense as I’ve heard. I really enjoyed it. I had this sort of feeling, almost sadness when I was approaching the end. I didn’t want it to end! 

I’ll be reading ‘Doctor Sleep’ next. I’ve recently been eyeing ‘The Stand’ because having read the description, it’s a story set in a post apocalyptic world, and those two words alone immediately grabbed my attention. However, I’m not too keen on eye widening word counts, but 1500 words is like heaven or ‘the more the better’ for me considering I’m glued to the description of the story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fe2yjr/stephen_kings_the_shining_spoilers/,2020-03-05T22:01:24Z,8,2,books,The Shining,POST

du2r65,"""The Book is Better"" finally fails for me: my review of Stephen King's ""The Shining""","The Shining is hailed as one of the greatest horror novels of all time as well as topping many lists of greatest Stephen King novels.  With Doctor Sleep in theaters, I wanted to finally read the book that I've heard so much about, and holy cow was it one of the most persistently frustrating and disappointing reading experiences of my life.  Without rambling too long, let me just say that I have a great respect for the film but am in no way obsessed with it (I honestly haven't even seen it in at least a decade), but like Danny big-wheeling through the Overlook, I was greeted at every other turn of the novel with something I wish I could unsee.  My primary criticisms of King's novel fall under 2 categories:

#1.  King's characters are not humans.  Jack, Wendy, and Danny are all simultaneously deeply broken and disturbed people *and* the generic leads from every Hallmark made-for-tv movie.  We learn that Jack is a drunk, a child abuser, a man with incredibly violent impulses that beats one of his students within an inch of his life after shaming him publicly, believes that he probably ran over a child during a drunk driving accident, has a disturbing and abusive childhood... but is also simultaneously a loving John Q. Everyman that just wants what's best for his family.  BULLSHIT.  Similar problems plague Wendy, who is supposed to simultaneously be some strong generic doting mother and wife (and a hot blonde), but at the same time a repressed coward that refuses to protect her child from what are clearly physically and emotionally abusive situations, again and again.  Danny has little dimension, but we're supposed to believe that he's constantly experiencing horrific traumatic experiences but somehow virtually unaffected by them, being a brainy every-kid that always stands up to his fears.  Again: bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  King wants to have his cake and eat it too.  I've heard that Kubrick's changes to the characters was King's main gripe with Kubrick's film, but the truth is, if you consider these characters to be real people and peel away the cloying saccharine Hallmark card dressing, you're left with exactly the broken and disturbed people that Kubrick introduces.  The book likewise wants to have Jack go insane based on his own personal issues, but then also wants to exonerate him from all wrong-doing as he's ""magically possessed"" by the Overlook.  Again.  It fundamentally does not work.

#2.  The book is hardly a horror novel.  You know the scariest images from the movie?  The twins in the hall, the bloody elevator, the endless hedge maze... yeah none of that's in the book.  Instead, it is straight up Looney Tunes and impossible to take seriously.  The main reoccurring horror is literally (I'm not kidding) giant magical prancing hedge animals.  Seriously.  The book is really banking on you finding hedge animals utterly terrifying.  And if that doesn't work, it hopes you're spooked by a possessed fire hose.  ... Again.  I'm not kidding.  Also, there's virtually no mystery to the Overlook and its ghosts.  It's all explained, and likewise, Tony is spelled out and not at all a nefarious or eerie presence.  Across the board, it's hardly even a horror novel.  You get one creepy scene with Danny hearing a voice in a tunnel outside and then the scene with the woman in the bath tub and that is it.  For me, the most effectively scary part of the novel was actually just Hallorann driving through a blizzard.  That's the only time that I seriously felt the characters were in danger, because even with Jack in crazy-mode, we don't really get a maniacal axe-wielding psychopath, we get a loving dad possessed by over-explained ghosts and wielding a wood mallet (which is never that threatening, and he never uses to kill anyone).  As a finale to the disappointment, there's a generic countdown-to-explosion moment before the Overlook is blown to pieces, an event that's depicted by having Hallorann (who lives) literally grab Wendy and Danny in his arms and jumps out of the exploding hotel like the ending of a Die Hard movie.

In summary, Stephen King's ""The Shining"" is fine for what it is: a generic Shirley Jackson rip-off made to be complete inoffensive to your grandmother.  At its best, I would say that at least it's well-paced and not-boring, and for how disappointing the ending is, it at least has a structurally climactic nature (which is usually a big criticism of King's work).  But is it one of the greatest horror novels of all time?  Not even remotely.  In fact, to say that it even deserves to be compared to Kubrick's adaptation feels, if anything, incredibly disrespectful to the film, which, from what little I remember, improves upon the book in virtually every way.

Sorry if this is one of your favorite King/horror novels, but my god was I incredibly disappointed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/du2r65/the_book_is_better_finally_fails_for_me_my_review/,2019-11-09T22:23:59Z,29,3,books,The Shining,POST

Mine are:

1. Back When We Were Grown Ups by Anne Tyler — A breezy but sometimes existential book about family and growing old. Some irritating characters for sure, but I generally thought it was very true to life, sweet without being saccharine, and fairly moving towards the end. 7/10
2. Beloved by Toni Morrison — Monumental fiction, just an utter powerhouse of writing. It strikes this incredible balance of horror and beauty through characters that you just want to weep for. So, so, so good. 10/10
3. Siddhartha by Herman Hesse — Way too convinced of its own earth-shattering wisdom while failing to offer much of a coherent philosophy at all. Like a less shit The Alchemist. 3/10
4. A Shining by Jon Fosse — Nowhere near Fosse's best, and far from the most interesting attempt at death in the first person that I've read. Not a bad read by any stretch, but there's just very little to it. 5/10
5. Reading Lolita in Tehran by Azar Nafisi — A book that somewhat clumsy combines memoir with history, sociology, and literary criticism, but the individual parts are all pretty excellent.

vtapzh,Is Jack Torrance a sympathetic character and how much of his actions in The Shining were of his own free will?,"There are flawed characters that are meant to be liked, but some say that there are flawed characters that aren't written with the purpose of being relatable. I've found myself feeling sympathetic and seeing myself in these characters a bit too often.

Just today, I finished reading *The Shining,* but a few days ago, my friends and I were having a debate over it. My friend said that Stephen King wrote the book so that you would feel gross and dirty when in Jack's head, but I actually found quite the opposite. He's by no means a pure person, but I found myself relating to him and understanding quite a bit. He has a good heart, I believe, but he's made some mistakes in his past and is trying to correct them, whether successful or not. When I finished the book, I still believed that he was a good person at heart, still caring for Wendy and Danny, despite having a temper. However, I found that I seemed to have misinterpreted the book, as I thought the one responsible for his behavior by the end was more of the hotel than of his free will, when other Reddit forums seemed to suggest otherwise. 

I've found myself always relating hardest to the misunderstood character such as with Jack Torrance, Holden Caulfield (which can be up for debate as well), the boy from *Dark Places*, Harry Potter (at the time when the whole school/his friends turn against him in every book), and so on and so on. 

My friend said that Jack seemed as if he were destined to be the way that he was, unsuccessful and disliked. Like it was something genetically wrong with him. I felt sympathetic towards all the characters in the book, like that part where he says he feels the same for the characters of his play. I don't know though, since I don't think I'm a very well liked person and have been told by my friends that I'm selfish, apathetic, and cold.  Is Jack not meant to be understood?

98aqj0,[SPOILERS] Am I alone in thinking The Shining was more sad than scary?,"The Shining is scary, for sure. The topiary scene is trippy and terrifying as all hell, not to mention Danny and Jack's encounters with the woman in the bathtub. But in my opinion it was above all.. bleak. Life fucks Danny out of a normal life, a normal childhood, a decent father, and then out of a father at all. Wendy loved him, loved him all the way up until he became a danger to her. (he was a danger to danny way before.. that didn't particularly affect her affections.)

Jack Torrance. Jack's storyline is downright depressing. He said it himself: he failed as a teacher,  an author, a caretaker, a husband, and a father. He failed at life in every way possible. The saddest part for me is at the very end when he realises what's become of him, begs Danny to get out, and ultimately.. destroys his face with a mallet. When he stops being Jack and starts being a.. thing. An object. A monster.

He could've gotten out of that hotel. He could've gone to jail for blowing it up, or gotten to rehab for his alchoholism, or a hospital for his and his wife and son's injuries.. but what he did was, for all intents and purposes, suicide.  
 
But lord, what a fantastic book.

qrj4zq,What makes Harry Potter great are not the plots or the magic but the mundane moments at Hogwarts and character interactions.,"I joined the Harry Potter train late. I first saw the movies and was impressed by them. They are well made entertainment with a lot of heart. I later read the books and found them even better than the movies. The movies breeze past you because they cover a lot in a short span. Whereas the books, without any time and budget restrictions, can go in on much more detail.

I was initially hesitant as an adult to give time to books meant for children and teens but my opinion changed early on. Not only do the books mature as they progress, they are also pretty fun to read. Interestingly, for me the plots and the magic/wizardry were unimpressive. Each book is a mystery where someone is trying to kill or hurt Harry and only Harry and his gang can solve the riddle. The magical aspect is mostly by the number and world building is okay. 

Where the books shine are during the mundane moments in between the bigger, plot-driving moments. This includes the class room lectures, the character interactions between the main trio, the Great Hall dinner scenes, the common room discussions, the banters with Malfoy and his gang, Fred and George being clever fools,  the train journey to Hogwarts etc. JK Rowling has written these characters well with nuance and interesting traits but not without their faults. 

The setting of Hogwarts is another positive. A huge castle which acts as a boarding school hidden from the outside world, with a lot of history as well as magical shenanigans aplenty. It makes you weirdly nostalgic for Hogwarts even if our school experiences are vastly different from Harry Potter's.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qrj4zq/what_makes_harry_potter_great_are_not_the_plots/,2021-11-11T11:20:41Z,821,10748,books,The Shining,POST

7xxt3y,The Shining - Danny and Dick Halloran," recently finished reading The Shining and loved it. But one aspect of the book that I especially loved was the relationship between Danny and Dick Halloran. Going into the book, I didn't really expect their relationship and bond to end up being so moving, but it certainly was!

I don't remember the movie portraying their relationship quite that way. Yes, Dick explains the ""Shining"" to Danny, but... That's about it. There's just such a warmness between them in the book that was not carried over very well into the film, at all.

[Spoilers]

Also, I was so happy Dick lived in the book. The very end, with Dick, Danny and Wendy was very sweet. These were people who were really put through the ringer together, it was nice to see that they had remained close.

To anyone who's read Doctor Sleep, Does Holleran appear in the book? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7xxt3y/the_shining_danny_and_dick_halloran/,2018-02-16T10:10:25Z,8,7,books,The Shining,POST
g2ntrz,What is the epigraph to the Shining talking about?,"So I’ve started the shining, I’m three chapters in and I’m still contemplating the epigraph to the book. To my understanding; the piece from Edgar Alan Poe is supposed to reflect the hotel as a sinister being to itself, the clock in the excerpt is supposed to be a parallel to the outlook hotel, once a year it disrupts the giddy fun that is usual to its walls in the on season and replaces it with a cold barren empty maze, it’s bells toll for the unlucky caretaker that is trapped in its grasp. 

The Goya quote; “the sleep of reason breeds monsters” is a little harder to get past the literal sense of comparing it Jacks decent into madness. I did a light read on the painting itself, and from what I got from that information as far as I can figure it, the monsters of the outlook torment jack (the dreamer) and jack himself becomes a product of his “dreams” and in turn the monsters, his wife and son are us, the viewers of the painting, who are still affected by Goya’s monsters as the monsters in the painting look directly at the viewer, making them an active participant in the nightmare. 

The folk saying “it’ll shine when it shines” is the least scholarly of the three and the hardest to interpret in my opinion, the most I can make of it is in reference to Danny’s ability to shine and relating that to the whims of nature. The outlook has done nothing but consume in the dark and unstopped and unknown to everyone, a spot with a constant cloud overhead. That is until Danny Torrence randomly arrives, like a random beam of sun and cast a shining light onto the darkness of the outlook.

The three quotes themselves I thought could also serve as a template that reflects our three main characters, the first quote is about the outlook and how Jack becomes a product of the outlooks malevolent history, the second quote is about how Wendy is subject to Jack and his demons, while the third quote is about Danny and how he breaks that chain and he is the glimmer of hope in this cycle, and all he is product or subject to is his abilities (though I’m sure Doctor Sleep will have something to say about that last part) 
I will also attach the whole epigraph so people see how I’m drawing some line: 

“It was in this apartment, also, that there stood … a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when … the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause … to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly … and [they] smiled as if at their own nervousness … and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes … there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before. But in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel … “ - E. A. Poe

15pawxo,What is a book you will defend to the end of the Earth that other people hate?,"Yesterday I had a post on this subreddit that a lot of people engaged with about books that you felt you were supposed to enjoy but simply couldn’t. Today I wanted to ask the inverse. What books do you feel have been unfairly maligned?

For me personally, two books I feel are severely underrated by critics are The Rules of Attraction by Bret Easton Ellis and Cujo by Stephen King. I loved Ellis’s shifting viewpoint in Rules of Attraction and felt it was overall an improvement on Less than Zero, as the characters, while still static, engaged more with (even if they ultimately refuted) ideas like ideal romance and were a little more complex and contradictory. This is not to mention it was downright hilarious. With Cujo, the book is frequently ranked below It, The Shining, The Stand, etc, but I thought it was King at his best. The action is incredibly gripping, the dog is genuinely terrifying, and the connections the characters have with one another are very deep and well written. 

In terms of books critics love that a lot of the public criticizes, The Sound and the Fury is one of my favorite books, as I was captivated by its stylistic experimentation and felt its themes of how we each respond to the inevitable passage of time and idealism vs nihilism are still very relevant. Moreover, attempting to write a chapter from a developmentally disabled man’s perspective was both incredibly ballsy and commendable. People with disabilities are incredibly underrepresented in literature, especially classics, and Faulkner respectively portrays and forces the reader to emphasize with Benji. 

Remember these are just my opinions, and it’s alright if you disagree. But I’m curious: 
What’s a book that has resonated with you that you feel has been unfairly maligned, whether by critics or the general reading public?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15pawxo/what_is_a_book_you_will_defend_to_the_end_of_the/,2023-08-12T17:52:29Z,766,322,books,The Shining,POST

All I can say is that portions of it terrified me.



Particularly, there is a speech made by captain Beatty to Montag when Montag is sick and starting to question the world he lives in. The logical thought paths he lays out to explain why conflicting information and thought provoking text is rightfully stifled and eliminated, hit me deep, and made me genuinely concerned for the potential path our world is heading down. I feel the book outlines how important open dialogue and question asking is in the world, because without it, we lose what has made us come so far. I feel the book also shines light on the influence of distraction from media forms and how being hyper focused on them destroys enlightenment and the path towards true understanding and knowledge.



Again, I know I’m late to the party, but I feel this book should be read by everyone these days to bring perspective to the book burning mentality permeating in culture today, and to question the idea of allowing our creativity and individuality be stifled for “the greater good”

2kklk5,"The Shining Girls, by Lauren Beukes","Finished this a few days ago. Would love to discuss it/recommend it. 

The basic premise is that a guy discovers an ability to travel through time but at the cost of an obsession to kill certain ""shining girls"" at various points in time. 

But one of his victims survives her attack and is on the hunt to find him. 

So, first of all, if you're really into having your time travel be really detailed, thorough, and aware of the paradoxes of time travel then this book may not be for you. In *The Shining Girls*, time travel is there, it happens, and it doesn't even make sense to the ones doing the traveling. 

But, this book isn't about the killer. It's about the victims. There's Kirby who by having the benefit of surviving her attack gets a lot of page time.

But then we get all these vignettes about the other victims and it's a great way for Beuke's to focus on a lot of important social history of the 20th century and relate some of it in a personal way.

And I really appreciated that, it gave these victims a sense of agency and you really felt how so much potential was wasted by the sick aims of one person who couldn't handle it.

ik44g1,[Crosspost] King's The Shining is scaring the hell out of me... but I am very intrigued and want to keep reading!,"\[So I figured I might get more advice in this community as it is bigger than the Stephen King subreddit, but if this is not allowed please do let me know/delete\]

So yeah. This is my first proper dive into horror. Tried to read Cell by Stephen King before and did not finish it, the pace didn't really pick up and I was bored – and it feels like a sci-fi apocalyptic novel rather than horror anyway. But though The Shining also had a slow start, this time the plot actually got me hooked. I care about the characters, and want to know what is going on.

The only problem being, I am getting scared as hell. Last night I read a good chunk (up to the start of Part Three) and literally kept waking up every once in a while because I was too scared to let myself fall asleep completely. Had to fully get up between 5 and 6am to pick up another book that would take my mind off it, and now my sleep pattern is all messed up lol. Needless to say, I won't be reading The Shining before bed again. But I do want to continue.

I know one of the issues for a few people in this subreddit seems to be that King's books are not scary enough rather than too scary, but unfortunately I am not one of those people. How do you guys manage to step away from the world of the book? And how did you come to enjoy horror books, if you weren't a horror novel person in the first place?

gd6xt3,Just Mercy and The Sun Does SHine,"Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson and Anthony Hinton's The Sun Does Shine are two books that talk about the prison system, racial injustice/inequality and capital punishment.

Anthony Hinton's book is about how he was implicated in two murders and then sentenced to death despite being innocent. During his thirty years of living in a 5 by 7 feet cell, he watched 54 people be executed 30 feet always wondering if the next banging on the bars would be for him. However, he quickly realised that he had a choice between anger or compassion, hatred or forgiveness, faith or despair. Anthony Hinton chose to forgive the people who put him there, love the guards and inmates around him and hope God would help him. Despite losing his freedom and dignity, he chose to survive and now works to abolish capital punishment because humans do not have the right to take a life, only God does.

&#x200B;

Bryan Stevenson's book shows how people can so easily be implicated for a crime with no solid evidence and only a few shoddy testimonies take away their freedom. A more shocking revelation in this book was the treatment of Minorities in the legal system, where victims of abuse are sent to prison to be sexually and emotionally abused, or women being incarcerated for not getting unaffordable prenatal care which is seen as negligence or the inability of the legal system to differentiate between children and adults.

31spcu,People who read The Shining before having seen the movie.,"I recently finished reading The Shining, and loved it, but somehow I find myself wondering how I would have felt if I had not seen the movie before. 

Is there anyone here that perhaps read it before seeing it?
My main points of wonder is.

Redrum, did you put it together what it meant before the revelation? I feel like that moment was supposed to be a huge but having seen the movie countless times it kinda lost the effect.

Did you also feel that Jack was always going to turn into this monster? I am trying to think if it always feels like it has premonitions that points towards this. Which it does, but they are vague. What is so good about the story to me is that Jack isn't just a monster throughout, he has regrets and seems to try.

I would also appreciate some opinions people have regarding the movie and the book. Which one is better and such. To me they are both excellent. Kubrick very clearly made his own vision though and I can really appreciate that. The book just feels more slow and brooding because its hard to portray the descent into madness in 2 hours as opposed to 500 pages. I also feel that the Overlook hotel is portrayed more as an entity in the book, which I have mixed feelings on. The movie portrays it more as Jack going mad, where as the book portrays him as possessed. I am kinda more attached to the idea of him just going out of his mind. 

Jack Nicholson is awesome as Jack Torrance though. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/31spcu/people_who_read_the_shining_before_having_seen/,2015-04-07T21:31:44Z,8,7,books,The Shining,POST

1bhe57z,The Fault in Our Stars.,"God...what do I even say. There's not enough words to articulate just how much this novel...is.

The romance was so beautiful. It never felt unrealistic, or awkward, or weird. Augustus and Hazel, truly truly loved each other. And I loved them.

The inevitability of it all, this book is heartbreaking. Augustus's cancer, I knew he would die. Hazel and I both knew it, everyone knew it. Especially as it got worse, there was no way he would make it out. Does that make it easier? Fuck no.

*""It's total bullshit. The whole thing. Eighty percent survival rate and he's in the twenty percent? Bullshit. He was such a bright kid. It's bullshit. I hate it. But it sure was a privilege to love him, huh?""*

So much joy and laughter and smiling and swooning. So much heartbreak and worry and sadness and grief. Augustus was—is— a remarkable person. I miss him so much.

But love was worth the oblivion. We're as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we're not likely to do either. You're gonna get hurt by somebody no matter what, but it's best to choose who hurts you, right? 

I am extremely sad. Augustus deserved fucking better, cancer is unfair and life is unfair and the world is unfair and the universe is unfair, and I'm so angry that such a bright and shining star on this earth was extinguished so soon. But it was still worth it to love him. 

I'm changed. Four days and four nights and dammit John Green you've done it again. This book changed me. My life is different because of this thing. It was painful, but it was beautiful. And it was worth it. So worth it. 

*""I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1bhe57z/the_fault_in_our_stars/,2024-03-18T00:59:05Z,112,270,books,The Shining,POST

2f5l7y,Theory about link between The Shining & The Hobbit,"
Ok, so this is just a theory and I welcome your thoughts...  (sorry it's long!!  Also I already know that I’m not an expert on literature, or on either book, or on anything.)

So I was watching The Desolation of Smaug on HBO earlier and when Bilbo & the dwarves reach the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo says something about Gandalf should be waiting for us at ""the overlook.""  Somehow, that sent a flag up in my mind, so I did some research online.  To summarize, I think that Stephen King's book ""The Shining"" is somewhat based on this section of The Hobbit.

The Overlook/Lonely Mountain =  The Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains

Thror = Delbert Grady (previous hotel caretaker)

Thorin = Jack Torrence

Bilbo =  Danny Torrence

Gandalf =  Dick Hallorann

Smaug = Hotel Boiler
 
Arkenstone = Psychic Powers

Sauron (?) = Horace Derwent (?) <evil in the hotel>


1.  Stephen King is a big Tolkien fan who has a history of setting LOTR
stuff into the United States (he admitted it about “The Stand” in Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work)


2.  The Lonely Mountain is the source of the Celduin River and it’s the location of the Kingdom Under the Mountain.  The town of Dale lies in a vale on its Southern slopes.  Correspondingly (maybe) the Overlook Hotel is set in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and has the town of Vail to the South.  The Colorado River’s source is here.


3.  Dale and the surrounding areas, which were burnt by Smaug, are called “The desolation of Smaug.”  There is a place called East Desolation Peak near the real Overlook hotel—the Stanley hotel—which Stephen King said was where he stayed and that inspired the fictional Overlook hotel.


4.  In The Hobbit, the Overlook area has a tragic history due to all the deaths & destruction from the dragon.  In The Shining, the Overlook hotel has a violent past including the deaths of guests and more recently, the deaths of the last caretaker and his family—he “got cabin fever” and killed them.


5.  In the Peter Jackson movie, Thror (Thorin Oakenshield’s predecessor as King Under the Mountain) went mad with greed.  However, Smaug the dragon implies that it was the Arkenstone that corrupted him when he says to Bilbo, “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad…”   I don’t know much about Thror, but the Arkenstone gave it’s owner the authority/power to rule the dwarves.  So maybe he was power & money hungry?  Anyway, in The Shining, I assume that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, actually went crazy from the same evil spirits who influence Jack Torrence.  One of these “spirits” is a past owner(?) of the Overlook named Horace Derwent.  Derwent is described as being an “evil genius” who was extremely corrupt and got rich from his involvement in organized crime, high level politics, gambling, etc.  It is said that his spirit inhabits the Overlook Hotel, but his death was never confirmed. (WTF?)   The evil spirits of the Overlook (especially Derwent) desperately want Jack to kill Danny in order to obtain his shining/psychic powers.  Jack gradually loses himself because of he is influenced or possessed to kill Danny.  In the same way, Thorin Oakenshield begins to lose himself and change because he becomes obsessed with getting the Arkenstone.


6.  Therefore, I think that the Arkenstone = The Shining/Psychic powers.  The Hobbit book says that the Arkenstone has it’s own pale light, but when exposed to outside light, it shone brilliantly.  When Danny first arrives at the Overlook hotel and meets the cook, Dick Hallorunn (who also has the shining ability), he warns Danny that the hotel is dangerous for people with the gift and can intensify it.
Now, I am not an evil spirit, so I don’t know why the hotel’s evil spirits want psychic abilities, but maybe it has something to do with the power to rule over others, like the Arkenstone’s significance to the dwarves.


7.  The previously mentioned Dick Hallorunn has a special connection/friendship with Danny because he can see that Danny has the shining power like he does, and also likely because Danny is a nice kid and Dick is a nice person.   Maybe it’s because he knows that Danny is in for a dangerous time and he can relate because he has worked in the hotel and knows its evil.  But, for whatever reason, they have a bond and a connection.  Similarly, Gandalf has a special place in his heart for Bilbo saying (in the movie) “Why Bilbo Baggins?  Perhaps it is because I am afraid and he gives me courage.’  Now, in The Shining, Hallorunn leaves the Overlook hotel for the winter and has to come back to help save Danny from Jack.  In the same way, Gandalf is not at the Overlook /Lonely Mountain while Bilbo is dealing with Thorin and the dragon.  But, Gandalf comes to help the situation at the end.


8.  Sort of covered before---  Bilbo is brave and selfless.  He is willing to risk facing a dragon to look for the Arkenstone.  Spoiler:  He is willing to give up the Arkenstone to avoid a war.  Danny is also very brave and selfless.  In The Shining (book), Danny’s mom, Wendy, wants to leave Jack behind early on an take Danny away from there, but Danny resists because he thinks the hotel is making Jack happy.  Danny is also able to face all the creepy stuff that happens in the hotel.  


9.  Smaug the dragon has been sleeping deep in the mountain, but awakens due to Bilbo’s presence.  He starts getting really mad, breathes lots of fire, and then destroys part of the Lonely Mountain getting out of it.  At the end of the book The Shining, the boiler in the basement of the hotel (which had ostensibly not been used until the winter) is turned on and gets hotter and hotter until it explodes and destroys the hotel.


10.  Ok, finally, I know it’s a stretch but  Torrence sounds like Thorin (kinda)

wvy7sv,What do you think about the idea that “the book is always better”?,"So it's even become a meme that the book is always better. IMO, the book tends to be better, but there are clear exceptions. Especially if the film is a masterpiece or a cornerstone of modern cinema, or if the book is not very good.

The Godfather and Jaws are some examples. The Social Network: an Oscar winning film made out of a sensationalist nonfiction book. Or even Ready Player One, which is a very middling Spielberg film adapted out of a book many people love to hate.

And there are even cases where the book and the movie are great in their own spheres, sometimes even contradicting themselves: The Shining, The Princess Bride, even Jurassic park.

xrhxl0,"Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series is beautiful & inspiring. Read it, then gift it to all the young women in your life.","I read these books as a kid and enjoyed them, but they really shine upon re-reading. I just finished Wintersmith (#3) via Libby last night, nearly shed a tear.

The Tiffany Aching books are set on Pratchett's Discworld, but as with all Discworld series they stand perfectly on their own. The books are about the title character, a young girl from a rural agricultural village who grows into some magical powers and has to reckon with forces beyond her ken, and also the joys and perils of family, community, and responsibility.

Right off the bat these novels are utterly delightful. The first one, *The Wee Free Men*, features Tiffany befriending a gang of tiny Scottish fairies who love nothing more than drinking, fighting, stealing, fighting while drinking, drinking while stealing, and fighting while drinking & stealing. They have a whole vocabulary of ~~nonsense~~ Scots words such as ""crivens,"" an all-purpose curse that I'm going to start using daily, and their typical approach to any problem is to rush in and start kicking it. They rule. 

I won't spoil the plots of the books, but I will say that almost all of the major characters are badass ladies who get shit done. They teach amazing life lessons along the way, a couple of which have made their way into the ""Quotes"" note on my phone: 

>TIFFANY: It shouldn't be like this.

>MS. LEVEL: There isn't a way things should be. There's just what happens, and what we do.

-

> GRANNY WEATHERWAX: Stars is easy. People is hard.

-

> Why do you go away? So you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving. 

I love these books a lot, and I think any young human (and especially young women) would get a lot out of them. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

EDIT: These books are, of course, great for people of any gender, and boys need female role models too! 

I have been informed that ""crivens"" is valid Scottish slang. Sorry, ye daft scunners.

1nspxt,A question about The Shining and Doctor Sleep - possible plot spoilers,"I have read the discussions here on /r/books and elsewhere about Doctor Sleep and The Shining, by King. I have also read many reviews about Doctor Sleep. However, I have not read a word about something that I think is quite important. Can you confirm that I am not crazy? 

**Spoilers ahead, both about the Shining and Doctor Sleep.** 

In The Shining, when Jack remembers his animated discussion with his student George Hatfield - the one he will beat up later on - the boy shouts at him something along the line of ""I know what you did, and I know that you are doing this to me because I know what you did"". George is accusing Jack of setting the timer for his debate lessons earlier, because George stutters. Jack even goes on for a couple of lines trying to remember what the boy could know about him, what he could be referring to, but he can't come up with anything. And this is never again mentioned in the book.

Fast forward to Doctor Sleep, and we found out that Jack was having an affair with a student - the future Abra's grandmother - while teaching at the same school he would be expelled from for beating George Hatfield. 

I think George was referring to the fact that he knew that Jack was screwing his fellow student. Or even better: he knew that the girl was pregnant. This could explain why Jack can't think of anything that George might know: it is not clear in Doctor Sleep that Jack ever knew that he had a daughter from another woman... 

Again, I have seen this mentioned nowhere. But if I am correct, it would add a layer of complexity to the Jack character in the Shining.

Anyway, I found this book incredibly engrossing. There were many evenings when I found myself continuing the book once I'd got home from work. I started the book after reading 11/22/63 and The Shining and, I thought The Stand was so much better than the other King books and short stories I've read this year. It was just so epic. I enjoyed the references to Tolkien, it really fit. I'm happy I experienced this story. The characters and setting were so believable. [When characters died](/spoiler) I was always nearly holding back tears. AND THE ENDING! [It was a happy ending only bittersweet knowing the sacrifices the survivors endured. I wish I could keep knowing these people and learn what happens to them and the rest of the world after Flagg is defeated(?). I suppose I can read the other books Flagg is in? Are they just as good? I'll find out.](/spoiler)

18u74xt,The Radim Girls by Kate Moore.,"I don't know what I was thinking. The stories are so tragic that depressed me. And I was already depressed for end of year festivities. Adding all these tragic girls, neglected by their employers, betrayed by their government. Thankfully they found allies, who helped them in their odyssey seeking for justice. Reading them die as they have no worth or value. The worst is, I can see perfectly that till this day, some employers are still unscrupulously doing that to their employees.

But, depressed and heartbroken, I love this book. 😭😭😭

Synopsis below ↓↓↓
The Curies’ newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.

Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these “shining girls” are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.

But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women’s cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America’s early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers’ rights that will echo for centuries to come.

Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the “wonder” substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18u74xt/the_radim_girls_by_kate_moore/,2023-12-30T04:42:40Z,14,17,books,The Shining,POST
wl2j6u,[No Spoilers} Thoughts on Twilight From a 33 Year-Old Man Reading it for the First Time.,"I wrote a post on The Shining a little bit ago that got some fun feedback and discussion, so I decided on mentioning something I've since read that is a little less intense.

A few years ago, I was on my main Reddit account, typing out feedback for a Redditor's short story submission, when I saw a comment underneath the original post that sent me back in time:

""Still a better love story than Twilight!"" from a reader.

Followed by an extremely amused:

""LOL!!!! THANKS!!"" from the author.

I completely missed the bus on Twilight. I was never part of the target audience of the books, but I always remembered thinking that the backlash against a monster romance aimed at young girls was way too harsh at a time where some real stinker movies were being held up as modern classics. In recent years, I've decided to kind of go back and catch up on some of the most popular literature I missed while growing up, including Harry Potter, Ice and Fire, and others, regardless of any demographic gap.

If I could put my feelings about reading Twilight into one sentence: I didn't like the story, but I have some affection for the book.

My biggest surprise with Twilight was in regards to its length. I was expecting to read a pulpy 300 page romance fantasy aimed at the sensibilities of a teenage girl. Basically, I was expecting Anne Rice-inspired gothic horror for the Myspace generation.

The first Twilight book has *119,000 words*, and boy does it ever read like it. Every time Bella decides that it's time to start providing commentary, the story itself goes into bullet time as she describes every feature of the room, every miniscule detail of her school schedule, and every minor movement of every character, complete with glib observations of glib observations. It is *laboriously* paced. It's genuinely shocking how verbose this book is.

But I can't really pretend that I think this book should be derided as being the worst thing I've ever read, mainly because I have read this story a thousand times on creative writing subs and forums, including my own works. It has all the hallmarks of an American Gen X or Millenial writer who was told by their public school teachers to do things like use the words 'explained' or 'exclaimed' instead of 'said.' While reading the character action sentences, I was reminded of every time a reader gave the awful feedback that Bella can't just get in the car and drive away- we must be told that she picked up her keys, opened the garage door, opened the car door, sat down, put the keys in the ignition... I could go on, but I won't.

I didn't feel the hate that so many people 18 years ago seemed to feel, because I was actually starting to empathize with the author, even moreso than any of the characters. Twilight is every first draft that every amateur author has written, but it just so happened that Mrs. Meyer's first book got absurdly popular after receiving maybe a cursory editing pass. I actually find reading about Stephenie Meyer to be more interesting than the book. I try to wonder what the reaction to one of my early writing projects would have been had one of them gotten popular for some reason, and I find the image both hilarious and terrifying.

I know this isn't a traditional review, but who honestly cares what anyone's Goodread score for the first Twilight book is at this point?

&#x200B;

EDIT: People have mentioned it, but of course there are issues with the book's quality and some of the problematic aspects of the Bella/Edward relationship. I originally had more of an in-depth review-style post that talked about the finer details of the books, but I cut a lot of it because I mostly just wanted to touch on some personal feelings that came to me while reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wl2j6u/no_spoilers_thoughts_on_twilight_from_a_33/,2022-08-10T16:55:49Z,701,4801,books,The Shining,POST

aw20yq,The /r/books Book Club Selection for March is The Radium Girls by Kate Moore,"From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls):

>**The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger**  
>  
>The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.  
>  
>Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.  
>  
>But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come.  
>  
>Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, *The Radium Girls* fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the ""wonder"" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...

In order to mix it up a little bit we will be reading a non-fiction book for March. We will be reading *The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women* by Kate Moore. As usual the dates and links for the four discussion threads can be found in the stickied comment, but you are welcome to read at your own pace. Just don't forget to join the discussion threads!

2toky7,Just finished The Shining (finally)--interesting thing I noticed about Lloyd (spoilers?),"I saw the movie version of The Shining years ago, but I never got around to reading the book until just recently, and I finished today.  Numerous things jumped out at me, but one thing that I couldn't find more info/discussion on using Google was Lloyd.

The first time Jack interacted with Lloyd, it appeared that he just walked into the room and sat at the bar and started pretending like he was back in an actual bar.  He called to the bartender, whom he called Lloyd, and started conversation.  Keep in mind this scene is relatively early in the novel as far as the supernatural occurrences.  Neither Jack nor Wendy has begun ""believing in ghost stories"" yet.  The most peculiar aspect of this scene is that Lloyd never speaks in dialogue.  Every line is uttered by Jack as dialogue (in quotes), but Lloyd's responses are all written as: ""Lloyd said it was."" or ""Lloyd sympathized.""  Lloyd has no persona at this point, he doesn't do anything in the narration itself; rather, the narrator tells us what Lloyd did.  Given King's tendencies to write from the POVs of his various characters, this implies that Jack is imagining Lloyd and his responses and there is nobody there.  Also in this scene, the party atmosphere begins to seep through, but any time Jack looks behind him or takes notice, the room empties and the sounds cease, leaving it implied that Jack's mind is conjuring everything.

However, as Jack becomes more and more a part of The Overlook--when you can start to say Jack has snapped--he returns to the bar room and this time Lloyd is a true character who acts and talks independently of Jack's mind.  He has dialogue and intentions.  I found this particularly interesting.  My first thought was ""how did he know Lloyd's name?""  And why was Lloyd suddenly a real phenomenon?  Did he exist prior, and Jack was interacting with him but still had himself convinced that he was merely hallucinating?  Or perhaps Lloyd *didn't* exist before, and The Overlook was consciously taking advantage of Jack by materializing the scene he had played out in his head before?  After all, The Overlook definitely seemed to play to his desires and egos in other instances, such as when they assured him he had always been the caretaker and that he could rise to the high ranks with The Overlook.  Was Lloyd actually Lloyd, or was he one of The Overlook's spirits playing a role?  And if he was Lloyd, did Jack actually interact with him the first time (and if so how did he know his name)?

These thoughts are not exactly major plot points but I thought Lloyd left us a path to consider the true nature of the phenomenon that is The Overlook Hotel.  I'm inclined to think Lloyd actually wasn't named Lloyd, and he was simply playing to Jack's internal desires and nostalgia for the bar life as a means of catching him in The Overlook's net, but it's a discussion/dilemma worth contemplating in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2toky7/just_finished_the_shining_finallyinteresting/,2015-01-26T03:00:59Z,3,0,books,The Shining,POST
rg7nc1,The Three Body Problem trilogy (Remembrance of Earth's Past) has to be the series of books I have most mixed feeling ever about,"I am at the beginning of Death's End so far, reading it in my native language. We've got a secondary translation from english, so I am not going to comment on the prose, but I trust the translator did not change the source material, and whenever I get to read about women... Oh my.

&#x200B;

I am really enjoying the actual *science fiction* part, and it's been a while since I could not put a book down for hours, but I feel the books would be a whole lot better if they had no women at all, at that's saying something.

&#x200B;

There are basically only two women there: Ye Wenjie and all the rest of them as a single entity with no distinct features. The entity is this sweet beautiful romantic charming chinese woman with shining eyes that make every single man in ten mile radius either a poet who would cross her name across the stars or a caring father figure whose icy military man's heart immediately melts when they look at each other. It is not one woman who is characterized like that, nor it is one man who looks at women this way, it's all of them together at the same time.

&#x200B;

Male characters are not very deep either, but at the very least they are people, not some walking poetic inspiration for everyone around. Come to think of it, aliens are people. Their actions (at least so far) are obviosly not humane, but incredibly human-like. They are believable as actors of those actions. While women are not.

&#x200B;

All in all it is extremely hard for me to take the whole ""it is so hard to understand aliens"" idea, when human women are more alien than aliens are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rg7nc1/the_three_body_problem_trilogy_remembrance_of/,2021-12-14T13:36:42Z,153,508,books,The Shining,POST

3as86z,I'm on chapter 12 of The Shining and so far it's pretty dry. When does the book start getting interesting?,"I love Jack, he's a very interesting character. Danny is a very realistic child. And Wendy is a convincing abused house wife. All the characters interest me and a few things have kept me going. I usually put down a book around 130 pages in if nothing gripping has happened and so far all they've done was explore the hotel. They explained each character's back story well enough, and that was nice. But the monotonous chapters of Ullman taking them around the hotel and us seeing things we already saw in the beginning and in previous chapters is driving me insane. When does Jack's alcoholism and insanity come into play? When does Wendy start becoming shrill and nervous? When does Danny's Shining start coming more into play? And when does the hotel start haunting everyone? 

Maybe I'm just impatient, but everyone told me the book would grip me from the beginning and I'm just rather bored with it so far. Can anyone tell me if it's worth pushing through and when everything interesting starts to unfold?

au0552,"Can we take a moment to acknowledge the brilliant, subversive premise H.G. Wells created for the War Of The Worlds?","I mean today we take for granted the alien invasion plot just based on how widespread and near universal it is within popular culture. But that wasn’t the case when Wells wrote War of the Worlds. That alone would make him at all time great but where he really shines is how he uses the alien invasion to satirize, at least in my humble opinion, the arrogance of imperialism. 

We’ve got to remember that when HG Wells was alive and as he grew up the British Empire was the biggest thing on the planet. It was the center of the financial industry, it was the biggest Maritime power, but most importantly it was and still remains the largest empire in human history. Bigger than Rome, bigger than the Mongols it was, as the cliché goes, an empire that the sun never sets upon.

At the same time in order to Make an empire this big you have to take land. Unfortunately, most of this land already had people in it that were pretty content with their own self governance. So you have all these justifications for why they don’t deserve it and why the British do. Remember, this is the time of scientific racism and eugenics. The Indians, Africans, Aborigines, Irish, they were all these subhuman creatures that the great, white man was saving from their backwards and savage ways. 

That’s why they got conquered, raped, enslaved, shot or destroyed by disease. They were practically asking for it! /s. Wells grew up and lived during this time and in a stroke of genius, decided to turn the concept on its head and give the British Empire a taste of its own medicine. War of the Worlds hypothesizes a scenario where the British meet a race of people that view them the same way they view the people they colonized. 

It’s such a fantastic utterly unique premise that I feel gets missed when other authors write sequels or spinoffs of original war of the worlds. There’s a biting add shift social commentary that elevates this book from being standard science fiction. The so-called spin offs and sequels end up taking the alien invasion part and simply running with that. Which in my mind makes a weaker product.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/au0552/can_we_take_a_moment_to_acknowledge_the_brilliant/,2019-02-23T21:07:56Z,212,4181,books,The Shining,POST

4rku5f,One of my favorite parts of SK's The Shining is a prefatory matter to the Prefatory Matters...,"The intro is by King himself, and perfectly describes why I think we have a fascination with such dark tales like The Shining:

""I believe these stories exist because we sometimes need to create unreal monsters and bogies to stand in for all the things we fear in our real lives: the parent who punches instead of kissing, the auto accident that takes a loved one, the cancer we one day discover living in our own bodies. If such terrible occurrences were acts of darkness, they might actually be easier to cope with. But instead of being dark they have their own terrible brilliance, it seems to me, and none shine so bright as the acts of cruelty we sometimes perpetuate in our own families. To look directly at such brilliance is to be blinded, and so we create any number of filters. The ghost story, the horror story, the uncanny tale-all of these are such filters. The man or woman who insists there are no ghosts is only ignoring the whispers of his or her own heart, and how cruel that seems to me. Surely, even the most malignant ghost is a lonely thing, left out in the dark, desperate to be heard.""

xhmvam,The silmarillion,"This one is a difficult read but it is imperative for any Tolkien fan to read it. Ages may come and pass, kingdoms may rise and fall, and the world may ravage and burn but the memory of these stories will linger forever and the world will be renewed. The world of Arda is full of wonders and delights for it was created by one of the greatest smiths - J.R.R. Tolkein.

The characters, contrary to what people usually complain about, are not all black and white. For they harbor avarice and envy in their minds, they are inspired by their aspirations and ambitions, they are moved by love and by hate.

The stories are all full and fresh as are all the things that grow under the light that shines by the grace of the author. You may grow old and forget everything but the stories will still be there with you. As the old age strikes you will always find within the deep chasms of your heart, Feanor casting all the beauty of the world into his silmarils, the hardships of Beren and Luthien, the tragedy of Turin Turambar son of Hurin, the never-ending love of Earendil and Elwing.

o6qgth,Lord of the Rings,"I know it is an unpopular opinion but I just finished the first two Lord of the Rings books and it has been one of those rare instances where I enjoyed the movies way more than the source books.

With the novels I just never felt the true desperation and overwhelming odds facing the characters. The book just felt more of a historical text; like reading a textbook vs watching an immersive documentary.

There are some books where I can separate the text from the movie, especially when there is great divergence between the story  (King vs Kubrick's The Shining) but the LotR movies are fairly faithful adaptations.

Sure I would have liked to see a bit of Tom Bombadil but I think the trade-offs with the movie interpretation are well worth it. One example: when Gandalf frees Theoden from the influence of Wormtongue - in the novels was a bit underwhelming, kind of like... hey, come get a few breaths of fresh air and a Snickers, you good boss? Look at the blue sky  (and his wrinkles smoothed. The end.) VS the movie interpretation when we can see the drastic  driving out of Sarumon's influence.

7ltmb4,"Just finished The Shining this morning, went on to try and read Dr. Sleep and I just can’t get into it. What did you think of the pair of books? And how do you keep your reading momentum, fellow Reddit book lovers?","This morning, while it was snowing and my backyard was [picturesque](https://imgur.com/gallery/cj4aA), I finished The Shining. I enjoyed reading it. I enjoy books that are descriptive of elements and weather such as The Shining. But let me back up a little bit so maybe someone can better help me and answer my question above. 

When I was younger, I used to read all the time. I always had a book. Through college, I only picked up one series of books for recreation (and it was a series I had already read as a child- Harry Potter if you’re wondering), and only one new book. I got on here to find some inspiration after realizing I desperately need something to divert myself from scrolling mindlessly through social media. I stumbled upon the standing thread on here for “people who want to get back into reading.” I saw that a user really got back into reading after reading The Stand. So I picked it up, and I loved it. I then proceeded to read *The Shining*. I enjoyed it too, but I did not divulge into it as ravenously as The Stand. That book made me feel like a fiend. 

This afternoon I started to read Dr. Sleep, the sequel to The Shining for those of you who may not know. I just couldn’t get into it. I think The Shining is better off where it was originally left, but that’s only my opinion. I can’t help but feel like I am losing my momentum to read though, if that makes sense. For those of you who have read The Shining and went on to read Dr. Sleep (or tried like me), I’d like to hear your thoughts. I’d also like to hear your suggestions about how you keep your reading momentum when you fumble upon books you don’t care for. 

Thanks for reading and pondering!

ai9enc,"I just finished 11/22/63, and it's one of the best books I've ever read. Here are some random thoughts","So after looking for book recommendations in this subreddit, I decided to try 11/22/63, and was instantly hooked. Now I've tried reading Dark Tower when I was in high school, but had to force myself through the pages and never managed to finish it. Because of that experience, I avoided Stephen King over the next 15 years. I'm so happy I decided to try out 11/22/63.

Really, it's just one of those extremely rare books that grabs you INSTANTLY, and never lets you go. It has flow all throughout. I guess me being a sucker for the time travel trope helped a lot, but still...the book was extraordinary. Here are some random thoughts while it's still fresh in my mind:

1. Stephen King ropes you in really early, by telling you about the time when Jake read the story of the Harry Dunning's father. When I read that, I just had to know what happened.
2. SK is a master of words. I remember a blog post I read by Scott Adams, The Day You Became A Better Writer ([link](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)). Scott Adams basically said that for comedy, you should use more colorful versions of words rather than the plain vanilla ones. For example, don't say ""drink"" when you can say ""swill"". SK did that plenty of times. For example: ""A truck droned past on 196, and then the road was still."" (while Jake was staying at the Tamarack Motor Court).
3. The concept of the past is obdurate and didn't want to be changed, was a brilliant idea and was the major source of conflict/tension in the story
4. The concept of ""the past harmonizes with itself"" was also a great idea, and it made for very interesting ""coincidences"" during Jake's journey in the past; to me every time the past harmonized I felt this eerie sensation.
5. I think SK intentionally made Jake's objective (preventing the assassination of JFK) many years away from his ""starting point"" in the past so that it wouldn't ""trivialize"" any of Jake's attempts to go back to the past. Jake had to make his journey back to the past really COUNT, because any tries would mean giving up many years of his life.
6. Because of point 5, SK now had to write about what happened to Jake in the interim (his teaching, relationship with the students, and Sadie of course). I would've thought this would get boring, but it was quite the opposite. Those chapters where Jake was dating Sadie, and directing the school play, and just living LIFE, were my absolute favorites. I almost didn't want it to end! I was hoping that Jake would just give up his mission and simply live the rest of his life in the past!
7. And those lines when the kids were doing the school play for Sadie's benefit! That moment when Mike and Bobbie Jill were doing the Lindy....Those words were so beautiful it sounded almost like a poem.

Sorry just had to write down my thoughts.

Can you guys tell me what to read next?? I'm thinking about Time and Again? What do you guys think?

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone who responded to this post...seriously, wow. I didn't expect this feedback at all. I just feel so blessed to be able to share my love for books / reading, and for great stories to people who are on the same wavelength (my wife is not a reader so all my stories about books fall on deaf ears! LOL). I'm relatively new to reddit and slowly fell in love with it as I discovered subreddits based on my interests/hobbies. I don't do Facebook/Instagram anymore. It's all noise to me. But Reddit...it has actually renewed my faith in social media.

Mostly for my benefit, I'm going to start writing below the book recommendations that everyone has been sprinkling in their various comments:

1bezbsi,Katherine Arden’s body of work + her latest book The Warm Hands of Ghosts,"I have been rereading the Winternight trilogy for the 3rd time but took a break to read Arden’s latest release The Warm Hands of Ghosts. And I’ve also read her middle grade series, the Small Spaces quartet. 

Winternight is a really solid fantasy series that I love and keep returning to. Of the Small Spaces series, I thought the first book (also titled Small Spaces) and second book titled Dead Voices were very good. Book 3, Dark Waters, was fine. The final book, Empty Smiles, really left me disappointed. I don’t know if I’ve ever read a book with a more rushed ending. 

It made me wonder like… did something happen? Was there an unmissable deadline? Did it maybe start to get too adult for middle grade and she didn’t know how to bring it back? 

So I was excited but apprehensive about The Warm Hands of Ghosts. Luckily I ended up loving it. At times I think it gets a bit too fanciful and maybe takes itself a bit too seriously, but overall, I really enjoyed it. 

And what’s really interesting to me is it sort of took a very similar character to the Smiling Man in the Small Spaces books, and expanded him into Faland in this book. They are also both similar to Medved in Winternight. All three are basically devils/gods who prey on human suffering. 

There is so much to discuss about The Warm Hands of Ghosts. I had never read a WWI book and found it to be a fascinating and horrifying setting. I believe The Shining must be a big influence based on this book + Dead  Voices.

sm29hy,Now I know why they call Brothers Karamazov the greatest book of all time,"""There has been nothing more insufferable for man than freedom.""

How do you review a book rated by many as the greatest book of all time? An epic of epic proportions, Brothers Karamazov has everything—drama, mystery, comedy, and Dostoevsky’s classic psychological philosophy. It’s so emotionally charged that you end up feeling deeply for even the least significant supporting characters.

Personally, I laughed, cried, bit my nails, took day-long breaks in the span of 1 month that I took to read it. I've read such long books before. The Lord of the Rings is one of my all time favorites. 

However, that book is an epic thanks to the number of characters and the expansive geography they traverse. With Brothers Karamazov, its the sheer depths Dostoevsky drifts into each character's psyche. 

But at the heart of this book is a gripping tale, one that catapults you into the abyss. ‘The Grand Inquisitor’ is a dialogue between a Spanish Inquisitor and Jesus, where the former criticizes the concept of ‘free will’.

The poem/story inspired many existentialists and is one of the first texts to highlight the absurdism of life. It's best summed up by the following quote

“There is nothing more seductive for man than the freedom of his conscience, but there is nothing more tormenting either.”

He feels that giving man free will was a mistake as it has just driven him into absurd confusion. Every living thing on Earth knows its purpose except man. Man has to choose, while stranded in a tempest of temptations, without knowing for certain that which choice is the right one.

This is especially true in our generation where religions and values have taken a backseat and freedom is at its peak. We often shout ‘tell me what to do!’ but unlike the previous generations, we don’t want a holy book or a father figure to give us an answer, even if that means we are always lost at sea.

As much as we want to reject authority and carve out our own path, the trail ahead greets us with tormenting confusion. We want the freedom to ‘do whatever we want to do’ but most of us don’t know what to do.

Some days, don’t you just hope that there was someone or something to show you the way, an authoritative figure with a whip and leash who you could obey without a second thought?

“There is no more ceaseless or tormenting care for man, as long as he remains free, than to find someone to bow down to as soon as possible.”

Sometimes, I am envious of the zealots know what’s the right thing to do because it’s written in their Bible, Quran or some other holy book. But even the ones with blind faith end up being blinded by confusion when they let the sight of reason shine, even for a minute.

What is the way out from this paradox? When being enslaved causes suffering and freedom ends up being insufferable, what does one choose?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sm29hy/now_i_know_why_they_call_brothers_karamazov_the/,2022-02-06T17:29:56Z,206,2052,books,The Shining,POST

10zespm,"Started reading 'A Man Called Ove' recently. I don't know if its because of English translation, but the similes used in this book are some of the worst I've ever come across.","I heard a lot about this book so I picked it up to read. It's going ok. It's not some phenomenal book or anything. It's just decent, the backstory of Ove is the best part for me so far. I wouldn't call this book a page-turner though.

Anyways, the biggest problem I'm having with this book is the countless similes the author throws at me. I mean, there is a simile for practically every couple of paragraphs. And man, those similes are some of the worst I've ever come across in a book. They're extremely pretentious (in the way that the author is trying too hard to be funny when he's really not - to me).

Initially I didn't pay much attention to them but chapter after chapter, they keep on coming. It has now become so annoying to read the book, to be honest.

I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else felt this when reading *A Man Called Ove.*

Is this a translation thing, or the original novel in Swedish also has the same kind of similes?

**EDIT**: Listing below a few sentences that I made a note this morning on my kindle:

> * Their mother had asked Ove what he’d really been doing in there in the garage, but Ove had just answered with a sound more or less *like when you try to move a bathtub by dragging it across some tiles.*

> * So Ove turns to the girls. And in the next second he looks *as if he’s just about to shine a desk lamp into their eyes and interrogate them on their whereabouts at the time of the murder.*

> * Ove looks at the book more or less *as if it just sent him a chain letter insisting that the book was really a Nigerian prince who had a ‘very lucrative investment opportunity’ for Ove and now only needed Ove’s account number*

> * on the other side sits the three-year-old, looking *as if she just found out she’s going to have an ice cream breakfast every day for a whole month.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/10zespm/started_reading_a_man_called_ove_recently_i_dont/,2023-02-11T07:04:03Z,182,234,books,The Shining,POST

15b7gd8,The Irreplaceable Role of Libraries in Our Communities - Let's Show Our Appreciation!,"
Hello folks,

I wanted to take a moment to shine a light on the unsung heroes of our communities - our local libraries. With the digital age advancing at a rapid pace, we sometimes forget the vital role libraries play in our society, beyond just being a place to borrow books.

Libraries are community hubs. They provide access to a wealth of knowledge for people of all ages and backgrounds, often free of charge. They're spaces where anyone can come to learn, explore, and connect. Whether it's hosting children's story hours, providing internet access to those who can't afford it, or organizing local events, libraries help bring communities together in unique and invaluable ways.

They also play a significant role in promoting literacy and lifelong learning. Libraries provide resources for everyone from students needing a quiet study space, to adults looking to learn a new skill, to seniors seeking companionship through book clubs.

In the age of information overload, libraries also help us navigate through the noise. Librarians are skilled professionals who can guide us to trustworthy and relevant information, something that's becoming increasingly important in our 'fake news' era.

But the sad reality is that libraries are facing budget cuts and lack of funding all over the world, and they need our support more than ever. So here's a call to action - let's show our appreciation for these indispensable institutions. 

Visit your local library. Utilize their resources. Attend their events. If possible, donate or volunteer. And let your local politicians know you value your community library.

Share your stories in the comments about how libraries have impacted your life or your community. Let's spread library love and ensure these pillars of our communities continue to thrive for generations to come!

Please give this post a thumbs up to help more people see and engage with it. Remember, the more people engage, the more we can raise awareness and support for our libraries.

Thank you for your time, and happy reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15b7gd8/the_irreplaceable_role_of_libraries_in_our/,2023-07-27T17:10:40Z,26,736,books,The Shining,POST

dvv0en,Falling back in love with The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson,"For those that saw my review of *The Shining* earlier this week, you know that it was a pretty disappointing read.  Luckily, there is a movie that fixes most of the book's issues.  Well, all but one: originality.

When reading *The Shining*, I kept trying to ignore how much it reminded me of *The Haunting of Hill House*, a book that I hadn't read since I was a kid.  Sure, *The Shining* is fundamentally constructed from old gothic horror cliches (giant abandoned estate haunted by tragedy and the evil deeds of an old aristocracy, causing the modern protagonist to slip into madness, etc.), but doing a ""20th Century take"" on these tropes is practically a genre itself, going at least as far back as Lovecraft's *The Rats in the Walls*.  For some reason, though, *The Shining* especially reminded me of *Hill House*, so yesterday I picked up a used copy.  After getting about a third of the way through it last night, I already just want to say: I love this book.

If you enjoy classic horror in any capacity, I highly recommend you check this one out.  It is truly one of the greats.  Jackson is probably more well known for her short stories, but she was an absolute master of both the horror genre and the craft of writing in general.  Her tone is incredibly specific and consistent.  The pacing is perfect.  Her characters are beautiful, vivid and instantly relatable, brought to life through dialogue that juggles being both organic and informative in a manner reminiscent of Tarantino.  And reading it so closely to reading *The Shining* and watching its adaptations, I'm noticing lots of little details that might have inspired aspects of both.  This book is a powerhouse in the genre, but it's also just a great read in its own right. 

I haven't seen the television series, but I'll probably check it out later this week.  I also noticed that there's already discussion on here about *We Have Always Lived in the Castle*, and having never read that one, I'll likely be checking it out next week as well.  Ultimately, though, I just wanted to share my recommendation for this book in case anyone else is coming out of the Halloween season still thirsting for a great horror story.  It's already reminding me of why this was such a legendary book and why Jackson is remembered as such a great author.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dvv0en/falling_back_in_love_with_the_haunting_of_hill/,2019-11-13T17:26:15Z,18,23,books,The Shining,POST

ydlzy7,(Spoilers)Stephen King's Later is perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read in my life,"I'm not a big fan of Stephen King's work. Up until this point, I have only read his book \* Cell \*, parts of the book \*The Shining\*, saw \*The Shining\* movie(didn't really like it), and now I have read \*Later\*. \*Later\* is a recently released novel of his that is apart of his Hard Case series of books. Though, there are some elements of horror spread throughout(But more on that later).

The book follows Jamie Conklin, a boy who has the power to see dead people and can extract the truth from them. He lives with his mother who runs a business publishing books while his Uncle Harry lives in various care facilities having contracted early-onset Alzheimer's. Jamie ends up having to use his powers to solve a case involving someone who plans on killing a lot of people from beyond the grave. However, solving the case causes a lot more trouble for Jamie than he originally anticipated(But more on that later).

While it may sound interesting, the book is anything but. Most of the time, the story is about Jamie as a pre-teen dealing with his life situations with the dead-body-viewing taking up a small portion of the book. The main conflict that the book presents, the case regarding the killer, gets resolved within two of the books 50+ chapters. The characters in this book are also not that interesting aside from Mr. Burkett who I wished we got to see more of(But more on that later).

A few other weird things I uncovered reading this book: the main killer's ghost apparently gets supernatural powers for no exact reason, the character Liz Dutton suddenly turns evil without much buildup, there's at least one or two spelling errors, and perhaps the weirdest thing in the entire novel happens in the last few pages where we are revealed who Jamie's father actually is. The ending regarding who Jamie's father is is so...awful. I felt that Stephen King could have done literally ANYTHING else but what he did regarding Jamie's dad(But more on that later).

Overall, I did not like this book whatsoever. The last few chapters did hold my attention pretty well, but the overall story I feel is pretty weak. Come to think of it, I may just not like Stephen King's work. I still have not read any of his most famous works like \*Carrie\* or \*It\*, but if they are anything like \*Later\*, then I may just end up not wanting to read them(But more on that later).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ydlzy7/spoilersstephen_kings_later_is_perhaps_one_of_the/,2022-10-26T01:58:14Z,26,0,books,The Shining,POST

You can ask me anything about the genre – and here also to focus on those specific classics, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The Yellow Wallpaper. AMA!","I’ve been teaching the Gothic and Science Fiction at university for over 25 years here in London, and I’ve edited classics such as Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker’s Dracula and H. G. Wells’s The Time Machine. I’ve written books about topics that range from the invention of the concept of telepathy to the history of the science fiction genre, and short books on the films Alien and The Shining. Princeton University Press asked me to do an illustrated history of the Gothic, which is just out for this Halloween, and tries to cover the whole field, from start to finish. I’m up for the challenge for you to Ask Me Anything about the genres of Gothic and Horror – but also, we thought people might like a narrower focus too: so ask me about Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper. The Female Gothic is a whole tradition in itself, one worth exploring!

1be1tmr,Daughter of the Moon Goddess,"So, I just finished Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan and it was such a disappointment. I got really interested in it based on the first few sentences but only a couple pages in I got bored and forced my way through it. Xingyin fell really flat as a character for me and most of the tropes in it were cliché. I also feel like the actual Moon Goddess was just a means to an end and an empty character, only there to add backstory and nothing more.

All in all, I didn’t enjoy it but I heard so many good things about it before reading.

Or that nightmarish quality when you're reading in pitch-black off your phone in bed, and your limbs can't be anywhere near the sides. Or you have to go to the bathroom, but can't reach two feet to your lamp because you know something is gonna grab you.

My most memorable book as such would have to be *Misery* by Stephen King. Even with the lights on I finished it with a thickening terror which didn't want me turning off the lights.

What's a book (or anything) that had a similar effect on you?

16ygwf3,The Stand by Stephen King,"It's a great book, the story is amazing, that last part in Las Vegas blew me away. Did NOT see that coming. I've learned to not expect too much from King's endings, but what happened in Vegas will never stop being amazing. Everything came together so perfectly.

The book up until the formation of the Free Zone was as tight and perfect as one could wish. But the Free Zone sorry to say is a drag. When the seven member committee gets together, I almost have to admit Harold Lauder has a point. Thankfully the baddies in Vegas more than make up for it. Every single baddie shined like a star from Lloyd Henreid and Trash to the mini-Elvis guy. 

I'm far more conflicted about the so called ""good"" guys. 

Take Nick Andros. So he f\*cks Julie whom he already suspected was not quite as old as she claimed to be, and then he physically assaults her over Pepto Bismal. Mind you even Lloyd Henreid the death row serial killer rat eating cannibal felon knew to stay away from Julie, while Nick not only slept with her but also threatened and abused her. And yes Julie's a b\*tch and bully, so leave her in that town by herself, don't talk to her. But to assault her after possibly committing statutory rape does not make what I call a good person.

And then Larry Underwood. He was abusive towards Rita, treated her as some kind of fuck toy. Woman was dying, had probably been dying for days, and all he could think about was somebody to f\*ck. This is after he shoots randomly in a dark tunnel and so wounding (and almost killing) her after verbally assaulting her over SHOES. Like if he was so smart and prepared, why didn't he think to bring a flashlight? If he had been less of a psychotic jerk over SHOES, he and Rita could have walked back to the city, got her the right shoes and maybe he would have remembered to get some flashlights for the tunnel.

101u2i8,The Langoliers by Stephen King,"Spoiler free post! 

Let me start this by emphasising that I have a life long 95% love affair with Mr King. Near enough anyway. I picked up The Shining when I was 12, had to put it out of my sight halfway through because my heart was hammering out my chest.

Picked up Misery when I was 14 and slightly braver and was hooked. King has been my most consistently read author and I keep on finding new, fantastic reads, and re reading my first loves. I could write a thesis on his work, even the more flawed and confusing tomes he's put out from time to time. He misses the mark sometimes but even when he does, he's pretty amazing in my opinion. When he hits it, he hits it as hard as any of the greats.

I saw The Langoliers recommended on a thread here about genuinely frightening reads and was thrilled to find a heavily recommended book of his that I hadn't heard of yet, asked for it for Christmas, and dear fellow readers.

It. Is. Perfect. 

From  the first page to the last,  I was marvelling at not just how much j was enjoying it, but how technically excellent it is.

The pacing, the emotional blows, the utterly unthinkable concept which he somehow captured and made *utterly* realistic. That's what I love about King. He doesn't just scare you, he scares you with things you couldn't have imagined, and does it so well you don't even need to suspend your disbelief.

That he can craft something so masterfully in 20 pages (what a plethora of short stories), or  900 (looking at you, equally excellent 11/22/63) is a true statement of his talent, and The Langoliers feels like a testament to all of his skills and strength.

Putting this out there because despite my (I think fairly clear?) love for his work, it was only by chance I found the recommendation. So if you enjoy his work like I do, then please read it, and chime in and share your thoughts if you have!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/101u2i8/the_langoliers_by_stephen_king/,2023-01-03T01:23:59Z,42,79,books,The Shining,POST

However, my sister and I have started picking books with the ugliest covers because we found that the inside has been full of gems. These overlooked books with great stories DOOMED! because of their awful cover design. 


The Martian movie cover is probably the best example I can think of. It’s not my favorite book — it’s passable, but people love it and it offered something fun for hard sci-fi fans. BUT THAT COVER IS SO BAD. I love Matt Damon, too! He’s a handsome man! But WHY.

nrkgx9,Oftentimes a good villain can be more interesting than the hero. Who are some of your favorites?,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR THE GORMENGHAST NOVELS


I suppose it's normal to emphasize with a books protagonist as for most books we're following right alongside them throughout and get their points of view, motivations, etc. Sometimes we get the point of view from a less than savory character (American Psycho), but in my experience most books shine the light on the ""good guy"".

I myself find a good villain, or at least an antagonist, can be just as interesting, if not more so. My number one case in point is Steerpike from the first two Gormenghast books. Not outright evil, but villainous. Crafty and full of unbridled ambition, yet a survivor who can be also be charming and ingratiating. Once the mask is pulled away (in his case literally and figuratively) he can be downright diabolical.

I think a good antagonist is someone where you can partially understand their motives, if not agree with them. Who fits your idea of a memorable villian/bad guy/antagonist?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/nrkgx9/oftentimes_a_good_villain_can_be_more_interesting/,2021-06-03T18:34:17Z,80,55,books,The Shining,POST
p870tm,"Generally, arguing whether an acclaimed film adaptation of a book is “better” than the source material or not is pretty goddamn stupid.","Look, I think it’s completely valid to feel disappointed by a film that changes aspects of a novel you enjoy so that facets of the original work are different or absent, and I get that. Les Misérables is my favorite book of all time and it’s seen all sorts of adaptations over more than a century, and none quite capture me the same way as Hugo’s original take. Here’s the thing I think a lot of people who whine about films don’t seem to understand though: an adaptation, at its core, should almost never intend to be a 1:1 reflection of its source, and part of the magic is seeing how a director may interpret the themes or subtextual values of the source material.


Take Kubrick as an example. Stephen King notoriously hated Kubrick’s take on The Shining; and while King’s source is still seen as a competent and oftentimes unnerving novel worth a read, time has shown that Kubrick’s mastery of direction, casting, camera work, etc. has created a Shining wildly different but yet more definitive and influential in cultural canon. If you want a more accurate take on King’s Shining, I implore you to check out the 1997 miniseries and see how King’s “accuracy” compares to Kubrick’s vision.

Furthermore, I think the only time pinpoint accuracy in a novel adaptation to film really benefits the film is when you’re willing to go ALL the way with it: dedicated the film entirely to being a 1:1, page by page replica of the source WHEN THE DIRECTOR CLEARLY ALREADY HAS A VISION IN MIND.   I look to Bela Tarr’s 7 & 1/2 hour 1994 film version of Satantango, which works because the film carefully takes the time to make every single scene feel lived in, tangible and astonishingly real. 


I have heard so many times over the years that the primary complaint about a film one has is that it’s “changed things” about the novel, as if that somehow deters from the value of the adaptation as just that: an adaptation. If it’s so important to you that the story remain told exactly the same way and not give the director room to explore concepts and experiment, then I’d strongly suggest just… I dunno. Reading the book again?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p870tm/generally_arguing_whether_an_acclaimed_film/,2021-08-20T15:03:45Z,9,7,books,The Shining,POST
joxygl,"Stephen King's ""The Stand"" is such an underrated masterpiece","I know King is extremely popular and ""The Stand"" is one of his most popular books, but in the grand scheme of things I think this book is so underrated. Unlike 'The Shining"" ""It"" or ""Pet Sematary,"" no one outside of Kingdom knows about it, owing mostly, I'm sure, to the lack of a notable film adaptation to place it within the cultural zeitgeist. 

Besides that, though, I think this book is overlooked frim a critical/literary standpoint, too. It never gets talked about at the university level and I know King himself has been famously spurned and looked down on by the literary community, but I just can't believe the absolute treasure trove of devices and and mechanics and characterization being ignored here. 

This has been one of my favorite books for years, but rereading it now for the first time since high school I'm blown away by this thing. The introduction of Frannie Goldsmith may be my favorite character intro in all of literature. Her personality is painted so quickly and vividly I was knocked out of my chair. That whole opening scene between her and Jess just oozes heart, personality, and melancholy. Not only is it a great intro for Fran, but also in setting the stage for the whole novel and the bittersweet feel of it all, including the end. 

The first three chapters of this book just feel so much sharper than I remember. King's prose is incredibly fresh here and his descriptors are staggering. Maybe my heightened appreciation for it only comes from the fact that lately I've only been reading King's new stuff, which is stale garbage, but this... This is something special. 

What do you guys think? Agree or am I nuts?

EDIT:

Wow, I was not expecting the absolute shit storm this stirred up. At all. 

To be clear, titling this ""underrated"" was a mistake as it conveys the wrong idea. I've also been blasted for calling it a masterpiece and told I don't know what ""underrated"" is. I am not using ""underrated"" and ""I like this book"" interchangeably. I like this book a lot, yes, and think it is King's masterpiece. I know it has been adapted and influenced music. None of that addresses anything else I said in my post. I think the actual writing and mechanics of this book don't receive enough attention- and some people have said they think the writing and characters are poor, which is ok. I'm not going to tell them they're wrong, especially when they take the time to give the reasons they feel that way. My question this whole time has solely been:

Why is this book not regarded as critically ""great"" in the wider literary canon, and why has this book- despite being so popular among his readership- not found the same cultural success as some of his other works? Is it simply due to lack of a popular, recent, lasting, theatrical adaptation?

If I come of as an idiot or fishing for something, I'm sorry. This is not intended to be a controversial post at all, but instead basically just an opinion poll. I have not had any luck finding fellow readers at my University (despite enrolling in master's English courses) or really anywhere else. That's part of what got me feeling this way about the book in the first place- the lack of exposure I've personally witnessed. If that doesn't align with other people's experiences that's completely fine, as those experiences are what I'd like to hear about. Obviously I'm the asshole due to the largely negative feedback I got here and if I ever post again it will be nothing like this. 

But anyway, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to comment and interact with me and the post. I appreciate the discussion and hearing other people's thoughts.

18oqlo5,The Shadow and Bone Trilogy... I liked it.,"I just finished the 3rd book. Not much happened plot wise.  
She goes above ground.  
She goes to the mountain base and trains.  
Darkling attacks and she escapes.  
She looks for and finds the 3rd amplifier.  
She kills the Darkling.  
She lives happily ever after.  
On the mountain she had no chance against the Darkling. 3 books of training and she doesn't even kill the Darkling with her power; she sneak attacks him with a knife in the heart. 

So the plot was simple, and maybe even anticlimactic.  
But everything else was better. The banter was fun. Nicholai shines so bright and steals the show every page he's on. A lot of characters were funny and had entertaining quips and one liners, making it a fun story.  
The Darkling was a sympathetic villain. Hundreds of years old he just wants Alina so he's no longer lonely, and he wants Geisha to be thought of as equal. He massacres innocent civilians which makes him a horrible monster, but other than that he is sympathetic.  
Alina's growth from confused nobody to someone who's willing to put in the hard work and make difficult choices to save the country is nice to see.

16vvhd4,Yumi and the Nightmare Painter by Sanderson (No Spoilers),"Of the Kickstarter books it's better than the Frugal Wizard one but not as good as Tress. It starts really slow and almost like a parody of Sanderson where he's just extremely expository about the magical wrinkles of his setting. Eventually though, the characters do get interesting and shine through.  
Like Frugal Wizard one, the protagonist is basically an accidental protagonist who isn't necessarily heroic, but it works a lot better in this book. It skews a little more YA on the Sanderson spectrum and it's a quasi romance but it sort of works.

  
Like Tress, the narrator is Hoid, and it gets very Tell Don't Show at the end where we get the Word of God as far as what *actually* happened earlier in the book.  


Didn't hate reading it, mostly enjoyed the ride, and the last 100 pages are exciting but it's not something I'd recommend to someone who isn't a Sanderson completionist.

cjremo,The True Horror of Call of Cthulhu (or why Lovecraft ruined other horror works for me),"Despite the certain-sounding title, much of Lovecraft's work is still enigmatic to me, no matter how much I am drawn to (and sometimes repulsed by) it. In *The Call of Cthulhu*, one of narrator's first descriptions is of a carved monster saying, 'but it was the *general outline* of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful'.

Throughout the story, the most horrific thing about Cthulhu is not that he is a beast or an alien, but that what he represents violates 'traditional' law and New English sensibility. The cities in the strange dreams that plague intellectuals and artists are horrifying because the 'geometry' of the cities is all wrong, they are of some 'cryptic regularity'. Their fear is not of their own destruction, say bodily harm or death, but of the destruction of the basic principles on which they pride themselves. Scientific minds, on the other hand, fear Cthulhu because of his vastness. Because they are unable to comprehend his existence (which is outside of space and time for the most part), all their knowledge and belief is rendered useless.

As for the 'primitive tribes' that accept Cthulhu and worship him, part of this is attributed to Lovecraft's racist outlook (extreme, even for his time) but is also a sort of anthropological horror in itself as well, the fear of The Other. What is it exactly about these peoples that allows them to accommodate a being of this type? Why are they more connected to the natural (or in this case, unnatural) world? Is this a form of intelligence that cannot be understood using traditional Western methods?

I always wonder if this was Lovecraft's true intention, to portray the fickle nature of Western enlightenment, or if his perspectives and biases are good examples of this fact - that there may things that will not obey the laws of geometry, space and time or even sit well with our aesthetic sensibilities. What if, through his biases, we can evaluate our own basic beliefs about knowledge and The Other?

Long story short, Lovecraft ruined horror for me because I cannot find anything as deeply horrifying as something that does not obey basic physical and mathematical principles. 

Any thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/cjremo/the_true_horror_of_call_of_cthulhu_or_why/,2019-07-30T12:58:14Z,44,73,books,The Exorcist,POST
5vzb3x,'The Outsider' from H. P. Lovecraft's 'The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories',"I was at Barnes & Noble a few nights ago, browsing the fantasy section. I spotted *The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories* by H. P. Lovecraft and picked it up rather impulsively before heading over to the Starbucks to sit with a coffee and read. I didn't have too much time to spend and I'm a slow reader, so I picked out one of the shorter stories in the hopes of getting through the whole thing before I left. I decided on *The Outsider*; it was incredible.

It's hauntingly beautiful. I loved the descriptions: sometimes vague yet suggestive (""odious oblong boxes of disturbing size""); sometimes highly-detailed (""It was the ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and desolation; the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation; the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide.""). I thought the whole story was woven so well. You can read it [here](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/o.aspx) if you like.

iwz6ol,Frank Herbert’s Dune and Lovecraft’s stories have given me more appreciation for the differences between books and audiobooks.,"Normally I don’t have a preference between book or audiobook - I just borrow the format that’s available in my library. 


So last year, I read The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories which is a collection of Lovecraft’s most famous short stories. And that book took me almost two months to read because it was a difficult read, linguistically. Lovecraft’s style of writing is very complex and his range of vocabulary is insane. As much as I enjoyed some of the stories in the book, I constantly had to take breaks and read something else because this book was exhausting to read. 

But a couple of months after reading that book I found a podcast of a guy reading Shadow Over Innsmouth; it was basically an audiobook. And I had next to no difficulty understanding the text. Guessing the meaning of words and understanding complex sentences were so much easier when they’re being read properly. Maybe this sounds a bit obvious, but the difference was so stark that I just need to mention it. 

On the flip side, there’s Dune. These days I only borrow digitally through Libby and my library only has the audiobook for Dune and not the ebook. I tried listening to the audiobook on two different occasions and I gave up after a couple of dozen pages both times. I thought this book was impossible to follow. So many characters, so many expositions, and so many made-up words were just dropped on the audience. And barely anything happened in the first two hundred or so pages that the audiobook just felt unengaging. 

But after the Dune trailer dropped recently, I went and bought myself a physical copy. A week later and now I’m officially a Dune fan. With a book this dense, it was paramount that I read at my own pace and take a moment to swallow all the info. 

TL;DR: If you have difficulty understanding a book at a linguistic level, try the audiobook. Meanwhile, if a book is just so dense with info, read the ebook/physical copy. The difference is way bigger than you think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iwz6ol/frank_herberts_dune_and_lovecrafts_stories_have/,2020-09-21T12:11:16Z,602,7604,books,The Exorcist,POST
aucnjv,"I just read ""The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories"" - this is my first experience with HP Lovecraft, and I'm blown away at how incredibly atmospheric, mystical and unsettling these stories are","Can't believe it took me so long to get around to Lovecraft's works, but I'm so glad I did. I was expecting something stuffy, boring and tame and boy was I wrong. I've spent the last 2 weeks with this book, which contains IIRC some of Lovecraft's best known works (the self-titled story, Shadow Over Innsmouth, Whisperer in Darkness, Nyarlathotep, Herber West Reanimator, Color Out of Space etc.) and I feel like the concepts, ideas and certain passages from the stories have wormed their way into my brain.

I can't stress enough just how amazing Lovecraft's prose is. There are passages and sentences throughout the stories that made my jaw drop and caused me to re-read them over and over again. His ability to create this almost tangible sense of dread, unease and sheer unknowableness is unparalleled, and he's able to imbue his mythologies with this weight of ancient, forgotten history. Most of the stories aren't really scary, per se, but they are all at the very least creepy and skin-crawling. I can see why people say his writing makes humanity seem like an insignificant speck in a vast, terrifyingly unknowable universe. I love that most of the stories don't really have any detailed explanations or concrete endings - it adds to their sense of mystery and the unknowable. 

If I had to name my top 5 from the collection it'd be the following:

\- The Shadow Over Innsmouth: This seems to be a fan-favorite and I can see why. Lovecraft has an obsession with strange things and beings from the bottom of the sea, as well as creepy small towns, and this story is like the perfect mix of the two, building in dread and unease throughout with a bleak ending

\- Celephais: I found this really short story to be the most beautifully written in the collection, and the descriptions of the narrator's dream-world are gorgeous, haunting and strangely melancholy. It didn't really have any horror elements but it really transported me to stranger places

\- The Colour Out of Space: This one got under my skin the most, with the way it built up the mythology of the fungi creatures and the indescribable colour. More than anything, this story emphasized the human mind's inability to comprehend something as insane and out-there as these mysterious, inhuman creatures from the edge of the solar system. The fate of the farmer and his family was tragic, all the more because it was shown as just a by-product of the creatures being there

\- The Call of Chtulhu: I have to mention the title story and probably his most famous work. This one is really more of a ""historical"" text and myth-making, but boy is the history and the myth fascinating. The ending at the Lousiana swamp was amazingly creepy and some of the imagery, like when we find out about the Inuits worshipping an ancient god in Greenland on a cliff under the aurora borealis, is simply mesmerizing. 

\- The Outsider: Another short but impactful tale, also beautifully written and just simply weird because of how strange and ambiguous the setting is. The ending hit me really hard too

If I have one complaint, it's that Lovecraft has the habit of being overly verbose at times, which really kills the pacing of some of these stories and makes them kind of difficult to read. There's also one too many instance of a character going mad or fainting because they saw something indescribable. These are minor nitpicks though because I've rarely read horror so atmospheric and immersive.

bzpq97,"People always name ""The Call of Cthulhu"" as Lovecraft's best story, but to me his best (and scariest) one is easily ""The Dunwich Horror"". And this passage always sends chills down my spines.","The excerpt from the Necronomicon:

“Nor is it to be thought,” ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, “that man is either the oldest or the last of earth’s masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but *between* them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. *Yog-Sothoth* knows the gate. *Yog-Sothoth* is the gate. *Yog-Sothoth* is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in *Yog-Sothoth*. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth’s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, *saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind*; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man’s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is *Them*. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. *Iä! Shub-Niggurath!* As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. *Yog-Sothoth* is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.”

s4607g,"Lovecraft's ""The Colour out of Space"" is a masterclass in creating an atmosphere of horror.","I've recently gotten into eldritch and cosmic horror, so of course I had to start with Lovecraft. The first story I read was the iconic ""Call of Cthulhu"", which turned out to be sort of average - the real horror was the almost satirical amount of racism. ""At the Mountains of Madness"" is a fun read, but drags a lot at some points. ""The Colour out of Space"" blew me away with how genuinely creepy it felt to read.

What stood out to me was his creative use of adjectives and adverbs to invoke very precise impressions of all this freaky shit. A few examples taken almost at random (mild spoilers):

\- ""It was a fearsomely archaic place...  I could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again""

\- ""The orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours...  No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen...  but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants... the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion... 

>!\- ""the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him...  a sort of heavy dragging, and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction!<

>!\- ""They were twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air ""!<

>!\- ""There burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance""!<

And those contrast sharply with parts of the story where the events and language are mostly normal. His writing style feels very unique, I don't know if it was common at the time, but it somehow makes for a very immersive reading experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/s4607g/lovecrafts_the_colour_out_of_space_is_a/,2022-01-14T23:37:05Z,47,347,books,The Exorcist,POST

4livdp,Is Lovecraft unappealing to the modern reader?,"I ask this knowing full well that many of his *ideas* are popular, with cons filled with various paintings, T-shirts, and plushies of Cthulhu, Lovecraft-based board games doing quite well, and direct liftings from his work on popular shows like *South Park*.

That said, No one seems to be reading his work. I'm no expert, obviously, I've only read around 9 of his short stories, but nearly everyone I see online talking about Lovecraft seems to say things that I know are false based on a very small reference. and I can't say anyone I've ever talked to has been able to name a Lovecraft story beside *The Call of Cthulhu* or ""The shadow over Innsmouth"".

To get the elephant out of the room, Lovecraft was insanely racist. To the point where we can't really say he was a ""product of his time"", he was above and beyond what was considered acceptable at the time. and it does show in his work, I remember most notably the narrator character in *Herbert West:re-animator"", a medical doctor, needs to keep reminding himself not to think of a black man's arms as forelegs. 

But beyond that, he's just not scary. I say that as a guy who willingly admits to getting scared by tons of dumb stuff in fiction. I haven't read nearly enough horror from the period to say if he was scary ""for his time"", but his stories are just tedious. The way he describes his monsters (often by saying their ""undescribable"") never did anything for me but stop me from being able to picture the scene, which was not at all conducive to the immersion needed for a book to scare me. Although I do admit that's just me, and would like to hear what any of you have to say on the matter. 

And don't get me wrong, I like other genres of pulp, EE Smith and Robert E Howard are some of my favorite authors, but when I look at Lovecraft's prose all I can garner is purple, and no substance beneath the style.

That said, I did quite enjoy ""At The Mountains of madness"", if only for its mythology. and it would seem in the modern world, the ""mythology"" of Lovecraft is the only part of his writings that survive.

I still enjoyed the stories very much (particularly The Shadow Out of Time), but overall I found the writing to be monotonous and just not that good. So I started reading about his critical reception and legacy, and found that, in general, he's seen as a bad writer that nonetheless created a very rich universe, which is a shame and a blessing.

86cbip,The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian,"Robert E. Howard published most of his Conan stories in the fantasy and horror pulp magazine _Weird Tales_. Howard wrote for _Weird Tales_ from 1924 to his death in 1936, and was mentored in his writing by the editor of the pulp magazine, Farnsworth Wright. While writing for _Weird Tales_, though before his Conan stories, Howard wrote a letter to the editor praising a reprint of another author’s recent story, “The Rats in the Walls.” The author of that short story was H.P. Lovecraft. When Wright forwarded the letter to Lovecraft it was the beginning of a lifelong correspondence between the two. Howard and Lovecraft exchanged letters discussing the context and subtext of the Conan stories, and Howard incorporated themes from what is now known as Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos.

Howard is credited as having probably the most influence over the type of tale we now call “sword and sorcery”, but the conception of Conan the Barbarian we have today thanks to several Conan films is much different than what Howard created. Going into _The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian_, I expected what we see in the movies and comics, a character covered in blood, clad in a loincloth, sword cleaving through his enemies while a pair of nude women kneel beside him. But what I was presented with by Howard was different. He’s resourceful, intelligent, and very practical warrior. Conan isn’t anyone’s dummy, and despite the “low INT” reputation barbarians tend to have he is cunning and wily, as often using brains as brawn to best his enemies. The stories of Howard’s Conan show us a long career as he grows from thief and pirate to the king of the greatest nation of the Hyborean Age. Certainly Conan is a creature of brutish strength and is always ready to solve a problem with muscle, but he’s also intelligent, generally well-spoken (especially later in his life), and even chivalrous.

_The Coming of Conan the Barbarian_ is an anthology of Conan tales unedited from Howard's published short stories and presented in the publication order. It also omits stories by other authors, which in the past made it difficult to know which stories where original and which homages. That sort of thing really appeals to me, even if it does mean that the Conan I am reading about may not be the same one Gary Gygax was inspired by decades ago. They begin with shorter stories but the last few tales are longer and in my opinion are of higher quality. There's a lot of inspiration here that a DM could use for one shots or to build out a campaign. The characters as well are colorful and unique, with their own motivations and relationships outside of the titular character. Players and DMs alike could glean ideas for creating their own interesting characters.

> In the gardens of the palace the torches glinted on polished helmets and curved swords and gold-chased corselets. All the noble-born fighting-men of Ayodhya were gathered in the great palace or about it, and at each broad-arched gate and door fifty archers stood on guard, with bows in their hands. But Death stalked through the royal palace and none could stay his ghostly tread.
>
> --Robert E. Howard, ""The People of the Black Circle"" in _The Bloody Crown of Conan_


Howard's ability to describe a vibrant scene is remarkable and many DMs could benefit from studying this. Note the frequent use of compound hypermodification in ""polished helmets and curved swords and gold-chased corselets"", where each noun is modified by least one verb. Howard was a master of oral storytelling and we can all aspire to his mastery of description.

The world of Conan’s stories is an entirely fictionalized representation of a pre-flood Earth. Its nations and cultures are intentionally obvious allusions to real-world ones—Celts, Germanic tribes, you name it. Howard was a history buff, and wanted to create a playground in which to let his imagination run wild, but not one in which he would be constrained by all of real history. He created a low-fantasy historical fiction world in which to tell Conan’s stories. The Hyperborean Age is full of of violence and bloody axes, to be sure, but there’s still plenty of royal scheming, war, and intrigue.

This is first in a three volume series collecting all of Howard’s stories as well as his essays and poems relating to the character and the Hyperborean Age. _Coming_ also includes beautiful illustrations for stories and important scenes by Mark Schultz. Each volume has a different artist. Unfortunately I found this out too late, and chose to listen to this book on Audible rather than purchase an ebook or physical book. Having seen some of the art, I fully intend to purchase all three physical volumes to appreciate the art and add to my bookshelf.

A common plot element in Conan’s tales is that of the damsel in distress. Conan never fails to come to her rescue, even at the cost of ruining his well-prepared plots to steal a MacGuffin. And yet, never does Conan ask for favors in return from his companions. When a romance does evolve naturally, Howard eschews explicitly describing any acts, instead hinting at them obliquely. Conan even defers to Belit’s plans in “Queen of the Black Coast”. “Hers was the mind that directed their raids, his the arm that carried out her ideas. It was a good life.”

Though often described doing unseemly things such as piracy, robbery, and plunder, Conan never actually partakes in these in the stories. In fact, Conan is more often the hero of the stories, even if his motivation tends toward his own survival or personal gain. He is lawful in his own way, being true to the ethics of his homeland as foil to the ""civilized"" antagonists' often evil actions. The Conan we are presented with is likely a Lawful Good or Neutral Good person, though the Conan we are told about but who never appears in tales might tend more toward Chaos.

Conan’s enemies and allies were diverse and colorful: men and women from a multitude of cultures and ethnic groups. I think that as DMs we’re often inclined to use characters who look and act like us (most of the older D&D adventures I’ve read have mostly human NPCs and mostly monstrous opponents). Stories and adventures with the default western pseudo-medievalism are to me a tired trope. Howard’s tales helped to inspire me to use a greater variety of characters and backgrounds. Why can’t the bartender in Hommlet be a Goliath exiled for wanting to own a tavern instead of an old white human guy? Conan’s opponents are Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, African, Celtic, German, and Native American inspired characters. They can provide ideas for multicultural variety in our own campaign worlds, and to appreciate the variety of people of our own planet.

While the episodic nature of short story collections doesn’t always appeal to me, I did enjoy the growth of the character and of Howard’s storytelling ability throughout. I think this is a nice side-effect of finally collecting Howard’s stories in order. Conan is one of the primary influences of the barbarian archetype in early versions of D&D, and while that archetype has changed over the years it’s still great to see its roots.

I give _The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian_ 4 of 5 stars as a resource for DMs. The escapist fiction and colorful, high-adventure stories share a grim undercurrent leaving reader with mixed emotions as they finish reading. Perhaps more tellingly, I plan to read the two remaining volumes in Del Rey’s Conan collection, _The Bloody Crown of Conan_ and _The Conquering Sword of Conan_.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/86cbip/the_coming_of_conan_the_cimmerian/,2018-03-22T15:24:45Z,42,121,books,The Exorcist,POST
iagjps,"[Review] ""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed"" (1997) by Marion Zimmer Bradley","> Ghor, Kin-Slayer was conceived in the late 1970s by Johnathan Bacon, editor of Fantasy Crossroads, a popular fanzine during the Robert E. Howard ""boom"" of that period. At the time Bacon had been presented with an unfinished story by Robert E. Howard, ""Genseric's Son"", which he quickly recognised as having strong possibilities if completed not by one, but a whole series of authors.
> 
> Beginning with Fantasy Crossroads in March 1977 Bacon lined up top authors in the fantasy field to each contribute a chapter until the novel would be completed some 17 installments later. Each issue of Fantasy Crossroads would include two or three chapters until the saga was finished. Unfortunately, thouh, after on 12 chapters saw print with the January 1979 issue, Fantasy Crossroads was no more, and for all intents and purposes, Ghor, Kin-Slayer was lost forever.

 - Publisher's Note, *Ghor, King-Slayer* (1997), 176

""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed"" is the sixteenth and penultimate chapter in the saga of Ghor, the round-robin which began with an incomplete story by Robert E. Howard and in time included some of the most prominent names in fantasy and horror—including Karl Edward Wagner, Michael Moorcock, Manly Wade Wellman, Brian Lumley, Frank Belknap Long, Ramsey Campbell, and many others. The only black author was Charles R. Saunders. The only woman was Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Marion Zimmer Bradley had been involved with science fiction & fantasy fandom since the mid-late 1940s, claimed to have met her first husband through the letters pages of *Planet Stories*, and by the mid-1950s was a published author in her own right, and found particular success in her Darkover series, a science-fantasy sword & sorcery world that takes its inspiration, and some of its names, from Robert W. Chamber's *The King in Yellow* (1895), as well as from J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings* (1955). She was also published in *Amra*, one of the premier Robert E. Howard 'zines of the 1960s, and became one of the most outspoken and well-known women in science fiction and fantasy, and much of her most popular and celebrated work involved female protagonists and a focus on their points of view and concerns—a rarity in male-dominated fantasy and sword & sorcery at the time. After Ghor, Kin-Slayer, she would go on to edit the long-running Sword and Sorceress anthology series, and find international acclaim with *The Mists of Avalon* (1983).

The story up until the point that Bradley received it was, like many round-robins, not well-balanced in terms of plot and pacing. Ghor had begun as a James Allison tale;  Howard had written several tales with Allison, most notably ""The Valley of the Worm"" (*Weird Tales* Feb 1934) and ""The Garden of Fear"" (*Marvel Tales* Jul-Aug 1934). In each of these stories, the crippled Allison in the present day would cast back his mind into previous, more heroic incarnations, to relive the glories of past lives and loves. This literary device allowed Howard to explore different fantasy historical periods and settings—in this case, Howard set the stage of Ghor's adventures in Vanaheim and Asgard, and so implicitly in the Hyborian Age, making Ghor a contemporary (of sorts) with Conan the Cimmerian.

Whatever initial plot Howard had in mind and never finished, in the hands of other fantasy writers, the Ghor saga got properly weird; involving as it does the Cthulhu Mythos, a prophecy, losing a limb and gaining a magical prosthetic (a la Lludd of the Silver Hand), becoming a werewolf, and gaining an affinity with the Hounds of Tindalos. Old pulpster H. Warner Munn left off the previous chapter with Ghor leaving the Caves of Stygia...

> Out of the caves of Stygia, then, with the great river Styx bursting forth at our feet and across the desert; Shanara, still unconscious against my breast, and at my feels the dread Hounds, invisible, only a rustling and a panting and a fleeting brush against my thigh. On, Northward through the night, drawn by the northern stars that flickered cold above us; but even the giant strength that I, James Allison, wielded in those nigh-forgotten days when I was Ghor, kin-slayer and great were-wolf, was waning.

 - Marion Zimmer Bradley, *Ghor, Kin-Slayer* (1997), 152

Despite this being the penultimate chapter, it is really in many ways the wrap-up of the whole preceding saga; Richard Lupoff, who got chapter 17, offers something more along the lines of a postscript or epilogue. So Bradley's 11-page chapter is, in essence, a short story in itself trying to bring about a satisfying conclusion to whatever threads are left—principally, the three curses Ghor had accumulated—starting with:

> [...] Shanara had probably been less than faithful wife to me. Well, I thought, looking at her haggard, ravaged features, for that too she had paid. And indeed in such a world as this, a woman had no choice but to obey whoever held her body; she had become my bride by no less forceful process, and that we had come to love one another was only a single blessing showered on me amid many curses. No; I would not ask Shanara what price she had had to pay for surviving the long ordeals of capture. (ibid. 153)

If the tone seems reminiscent of [“The Vale of Lost Women”](http://deepcuts.blog/2020/06/10/the-vale-of-lost-women1967-by-robert-e-howard/) (1967) by Robert E. Howard, it should be remembered that this bit of casual sexism is being filtered through a female fantasy writer, and Bradley is neither entirely unsympathetic to Shanara nor does she ignore the physical and psychological impact of the implied rape. Which includes one of the oldest tropes of body horror, well-familiar to Mythos fans:

> For her body was swelling, ripening...and I knew that look. Even her sullenness and the persistent thirst was part of that, and it was not hunger alone set her to seeking the bitter desert herbs as we travelled. Within her breeding body the curse of Gaea was ripening. (ibid. 154)

There is a question of who is the father; and Ghor entertains that it might be his, the sorcerer who kidnapped her, or even ""some nameless thing somewhere in the realms of sorcery and evil"" (ibid). Ironically, Ghor has no real issues if the child isn't his; the wild-man's own family situation being what it was (exposed at birth as an act of infanticide, raised by wolves, killing his own birth-family), he is rather progressive in his determination to adopt Shanara's kid.

The story skips forward to the birth, and then to the final fulfillment of the curse. Ghor's story comes full-circle.

In one sense, Bradley had her hands tied: fifteen chapters of increasingly odd sword & sorcery, bringing in everything from the Moorcockian Gods of Law and Chaos to the Cthulhu Mythos—and there were prophecies and curses to wrap up, physical distances to travel to get Ghor back from Stygia to Nemedia and finally in the icy forests where the story started under Robert E. Howard. In another sense, by putting the focus on Shanara and the goddesses who cursed Ghor, by addressing the sexism and realities of sex and family in the Hyborian Age, she makes the chapter her own.

It's not a bad penultimate chapter by any means. Not something Robert E. Howard was likely to write, but then nothing that any of the other authors had contributed attempted to really pastiche Howard; they all knew better than to try and ape his prose, and they all brought their own ideas to the table while trying to keep the story moving. For fans in 1997 when this was published for the first time, they could likely appreciate that.

Today, readings of Bradley's fiction tend to be colored by other factors in her life.

Walter Breen was prominent in Darkover fandom. Breen had been convicted of child molestation in 1954 and received a suspended sentence; his continued pederastic activities resulted in his banning from the 1963 Second Sci-Fi Pacificon. This caused an uproar in fandom, with Marion Zimmer Bradley vocal in her defense of Breen, though the actual cause of Breen's banning was not universally known, and was called the [""Boondoggle.""](https://breendoggle.fandom.com/wiki/Breendoggle_Wiki) Breen and Bradley would marry in 1964.

In a [1998 deposition](https://deirdre.net/marion-zimmer-bradley-1998-depositions/), Bradley said she was aware of Breen's pedophilia and child molestation. They would separate in 1979, although Breen would continue to live on the same street and in Bradley's employ for the next decade; they would get divorced in 1990. In 1991 he would be sentenced for child molestation, and die in prison in 1994. In 2014, her daughter Moira Greyland came forward to admit that [Marion Zimmer Bradley herself had molested children](https://www.webcitation.org/6RqZ6c9az), including her own children. Links to further accounts, and the story as it unfolded, can be read [here](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Marion_Zimmer_Bradley#Allegations:_MZB_Sexually_and_Physically_Abused_Her_Children).

The personal accounts of Marion Zimmer Bradley both as a serial child sex abuser, and as someone that facilitated Breen's sexual molestation of children, cast a shadow on her fiction. Readers now look for any evidence of predilections which were perhaps not obvious to fans previously—and there are definitely scenes and relationships in Bradley's work which, in light of these allegations, appear much more skeevy than perhaps they once were.

How do we read ""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed,"" through this lens? There are, fortunately, no incidents of child sexuality in this story. But the revelation of Bradley's history of sexual abuse, and her marriage to Breen—how does that reflect on Ghor's oddly accepting attitudes with regard to Shanara's pregnancy? Is he actually being weirdly progressive in not caring if the child is his, and supportive of Shanara despite the social ramifications of rape in Hyborian culture—is it at all reflective of Breen and Bradley explicitly condoning and supporting each other in their own extramarital sexual relationships?

There are no good answers for these questions. Many folks, reading this story, would be glad not to have been aware of it at all. In 1967, Roland Barthes published the essay ""La mort de l'auteur,"" which would have strong and wide-ranging impact on literary criticism. With the death of the author, authorial intent needs no longer be a primary concern of literary criticism; the text can be read and interpreted on its own, apart from the facts of the author's own life.

A straight reading of the text, with no knowledge of the author, would almost certainly not raise any associations with pedophilia in the reader's mind. If you take Bradley out of the equation, then ""Doom of the Thrice-Cursed"" becomes little more than a chapter in a long but not-terribly-great Robert E. Howard fanfiction. The comments on sexism and the Hyborian Age remain, and the story can be ready, studied, critiqued, and enjoyed.

Yet...it is important that Marion Zimmer Bradley was the author, the only female author, in this round-robin. That she choose to address sexism in the Hyborian Age, or at least Ghor's understanding of it, becomes important—because her male contemporaries in Sword & Sorcery largely didn't. If you as a reader or critic consider sexism and gender disparity in the field of fantasy fiction important at all, then her presence, as more than mere tokenism, has to count for something.

Marion Zimmer Bradley inspired many. She injured many too.

Marion Zimmer Bradley also wrote a novel with Mythos elements, *Witch Hill* (1990).

I notice how this theme of letting children grow with imagination only came to bloom later on after half a decade later with A Little Princess and Anne of Green Gables.

And so once again this is (sigh) another instance of being aware of the film and not knowing about the book. But I digress. This novel, published in 1971, it became an enormous sensation and a big seller. The contents of it had taken readers by surprise during that time. The story of demonic possession is delivered in a visceral way, much more so than Ray Russell's ""The Case Against Satan"".

This is the layout of the plot, Actress Chris MacNeil begins hearing strange noises in the house she shares with two housekeepers and her daughter, and then gradually she begins to see changes in her daughter. Some very frightening changes.

She takes her to various doctors when these changes intensifies and gets not answers as to what may be wrong with her daughter, she has one hope left. An Exorcism.

Like I've said before this was a very intense novel. Later it was adapted to film and released on an unsuspecting world and its screenplay was even written by Blatty himself.

178law7,[Theory] A second evil in The Exorcist: There's something wrong with Sharon,"The movie adaptation of The Exorcist is being told through a visual medium and therefore we directly see evidence of Regan’s possession, however in the book we are shown scenes through our character’s POVs and are constantly given counter-arguments that Regan may not actually be possessed. I feel like theories concerning The Exorcist novel may be ignored because the movie version feels far more cut and dry as to what’s happening, but there’s some ambiguity there in the novel that I find interesting.

I’m not saying this theory is definitely true, or even what it proves. But after finishing the book I saw a comment on Reddit alleging that people have theories about the help in the book, and what they’re up to during the novel. After searching around I really couldn’t find anything other that [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLrD1CC5wQ) which discusses the idea that Regan may be being sexually abused. It primarily focuses on Burke Dennings, but at the end argues that if Regan is being abused it’s not him. Other than that I can’t really find any solid theories as to what the help are up to - so I went back over the book with a more suspicious eye and I want to talk about how weird the behaviour of Sharon is at certain points.

A second evil:

So the first thing to point out is that there may be a second evil lurking within The Exorcist. Near the beginning of the novel when Chris is hosting a dinner party a priest remarks.

>“They had a couple of cases of desecration in Holy Trinity [church] last week,

This is at the beginning of Regan’s possible possession (later in the party she comes in and pees on the floor) and seems way too far for Regan at this point in time - her behaviour slowly gets worse and as we’ll see she does indeed desecrate a church later, but it seems very out of character for Regan to be doing this early in the book. We get mentions throughout the book of incidents of Black Mass and devil worship, and at one point Sharon tells us there are occultists in some areas of Georgetown. This is constantly brought up throughout the novel but there aren’t any obvious cases of devil worshippers in the book. It could be that this is just mood setting by Blatty, or it could be hints that more is going on than meets the eye.

We should also ask the question of why Pazuzu and why Regan?

We’re introduced to the demon Pazuzu at the beginning of the novel through the form of a shield:

>reaching down for an amulet and cradling it pensively in his hand. It was a green stone head of the demon Pazuzu, personification of the southwest wind. Its dominion was sickness and disease. The head was pierced. 

>The amulet’s owner had worn it as a shield. “Evil against evil,” breathed the curator,

Pazuzu was used to ward off lesser demons in mythology so him being used as a shield to combat evil makes sense - but why is that mentioned in this story? What evil is Pazuzu being used against later? It could just be that he isnt he’s just possessing Regan for no reason - but if so why would the author call attention to Pazuzu being a shield against evil at the beginning of the book?

And with possessions, usually someone needs to invite a demon in to be possessed. We see this in the book where at the end Karras invites the demon to possess him and then kills himself to stop it. So why did Regan invite a demon into herself?

I see two main options: Early in the book we’re shown Regan talking to an imaginary spirit called “Captain Howdy” she talks to through a Ouija board. Later Regan runs in crying and writhing in pain complaining that Captain Howdy is pinching and kicking her. Regan may have invited in Pazuzu to protect her against Howdy. We’re never actually told the demon who later possesses Regan is the same as Howdy - there’s only one point in the book linking them when possessed Regan tells Karras that he can call it Howdy. But that’s because it’s trying to avoid giving him it’s real name, and Karras has likely been told of her friend Captain Howdy. At an earlier point Regan makes it seem as though Howdy and the demon in her are different things:

>“I don’t know!” Regan tearfully answered him. “I don’t know! I don’t know why he does it! He was always my friend before!” 

>“Who’s that?” 

>“Captain Howdy! And then after it’s like somebody else is inside me! Making me do things!” 

>“Captain Howdy?” 

>“I don’t know!” 

>“A person?” 

>Regan nodded. 

>“Tell me who?” 

>“I don’t know!”

Or did Regan invoke Pazuzu to try and scare off someone else? Someone who was involved in black masses which usually involve drinking the blood of children? Evil against Evil.

The case against Sharon:

Sharon is one of the servants employed by Chris. She works as Regan’s tutor and housekeeper. She was hired 3 years ago. While Chris employs a few housekeepers Sharon is the one closest to Regan - working as her tutor, but we also see throughout the novel that she’s the one who looks after Regan at night (at one point inviting Father Karras over during the night when she notices Regan doing something. Chris is asleep and never told what happened). She administers Regan’s medication during the earlier parts of the book (later on she teaches Chris how to administer it). We’re told that at some point at least she was a religious Christian, but there’s also a reference to her now seeing a “guru” - a type of spiritual advisor not usually related to Christianity.

If Regan is simply making up the possession and is acting out because of some other trauma like abuse then we should pay close attention to Sharon as apart from Chris she’s the closest adult to Regan. If Regan is posessed and invoked Pazuzu in order to protect herself from something, then again we should look at Sharon, the closest non-parent to Regan. And if we do so we can notice some odd things that are associated with Sharon.

As mentioned throughout the book it’s said that there are Satan worshippers, this is first brought up at a dinner party where Chris and her friends discuss black masses 

>“I heard a statistic once about something like possibly fifty thousand Black Masses being said every year in the city of Paris.”. 

After the party Chris notices that Sharon is reading a book related to this 

>She reached out for a book by Sharon’s elbow. “So what are you reading?” [...]  Chris nodded and glanced at the title of the book: A Study of Devil Worship and Related Occult Phenomena. She opened it and found a penned note: […] Chris riffled through the pages of the book. “What’s the scoop on Black Mass? Pretty hairy?” “I don’t know,” answered Sharon. “I haven’t read it.”

There’s a note on the book from one of Chris’ friends saying that they picked the book out for her, they delivered it to Sharon to pass on to Chris. But Sharon forgot to until Chris noticed it. What’s odd here though is that Chris twice indicates that she thinks Sharon has been reading it. Chris then tells Sharon to read it and tell her about it, instead Sharon once again forgets about the book and leaves it lying in the open where Regan then takes it

>Sharon had dinner at the house with Chris, and then left for a date. She forgot the book. [...] The next morning the devil worship book had mysteriously vanished from the table. No one noticed.

The book is later found in Regan’s room and is one of the points of evidence discounting Regan’s possession - as the characters argue Regan could have read this book and could then be subconsciously imitating parts of it instead of actually being possessed. Sharon is the one who brings such an important item into the house, I don’t think she would make up the note from Chris’ friend saying she picked the book out for her (which is mentioned to be hand written), so this isn’t Sharon’s book. But she brings it into the house, is implied to be reading it which she denies and then she forgets to take it away which lets Regan take it.

But the oddest event related to Sharon is the death of the director Burke Dennings.

Burke Dennings is Chris’ director and a friend of hers. According to the story Sharon gives Burke came to call on Chris but only Sharon was in the house. Sharon needed to go pick up Regan’s medication so let Burke in and went out. Burke was then found dead, at the bottom of the stairs beside Regan’s window with his neck twisted around.

While the book mostly focuses on the implication that possessed Regan threw him out the window, we’re also given some reason to doubt that (or at least Sharon’s version of the story). And there is of course the possibility someone else killed Burke Dennings (if Regan wasn’t posessed). One of the strangest factors which gets overlooked is why Burke was in Regan’s room in the first place?

We get one account from the possessed Regan talking in Burke’s voice:

>“Look, she killed me. Not our innkeeper, Karras—she! Oh, yes, indeed!” It was nodding affirmation. “She! I was minding my business at the bar, you see, when I thought I heard her moaning from upstairs in her bedroom. Well, now, I had to see what ailed her, after all, so up I went and don’t you know she bloody took me by the throat, the little cunt!” The voice was whiny now; pathetic. “Christ, I’ve never in my life seen such strength! Began screaming that I was diddling her mother or some such or that I caused the divorce. It wasn’t clear. But I tell you, love, she pushed me out the bloody fucking window!”

 Now there are different ways we can look at this:

If this really is Burke speaking - why does his story not match Sharon’s? Sharon said that Burke was let in after he came looking for Chris because Sharon had to go to the pharmacy, but Burke says he came because he heard moaning from Regan’s room. There’s also no mention by him of Sharon letting him in or needing to leave the house. There’s also an odd inconsistency that if Burke was able to hear Regan from a bar outside and rush into her room, why wasn’t Sharon able to hear Regan screaming when she left the house? Or why even let Burke in/head out if Regan was making such odd noises.

This could be explained by the fact that it may not be Burke - if the possession is in Regan’s head it could just be her POV on what happened but again there’s no mention of Sharon, and it’d be odd for Regan to say that Burke was in a bar near her house since she’d have no knowledge of what Burke was doing before he entered the room.

Sharon’s account is also suspect in another way - Kindermann points out that it shouldn’t have taken as long as it did for her to go to the pharmacy and come back - although Sharon does claim this was because the pharmacy’s delivery was delayed. With Chris unsure what to think of Burke’s death after Kindermann quizzes her on it Sharon then tries to come up with an explanation as to how Burke could have fallen

>Her eyes still on her notes, Sharon probed at the silence in a strained, low voice. “They’ve got an awful lot of hippie joints down around M Street and Wisconsin. Lots of potheads and occultists and stuff. The police call them ‘hellhounds.’ I wonder if Burke might have—”

>“Oh, for shitsakes, Shar!” Chris suddenly erupted. “Just forget about it, would you? I’ve got all I can think about with Rags! Do you mind?”

Now it’s odd that Sharon knows so much about these occultists, but it’s also odd that Sharon tries to come up with another explanation as to how Burke died when Chris obviously doesn’t want to hear it. Now Sharon may not want to believe Regan threw Burke out the window and may be grasping at straws here, trying to come up with any explanation she can think of to absolve Regan. But Sharon is calm in this scene, not exactly desperate and afraid of the possibility Regan might have done it. Sharon is also coming straight from Regan’s room, and as established the two are close. If anyone should know the full extent of Regan’s possession it should be Sharon, and so she should have an idea of what Regan is capable of. If Regan killed Burke, Sharon would probably be the person who came to that conclusion first. 

Instead Sharon is coming up with an excuse that turns attention away from herself - the only adult who should have been in the house when Burke was thrown or fell out of a window. The other housekeepers were gone at the time and we only have Sharon’s account that she had left the house. If Sharon was in the house then why was Burke in Regan’s room? He wouldn’t have to look after her so he’d presumably just wait downstairs to see Chris. Did Sharon lead him upstairs and push him or did Burke hear moaning from Regan’s room while Sharon was in the house? If so what was she doing? Was she doing something to Regan to illicit the strange noises Burke heard or was she ignoring them for some reason? 

I also want to note that Sharon mentions occultists in her explanation of Burke’s death - another time when the occult and Sharon are linked.

Later in the story there is a desecration of a church, which seems in line with a black mass which requires multiple participants. The statue of Mary is desecrated and an altar card is left that depicts basphemous fanfiction of mary. Now the altar card was typed up on the same typewriter Sharon uses but with a heavier hand - and fingerprints on the card match with Regan’s prints. The card was also written in skilled Latin which points towards a possessed Regan writing it. But as I mentioned at the beginning of this post very near to the beginning of the story we’re told:

>“They had a couple of cases of desecration in Holy Trinity last week,

So there are Satanists active before Regan’s possession and Regan now seems to be joining in with them? We only see Regan leave her room about twice on her own when she’s possessed (to pee on the carpet and the spider walk) due to the fact that Sharon is heavily sedating her. But she’s now apparently producing cards, spending time on Sharon’s typewriter and going to nearby churches? Is she doing this on her own or is Sharon taking her there? After all she’s the member of the help who we see with Regan during the night, she controls her medication, and her typewriter was directly involved.

Now it is mentioned throughout the book that Regan’s window keeps being open when Chris comes to check on her. So there is an explanation for how Regan could get out of the house. But again, Sharon is supposed to be sedating her. And we see that the medicine does work as it’s what gets Regan into her restraints. The demon couldn’t be jumping out to possess other people (ala Exorcist 3) because Regan’s fingerprints were linked to the desecration. Regan had to be present, despite the fact she’s heavily drugged to the point where she can barely move, let alone leave the house. So is Regan leaving the house or being taken from it by someone else like Sharon?

Another strange moment between the two is the infamous spiderwalk

>Gliding spiderlike, rapidly, close behind Sharon, her body arched backward in a bow with her head almost touching her feet, was Regan, her tongue flicking quickly in and out of her mouth while she sibilantly hissed and moved her head very slightly back and forth like a cobra. 

>Staring numbly, Chris said, “Sharon?” 

>Sharon stopped. So did Regan. 

>Sharon turned and saw nothing. And then screamed and jumped away as she felt Regan’s tongue snaking out at her ankle. 

>Chris threw a hand to her cheek, her face ashen. “Call that doctor and get him out of bed! Get him now!” 

>Wherever Sharon moved, Regan would follow.

What I find weird here is that Regan is following Sharon so closely and moving in time with her, completely fixated on Sharon. For such a bizarre and impactful “scare”, I also find it strange that the chapter ends with that last line where the emphasis is completely placed on Sharon. We’re also shown Regan following Sharon around - which could point to Sharon being able to lead Regan.

We also get warning about Sharon during Karras’ dreams:

>The soft ringing of the telephone on Karras’s desk drew a swift, alarmed glance from Father Lucas. “Watch out for Sharon!” he warned Karras sharply, and then abruptly the phone was ringing loudly so that Karras awakened and realized he’d been dreaming.

…

>Racing thoughts. Suppositions. A coldness. Then an urgency: “Watch out for Sharon!”

Now this does have an obvious answer: Sharon calls Karras and warns him about something happening with Regan. This incident is then what leads to Karras finally seeking an official exorcism. Part of Karras just wants to walk away, and of course he dies during the exorcism so a guardian angel warning him of proceeding with it isn’t out of place. But I think the warning itself is suspect - with the emphasis placed on Sharon rather than the call. Karras also received a warning in his dream not to continue with the exorcism before this warning, so he didn’t really need a specific warning about Sharon. It suggests that something more may be up with her.

So in conclusion I’m really not sure what’s going on with Sharon. There are a variety of ways we could interpret this.

If Regan really isn’t possessed then is Sharon abusing Regan, and perhaps bringing her to thinks like Black Mass and telling her about occult phenomena, which Regan then imitates subconsciously when she acts out? As mentioned in the video I linked to at the start Regan’s symptoms fit very closely victims of sexual abuse - being extremely sexual, peeing themselves, not trusting adults or medical professionals etc. Could Sharon be performing this abuse or at least aware of it?

If Regan was possessed did she accept Pazuzu to protect herself from Sharon and the members of the occult she associated with? I don’t think so as Regan still seems to go along with a later Black Mass so she doesn’t seem to be warding off Sharon. If it was to protect her from “Captain Howdy” then Sharon seems to be aiding it - by either killing Burke Dennings in her room or covering for the death, by taking her out to desecrate churches, leaving it books on the occult and doing… whatever it is the spiderwalk scene was about.

A counterpoint to this is that Sharon invites Karras over to see evidence of Regan’s possession which directly leads to The Exorcism - if she was working with the demon why push for an exorcism? But we do see that Pazuzu wants some sort of fight or confrontation with the priests. When Father Merrin dies of heart failure the demon wants Karras to bring him back:

>Merrin lay sprawled facedown on the floor beside the bed. Karras knelt, turned him over, and seeing the bluish coloration of his face, he quickly felt for a pulse and in a wrenching, stabbing instant of anguish, Karras realized that Merrin was dead. 

>“Saintly flatulence! Die, will you? Die? Karras, heal him!” raged the demon. “Bring him back and let us finish

So maybe the demon pushed for Sharon to bring Karras back when he was doubting the need for an exorcism?
A lot of this is ambiguous and as I’ve laid out there are arguments against a lot of what I’m presenting here. But I do find the character of Sharon suspicious and diving into her behaviour raises a lot of interesting questions as to what’s really going on in The Exorcist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/178law7/theory_a_second_evil_in_the_exorcist_theres/,2023-10-15T18:13:11Z,1,2,books,The Exorcist,POST

awi98a,Just read The Exorcist in one sitting.,"It’s been a really long time since I’ve been able to find a book I physically could not put down. The Exorcist was one of them.

I find that my bar has been set quite high for books, and if I’m not hooked within the first five minutes of reading, I get bored and give up. I know this is a bad habit to get into, and I’m sure I’ve missed out on a lot of excellent novels. But it gave me hope to find a book I couldn’t put down until I had finished it.

Prior to listening to The Exorcist, I had never read/listened a true horror book before, but this audio book was amazing. I don't know what I was expecting, but certainly not a well-thought out, well written, captivating story. Also the author, Blatty, does the reading and his voice is on point! Always fun to jump into a new genre and have your stereotypes destroyed :)

av9fvx,I just read “The Sirens of Titan” by Kurt Vonnegut.,"Both of my parents were writers. As a rebellion, I often deliberately avoided books they would recommend. That turned out to be idiotic, because they have impeccable taste.

I just finished the book, not 5 minutes ago-

and I sobbed.

The language, the flow, the cadence, the characters. This book enveloped me within the first 3 pages. The journey of Malachi Constant, from shitty, rich playboy, to Martian slave, to disgraced Earth monster, to Titanic nomad, to salvation seeking earthling once again.

It’s all nothing.

I never believed I could be moved by something so nihilistic and bleak. But this shook me to the core. Life is random. Life is an accident.

Read this book. Please.


Edit: A lot if you were asking about some other recommendations from my parents. Here are some my favorites off the top of my head:

Winter’s Tale - Mark Helprin     
Rebecca - Daphne Du Maurier    
The Second Coming - Walker Percy    
Cry, the Beloved Country - Alan Paton    
Telegraph Avenue - Michael Chabon    
Lincoln In The Bardo - George Saunders    
100 Years of Solitude - Gabriel Garcia Marquez    
A Tale for the Time Being - Ruth Ozeki    
The Exorcist - William Peter Blatty    
Naked Lunch - William S. Bourroughs    
The Sellout - Paul Beatty    
The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Haruki Murakami    

There are a million more, but these ones were all given to me by them over the years and became some of my favorites. Once I stopped being a dickhead and actually read them.

I'm thinking about reading The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty sometime soon. However, I'm a bit apprehensive, because of the reputation the movie has for being one of the scariest ever. I'm 17 years old and I've been reading Stephen King for the last year and a half or so, as well as some HP Lovecraft. Not much has REALLY scared me; maybe a few things from The Shining and IT.

a6azgz,Just finished reading The Exorcist (spoilers ahead),"I'm looking to probably start reading Legion next but is Kinderman as annoying in Legion as he is in The Exorcist?
The ""jumbled"" nature of how he acts around people seemed like an act but just came off as weird to me. I am a little concerned about buying Legion because if the whole book is focused on his perspective then I don't want to deal with his unfocused nature for a whole novel.

I also did what I always do when I finish a novel and tried looking up explanations about the ending just to get different interpretations. 

[Spoiler](#s ""A lot of people that I read about followed the belief that Karras had just thrown himself from the window because of the reasons the book stated: death of his mother, remorse over the potential death of Regan, etc. However, I remember the story that they told early on when Karras was reading through those books about the man from the Bible that Jesus cast 'Legion' out of. The demons were cast into pigs and then the pigs we're drowned in the sea. I wondered if anyone else picked up on this, that maybe as a last ditch effort, Karras remembered the story and sacrificed himself, thus explaining the peace and look of triumph in his eyes."")

What is with the last few sentences of the story? The conversation between Kinderman and Dyer seem so out of place to me.

I loved the novel and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a suspenseful book to read.

uea0n1,"To anyone who’s read it, what did you think of William Peter Blatty’s Legion, the sequel to The Exorcist.","*SPOILERS FOR THE EXORCIST AND LEGION* I’ve not long finished reading Legion and my initial thoughts are dominated by disappointment. I read and loved The Exorcist last year, so I was interested to read the sequel. Especially since it doesn’t seem to be talked about a whole lot, so I was very curious to see what the whole thing was about.

I guess there was a reason nobody really talks about Legion though haha. I did have initial worries after learning that the whole book is from Detective Kindermans perspective, a character that I didn’t enjoy in The Exorcist, finding him to be out of place in that story. Those worries were confirmed… On the whole I found him somewhere between painfully dull and irritatingly pretentious during Legion. There were some decent chapters and ever so slowly I might have warmed to Kinderman. But his constant meandering ponderings on the nature of existence were grating to say the least. I don’t think he was a strong enough principal character to follow. 

I also found the entire plot to be… I dunno. Unnecessary? It ended very abruptly and I don’t feel like it added anything interesting to what The Exorcist dealt with. When you start to think about what Legion is about too, it really starts sounding incredibly silly. So a Zodiac killer type is invited into Father Karras’s body by the original demon from The Exorcist just before he could fully die… and they, along with an amalgamation of other nasty demons/personalities slowly reanimate Karras brain and burst him from the grave, doing a switcharoo with another priest… and start murdering people… it’s just a bit of an odd idea to choice right? Or is it just me haha. Like how does any of that work? I know we’re talking about Demons, so I’m not expecting some logical explanation… but it seems very unconnected and random. Almost as if it doesn’t know whether it wants to be a sequel or not.

I will concede that the book certainly got better towards the end. The beginning and middle were a slog, but once things really kicked off and Karras is revealed, there were certainly some chilling moments which I enjoyed. But I couldn’t help but be very disappointed. It didn’t get even remotely close to the quality of The Exorcist. 

Would love to hear peoples thoughts and opinions though. Whether you agree or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uea0n1/to_anyone_whos_read_it_what_did_you_think_of/,2022-04-29T01:01:47Z,1,3,books,The Exorcist,POST
tik8ti,I posted about The Haunting of Hill House and got sent straight to The Exorcist. I wasn’t nearly as scared and here my high-level notes from comparing the two.,"I’m not going to link my posts about THOHH (yes, posts, I might be obsessed), but I can tell you it had a lot of comments. In those comments, there were a whole host of people who recommended The Exorcist - the kinds people who like making sure other people get the souls scared of them, good people, people I appreciate. 

Anyway, I read The Exorcist only because of those recommendations. I haven’t watched the movie, so the only clear idea I had about it was that it would be a story possession and an exorcism - which I generally find quite scary in movies so I was genuinely prepared to be scared.

I got my husband to pre-agree to come to bed at whatever time I went to bed, because I lay in bed alone and terrified after my first (of two) THOHH sessions and I didn’t need that again.

Anyway. One of the things that made THOHH so utterly terrifying for me was how Shirley Jackson didn’t really rely on anything overtly supernatural, violent, or even obscene. She relied on the terror of the unknown: could it be or couldn’t it? What is it? The entire read, and even after the fact, you sit there wondering.

Not so much with The Exorcist. There’s the attempt to cast doubt on whether Regan is really possessed or just suffering from some kind of psychiatric disorder, which wasn’t as well-executed. That’s because the possession itself wasn’t subtle and the alternative nothing except “maybe an unnamed mental disorder that no psychiatrists can really put there fingers on”. It wasn’t as compelling a theory when the case for possession was made out so strongly. (In THOHH, each alternative explanation is equally compelling.)

THOHH was also CRISP. Every line was perfectly executed, nothing superfluous. The Exorcist, on the other hand, wasn’t as exact. In particular:
- Kinderman is a bit of a fool and the reader feels the frustration of the characters encountering him because of all his dithering. That’s good in general, but I don’t think he served a highly valuable purpose. He was very much ancillary.
- There’s also a dream one of the characters has >!not to trust another character, and it goes absolutely nowhere. It’s a misdirect, but why misdirecting to Character A and not Character B? It’s not really.!<
- >!There is also the question of other crimes in the book that seem like they are related. But the link is never properly explored.!< As opposed to contributing to answering the question, it’s more of a loose end. In THOHH, there are unanswered questions: but they lend themselves to the author’s goal of wanting the reader to theorise and decide, and relate directly to that process.
- The start of the book sees us spending a day in the life of one of the other characters, same as THOHH. Both seem a little slow. But the relevance of that sequence in THOHH is immediately apparent.

All of that being said, I did really enjoy the book. It had more elements of outright horror than THOHH and I can see how that is scarier for some people. I’ve read many horror books though and those kinds of scares creep me out in the moment, and I move on from it. For me to be _really_ scared (and it’s only happened once as an adult, from a book), there needs to be subtlety because then the fear, the terror, the dread is generated by my own mind. 

In my view, it’s easy to be scared, for a second, if there’s a scene that shocks you. There is an animal ritual sacrifice or some terrifying show of occult presence. Pretty creepy. Scary, if it comes out of nowhere. But it’s words on a page, a scene I’m imagining, from very express and directory writing. I’m not cultivating the fear in my own head and it is therefore fleeting. I can see why that is more scary to some people however and I can admit that this is very much a question of what it takes for _me_ to be moved. 

Again, I thoroughly enjoyed The Exorcist. It was quick and it almost felt like a horror-mystery. But… My brain wasn’t as stimulated as it was with THOHH. I think part of the issue is that I just went in straight after THOHH, which is just an amazing horror novel, but a masterclass in writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tik8ti/i_posted_about_the_haunting_of_hill_house_and_got/,2022-03-20T12:43:36Z,19,9,books,The Exorcist,POST

But, the writing was not what I expected. One thing were colloquialisms that didn't quite fit, in my opinion, like "" what doin"" ""whaddya mean"".
Another thing that slightly bothered me were some of the dialogues . They just didn't feel natural/real. They had a weird flow.
Then there's the Detective, all his conversations were a little jarring. Some humor between the characters  fell flat..
At other times the writing was riveting, but overall it left me with a feeling that The Exorcist is a fantastic book, but not fantastically written. Does anyone agree ?

If you have a first edition but a later printing that is still very rare (such as T*he Hobbit* or *Dune*) then go ahead and mention it.

I have 1st/1sts of *Snow Crash*, *Ender's Game*, *Dune*, *Hyperion*, *Salem's Lot*, *The Great Hunt*, *The Short-Timers,* and *The Stand*.  My copies of *Snow Crash* and *Hyperion* are signed.

As *Snow Cras*h is signed, I believe that is the single rarest 1st/1st that I have, as only 600 hardcover 1st/1st copies were printed back in 1992, making it one of the smallest first print runs.  Probably only half of those have survived over the last 32 years, and I would imagine only a fraction of those are signed.

The story here is set in a top-secret installation that is dubbed by the Pentagon as Center 18. Residing inside Center 18 are twenty-seven military men, all of them decorated officers and heroes. But these men are gripped in madness with hope eluding them.

Then one day a psychiatrist is assigned to the Installation, a certain Colonel Kane. Kane is haunted by some form of guilt as holds the inmates in a powerful and strange power. But slowly he begins to lose control over a murderous demon that he is keeping locked up.

And all round the inmates there gathers the forces of faith and fury. Of a kind of obsessive evil, and also a soul piercing terror that rages.

This novel is quite a departure from his 1971 work ""The Exorcist"", as it focuses on the the questions about the  existence of god. And it is also a rework, that was spurred on by the success of the previous book, of an earlier novel of his from 1966 titled ""Twinkle, Twinkle, ""Killer"" Kane"". While it isn't the horror of both ""The Exorcist"" and ""Legion"" and it isn't as long, it is still very good as a thriller.

The story has a very suspensefule undercurrent that runs through it. And it even has some comical moments that pop up every now and then.

So here is the premise of this novel: Susan Garth, a teenage girl, was in every way an ordinary girl. But then things take a bizarre turn as she starts to have a strange and adverse reaction to churches and a keen fondness for the vulgar. Eventually it culminates in her stripping right in front of a priest and then attacks him.

If it isn't madness then it surely must be demonic possession. In order to defeated it, one Bishop Crimmings brings in a young priest who is more in tune with new ideas, and also a taste for brandy. As they battle this entity that's taken over the girl, tension grows between them. And there is a dark revelation that lurks that is more terrifying.

""The Case Against Satan"" is not a very long novel but it makes up in a chillingly intense story.

b4v4g4,Nonfiction seems to have become the only type of literature I enjoy,"Hello, everyone!
I wonder if anyone shares the same or similar thoughts as I do. Thanks in advance!
The thing is, I was an avid fiction reader for a long time. All my favorite books were fiction novels, such as 1984, 11/22/63, Lolita, The exorcist, Brave New world, Rosemary's Baby, Sherlock Holmes novels, and many more. Yet, a while ago I noticed that imaginary characters and adventures stopped gripping my interest so tighly, mainly because they were, well, not real. After reading books like 'Into thin air' and 'The miracle in the Andes', which are the personal accounts of two different people who had to go through a terrible ordeal in order to survive, I have started to realize that I wouldn't have found these novels so riveting, had they been written as fiction stories. Right now I am listening to an audiobook called 'Nothing to envy: ordinary lives in North Korea', and it's about as gripping as a book can get. The book is even more fascinating than my beloved 1984, which I have long considered to be one of the literary masterpieces (I draw the comparison due to the two novels' very similar themes of totalitarianism and control). The reason is, once again, because it's based entirely on true accounts. Why do we even need fiction if the world and people around are capable of providing stories that may be more engrossing than any work of fiction? Of course, by shunning fiction books I can be missing out on lots of powerful stuff, as well as its authors' eloquence and vocabulary (I am not a native English speaker, so the more I read, the better), but somehow I seem to lose the ability to be engrossed in something that takes place exclusively in other person's head.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b4v4g4/nonfiction_seems_to_have_become_the_only_type_of/,2019-03-24T10:55:35Z,38,27,books,The Exorcist,POST

kj8llj,"Danielle Vega's ""The Merciless"" is a great series for horror/thriller fans","This series has been described as ""Mean Girls meets The Exorcist"" and that is the most accurate description of any series I have read ever. It's got a lot of great gross imagery and very tense scenes. I remember reading the first book way back in middle school and I absolutely loved it. I still own the third and fourth books to reread from time to time. The first book is a good read even as a standalone story, but the other books are worth reading as well for their own reasons. The second book does a great job of keeping the audience on it's toes, never becoming predictable or cliche. The third book actually explains events taking place before the first book, and does a great job of making us sympathise for one of the antagonists of the first and second books. The fourth book was decent, although I think the series could have ended with three, it wraps up the entire storyline. Overall a great series and a must read for horror and thriller junkies",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kj8llj/danielle_vegas_the_merciless_is_a_great_series/,2020-12-24T04:20:33Z,0,3,books,The Exorcist,POST
vq9yxz,"Question about The Monk, by Matthew Lewis","In volume 2 while Raymond, marquis of las Cisternas is telling his story about him and Inés to Lorenzo, the part where he escapes Lindenberg's castle with the bloody nun instead of Inés, he starts getting haunted by her every night and is suddenly cured by a traveller who had a cross of fire in her face and apparently had lived for a few centuries. I haven't finished the book yet, but my girlfriend who has read all of it told me this theme does not come back anywhere in the story. I was just wondering if it had any explanation, because it felt very out of nowhere and it didn't really feel like Matthew Lewis' writing, or at least i felt like it didn't really belong.

3heqk8,Recommended Author of the Day: Phil Rickman,"Phil Rickman is British horror and mystery writer who should be much better known in the U.S.  His writing intelligent and suspenseful, dark without being depressing. If you like King, Straub and McCammon then try Phil Rickman.

He has five stand alone novels, though charcters from some will turn up in his other works.

My favorite is December.  A rock group decides to do a recording session in a deserted abbey and the sessions end in death and disaster. Some of the recordings are released in an in an infamous album which some claim has occult power.  Thirteen years later the remaining band members reunite.

Man in the Moss looks at strange happenings that occur after the discovery of a ancient body preserved in a peat bog with fundamentalist Christians and pagans both facing off over the body.

The Curfew is set on the Welsh borders and explores whether local custom is just a relic of the past or has real power against long quiet dark forces.

The Chalice is set in Glastonbury and winds its story through the various Arthurian and supernatural legends that abound in city and Tor and the people drawn there today seeking the answers to mysteries.

Candlenight is my least favorite of his straight horror books and again looks at a local custom with a dark side.

His largest set of work is ongoing mystery series featuring Church of England pastor Merrily Watkins who gets appointed dioscesan exorcist. Between being called in every time something odd or dark is involved and the general opprobrium often launched at the mere idea of an exorcist in modern times, Merrily has a rough time and that is even without dealing with the growing pains of her self-declared pagan daughter.  The Wine of Angels is the first book and the whole series is highly recommended.

Rickman has three books featuring a journalist who sometimes covers the paranormal--Grayle Underhill --Cold Calling, Mean Spirits and the recently released and terrific Night After Night.

He is two books into a YA series under a pen name in the UK but his own in the U.S. Marco-s Pendulum and Marco and the Blade of Night.

He also has a historical series set in Elizabethan times featuring alchemist Dr. Dee.  I have not read these-perhaps someone who has can comment.

Check him out.

b6dito,"Just finished 'The Haunting of Hill House', found it to be a huge waste of time.","As the title says, I was waiting for the book to pick up and then it suddenly ended.

For me it seemed as if it was all over the place with the author jumping from one thing to another without thinking it out, along with it seeming like it has been forced into the writing/ reading style of a similar time when Wuthering Heights was written, but failing at doing so. 

After combing the internet for parts or clues that I may have missed which makes this an 'award winning ghost story' I've turned up nothing. Other than apparently I don't understand psychological horror. Which I wouldn't class this book as, I wouldn't class this book as horror at all to be perfectly honest. 

The characters were admittedly immediately likeable, and then immediately unlikeable as the book went on. Not including Dr. Montague, other than not standing up to his wife and telling her that they've seen/ done enough, he's the only character I could say that I liked towards the end of the book where his part was diminished for the squabbles of Eleanor and Theodora. 

Arthur may aswell not have been there unless.it was a nod to the Doctor's wife being unfaithful, which I can't see as she seems too full of herself to even love the Doctor, despite what he says about her caring for him. I refuse to believe she turns into a harpee only when she investigates the paranormal because she believes she can commune with spirits. 

Bull.
Shit.

They say that Eleanor was turned crazy by the house. But I believe it's from realising that she has nothing and Theodora won't take her, meaning she has nothing to look forward to. Along with knowing that she inadvertently killed her mother, that's probably what broke her. 

I just can't see what makes this book good. I could rant all day about this and how I could have read something else, better, had I known the outcome. 

I haven't been more annoyed since reading Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road', which was hailed as a great dystopian book but read as though it was written by an edgy teen who had never seen a thesaurus and decided to make the book look bigger by bumping up the size of the font to fill the damn pages out. 

Edit: Currently on a huge Horror binge. So if anyone can point me in the direction of any decent books please do. 

Recently also finished Rosemary's baby, but can't stop thinking it's some Feminist agenda. Amityville Horror was pretty damn good. 
The exorcist and legion were also enjoyable. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/b6dito/just_finished_the_haunting_of_hill_house_found_it/,2019-03-28T02:50:26Z,27,0,books,The Exorcist,POST
hbg0z0,Anyone else disappointed with the film version of Elmer Gantry?,"I read Elmer Gantry maybe a decade ago. I like dark little satires and boy howdy, if you want a satirical look at America this is a book for you. That said, if you're religious you might not enjoy it. It's all about this sleazy guy (the eponymous Elmer Gantry) who's too unethical to be a lawyer so he becomes a preacher and cons a ton of people. The book was widely banned when it came out in the 1920s. 

Anyway, I don't want to give away any details, but it's a fun, really satisfying book in the way that longer books can be--lots of little side plots and distractions along the way of telling the larger story--so that by the time I finished it, I felt like I'd gotten off of a roller coaster. 

Monday I discovered you can watch the film for free with Amazon Prime (something called the IMDB channel, which has ads) so, knowing I love Burt Lancaster and Arthur Kennedy and that it was up for a Best Picture and several other Oscars, I figured I'd check it out. 

The film ... is GOOD. It's well acted, shot etc. but it's literally only about 100 pages of plot (I checked) and everything I loved about the book (the weird adventures that Gantry went on scamming people and screwing over everyone) are all gone, likely for time as it's still 146 minutes long. They also changed the ending, which I didn't like. 

But God, I felt so scammed. Sadly, it's a ""great"" enough film (again, it was up for a boatload of awards for a reason) that I don't know if it will get remade, but someone really needs to do this book justice and turn it into a miniseries or something. 

I know it's a cliche to say ""the book is better"" but honestly, if it's a truly great film, I'm usually pretty happy with both. The Exorcist book and movie are great. Psycho, same thing. To Kill a Mockingbird, etc etc. 

I think this is maybe the one time I've ever concluded that the film IS quite good but still bad compared to the book. I left thinking that I wished I'd either only read the book or only watched the movie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/hbg0z0/anyone_else_disappointed_with_the_film_version_of/,2020-06-18T14:49:42Z,2,0,books,The Exorcist,POST
