About the second book, The Housemaid's Secret this is just my opinion but I feel like it's not as great as the first one, the ending's extremely cringe but the twist is kinda cool and surprising.",aboring_person,2024-01-11T16:27:16Z,The Housemaid,COMMENT

v2g0b6,"My pet peeve about the book, or rather, all the other literature it inspired: sunlight mildly inconveniences Dracula. I may have some details wrong, it's been a while, but there are definitely scenes in the book where Dracula walks around and fights in daytime.  He can't shapeshift during daytime, and he needs to rest for various reasons and once he's resting, he can only become active at sunset. 

But that's it! Bursting into flame in sunlight or any other major problem with it was invented by Hollywood, and has somehow become the second biggest part of vampire lore there is, after needing blood. Even works that pretend to be ""getting back to the basics"" of vampires usually include some problem with sun. It's weird, and makes some vampires so weak it's almost hard to take them seriously.",cybishop3,2022-06-01T14:42:50Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Stoker's book would be obscure if it weren't for the movies.  I go to Whitby a lot, where the Dracula tourism industry is huge.  But I got hold of a guidebook from 1926 - no mention of anything related AT ALL.  The whole phenomenon came from Hollywood.

My wife once took over as a cook at a residential school where the previous cook was an Eastern European who'd had to lesve abruptly.  She'd gone bananas and had blown a huge proportion of the catering budget buying ropes of garlic to festoon all the doorways as protection from vampires.

v2g0b6,"I hated it with a passion. It might well have invented the 'found footage' genre of horror where a home video, or a journal, is purported to be found, and make the viewer think they are seeing real events. It's a framing device I can't stand, and in the case of Dracula it results in essentially reading somebody's diary, and it was just so plodding and hard to read in that manner. 

Regarding Vampire lore, the reason so much is included is that it invented much of the lore. There weren't really vampires before Dracula, but vampires are based on much older lore. 

The Romanians called them Strigoi vue and Strigoi mort but you can call them strigoi for short. This is where the vampire legends come from, they didn't call them vampires, they were strigoi. Vlad Tepes also has nothing to do with vampires or Dracula, that is purely a modern story telling twist. If you ever played the Witcher games, you might have heard of the Polish Striga, this is their own version of a strigoi. 

Strigoi vue are basically vampires. They live a very long time and feed off of the life of those around them but not necessarily by blood, it's more of a psychic feeding. They are not undead, can go out in the sun, eat, have families, but they are not human. They have unnatural strength, they don't really age or get old, and they have certain mental powers over people. There are some caveats too, they can't leave their homes or travel. They are kind of stuck living where they were born. This might be where Draculas need to carry his home soil around with him comes from. But Strigoi have reflections, can eat garlic, and they didn't really kill the people they fed off of, they just drained them. 

Then there are the strigoi mort, and this is where it gets interesting. They are dead people that aren't done living. They rise from the grave, and seek earthly pleasures. Eating, smoking, drinking, having sex, they are lusty, hungry, wanton creatures that look like people, but only want to indulge in earthly pleasures. This more than anything is where I think Zombie tropes come from. Especially the hunger part. They aren't rotting or look like corpses, but they did die, usually in a violent fashion, and if they aren't given a proper burial they come back, they often show up on somebody's doorway and will refuse to leave until they are fed and given liquor. Basically you have to frantically feed them or they will do very bad things to you like curse you. Your best bet is to give them the time of their lives so they move on.",kodack10,2022-06-01T17:32:17Z,Dracula,COMMENT

v2g0b6,"I got a story about reading Dracula for the first time. Back in high school, our school's library got a copy. It was sitting on the clerk's table, probably waiting to be ""processed"" (ie be logged into inventory and have that sleeve put in to hold the library card on the back.) I was waiting for it to finally hit the shelf. The problem was, it didn't. It sat on the clerk's table for close to year. At that point, I was a senior, I think it was that time when we basically didn't go to classes anymore so we basically just hung out at the lib in between graduation practice. The clerks were out for lunch, I see the book on the back of their table. I swiped it, put it in my bag, and went home and read it. I still have it to this day and it's one of my favorite possessions. I told my mom this story a couple months ago and she told me to return it.",426763,2022-06-01T18:08:39Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Characters had to study his life and work in order to predict his next moves. That kind of good writing is something that most of zillion movie/TV adaptations desperately lacked.

v2g0b6,"I've noticed a lot of the public-domain monsters (Dorian Grey, Frankenstein, etc.) have far less magic and fantastical elements than you would expect given their pop culture status. 

Dracula was written shortly after Oscar Wilde was put on trial, found guilty for the crime of homosexuality, and given a sentence so grueling he died just two years later - alone, penniless, without a friend. 

His novel, Dorian Gray, was used as evidence during his trial. And the whole incident sparked a massive backlash which reinforced the conservative hegemony. 

(Which made Wilde unpopular with his format friends, who disliked all the new, negative press and scrutiny his book caused them. He died sick, penniless, and without a friend just two years after writing his book.) 

Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker weren't close friends, but they were contemporaries. They ran in the same circles. The Wilde trial was a media firestorm, it absolutely would have been on Stoker's mind. 

a common queer reading of the next is that Stoker was writing to vent his fears about dangerous homoeroticism in the wake of the Wilde trial.

v2g0b6,"Well, there's not much more to my point. For me at least, when I read a classic book I expect to find it has a lot less modern tropes since it has been done to death and adapted over and over, each time adding more things that are now tropes of the original work but that aren't found in it. Another example is the ""classic"" Sherlock Holmes' ""elementary, my dear Watson"" quote, I don't think it's found in any of the books. That doesn't really happens with Dracula, I can't think of any vampire trope that is not in Dracula except maybe for their hate of werewolves.

Vampires in Dracula hate garlic, they can't cross running water easily, they turn into mist or animals (particularly bats and wolves), they are repealed by holy symbols like crosses, sanctified things like sacramental bread, they don't have a reflection, they are hot, they have to go back to their coffin or buried ground each day, they can charm people with their sight, they can only be killed by an oak stake to their heart or the Sun, they become more powerful the older they get and the older ones can overcome some of their vulnerabilities... To me it's amazing that I can only think of one trope that has been added to popular culture's vampire lore since the book was released, and I find it pretty unique among classic books.",Matt_Dragoon,2022-06-01T17:31:01Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Like for many current day Americans, they're romanticized as  free-spirited artists and wanderers, while 19th century English-speaking writers like Bram Stoker or HP Lovecraft (born in 1890) depict them as these unclean servants of evil without any redeeming qualities. And then modern Europeans living in cities with large Romani populations have yet again a different set of stereotypes. 

It's disturbing to think about how Hitler famously loved  Winnetou, and related to the struggles of Native Americans against the colonists, but then well, went all Hitler-y on his own groups he deemed subhuman. It's like whether an ethnic group is seen as ""free-spirited and noble"" or.... an obstacle to ""progress""... is less dependent on who they actually are as real humans, and more to do with the distances involved and often the psychological projections of the in-group's aspirations or fears.

853z3d,"One thing I find amusing about it is how everyone is so enamoured with and fascinated by the fact that Mina can type and how she makes herself ""useful"" to the men by documenting their actions (at the same time being the damsel in distress). They may as well pat her on the head and say ""That's so good for a girl."" The book in general infantilizes women, but that's the Victorians for you.

Beyond that, I find adaptations of Dracula himself interesting for how much they exaggerate his powers and weaknesses - or just outright ignore most of them.",nesagwa,2018-03-17T17:56:53Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"It's fascinating how in the book Dracula is quite clearly a demonic sexual predator, his home an elaborate prison for his prey, and yet most movies or references romanticise him, as if he were a misunderstood or even tragic figure.

853z3d,"It was an ok read.  The very beginning chapter was very juicy and interesting (I don't mind supernatural cliches so much, esp. since this book started a lot of modern ones), and the last 3rd or so was quite entertaining, beginning with the graveyard vigils.  However, abt half of the book was excruciatingly slow-paced and flowery Victorian narrative illustrating the two women's deep friendship and her slow, slow wasting away; definitely could have been pared down, considering the book's ostensibly more gothic themes.  6.5/10

Protip: don't read his short story sequel (I *think* it was written after) to Dracula... It's pretty bland and disappointing.",complimentarianist,2018-03-17T18:16:50Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"I definitely preferred the first half to the second. The beginning was so eerie: you had Jonathan Harker going to a strange foreign country, meeting people who were palpably afraid and disturbed, then finally getting to Dracula's castle after an eldritch experience in the nearby forests. The castle itself is equally horrifying, and we get to experience all of the scares in Harker's intimate epistolary prose. I even enjoyed the section with Lucy Westenra, Jack Seward, and Abraham Van Helsing. I loved Van Helsing as a character and enjoyed Westenra's death and resurrection. The Renfield bits were interesting too and, in retrospect, I wish Stoker had expanded on him a bit more. I was surprised how well the book held up, especially since I think that horror tends to date really badly. The characters were also so great, each one felt like a real person and I was quickly worried about their fates. All of this and then... it just kind of putters out. Oddly enough, even though the stakes (pun intended) were raised more and more as the book came to its conclusion, I became less and less invested. It just couldn't capture the dread I felt at Dracula's castle or the helplessness of watching Westenra turn into the vampire. Overall, I enjoyed it but felt that its quality fluctuated. Also, I read Salem's Lot afterward and was able to pick up on some of the references King makes to Dracula that I might have missed had I not just read the novel.

Everything in the castle sets up a creepy atmosphere and in some parts you can get really tense while reading, specially at night (at least that was my experience).

Pale skin, light sensitivity, madness, and even sharp teeth are all symptoms of people with syphilis (mostly for children born with it).

853z3d,"I loved it.  It took a minute for things to really build up but that's one of the great things about classical writing is it doesn't rush into the climax.  The backstory and dialogue gives the characters time to assess the situation in a more realistic way.  Bram Stokers 'Dracula ' scared the absolute heck out of me. The way the tension builds and just plateaus without immediate resolution is what gives the story its strength

I feel like a lot of modern story writing is driven by its potential to make a movie so the characters are less likely to make mistakes and assumptions while they're following the story line.  Dracula and other older novels don't do that.  They aren't in a rush,  the characters aren't flawless or even particularly bright,  they just are and they're existing in their circumstances with realistic fears and determination. 

I really enjoyed the book when i read it simply because you can fall in line with the characters thinking and behavior.  It was scary,  it was unexpected,  and there weren't moments where the characters judgement of a situation wasn't justified whether it was a correct assessment or not.

It's also excellent allegorically in the way Stoker portray's the effects of a poisonous relationship where the lecherous ability of one (Dracula) can steal life energy away from another (Mina) and the toll it takes on loved ones as they sacrifice their own life energy to try and keep their loved one alive.

I say this as someone who loves 19th century novels. The original Frankenstein is amazing, and I thought Carmilla was better than Dracula.

EDIT: Although one thing that I just remembered (I think I recall correctly?) that I thought was very cool that hasn't really appeared in vampire mythos since is the suggestion that Dracula arose as a mindless monster and only very slowly over a great deal of time did he develop mentally and learn to emulate the noble he appears to be.

853z3d,"Dracula is definitely in my top 5 favourite books.

First of all, I like the format, an epistolary novel is well-suited to this story. You only see and feel what the characters see and feel and it helps us get in the mood of the novel. Discovering Transylvania through Jonathan's eyes really makes me feel I've stepped in a far and strange land, nearly as if I had gone back in time with his (sometimes condescending) descriptions.

Then I like that it's the Ur-example of the vampire story but there are still some surprising elements. As you said, when you first start reading it, you think it's going to be like every other vampire story but then you find elements that most other stories have ignored like the fact that sunlight don't harm him, just prevent him from transforming and the whole native soil thing.

I also like the fact that the old gothic castle that we see in every gothic novel is not the whole setting of the novel. It appears at the beginning and at the end but the rest of the story is set in Modern England (well, modern when the book was written). You go to Whitby and London, you're not stuck in Transylvania.

And speaking of modern, I like the modernity of the novel: science and modern transportation are heavily used and Mina's definitely a modern woman. Alright, scientific discoveries have made some of the science used in the book outdated (blood transfert without knowing the blood type for instance) but you can still feel Stoker used the latest scientific disccoveries for his novel.

And no, as you said, it's not scary, just unsettling, and to me that's a good point. Some of the more unsettling scenes are just beautifully written with a wonderful atmosphere, like Dracula's arrival in Whitby.",,2018-03-17T19:35:29Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"Reading the bit where Dracula's vampires kept draining Harker have me an odd cliched, chill down my spine sensation. I get that phrase now. The book is really good and damn, the movie went off the rails in a couple places.",,2018-03-17T19:55:37Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"As a horror book, it's not very scary. Drac himself has been done to death and so a lot of what he is/does comes across a trite or corny. That's not the book's problem: that's just the result of a century or so of media doing Drac from every angle. 

There's also an aspect of personal taste too: I grew up reading when Anne Rice was the queen of vampires, so I find the ""pure monster"" style vampire to be a bit lame. I like the ""vampire as a tragic reflection of humanity"" style of vampire. But that's just personal taste. Dracula is one of the few books where I think the film (specifically the Coppola adaptation) is better than the book from a pure entertainment standpoint.

From a literary perspective, though, the book is a fascinating window into Victorian culture and mores and has a lot to say on the questions of democracy vs aristocracy, science vs superstition, a women's role in the world and to society, the rise of technology, etc. ",marisachan,2018-03-17T19:58:33Z,Dracula,COMMENT

853z3d,"I loved it! I'm a scaredy-cat so I didn't know if I'd be able to read it but it wasn't gross horror. While it had me on the edge of my seat, I never got freaked out enough I wanted to put it down. 

I was also surprised how I didn't know how it would go. I always loved modern vampire fiction (pre-Twilight), so I thought I'd know all the vampiric powers/ect. since Dracula was a big basis for a lot of the modern stuff. But I didn't! I guess Dracula is so old that modern vampire writers have deviated from him enough that the ""stereotypical"" vampire I picture isn't entirely accurate to the book dracula. A very pleasant surprise.

Similarly, I liked Frankenstein for the same reasons. It was a little more dense (though I did listen to it as an audio book, so perhaps that affected my enjoyment), but still really good. We all know modern references to the monster, but the source material is different enough it feels fresh.",LadySilvie,2018-03-17T20:05:50Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"It’s one of those things I picked up because I like gothic romanticism and think vampires are cool and all that, but fully expected to be a bit of a brick. 

Nope! I was surprised by how much of a “human story” it turned out to be. Sure, the atmosphere was chilling and the count himself is rad, but there was something so positive and touching in the depiction of the relationships between the band of heroes that I came away from the book feeling warmed. Not just in the way that Mina cares for Lucy and the men for both of them, but in the way the men are concerned for each other as well, though they were initially brought together because they were interested in the same woman. 

The parts of the book that stuck with me the most were the passages where one of the characters would offer his own blood for transfusion because another one was already weak, and the way they’d stand guard outside Mina’s room. It’s weird to describe Dracula as heartwarming but I genuinely feel that about it.

I remember being really thrown by the epistolary style of the novel.  It was the first I encountered, and I am glad to have been given that chance. Dracula, the story, the novel, and the character, are nothing like we imagine - much like Frankenstein.

I figured it could be good, but I was also a little worried that it might be boring - like maybe all the stuff we associate with Dracula came later. But nope! The book really did start it all. I liked how almost ""modern"" it was set up, with the letters and newspaper clippings. I definitely found it creepy and suspenseful. I never did read Frankenstein but maybe I will now.

It focuses more on the Transylvanian part of the story and less on the other locations.  It is darker overall, and more sexual in nature.  He also added some Norse elements to the mythology.

It's definitely very different in format from contemporary books, and despite it having inspired so many other things, very little has come close to replicating it in any but the broadest brush strokes.

What sticks out to me are the Victorian values expressed by the characters, and how Dracula's description greatly varies how he's portrayed in virtually every, single medium outside the book. Imagine if, in 1992, Gary Oldman had played a mustachoied, rat-faced Drac the whole movie? Or if Bela Lugosi had his pointy teeth on his front incisors and silver hair? It's such a huge difference from what we usually expect with Dracula.",,2018-03-18T02:23:13Z,Dracula,COMMENT
853z3d,"Read it during high school, but it was my choice. My mom got me a collection of Dracula, Frankenstein, and Dr. Jekyll in one. I read big chunks of the first two on my breaks at my first job. (A funny thing is I have the smell of barbeque kettle chips associated with those books because I would eat those during my breaks too.) 

Dracula surprised me, like it seemed to surprise a lot of people. I liked the letters format because my previous exposure to a story written in that style was a dumb, conservative Christian series called Mail Order Brides. I don't recommend them. 

Dracula himself surprised me. Imagining him in the way Stoker describes him was difficult, because I was so used to the Hollywood widow's peak and clean shaven face. A Drac with facial hair??? It jarred me a bit, and I had to read over his description a few times. I had also not watched Billy and Mandy before reading this, which does depict Drac in the way Stoker describes, and I really appreciate that now.

Previous comments have mentioned the comedy of errors type events that lead yo the death of the women and, hoo boy, are they ever right. It's definitely one of the biggest flaws in the book. The dead ship confused me at first, had to reread that part a few times too. Van Helsing just annoyed me tbh.

853z3d,"I had this concept of Dracula before I wanted to read the book many years ago. It started off with no mention of him and with this random dude and his diary entries. I was incredibly ignorant and put the book down before even giving it a proper chance. 

I don't know what I expected the book to be. Maybe starting off with Dracula going on a blood sucking rampage? I don't know, I was left pretty dissapointed not only at that time but now too. If I had given it a chance then, I would've discovered reading earlier. But I did discover it later on.

I downloded a free copy off the iBooks store for my iPad and actually decided to give it a shot. This was before I voluntarily read any books, but I had given a couple of gamebooks a shot and enjoyed them quite a bit. I stuck with it and found a really enjoyable experience. The first section where Harker goes to Drac's mansion was really gripping. After that the book sorta went down a route I didn't really enjoy because they felt like a slog, but there were still a lot of sections I incredibly enjoyed. My only real issue with the book is that some of the character dialogues can go on and on without any purpose. Aside from that it was a very enjoyable experience and it was the first book I picked up and read without being forced to for some school assignment.

I do admit that the element of horror in it is truly spectacular. Some of the scenes really stayed with me. The terror I felt when reading them was spine-chilling. I understand why it’s such an iconic book. But, for me, the characters and the slow-paced drag, which were the last half of the book, was too much. ",am-an-am,2018-03-17T21:08:05Z,Dracula,COMMENT

853z3d,"I liked the book. Its amazing that Stoker came up with some of the best scenes in horror history back in the late 1800s. His plots and horrific scenes must have kept his readers spellbound.

There was also a lot of sexual tension regarding the fact that women became seduced and spellbound by Dracula. At a time when there was no sexual literature, the readers of Dracula were probably getting a taste of sexuality they hadn't ever witnessed or read about. 

The only thing about the book that I didn't like is how it went on and on about certain things. Wasn't 25% of the book about Lucy being sick? Stoker would have done better to move the plot along a bit faster, but all in all, the book is a great read.

  Opening with Jonanthan in the castle hooked me hard, loved it! Most of middle was veryyy slow. Van Helsey could say in one half page paragraph what modern day people would convey in a phrase. The dead ship was great! Then back to slowness, then the very end it picked up again and was done.

It never really dawned on me the first time I read it, but there's some pretty strong anti-Semitism going on in the book. It's not too hard to paint Dracula as a metaphor for an invasive, parasitic enemy from the east with mystical and dark connotations.

s9i924,"I think a lot of people inappropriately pair it with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and base both of them off their memory of reading Frankenstein (I know I used to before reading Dracula a few years back).

Frankenstein was a meh read for me in high school because Shelley's emphasis on the Romanticism of the time (not romantic like love, but romantic like ""Oh shit these mountains are beautiful""), didn't resonate too well with me.

People may also write it off for being Victorian Era literature which sometimes oozes along with too many words (Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, etc), but I found Bram Stoker's writing captivating and exciting especially coming from that era!

Going to have to disagree here. I find the treatment of women to be just barely passable (honestly, I find them to be incredibly one-dimensional and stereotypical, but I think that applies to every other character in the novel too, save Dracula himself, so I'm chalking this up to writing style rather than sexism). I certainly don't think the female characters are anything exceptionable, even given the time period.

*Dracula* was published in 1897—not 1397. Plenty of Stoker's predecessors and contemporaries were writing well-rounded, intelligent, and active female characters, to say nothing of the many successful, respected female authors publishing their own novels in and before his time.

Anyway, the book expands on Harker's time in the castle and that makes up about 2/3 of Powers of Darkness. Having read both I preferred Powers of Darkness for the time that Harker was at the castle, but the second half of Dracula is way better in my opinion.

Dated as in most older books tend to have a lot more irrelevant fat on them?

Compared to most ""classics"" I think Dracula is one of the leaner narratives to follow. Whenever I hear the word ""classic"" I just imagine a slog from my time trying to read books like Moby Dick, Don Qixote, etc. Always forcing myself. 

But in this, although there were sections towards the final act of the book that I felt the slog.. for the most part.. it wasn't a forcing at all. Which was super happy about.",halkenburgoito,2024-01-29T07:25:21Z,Dracula,COMMENT

1ad25fw,"Having read Dracula made me despise that movie. I know it's an adaptation (an extremely loose adaptation), but the changes they made killed some of my favorite aspects of the books.

The worst part to me is what they did to Mina. In the book Mina is critical to their success in a very unique way (her organizational skills) and is extremely dedicated to the cause. She does everything right, which makes it scarier that this evil is able to corrupt her to the point where God has essentially forsaken her. That's scary! Then at the end her sense of empathy and the situation she's in due to being bitten makes it clear that Dracula and his wives are trapped in their own Hellish existence which heightens the fear. Dracula was cursed to live this evil existence, and the same could happen to anyone.

In the movie she's a non-entity, she exists solely to be longed for by Dracula. She doesn't help the group at all because she actively does not want to be helped. Her role is to go ""No! No! Oh yes!"" when Dracula is around. They even made it that Jonathan figured out the routes to intercept Dracula. That was Mina's thing! She couldn't have one thing?",No_Establishment1649,2024-01-28T15:55:10Z,Dracula,COMMENT
1ad25fw,"Eh, closer than the hammer films maybe - but I can’t agree it was very close at all otherwise. The tone was so so off and it was too bombastic to be scary at all. The atmosphere was non existent at the castle. Oldman lacked gravitas as Dracula for me as well. 

The only adaption I could really say was similar in tone and story (somewhat) was the British TV movie Count Dracula (1977), though it’s not a definitive version by any means. For one thing they lacked the budget to do some of the stunts necessary to bring the more frightening parts of the movie to life (the carriage ride to the castle, Dracula climbing on the wall etc)",LongDongSamspon,2024-01-28T15:54:44Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Some people complain that the ending wasn't exciting enough but when you think about it, there really was no other way since Dracula was essentially invincible when active at night. The tension and race against time till sunset was exciting enough for me. The epilogue (7 years later) was really sweet and it was nice to see how strong the group's friendship remained.

As for the plot hole you mentioned, it's really not so much a plot hole as Dracula underestimating Harker. Dracula left Harker alive so that the three vampire women could feast on him. He didn't expect Harker to be clever enough to find an escape.",milly_toons,2023-10-20T03:03:22Z,Dracula,COMMENT

In Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" the scenes when Dracula meets Harker are fantastic, Dracula is so evil he feeds a baby to his minions and laughs. We're supposed to accept that scene from that to him and then feel sorry for him as the tragic, misunderstood and romantic antihero. And the stupid backstory in the film- I love how the novel has no origin story, Dracula is just *there,* an ancient and evil presence in his castle*.*  In the film, in the backstory Coppola invents, Dracula only became a vampire after he lost his greatest love and blamed God for some reason.

17c0z5a,"I just finished this book as well and while I did enjoy it and can appreciate the impact it had on future works I think it is definitely frustrating to read at some points. 

I actually found a lot of elements funny whether intentional or not. Most the male ensemble just kinda bumble around. Even Vanhelsing comes across as goofy. Mina Harker is clearly the character most on top of things and I liked how societal and her own views of gender roles come up. 

The news article and ships log concerning the Demeter were my favorite part. 

The ending left me truly frustrated. Vanhelsing and Mina facing off against the 3 vampire women was good as was Vanhelsing going into the castle. All the while Mina gets closer and closer to turning. But ultimately this tension built up to nothing. 

The ending with the death of Dracula was frustrating, Quincy and Jonathan charge into a group of hired gypsies and Quincy gets stabbed. A lot of good those winchesters were when you don't use them and get yourself stabbed meanwhile Quincy previously shot at a bat and was also supposed to be all about the battle plans.

Wow! 

It felt so modern, and the short entries made it a true page turner that just kept turning the screw and bringing a real sense of dread to the story. The fate of Lucy was genuinely shocking and then there are the diary entries from the Demeter.

> There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see! I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.",iceman012,2023-10-20T15:22:26Z,Dracula,COMMENT

I love that. The fact that the book is written as a sequence of letters becomes part of the plot when the characters exchange the letters, then the genre switches from ""horror movie"" to ""revenge film."" Someone's gotta get Liam Neeson to play Van Helsing, I say.

The opinions there were a little more critical, but it made for a fun discussion.

If you're curious about some of the inspirations for Dracula, I highly recommend reading Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. Stoker borrowed so much from the novella. It also has a great web series adaptation (and a sequel movie)",steampunkunicorn01,2023-10-21T23:36:29Z,Dracula,COMMENT

If you're looking for more vampire books, Fledgling by Octavia Butler is fantastic. Just be aware she had plans of writing a series but tragically died before she could write more. On a similar thread, Hacienda by Isabel Cañas was genuinely scary (had to stop reading it at night) though it doesn't feature vampires.

17c0z5a,"The alternative would have been that Dracula would somehow learn that the hunting party was approaching, and understanding that he wouldn't have any place to hide for the day, decides to attack before sunrise, hoping he can still get back to the box in time.

Then we would have had the hunting party stalling for time as Dracula tries to kill as many as he can in few minutes (perhaps there would have been few redshirts along from a local village, so we can have more deaths). Just as the core group is about the get it, Dracula runs away to get to safety in time (iirc, it wasn't just the sunlight, it was the turning into a corpse even in total darkness). As he's now in Transylvania, he doesn't even need the box full of homesoil, but can go ANYWHERE. The hunters don't realise this at first, losing time by advancing to the castle and finding the box -- empty.

Then they'd have to backtrack to where they saw Dracula, and try to guess from the cues where he might have hidden.

That way we can raise the stakes, if you pardon the pun. 

Finally they find the corpse in some nearby cave, which also has some old skeletons and trashed ottoman armour -- this is a place where Dracula dumped his enemies while he was alive. At the back of the cave, surrounded by the skeletons of his old victims, they find Dracula himself. He's not at peace, but looks fearful, even as he's but a corpse.

The last rays of sunlight are falling at the front of the cave, as they stake Dracula, who gets animated for one last final breath before turning into dust, trying to remove the stake from his chest. Perhaps the sun just fell -- which is a bit of a copout -- or perhaps the curse that animated him had one last trick in its sleeve?

I think Dracula and Frankenstein are great companion reads, especially if you imagine their contemporary worlds. Very different, but some similar topics.

Frankenstein, to me, is about the danger of new tech in an unreformed world. The ego and loneliness of Dr. Frankenstein taint his works.

Dracula is an old evil, made more dangerous by growing globalism and labyrinths of bureaucracy.

Each fault ivory tower science for ignoring ancient works and folk wisdom.

I've read a few epistolary works, but this was unique in how many characters it featured. I felt it creates some narrative distance, and I was ready for any or all of the characters to die, since someone else could finish the tale.

It was an incredible read (somewhat enhanced in spookiness by my simultaneous listening to the Phantom of the Opera musical--London Cast Recording). I re-read the book in high school for a book report, which was fun but not too analytical. Then this year I took a German class about vampire literature and film (1700s to the remake of Nosferatu) at my university, and found even greater richness in reading it once more. There are some excellent motifs of duality and existential confusion; Dracula is a well-layered book.

If you're interested in more ""classic"" vampires, I would suggest Carmilla by Le Fanu (It's an older vampire story where the vampire is a female, but it is the first story to introduce lesbian vampires--so a female, rather than a male, human is on the other side of the vampire-human relationship.

jis1cx,"Which musical?

Probably about 10 years ago now, I bought the movie musical 'Phantom of the Opera' from amazon. So then later Amazon recommended a 'Dracula' musical to me. I was shocked, I didn't even know there was a 'Dracula' musical. So of course I ordered it (DVD).

This musical was produced in Canada and was in French. (I don't speak French.) It wasn't quite what I expected but, after watching it several times, I decided I really liked it so I went to Amazon to order a CD of the music.

I looked up 'Dracula musical CD' and, much to my surprise, Amazon showed me a CD of a different musical, a German one. Not one, but two 'Dracula' musicals! So I ordered the German CD (I speak some German.)

This CD ended up changing my life. I immediately fell in love with the lead singers voice, which led me into investigating other musicals, which ultimately led me to 'Tanz der Vampyre' (Dance of the Vampire), my favorite musical of all time. I've made friends in The Netherlands, Germany, and Austria and I meet up with them every couple of years and we go see musicals. I've been to Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, Magdeburg, and Stuttgart and have met up with extended family that I hadn't seen in 40 years. I plan on going back as soon as possible.

This is obviously way more than you need to know but the words 'Dracula musical' have a fond place in my heart.

I understand that there are at least two other Dracula musicals. I have one around here somewhere (didn't like it much) and the second that Frank Langela starred in.

Then I hope his soul burns for eternity in hell!” And Mina responds by telling him to not say such things since she may one day need that same compassion from someone else due to her situation. Also, it’s small but after Dracula is slain Mina sees a look of beauty and relief on his face just like all the other slain vampires, before he quickly turns to dust!

The strange women in the castle with Jonathan, for instance. I've always assumed that they were other vampires, but they don't seem as deteriorated as Dracula.

The story with shipping containers of grave earth over is excellent, and it really shows what kind of evil forethought goes into this ""invasion of Britain"" plan of Dracula's.

Renfield's obsession with consuming life is very interesting. Not a vampire himself, it's almost like he's trying to emulate one the best way he can.

And Mina's being attacked by a monstrous beast repeatedly, and being fed Dracula's blood. It's clear that he is no ordinary vampire, and it's interesting to see how far his powers go.

Overall, it's great - there is a good reason that it's a classic.

It is certainly several steps above the other novels of his that I have read - *Jewel of the Seven Stars*, *Lair of the White Worm*, *Lady of the Shroud* etc, some of which have been adapted for film with interesting results, but have not aged well as text. However, I've not read his earlier works.

There is a short story by him - originally intended as the opening chapter of *Dracula* - which is worth a look though. It is *Dracula's Guest*. The other shorts in the eponymous collection are generally worth reading too.",GreyShuck,2016-06-11T12:01:35Z,Dracula,COMMENT

I forget who it was, but a certain comedian does a great routine about how *Dracula* is a great example of the British class-system at work. Harker sees all kinds of incredibly fucked up things at the castle, but the thing that finally convinces him something unnatural is going on is that *the count has no servants!*",,2016-06-11T17:00:44Z,Dracula,COMMENT
4nl229,"There is a school of thought that one of the consistent threads through Dracula is a condemnation of the character and virility of the upper-class Victorian Englishman.  FFC's Dracula certainly takes that ball and runs with it.

The most effective men in the story are Abraham van Helsing (Dutch), Quincy Morris (American, specifically Texan) and Dracula himself (Slavic).

Jonathan Harker is such a complete wet noodle that he's writing about paprika chicken recipes while Transylvanian peasant women are sobbing and begging him not to go to the castle.  Then you get into threads of infidelity while pretending to be virtuous, etc.  Dr. Seward runs a 19th century insane asylum - the very definition of a quack.  And Arthur Holmward... exists?  Is a name on the page?

It's an interesting thought exercise, since it's so easy to forget that Bram Stoker was Irish, not English.",AugustK2014,2016-06-11T13:46:59Z,Dracula,COMMENT
4nl229,"Just finished reading it the other day.  The Christian horror is very different than the suspense and murderfests of our day.  The fear of Dracula was beyond becoming a vampire or death.  It was eternal separation from God that they were afraid of.  You read it in Van Helsing's speeches about Lucy.  You see a greater fear for her soul than her body.  Later, Dracula moves to Mina.  He is able to seduce her and feast upon her while her husband sleeps next to her.  He bypasses her free will and threatens eternal damnation.  It is the mark given to her by the wafer that marks her realization of what is happening against her will.  The mark is akin to the Biblical sign for being unclean and being unable to partake of the sacrament.  

What I really appreciate about the book is the New Woman and the avoidance of the cliche.  Mina is an active player in the book.  It is not the traditional female helpless woman that perhaps never existed in anywhere but prejudiced dreams, but rather one based on Biblical women such as Deborah.

The mixture of Reason, Christianity, Paganism, the Old World and the unexplainable make for such an interesting mix.  Nowadays the debate between reason and mystery has Agnostics (or Atheists) pitted against Christians.  In the past, Christians were the scientists.  What is consistent both then and now is the need for man to provide reason for the great mysteries in life along with life's way of showing that there are an endless supply of things that mettle with reason.",Elyikiam,2016-06-11T14:19:11Z,Dracula,COMMENT
4nl229,"I liked the first ""Act"" of the book a lot. The way the letter format keeps us kind of ""in the dark""; the pace of Johnathan's discoveries and growing dread;  the indirect and organic way we hear the peasants' folk wisdom; the imagery and atmosphere of the castle, surrounded by mountains and the brooding forest...

I enjoyed the second part as well (especially the sequence involving the shipwreck), up until just before Lucy's death. Around that time several things took me out of it, such as: 

  -The incredibly poor communication between the heroes, particularly by Van Helsing, even after they had a bunch of dialogue about the importance of sharing information. More generally, their gross negligence in protecting Lucy.
        
 -The book's parody-of-itself portrayal of gender relations. Maybe it's just a reflection of the era, but it was laughable how much time they spent talking about the weakness of the women and their need for rest and protection. Perhaps Stoker was trying to draw attention to the problem, as it caused at least one ""oh no!"" moment in the plot, but it just felt dumb.
        
   -The vibe of the whole thing once they ""kill"" vampire Lucy and begin hunting Dracula. The pacing and style devolved to the point of pulp, I felt no suspense, and the characters' combination of melodramatic solemnity and ridiculous ineptitude made the whole thing almost laughable.

Edit: TL;DR -- I was disappointed. I don't think it should be considered a classic. Stoker had some good ideas: the letter/diary format, the similar claustrophobias of the characters (in space, in suspicion) and the reader (in information, in dramatic irony); but ultimately he failed to execute them in a way that deserves the title of ""classic"".

4nl229,"I liked John's part of the book best. It kept me turning pages with mounting horror and despair, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I thought the second half of the book, particularly the end, was fairly boring though.

I have no idea what ""books were like"" at the time so I don't know if this would have flown at all, but I would have liked it to be somewhat darker. Dracula talks big about being able to predict their every move and blah blah blah, and at first it seems like he can back that claim up, but in the end his escape seems kind of desperate, the act of somebody with truly no aces up his sleeve, and that disappointed me. The whole time they were tracking his boat, and later his carriage, I kept thinking ""Okay, NOW he's gonna spring the trap on them!"" but it never materialized.

I also thought it was kind of lame that nobody among the vampire hunters really had any flaws. They acted like perfect knights from an Arthurian myth (except even those guys had the occasional flaw). It read less like a real account of what happened and more like someone's idealized revision of events, which given the nature of the writing I suppose is possible.

But man, if I had taken a drink every time someone was overcome with the chivalry or selfless acts of someone else in the group and moved to tears, I'd have been dead before they even finished tracking down dirt containers.

4nl229,"I read it about a year ago and really enjoyed it.  It was really interesting to read the book and see where all the other vampire fiction got ideas about vampires.  For example in Buffy (before Willow comes out as gay), there's an episode where Willow becomes a vampire and is attracted to/seeking women and then later when she goes back to being human she says something along the lines of ""Wow, vampire me is a little gay"" to which one of the other characters says ""Actually being a vampire makes you more yourself.""  This reminded me of Lucy when she is a vampire about she is more suggestive/sexual, basically letting all her inhibitions/society expectations go and is being her ""true"" self. 

I'm also still trying to make sense of the weird 3-wayish scene where the men walk in on Dracula in bed with a passed out Harker and with Mina drinking blood from his chest.  I read Dracula as part of a college english course focusing on monster lore.  My professor was a big fan of the theory that the baby Mina has at the end of the novel could be Dracula's from this hinted at sexual encounter.

4nl229,"Dracula is a great book to illustrate the role of culture in literature. The way the story is framed highlights the relative modernity of Victorian society. Great attention is payed to the use of shorthand and typewriters as well as trains and other transportation which were very modern at the time. This technology seems quaint to us now, but when Dracula was written, the would have served to reinforce the disparity between the heroic, modern Anglo protagonists and the superstitious, and antiquated Eastern European villain. Horror stories are great at telling us what the story's contemporaries feared. In the case of Dracula, the conflict is very much modernity and science vs. antiquity and superstition. This central conflict points towards a fear that embracing technology will cause us to forget important traditions and weaken the moral resolve of our culture. The moral decay component is especially strong in Dracula considering the beastial and sexual nature of the villian's attacks on Lucy and Mina.",knuckles523,2016-06-11T18:45:56Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Also, if you're into campy movie adaptations, watch the Bram Stoker's Dracula version. It's a totally intentional B-movie adaptation but it's so well cast!

I'm actually happy to see someone else see the value in the book, it's not really talked about anymore after all. Id have to agree with you on the epistolary narration being something I really enjoyed when reading, as it gave us a sense of helplessness as though reading the journals/letters/etc but being helpless and unable to help. It added an element of realism in my mind at the very least.

Might as well mention my thoughts on the sexual side of things just since I wrote the paper on it and all; well essentially Stoker broke a silence, showing the grim and sexually corrupt side of Victorian England, when virtually no authors in Europe during the 1800's would even mention it. Of course we can also see Stokers opinions of how women were regarded; specifically by religion. Mina and Lucy may have been the only real female characters in the book, but they were by far the focus along side the perverse Count Dracula himself. Without going in to too much detail, the women were seen as sexually vulnerable and easily 'corrupted' by their temptation for lust. Lucy was spoken down of to an extreme in the writing, whereas Mina kept true to her beliefs and represented the angel archetype against Lucy's devilish counterpart. 

Doing all the research and writing for this side of the story made it even more of a fearsome book to behold.

I understand the need to read it within the context of the time, so the casual sexism, calling children 'it' etc doesn't bother me. (Animal Farm, for example, feels simple and unsubtle today but is interesting reading within the context of when it was written.) I thought the characters all lacked depth and motive or development.

What really bothered me was the core message of the book. At no point in the early part of the book does Dracula do anything wrong, he's hated for just 'being a monster'. The whole book felt to me like an archaic christian parable, with its moral absolutes and the story with Lucy a metaphor for sex outside of marriage.

I even went so far at the time as reading the attempts to give her a blood transfusion to 'fix' the 'fall from purity' as paralleled by the abhorrent belief that raping lesbians would make them straight. (That was in the news a lot at the time, so maybe that influenced me).

Anyway, I thought the whole book was really one-dimensional and lacked any redeeming qualities.

The journal entries showing different characters perspectives of a creepy situation where nobody fully knows what's going on creates an atmosphere and a feeling that's not quite like anything else I've ever read.

The closest I've come to finding it elsewhere is reading Peter Straub. Ghost Story creates a similar effect in a different, but not entirely dissimilar manner. He gives us 5 alternating points of view of a creepy situation where they all start dreaming of their deaths.

4nl229,"It was one of my favorite books I ever read. Stoker did a great job making Dracula creepy right from the start. Dracula was so mysterious and creepy. Plus, the way his actions are described through other people only adds to the creepy atmosphere. It's a shame a lot of the powers his vampire's possessed are lost in many modern interpretations. Stoker's vampires seemed unreal and otherworldly, even though Johnathan would see it with his own eyes.

The ambiguity of Dracula's death solidifies his mystique. Dracula is 'killed' but turns into smoke, which stoker's vampires can do anyway. So is he truly dead? 


Personally, I lost a little interest when the story shifted away from Johnathan and the Castle. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the story all comes together wonderfully.

4nl229,"I've been (trying) to read a book a week this year, and Dracula was book 12! I've also been writing reviews, so here's what I thought of it at the time when I had just finished it:

WEEK 12: Dracula, by Bram Stoker.

Jonathan Harker is a solicitor tasked with going to Transylvania to assist one Count Dracula in buying a house in England. Once he arrives at Castle Dracula, he finds pretty promptly that not only is Dracula a weird dude, but he cannot leave, and is trapped in the castle. Once he sees some supernatural goings on, he surmises that he ain’t gonna be let out of this place alive, so he manages to escape, but goes mad in the process.

Back across the pond in jolly old England, Dr. Seward, a sanitarium manager, starts noticing some strange goings on with his new neighbor. Jonathan’s missus, Mina, her friend, Lucy, and her fiancé Arthur all get involved, and Seward has to call in his old teacher, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to save the day. What follows is a story of intrigue, love, loss, and bravery.

This is a cool book. It is written in an epistolary format, which is a word I had to look up to make sure I got it right; basically, it’s written as a series of diary entries and letters, with some newspaper stories thrown in. Therefore, it reads like a detective story with some great dramatic irony - you have more information than the characters, and hence feel a lot more tension. There’s a great bit about ¾ of the way through where all of the perspective characters have met up, and decide to pool their knowledge - recorded in their various journals and letters - so they can all read each other’s stories, and hence have the better chance of hunting the vampire. I like to think Bram Stoker did this so he wouldn’t have to keep track of who knew what so far into the book.

It’s a little weird reading the foundation of such an iconic monster and character. All the vampire tropes are there - can’t be out in daylight, hates garlic and Christian iconography, can turn into a bat, sucks blood and places people under thrall so they have to do his bidding -  but it’s interesting to see how they are dealt with in their original context. One that doesn’t really come up that much is that Dracula his command over wolves, and can turn into one. There’s also a weird telepathic link thing where one of his victims is forced to drink from his blood, and hence becomes more linked to him as a thrall under his command. It’s definitely cool though - Stoker does a good job of having a set list of rules that the monster must follow (which Van Helsing basically spells out early in the book) and then sets up some detective work and crimes based on these rules, and gets the characters to figure it out.

The main theme that I could see in this book is madness; when one is faced with the horror of an undead foe, can one help but go mad in the process? Especially when it is impossible to ask for help from the authorities, as no-one will believe your story? How then, can one judge the conventionally mad, when they may be no different to an objective viewer? This is supported quite well in the prose - after the introduction of the book, Jonathan Harker is not heard of for several chapters, as he went mental after escaping. It takes him a few months to return to his former self, and only when Van Helsing confirms what happened to him - his own self doubt mirroring the fears they all have that nobody will believe their tale. Dr. Seward’s patient Renfield is another interesting case; already a patient at a mental institution, when Dracula starts messing with him and placing him under thrall, nobody will trust him and believe him as he is conventionally mad. The burden of an unbelievable truth is an old trope (back to Cassandra in Greek myth), but it works really well, and keeps a 450 page book interesting.

I would recommend this book. It’s gripping, a well told thriller with good characters and a great villain. There’s a lot of good prose in there, and his use of different voices for different characters is entertaining (the Dutch Van Helsing’s slightly broken English being the most used example). While a little long winded at times after a very strong opening 65ish pages (some page-long paragraphs are a pain in the arse to read), it mostly stays focused, and pays off in the end.

BOOGIE ON DOWN, IT’S QUOTES TIME BABY.

4nl229,"Dracula is one of my all-time favorite books and I've probably read it about ten times. That said, I agree completely that the ending is lacking. There are some nice scenes towards the end (the confrontation in the house Dracula has rented, particularly) but the actual climax itself is drawn out for too long and then the final showdown ends far too swiftly. More than once I have actually stopped reading the book before the end because all the best parts are long past and after all, I've read it before. I imagine Stoker probably just didn't know how to end it, so he did his best. Having read some of his other stuff, he strikes me very much as one of those mediocre authors who accidentally wrote a masterpiece.",,2016-06-11T16:26:41Z,Dracula,COMMENT

I just thought that was an interesting view on such a culturally influential novel.  Most everyone walks away with a bunch of sexualism and bestial metaphors, and the different viewpoint on the book was (to me) refreshing.",Sage-Khensu,2016-06-11T16:54:43Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Maybe I was a bit spoiled as I read Frankenstein first, and that is just a mind blowingly excellent read, and I was expecting Dracula to be similar. I actually read Dracula as I was travelling by train across Eastern Europe a few years ago, (including a stop in Transylvania) and I should have chucked it out the window on one of the many times I wanted to.

Took me about 6 months to get through it all, as I would reread the entire chapter I stopped on (or at least get to the beginning of the letter/account).

Jonathan was slightly milquetoast to me, by with the era in mind, rollicking action heroes weren't as much of a thing in those times. Mina was a nice change of pace, and I fell completely head over heels for Lucy Westenra.

I thought the last act was pretty great. Finally, the action!!! The buildup made the payoff much better than anything I had read up to this point. Or maybe that was Quincy.

It's been a long time, over 20 years in fact, but I'll always remember it fondly. Fighting sleep for days because of what might be climbing the house, having to keep the windows closed in Georgia in summer, and little 9 year old me feeling like Lucy would have been my main squeeze.

I actually enjoyed the third half the most because it was like a grand adventure, the main cast hunting Dracula around the world, some for vengence, some to save one that they loved, and some just because they saw it as a morally righteous thing to do. I loved Van Helsing, at first I didn't due to his rough grasp of the English language making it difficult to understand him, but later I saw the pattern in his speech and it was almost poetic. His character as this mysterious genius who loves every other character like family, despite just meeting them, was so endearing. Not to mention that he drives the hunt for Dracula and refuses to rest till the villainous devil has been destroyed just cemented him as my favorite character in the book. Immediately after finishing Dracula I bought Kim Newman's book ""Anno Dracula"" because I wanted to read more set in this universe. I recommend ""Anno Dracula"" if you want the same.

Coincidences everywhere.

1. Dracula's ship just happens to come to port where Mina is having a vacation, Mina being the fiance of the man who helped arrange Dracula's trip.

2. Mina's friend becomes Dracula's victim in a town full of potentials. (This might be excused a little since it's clear that Mina and Lucy spent a lot of time at Dracula's hiding place while they were talking at the funeral, so maybe Dravula followed them? But Dracula should have been sleeping in any case.)

3. Dracula just happens to buy, long in advance, the abbey next to the asylum that is run by Lucy's suitor. It makes sense in one way since Dracula and Renfield seemed to have had a bond from long before, so Dracula wanted to be  near his servant. But it's a heck of a coincidence that the doctor is not only in love with Lucy, but even knows her at all.

4nl229,"""Dracula"" is a great example of how social and political trends at work during the late 19th century, specifically feminism, were expressed through literature and fiction. 

The feminist movement (women's liberation) was in full-swing in England by the late 19th century. As with all social movements, there were detractors who railed against change, and Bram Stoker sat firmly in the old-school conservative camp where women stayed in the home, stayed quite, and took care of their husbands and children. This novel was an expression of Stoker's conservative anti-feminist views, and a dire warning to the ""dangers"" of female liberation. 

Case in point; the two female leads are Mina and Lucy. Mina is traditional, conservative, and pure. She is pursued by the corrupt and carnal Count Dracula but ultimately prevails due to her virtuous conservative nature. Lucy however is a ""modern woman"" who is sexually liberated, shuns tradition by making choices for herself, and her liberated ""lustful"" nature leads to her conversion into a vampire. As a vampire Lucy becomes the antithesis of a proper woman. According to traditional values, a woman's purpose is to be a wife and a mother.  Lucy's brazen sexuality allows her to be corrupted by Dracula and turned into a vampire. As a vampire Lucy becomes the anti-mother who feeds on the bodies of children instead of feeding children with her body. 

Stoker was equating women's liberation with an absolute inversion of what it is to be a woman. That a liberated woman is dangerous, destructive, and incapable of supporting a traditional family unit. It's a direct corollary that Stoker's fear of feminism lead to one the great classic horror novels.",atavus68,2016-06-12T05:30:23Z,Dracula,COMMENT

If you liked Dracula, you should really look into ""The Historian"" by Elizabeth Kostova. Follows a similar writing style (told through letters written in the past) but it set in the 20th century (actually in 3 different periods of the 20th century) and spans a good portion of the globe.

If you thought this book cleared the name of vampires you should check out the original Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, who wrote that when she competed with, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and possibly someone else to create the best horror story.

i dunno. it's a very surface interpretation, but also structure was a very different thing, a less studied topic, and beyond that, dracula has the framing of being a travel story, a structure we don't really engage in as much anymore outside of sci-fi, where we're making up a lot of the details of travel and adventure.",DementedJ23,2016-06-12T01:07:34Z,Dracula,COMMENT

My absolute favorite theme of the book came from the theme Van Helsing embodied. Namely, that a master of both the 'old' and 'new' worlds has the greatest advantage/power. None of the other characters at first had as much knowledge or advantage as Van Helsing did because he was one of the few (if not only) people who still bothered studying up on the 'old' sciences etc. He combined his knowledge of the old and archaic with the 'new' technology of the time to help effectively combat Dracula, and as the other characters are brought up to speed and team up, they gain in power.

4nl229,"I read it in literature class, and it was an honors course so the teacher made us go pretty in depth with it. I think my favorite themes is feminism in the book. You look at the vampire women, who are the embodiment of sexually liberated, strong, powerful women, but they are viscous and evil.(radical, maneaters?)  Lucy, who before she becomes a vampire is the domesticated, pure, chaste woman. She's not too smart, and lives to serve the men in her life and really her existence is for men.

then you have Mina. She's smart, independent, she's pure (but it's more complicated than that). she's equally as capable, if not more, than Jonathan. A large majority of the book is revolved around the men trying to protect her, but the thing is that Mina really ends up helping and protecting the men more than they do her. she keeps them in check, and they treat her as a teammate, and a mother figure. she even uses her connection to Dracula to her, and the men's, advantage as a way to take him down. 

so if the vampire women are these radical, sexually liberated, man-eating ""feminist""(though not really) figures, and Lucy is the epitome of the ideal Victorian housewife, submissive, obedient, man serving... then what is Mina? what does she represent? How does her character's involvement and experiences throughout the book reveal about feminism and women being equal to men?(especially in that time) Is Mina a feminist icon or the exact opposite?

4nl229,"It's kinda sad that a lot of mythology and folklore that is at the center of european cultural heritage most certainly got lost during the transition from oral to written culture and the christianisation of europe, in many cases there's only fragments left.

As for Bram Stokers inspiration, wikipedia seems to have this bit.

>Before writing Dracula, Stoker met Ármin Vámbéry, a Hungarian writer and traveler. Dracula likely emerged from Vámbéry's dark stories of the Carpathian mountains.[9] Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of vampires. 

An example regarding werewolves, which kinda shows why it's so sad that we lost so much folklore:

>there are currently no known written accounts of Slavic mythology predating the fragmentation of the Proto-Slavic people into West, East, and South Slavs, with the possible exception of a short note in Herodotus’s Histories, mentioning the tribes of Budini and Neuri in the far north, whose men, supposedly transform themselves into wolves for several days each year although Herodotus is himself not convinced by this rumour, he stresses that he has heard some swear it.[1] Some researchers have interpreted this through the Slavic folk belief in werewolves, while others believe that Herodotus actually referred to ancient Slavic carnival festivals, when groups of young men roamed the villages in masks, sometimes referred to as vucari (wolf-humans). The identification of ""Neuri"" with Proto-Slavs remains controversial, however.

It's also interesting that you bring up LOTR, as Tolkien seemed to be saddened by the loss of mythology and folklore of pre-Anglo-Saxon England. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_paganism

>The pre-Christian society of Anglo-Saxon England was non-literate.[14] As a result of this, there is no contemporary written evidence from the period in which Anglo-Saxon paganism was actively being practiced.[15] Instead, our primary textual source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon paganism derives from later authors, such as Bede or the anonymous author of the Life of St Wilfrid, who were writing in Latin rather than in Old English.[16] These writers were not interested in providing a full portrait of the Anglo-Saxons' pre-Christian belief systems, and thus our textual portrayal of these religious beliefs is fragmentary and incidental.[",,2016-06-11T15:30:07Z,Dracula,COMMENT

FFC's Dracula is considered by some to be overwrought and too long, but I consider it superlative.  

The entire movie is lush, beautifully shot, laced with metaphor (the white wolf as the restrained sexual urge, the black wolf as destructive, unleashed carnality) - and Coppola refused to use any digital retouches in the film (even back in 1991 they wanted them).

Mina is hard working and competent. She helps out in several ways including ways that you pointed out would be traditionally masculine. She's treated as a fairly straight forward member of the group and an asset. 

I find it oddly telling that in the 'modern' take on it they remove that intelligence and competence. I have the same issue with almost any portrayal of Irene Adler from Sherlock Holmes too.

4nl229,"I definitely agree with your take on Mina's actions, but where I disagree is that I don't think Stoker necessarily sees Mina's actions as a good thing. From my perspective, it seems like everything really comes to a head after Lucy dies - Mina finds out what happened and she recovers fairly quickly. Seward serves her some brandy. Goldalming becomes hysterical (a very feminine word in that time period!) and she comforts him calmly. Mina immediately types up a record of what has taken place. It seems like she is really stepping into the masculine role here, perhaps even over the men.

And what happens immediately after? She gets her first visit from Dracula. She's acting improperly, so she must be punished just as Lucy was. And from that point on she is allowed to do nothing but wait for the men to step in and save the day.",,2016-06-11T18:04:38Z,Dracula,COMMENT

4nl229,"For a very long time, blood held a certain mystical property as it was not well understood. It was seen as the life force and essence of who we were. When we learned that blood is just blood and not really all that important to who we were we turned our attention the brain and mind. If you want to know more about the history of blood I recommend listening to [Radiolab's ""Blood"" episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/308403-blood/). It's fascinating. 

Oh, and since you loved *Dracula* I recommend reading Stephen King's *'Salem's Lot*. It was published in 1975 and is actually his second published novel ever. In one of the most recent editions, King has written one of my favourite introductions to a book I have ever read. In it, he talks about the history of the book and how in some ways it's a modern retelling of *Dracula*. It has a lot of other inspirations as well (Invasion of the Body Snatchers for example) but King goes back to *Dracula* a fair bit. King says that when he was writing *'Salem's Lot* (at that time called The Second Coming) he thought that *Dracula* was too hopeful. He set out to write a vampire that would crush all humans that would opposed him. Anyways, here's a link: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5413._Salem_s_Lot?from_search=true&search_version=service you can look inside and read just the intro if you want.

>Stoker wrote Dracula as a middle class Anglo-Irish guy at the turn of the 20th century, if he was going to fill the book with ethnic stereotypes Jews are just below Sicilians on the list of people he would have probably targeted

Turn of the century Ireland was rife with anti-Semitism, as it was a means to become part of the 'in' group by oppressing others. See James Joyce's Ulysses for a depiction of this in literature. 

[The Limerick Boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_boycott) is an example of a notable contemporary anti-Semitic incident. ",,2016-06-11T17:23:37Z,Dracula,COMMENT

it means it's an extremely obscure stereotype that Stoker probably didn't even know about himself.

>as it was a means to become part of the 'in' group by oppressing others

Stoker was an Anglo-Irish Protestant who worked for Dublin Castle, he didn't need to seek out any groups to oppress.

Is it possibly Dracula is a racist Jewish caricature? Who knows, maybe. Is it likely? The fact that Stoker had no history of anti-semitism and had a terribly complicated ethnic identity of his own, on top of the threadbare evidence in the text itself, suggests not.",rollinggrove,2016-06-11T18:03:32Z,Dracula,COMMENT
4nl229,"Again, 'Anglo-Irish Protestant' does pretty much nothing to indicate that somebody isn't anti-Semitic. Colonial subjects often internalize the prejudices of the colonizer in order to assimilate. For an example of something similar, in the US,  the Irish were viciously racist against POC because it provided them with the opportunity to redirect racial/ethnic hatred and exclusion. 

 I don't think that Dracula is a racist Jewish caricature, I think that he, like many other instances of vampires in fiction, owes a lot of his roots to anti-Semitism. This doesn't mean that Bram Stoker is a die-hard anti-Semite, it just means that his fiction was a product of the times. As for the author themselves having a complex identity, I would again point you towards Ulysses--the depiction of anti-Semitism in Ireland that is presented in the book is far from lacking nuance, in fact it does a lot of work towards condemning Irish nationalism on the basis that it utilizes anti-Semitism to create an in group. [Quick Edit: Although Joyce wrote the novel in the 1920s, it's pretty clear that Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom are both author stand-ins at different stages of life projected onto 1904 Dublin because hindsight enables more effective social criticism, with Bloom working as a reaction against the Stephen that was presented in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man] 

I have a feeling that a lot of your arguments here are based on the assumption that claims regarding anti-Semitic content are tantamount to claims asserting the presence of anti-Semitic activism. This is not the case. Similarly, if I were to write a book set in present day America, there would be heavy inclusion of institutional and personal manifestations of racism against POC. That being said, it wouldn't necessarily indicate that I endorse those viewpoints, and could just as easily be used to subvert them. ",,2016-06-11T20:49:37Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Although sunlight does weaken Dracula even in Stoker's book. An even earlier literary vampire was Lord Ruthven in Polidori's story [The Vampyre](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Vamp.shtml), which was actually responsible for a vampire craze in England and obviously influenced Stoker. But this vampire was not allergic to sunlight too.

The reader knows about Dracula by this point but the characters don’t, so he’s this shadowy, dangerous presence lurking around the edges of the story.

Once Van Helsing takes over the hunt for Dracula, I felt like the last third was a letdown. There are still amazing bits, like the scene with Dracula’s brides besieging Mina and Van Helsing’s hut. But Dracula himself goes down like a chump! The hunters just do everything during the day, and Dracula doesn’t really have a good way to counter that.

One of my professors fell in love with vampires thanks to Dracula! And this love lead her to write her masters thesis on the impact of vampires on literature.

So, even though I would agree that maybe Dracula isn´t on the NY Times best sellers or your local library´s ""hot section""; by no stretch do I think it doesn´t receive its deserved praise and admiration. I think of it as in music (well, not always. I just said it to illustrate the point, it´s not like every time I think of *Dracula* this comes to mind): maybe you love Porcupine Tree. But just because you don´t hear it blasting on every single stereo doesn´t mean there aren´t any fans out there enjoying them.

nrrkvc,"You know we only have this book because of a drug-fueled orgy

EDIT: I feel I should explain this. In 1816, Mary Shelly (the future writer of Frankenstein) was engaged to her future husband Percy Shelly, and traveling Europe with both him and her stepsister. Her stepsister had had a fling with Lord Byron, and wanted to visit him at his estate on Lake Geneva. 1816 was also the “year without a summer” and because it was cold outside, Lord Byron decided that they should have a 4-way. Lord Byron’s personal physician was standing in the corner eating a pickle (not a euphemism). After sex, they all did a bunch of opium and Percy Shelly tripping balls eventually leads to a scary story contest. Lord Byron tells a story about a precocious vampire that bites people. Mary Shelly tells what she would eventually publish as Frankenstein. Later, Lord Byron’s personal physician writes down and publishes Lord Byron’s story and titles it “The Vampire”, which would later be the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”",Chancellor_Valorum82,2021-06-04T00:54:48Z,Dracula,COMMENT

It would hardly surprise me if Stoker was overshadowed by the modern commercial vampire complex which has given us such gems as the never ending Twilight series—fittingly vampiric in itself, if for no other reason than it never tastes death. 

I think that Stoker’s influence is less evident in modern retellings of the vampire myth in that modern series make sex symbols: vampires are sports car driving, clubbing playboys with a temper who incidentally drink blood and live forever. To the extent that these can even be considered horror—I never feel fear as I watch them—these modern series resort to the occasional—or frequent—gory interlude—which is usually just viscerally disgusting, more than anything else—to punctuate horror, whereas Stoker was more artful about it. In Stoker’s version, the refinement is part of his coldness. Dracula’s attempts at hospitality leave Harker chilled. Dracula is equal parts aristocrat and literal horrifying monster—beastly and demonic, a true incarnation of evil.

nrrkvc,"I remember reading and thinking meh of the Scarlet Letter in Jr High being forced reading, but I found and read Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales from my mom's bookshelf and it was absolutely amazing. The fact that the name alone is both a Shakespeare reference and an Odyssey reference (I actually caught the Odyssey reference myself, having just read both the Odyssey and Iliad and that's actually what caught my eye) as well as being self deprecating is cool. I agree with E. A. Poe's review that the stories were a bit didactic and full of allegory, but the prose and tale telling was amazing.

Bram Stoker is a bit of an enigma to me. He wrote one of the best horror stories I've ever read (Dracula) and quite possibly the worst as well (The Lair of the White Worm). Dracula was all imagination, as Stoker based the castle on Castle Bran, not Poenari Castle (Vlad's actual fortress) having never visited either. Bran is a cramped, dark military border fortification, whereas Poenari is a partially restored ruin, but you can tell it was a lot more palatial and bright (but damn, all the steps to get up there! Almost 1500, then you have to go down - my calves hurt for days).",Clewin,2021-06-04T13:05:11Z,Dracula,COMMENT

It has been torn apart, dissected, examined and reviewed for almost 150 years now by every major literary and pop culture personality at the time they existed.

Even then, what guarantee do you have that someone who doesn't speak English as a first language is going to want to read Dracula when their own language would have its own classics? Would you count abridged versions of the book as really having read it, because that's a different experience?

nrrkvc,"I used to be really bad with Dracula adaptations because I really loved the book and kept getting upset whenever an adaptation contradicted something from the book. Now if it was a parody, I was more forgiving. Nowadays I just let the adaptations be and my friends would make fun of me because they know I want to mention the book if we're watching.

(I also didn't have anyone to talk to when I first read Dracula. Those who liked to read weren't interested in it and everyone else didn't like to read. So like for the next few years, whenever I had to report on something I like for whatever class, I almost always spoke about the Dracula novel.)

Honestly though, I don't fully agree that the book is ""better than everything it produced combined"", emphasis on 'combined'. I think it's the BEST but I also think some adaptations and parodies have been pretty good and the novel itself could be intimidating to some people. (Though they still won't beat the novel.) I would love to see an extremely faithful adaptation to be honest.

As for why you might not hear about the book being talked about often, I think for starters, it's because Dracula is very popular and well-established in pop culture and has been for decades, so it might be one of those things people don't feel a need to discuss that much? Another might be because of its genre or because it's an epistolary novel? If I'm right, then I'd find that a bit sad because I'm always down to talk about Dracula lol.

nrrkvc,"Each to their own but I don’t consider it one of the classics for any great themes. To me it’s one of the classics for kickstarting the vampire subculture. 

If I compare the themes in Dracula to Conrad’s Heart of Darkness published 2 years later the difference is stark. Conrad’s got themes of exploitation, colonialism,imperialism etc that are obvious. I don’t need to be a 1900s Englishman or historian to understand it, In comparison I didn’t get any great theme or meaning from Dracula. 

Or you could compare Dracula to Frankenstein, the latter being a much deeper book in terms of undercurrents and themes throughout. 

I’d personally put Dracula in line with books like count of Monte Cristo or Don Quixote. good fun reads that have stood the test of time, inspired other tales and stories of a similar fashion. But hold no great meaning or significant themes.

19aft1z,"The first half of that book was a masterpiece. The castle and the captain's log really captured the dread and horror. You are right and London was remarkably boring in comparison. And the ending was very anti-climatic, but it was at least realistic to the world Stroker had created, as a small group would stand no chance against Dracula, especially not in his home country.  

A few years back, I did watch a modern retelling of Dracula that was a limited series I found on Netflix. It has the castle and boat trip season, but turned the later conflict into a multigenerational one, where several generations of the survivors of the first half prepare for the arrival of Dracula in London, which the previous generation had managed to delay. It was pretty well done, though the ending took a left turn, choosing to go with a disappointing conflict resolution over what I thought they'd set everything up for.

The primary problem with the book is pacing; the first 50 pages in which Harker is running around Castle Dracula wondering what the fuck is going on and trying not to die are lightning in a bottle. It felt like a thrilling Benny Hill sketch and I was invested in it 100%.

Then it shifts to 150 pages of looking out over the Whitby shores and seemingly endless blood transfusions.

I definitely agree with the pacing issue but I still like the the Lucy and Renfield chapters. I think that the book would have been better if we didn't know that Dracula was the cause of all of Lucy's problems. It was a problem of the reader knowing too much and getting frustrated with how the characters handled the situation. I read it three years ago but I remember Van Helsing putting out garlic and a maid throwing it away, and maybe locking the windows and someone else comes and opens them. When you know that Dracula is a Vampire and can turn into a bat then these moments lose a lot of their tension.

You’re free to like every part of it, I’m free to have different preferences.  Also, re dracula being too powerful to be defeated. The gang ran him off of his London lair, so it’s not like he’s unstoppable. That’s revisionism based on how belovéd Dracula has rightfully become in the meantime. In-story, he can be stopped from getting at Lucy by a shut window. Let’s not get out of control. Van Helsing has pieces of the true cross or whatever, there could easily be a scenario where they fight and kill Dracula.

But I’ll never forget the dawning realization, while reading _Frankenstein_ in high school, that the “monster” is not the monster. Dr. Frankenstein is the monster. Those who mistreated the “monster” are the monster. Regular people are the monster. The reader is the monster. _I_ in my ordinariness am the monster. 

That has been a foundational piece of my personal anthropology. Human beings, in our ordinariness, can be monsters.

17iabi3,"Regarding the gender stuff, I'd say Carmilla gets a few points for toying with the Very Victorian idea that ""beauty = goodness"". Seriously, the number of stories from that era, Dracula included, where you can immediately tell someone is trouble due to them not being conventionally attractive. It was an actual belief at the time that criminal or deviant behavior just sort of showed up on your face (Dorian Gray also plays with this). Nowadays we're used to the character of the ""femme fatale"", (only other example from the time I can think of is Milady from the Three Musketeers) but at the time Carmilla looking and acting like the sweetest and most innocent thing imaginable while actually being a monster was a bit subversive. Also she's a female character who is stronger and smarter than most of the males, so for the time that was a rarity too.

As for being sympathetic, she's still a monster, but whereas Dracula shows zero positive traits throughout the book, Carmilla has...a couple. Like showing a few signs of guilt for her actions, trying to rationalize herself as a part of nature, and just the fact that she was apparently a good person in life who can't help what she is. Whereas Dracula shows no remorse or complexity, and in life he was, well, actual maniac Dracula.

I wouldn't say it's a better book, Dracula does have the better plot. But Dracula as a character is just a Saturday morning cartoon supervillain. Every adaptation of him that has tried to add some nuance, guilt, or affection for his victim, is borrowing from Carmilla. She's a more interesting character in a less interesting story.",LupinThe8th,2023-10-28T16:06:08Z,Dracula,COMMENT

The Vampyre is an important book for those interested in horror/vampires, but I don't think it's in the same league as Carmilla (and certainly not Dracula).

17iabi3,"I think Carmilla is a great little book. It’s a much more intimate story than Dracula. And you get a much closer view of the predatory nature of the vampire. I think it is going to feel much more familiar to readers of modern (read post Interview with a Vampire) vampire stories. The ending is defiantly an anticlimax, I don’t think the Baron is completely to blame. Part of it is that our point of view character had no business in a monster fighting climax. Hard to fit in a non tragic climax with a protagonist like Laura. It’s also notable for being an early example of a beautiful and innocent looking monster that hunts by manipulating the assumptions people would make about such a “frail” creature. That angle would be very transgressive for the time.  The woman that dropped Carmilla off is also one of the most tantalizing unsolved mysteries of fiction. One thing I will say is that I’m not convinced the relation is meant to be lesbian. People, especially women, were a lot more physically interment in friendships at this point in history.  And I don’t think all of the affection starved women that preceded Laura as Mircalla’s victims would have been lesbians either. 

If Carmilla is a book that does what it does well. Dracula just does so much more. More technically complex and accomplished. Phenomenal use of the epistolary format. Way more themes delved into. I can’t go into all of it while I have said all I really have to say about Carmilla. One thing I will say though is that Dracula is a much more progressive book, both in intent and execution. It’s just that we’ve moved past a lot of the issues discussed in Dracula while two women cuddling is more controversial now than when Carmilla came out.",Lordfinrodfelagund,2023-10-30T16:18:08Z,Dracula,COMMENT
17iabi3,"I agree. Dracula is clearly the best, for the reasons you mention.

Carmilla is good and fun to read, but it's almost hard to believe how Laura can still not put the pieces of the puzzle together even after hearing about Carmilla's (""Millarca's"")  previous victim. I couldn't believe that Laura was even happy to see Carmilla show up right after hearing the story from the old General -- was she really that slow on the uptake, or was she being mind-controlled by Carmilla and therefore couldn't reason logically?

The Vampyre is also a good read. I think I liked it about as much as Carmilla. It was better than Carmilla in the sense that the main (non-vampire) character Aubrey did put the clues together and realise the identity of the vampire. But it was worse than Carmilla because the ending was >!very tragic: Aubrey couldn't prevent the vampire from killing him and his sister, and the vampire got away!!<",milly_toons,2023-10-28T15:57:57Z,Dracula,COMMENT
17iabi3,"I started it, but it was bit of a drag so i dropped it towards the beginning, shortly after the coach crashed i think.

stoker's dracula by contrast started off strong. the writing was clearly on a higher plane than carmilla. carmilla's writing is like every other gothic ghost story the victorian era writers were churning out by the dozens. but dracula's writing was almost modern in its use of suspense. 

unfortunately, while i got further along in dracula than carmilla, i still did not finish it. the book bogged down significantly (for me) once scenery shifted to england. it was kind of hilarious how characters were introduced by the way their their brow bones were shaped, but made it hard to take things seriously. i know physiognomy was huge back then, but my god it did not age well.",quantcompandthings,2023-10-29T02:44:29Z,Dracula,COMMENT

And the arch vampire being the logical extreme of the feudal lord is interesting; more so now than it has been in a while. 

I will say I tend to enjoy Carmilla a lot more when she has shown up in later stories where as the Count I’ve never really felt worked as well outside of the novel, even in the stage play and it screen adaptations( I know he’s is the second most adapted chapter of all time.

164j544,"Protip: the book you actually wanted to read is *Carmilla*.

Not only was it written 26 years before Dracula, and partially inspired it, but it actually suits our modern ideas of vampires far better.

Carmilla is a major character in her book, ""on screen"" for most of it. She is charismatic, appealing, and attractive, unlike Dracula. She is capable of blending into society through cunning and deception, unlike Dracula. She also has romantic feelings for the human protagonist, shows signs of guilt for her actions, and seems to struggle with and regret her nature as a predator, but can't help what she is and tries to rationalize her deeds as just being part of nature. Even in the end, after she's been destroyed, the narrator admits that she sometimes views Carmilla as a monster, and sometimes remembers her as a friend. She's complicated and not 100% horrible, but capable of doing horrible things, because as a vampire she must.

If all this sounds like what modern vampires are like (including most adaptations of Dracula), there's a reason for that. Dracula has the more suspenseful and iconic plot, but other than that first act he's not much of a character. So when people wanted to tell stories about him that focused on him more, and gave him more of a personality, they naturally borrowed from that *other* vampire, the one who is actually fun.

(Also, Carmilla is *queer as fuck*, so you can see why through most of the 20th century Hollywood was a little leery of adapting her too closely).

Oh, and it's a novella under a hundred pages in length and you can polish it off in an afternoon. No padding in this one, the story is nice and brisk.

164j544,"Honestly same. Some people say it starts slow but honestly I found the first four chapters peak. Absolutely loved it and woshed Stoker worked on it more. Initially I was a little put off by it's focus then on Mina but eventually came to like it. Once Lucy died it went downhill. Didn't mind them hunting down Lucy, but after they formed a team it went mid for me. Mina was pushed to the side, Dracula who should have had his time to shine was kind of just the guy they were hunting rather than the powerful, intelligent master of the night. As far as we know he just never hunted anyone in England other than Lucy and Mina; I wish they went more into other victims. Last third of the book felt dragged, it was all about hunting down Dracula to the point the characters didn't feel characters anymore, more just extensions of eachother.

Overall I wish Stoker looked more into Renfield, his background and motivations beyond just madness, but mostly Van Helsing and Dracula. The rivalry could have been gone into further and the characters fleshed out more than just Van Helsing leading and Dracula as just the bad guy after he was so well set up in the first chapters. I wish Jonathan was also further fleshed out,  lot of the book seems to put aside that he's the only one to meet Dracula for half the book.

However, her actual inner narration frequently mentions how glad she is to be a good obedient wife, and takes jabs at feminists. There's also a certain... thing that happens later in the book that could have been completely avoided had the men not unanimously agreed that she be kept out of this, since women are not able to handle this kind of business (despite the fact that to get to this stage, she had to handle this kind of business, and very well at that). Something really bad happens as a direct result of the ""stay in the kitchen"" attitude. And the narration, even Mina's own, never blames the men. Nobody ever says ""Oh no, our narrow views on the role of women has led to this terrible thing"", even though it's really obvious that's what happened. They never admit to a mistake. 

It's really odd. With the omission of Mina's narration, and a single line from any of the cast, she would be seen as a feminist character. But as is, I can only assume that any feminist interpretation is an accident.",WaserWifle,2023-11-29T23:28:01Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Women were more or less totally closed off from higher education and any institutions of note beyond auxiliary roles like secretaries.

Declaring something fully feminist or misogynist is just like. Not a useful way to do anything. For these purposes, feminism would be a critical lens through which to examine the work - one which should probably also work hand-in-hand with a historical lens for a book 100 years old. There's going to be elements of both. It was written by a man a hundred years ago. Just by that alone there's going to be problematic stuff in it, never mind the actual contents of he story. However, as any of the dracula daily tumblr girlies will tell you, there's also plenty of character work that resonates strongly with a modern feminist audience that has good points to take away, especially depending on your interpretation.

Edit: Skimming some of the other comments has made me realize some of the words I want to use for this- I would say that *judging* dracula through a modern lens is probably misguided (though ngl I do thoroughly judge the twists several adaptations have made ever since that do make it MORE misogynistic imo), however I think *analyzing* it through a modern lens gives you all sorts of complicated answers to your question!",math-is-magic,2023-11-30T12:29:13Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Especially those women who were upper middle class to upper upper class. Same goes for the various words that were in use at the time. He also took time to research the real person behind the fiction. So it can not be seen in many ways as being misogynistic. Due to the standards of that time vs current time.

What many folks do not realize. Is that Dracula was based on a real person. Vlad III. Who had a long bloody history. He also had a total of three wives. Not all three at the same time. Which Stroker placed in the books as the three female vampires that are in the castle that Renfield visited. He was the ruler of Wallachia. The thing is, he was super religious in his own way. He had built several churches, nunneries, priories, etc... 

I would say that the using of the stake to impale the vampires in the story came from how he treated various folks. If injured in front. he would see that person as being a warrior. If injured in the back. the person would be impaled due to him seeing that person as a coward. And the item of impalement entered the body from the anal area and thru the mouth.

Honestly Dracula is a particularly interesting work for the exact reasons that OP is talking about, in that it straddles a strange line where sexist thinking was considered the default, but Mina behaved in a way with significant agency in a very non-traditional sense.

While it's true that people who don't know what they're talking might respond to this post, that's a totally different issue than posting the discussion itself. There are people who have a better idea who also can access this forum and post.

>For an example (and I'm totally making this up) someone might find a quote that Bram Stoker said the l that his wife should stay home and look after the kids. And then use that as an argument for his mysogeny. When really, that was in fact the societal norm of the time. Everyone would have said that.

That's misogynistic regardless of societal norms, just fyi, but wouldn't necessarily preclude Stoker having more progressive thoughts as well (and doesn't single him out as being especially woman-hater-y). I don't think people having a knee-jerk reaction to information means we should curb other people sharing their thoughts or knowledge. Yeah, some people suck, but why limit ourselves because someone else might get offended? That's their problem.

I guess, in summation, I don't understand the idea of getting pre-offended because someone else might get offended, but to each their own.

  
For what it's worth (if you or anyone else is curious), there's evidence that Florence was in many ways Stoker's working partner during his life and is, of course, known for her defense of Dracula. I know she managed all their affairs during the end of Stoker's life, too, which he praised her for to his friends.

11fiwer,"This is simple

It's not a language issue but a plant cultivar issue.

The word eggplant in Dracula is referring to a specific cultivar of the plant. It's from this cultivar we get the general name eggplant.

This cultivar is white and looks like an egg growing out of the plant. It's not a very creative name.  It is not purple and it was popular in the west starting around 1760 then puttered out as other cultivars came about. The name caught on because it was very popular and could be produced to meet demand.

What happened?

The word eggplant became generalized to mean all in North America after this cultivar of the plant became popular. Why? to not be British.

What about aubergine?  In the UK the upper class adopted the French word to be posh, as they often did, and the rest followed so yeah. IF memory serves the original name in English for eggplant was madde.

The big fat purple thing we know and love? that is a cultivar known as Black Beauty and  it's only around 100 years old. It's a product of the early 20th century and it became common because it produces multiple large fruit and ships well so it eclipsed all other cultivars of the day for a long time.",that_other_goat,2023-03-02T00:34:53Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Many English (as in the English language) culinary terms tend to come from French. This is why you'll find zucchini called 'courgette' in the UK, for example.

Vampires in mythology are kinda known for having an effect on the land; plants wither and die, the weather becomes more gloomy, you have a weird shiver when you look up at the third window on the left of that decaying estate house, that sort of thing.

I always assumed that Dracula picked a house so close to the asylum because the minds of those within would be easy to bend, and who would believe a mentally ill person who said a tall dude in a black cloak materialized under the door and drank his blood in the night?

Renfield was just the mind that ended up bending first, or most usefully. If he was so important, I don't think Dracula would've cast him aside so powerfully that it killed him when he came to get Mina.",CSEngineAlt,2023-06-16T16:27:28Z,Dracula,COMMENT
14aw5hq,"It's implied in the book that he can have some sort of mental control over people who are susceptible in various ways.  Lucy was a sleepwalker, Renfield was insane.

 It's pretty common in horror stories as well as in real life superstitious or religious beliefs for people to think that certain conditions could make a person vulnerable to supernatural influence or able to communicate with supernatural beings. That's why youll find stories about how epileptic people or disabled people or insane people have connections with the paranormal, sometimes as victims or as seerers etc.

So It's nothing specific to Renfield. Anywhere Dracula mightve traveled he would've influenced or made connections with someone like that who knew what he was and could communicate with him. Renfield just happened to be there, if it had been another place it would've been another person as there are insane people everywhere.  

It's possible theyd met before, only don't remember the book saying this though. I recall that it was Draculas first time in England?? But who knows, it really doesn't matter. 

Renfield,  like Van Helsing, knew what vampires are (probably as a result of his condition which made him sensitive to that sort of thing) and Dracula started to communicate with him as he was approaching England, still on the ship. This does not require them to have known one another before, but it's irrelevant to the story if they did or not.

Note the similar pattern with Lucy due to her sleep walking.

Renfield is in the role that we might call a familiar. He wants Dracula to make him a vampire and so he'll help him and serve him. You can see why it might be useful for Dracula to look for people like this anywhere he goes.

One more thing, Dracula does not go to Whidby bc Renfield was there. He had already planned the trip to England, it's why he brought Harker to the castle in the first place, to help him prepare. But he went to Whidby specifically as opposed to elsewhere in England bc of Mina and revenge on Harker. That's why he toyed with Lucy so long too.

It's very sad how modern media has diluted this classic story of good vs evil and popularised the romantic, sexy, tragic hero vampire.

18xnj1l,"Yes, men penetrating men, or women penetrating men, is part of the exciting sexual depravity depicted in the story. Dracula also embodies some of the Victorian stereotypes of homosexual men, such as very red lips, shockingly-pale skin, white and fine hands, and the ability to fight physical force with enchanting charm. He's also the only creature capable of producing more vampires, which makes him a perverse kind of mother figure. But gender-bending sexual imagery is not the only Victorian fear Stoker works into the story.

*Dracula* also raises fears of sexually-transmitted disease, which was a huge problem in Victorian England but a taboo subject. It was often discussed in coded language, though, and vampirism may have been one of those codes. Sexually-transmitted diseases were often assumed to be a byproduct of sexual depravity.

The character of Dracula also bore a resemblance to stereotypes about Jews, many of whom came to England from Eastern Europe in the 19th century due to antisemitic Russian pogroms. There's a very old stereotype among Christians in Europe that Jews use the blood of young Christians for ritual purposes. Jews were also stereotypically depicted as wealthy. They stereotypically dressed strangely, spoke with accents, and had no allegiance to any country.

Dracula also raises fears of Romani, commonly known by the slur gypsies. The traveling Romani who had no permanent home or job were thought to be thieves not only of money and objects but also of children. They were thought to live like animals. 

In short, Stoker's *Dracula* reveals a lot about what Victorian English readers secretly feared. They feared aggressive and seductive sexual deviants, Jewish immigrants, Romani immigrants -- in short, ""otherness.""",wjbc,2024-01-03T17:25:56Z,Dracula,COMMENT

The vampire women in the castle are a straightforward metaphor for sexuality, and the Count wants Harker all to himself... there's a lot of coded sexuality in general in the novel. Lucy is a fairly obvious example of that, as is the idea of vampires drinking blood - it's a kind of penetration.

It helps if you look at what came before *Dracula* (1897). *Carmilla* (1872), the archetypal 'lesbian vampire' story, and *The Vampyre* (1819), whose titular character is based on Lord Byron, noted socialite, bisexual, and accumulator of scandals ('mad, bad, and dangerous to know' was coined about him).

Stoker himself is believed to have been gay - there are some letters from Walt Whitman which hint at that quite heavily - and though there are obviously other themes he's dealing with in *Dracula*, there's been a lot of academic writing on whether/how he's filtering his own grappling with sexuality through the work.",TigerHall,2024-01-03T16:50:30Z,Dracula,COMMENT

In fact, I hated the book, despite loving most Victorian literature I read and Dracula movie adaptations and everything vampire-related. The book was so repetitious, melodramatic, and the characters did not act logically. And the treatment of women was unlike anything I had read by a Victorian author before—how Lucy and Mina were basically worshipped but also demeaned. I mean it's not a surprise given the time period, but it just made it difficult for me to enjoy.

After that Dr. Seward was reluctant to defile her corpse, and Van Helsing had to physically show him her grave, both at night when it was empty and during the day when she returned. Van Helsing does have a conversation with Dr. Seward about mysticism, and whether or not he believes in various metaphysical concepts, precisely to emphasize Dr. Seward's scientific mind and his skepticism, and Van Helsing's acknowledgement of certain forces being outside the realm of science.

Quincy only became involved because he loved Lucy, and it was seeing her and what she became that helped convince him of the necessity of taking out Dracula.

Like there's that stupid idea about the blood transfusions that made its way into that *Dracula Tapes* book, where Van Helsing was actually killing Lucy with mismatched blood types and Dracula *actually* turned Lucy into a vampire to save her life. Never mind that the book *Dracula* makes it very obvious that the blood transfusions *did* work, that she felt better afterwards, and that her relapse into illness was entirely because of Dracula coming back and draining all the blood out of her again and again.

I found her final days infuriating. Van Helsing arses around  decorating the place with garlic as if that's a foolproof solution. Surely she'd have had a better chance if he or one of the lads had stayed by her side every night? He's all shocked everytime finds that Dracula has been during the night, but what did he expect?

He's the Obi Wan. Stoker might also have intended him to play a comic relief role with all his mis-translations of English slang and phrases.

Mina is definitely not presented as a damsel in distress. She is intelligent and self possessed, traits that are often commented on by the rest of the characters. Although Van Helsing has the knowledge of vampire lore, Mina seems to be one step ahead of everyone when it comes to what is actually going on. She knows that the group's friendship, and collaboration is stronger than Dracula. Even with all his supernatural power, he is weaker than them because he is alone. Van Helsing agrees, saying something like, ""We must always work together."" But then when Van Helsing takes the men to kill Dracula, he ignores his own advice, leaving Mina behind, where Dracula is able to attack her. I think Mina is the one who suggests they can use her psychic link with Dracula and follow him back to his castle if Van Helsing hypnotizes her. Most importantly, Mina convinces the men that they are not on a mission of  vengeance, but instead a mission of mercy.

A big part of it was his knowledge of the books was so incredibly deep.

>I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. [...]

continuing for several paragraphs.

But I think a lot of the original vampire stories are more about sexual abuse than about *fun* sex. Remember that the term ""date rape"" didn't exist until around 1980. Date rapists would have been classed as ""seducers,"" which of course makes ""seduction"" sound a lot less fun.

Dracula *could* be depicted as a sexy nobleman who attracts women through wealth and charm.

181w0cy,"If someone ever asks me for an argument against teaching English literature in high schools, I'm just going to show them this post.

It's a horror story about a monster who eats people. What it is trying to say is: 'I'm exciting, buy me!'

Okay, so it's not entirely devoid of subtext. Stoker wrote at a time when Britain was receiving what was, for the time, a large number of immigrants from Eastern Europe. You can, if you want to be simplistic, reduce the core of the novel down to: Eastern Europe immigrant comes to London, sexually assaults pure English girl. 

But there isn't a political *message*; Stoker wasn't trying to make a comment on the political problems of the day, he was just trying to riff on themes that would resonate with his audience.

And if your interpretation is an illustration of the dangers of exposing the unprepared brain to too many English literature classes, it's also an example of why we need more, and better, history teaching. Because you don't seem to understand the Victorian mindset at all.

Britain at the end of the 19th century was the richest, most technologically advanced nation on the planet, and perhaps with the exception of the United States it was one of the most socially progressive, too. For a 19th century understanding of the term 'social progress', that is. You're trying to project a modern understanding of the word 'conservative' back onto a time when it doesn't really fit.

Dracula represents the old world. The superstitious, feudal, Medieval societies still widespread across Europe in Stoker's day. Jonathan Harker and his friends are very deliberately presented as middle class: a growing part of English society but still very much not the norm elsewhere. A lot of Europe was still divided between peasants and landed gentry, especially the further east you went. It was one of the big complaints by the British against immigrants that they were ignorant and superstitious. 

Dracula is served by gypsies who were bound to him by custom and religious fear. But Harker is neither a grovelling serf nor a (literally) bloodsucking aristocrat. The upper classes had always looked down on anyone who actually worked for a living, but Harker has a respectable career (as does Mina); he doesn't draw his income from the toil of others, but nor is he anyone's servant. The theme is modern, progressive Victorian Britain vs. dark, regressive feudalism. 

Trying to project our modern dichotomy between 'liberal = pro sexual freedom' and 'conservative = anti sex' doesn't really work for this time period. Sexual continence was a middle class virtue; having babies out of wedlock was what poor people did, and being sexually promiscuous was what decadent aristocrats did (see: Lord Byron). Lucy becomes sexually promiscuous when she becomes a vampire because she has lost her moral sense.

But again, I cannot emphasize enough how Stoker was not trying to make any kind of political commentary. These are all things that would have been implicitly understood by his audience and were used by Stoker to add depth to what is at heart a traditional monster tale, rather than the story serving merely as framework for a metaphor (like Frankenstein, for example).",WRickWrites,2023-11-23T16:02:19Z,Dracula,COMMENT
181w0cy,"I read Dracula as quite a conservative text that, as you say, has a lot of fears of 'the Orient' and what it might do to a 'civilized' Victorian society (corrupt our women, enfeeble our men, etc). I don't think the fact Mina has training or education undermines that effect - nor does the portrayal of the male characters. 

The discourses we have about values in our society are imperfect and fragile: ideas about gender, for example. We can all reel off the tropes of what men and women should be like. And we all know that in practice, no individual meets that standard of behaviour/character/presentation. But we have a rigid set of idealised tropes that are, by definition, impossible for us to ever fully actualise. This is like Derrida's practice of deconstruction & double reading - any discourse always already contains the seeds of it's undoing within itself. So, Dracula can contain these contradictions (and must contain these contradictions) - that doesn't necessarily undermine your reading of it/the overall message. It just means that any act of making meaning (writing a story, for example) will contain tensions within its narrative.

So, while Mina might be educated (which fits with progressive middle class aspirations of white, Victorian womanhood at the time) and the men can and do emote (Jonathan in particular is at risk of falling under Dracula's 'spell', too, in the early novel) at the end of the day, it's the good old heterosexual, middle class, monogamous family that is 'saved' from these threatening, vampiric others.",missoranjee,2023-11-23T14:06:05Z,Dracula,COMMENT
181w0cy,"I don’t know how fast a reader you are but it really might be worth comparing it to The Beetle, the other big horror novel published the same year that actually sold more copies and was more critically acclaimed then Dracula. It’s also got an innovative structure— not epistolary but with each section from the pov of a different character— and it’s also got this eastern thing going on, in The Beetle an Egyptian cult, and it’s also got sexual danger for the independent female character. So then instead of looking deep inside Dracula and trying to find something that was never meant to be there, you can actually talk about the book as the money maker it was meant to be but – and this is still true – of course any book like that is going to draw on things that people find exotic, interesting, or frightening. So it says something about the reading public at the time.

181w0cy,"I haven't read Dracula, but I've seen from your comments that you need to figure out a meaning for school. 

The cool thing is, there is no wrong answer. 

Your idea of it being about purity / sin / change etc. - you said you got confused using this metaphor because when you categorised people as 'good' and 'bad', they still ended up facing the same fate. That could be a metaphor all on it's own. 

You could write about how Stoker was trying to say that change happens in life wether you're ready to embrace it or not and no matter how good and pure, or bad and impure someone is, everyone faces the same fate (death). Dracula represents change and he comes for everyone and people react differently but their outcomes are seemingly unrelated to their reactions - just like life. So ultimately, you might as well strap in and embrace change because being happy in the moment is all that you can control. 

I dunno. Like I said, I haven't read the book, I'm giving that analysis just based on your post, but it seems vague enough that you could probably justify it without being contradicted?",TheRecklessOne,2023-11-23T17:21:02Z,Dracula,COMMENT
181w0cy,"I think it's notable Bram Stoker started writing Dracula during the trial of Oscar Wilde, who was convicted of having sexual encounters with other men. The writers had known each other a long time, even fighting over the same woman in their youth, despite both being interested in men, and possibly both being gay. It's harder to say with Bram Stoker, but he wrote quite an incriminating letter to Walt Whittman, who himself wrote very suggestive poetry about men and had relationships with them. Bram Stoker also tried to remove all references to Oscar Wilde from his own writing and correspondence following the trial. Keep in mind Oscar Wilde's own book (The Picture of Dorean Grey) was used as evidence against him. Knowing that is going to potentially impact how other LGBTQ+ writers wrote, especially those who could be associated with him, like Stoker. 

So, this book was likely written by a closeted writer, who feared imprisonment or worse, if he ever acted on his desires. It very notably and repeatedly promotes heteronormative structures as ideal in way that is unusual even for the period. Heteronotitivity is something the character of Dracula directly threatens. The first part of the book Bram Stoker wrote was Dracula defending Harker from the female vampires. This is the part where Dracula says he loves Harker and 'this man is mine.' This is potentially quite telling. You could easily read the book as a story about internalised homophobia, where Dracula represents (unwanted) male same sex attraction. Dracula has some potential similarities to Oscar Wilde, in fact, and it does involve a fight over women between Dracula and the male heroes.

The close male relationships themselves are interesting in terms of this interpretation. They could be read as an attempt to show close male bonds which are most definitely not sexual, because all the heroic thing the men do are very definitely for women, not for each other. While there is an element of being able to break social norms of traditional masculinity or femininity, it is only up to a point. This something LBGTQ+ people in particular would acutely aware of.

In terms of 'social fear,' the fear of unacceptable sexual desire as rooted in the period, and notable from the trial of Oscar Wilde, could be a consideration, but it also possibly the book speaks to the very specific fears and turmoil's of an LGBTQ+ writer during a period of persecution.",Willowtreegarden,2023-11-24T21:57:50Z,Dracula,COMMENT
181w0cy,"To be honest with you, when I was using the terms conservative and liberal, I wasn’t exactly using them in a political way, at least that’s not what I had in mind. I was using them to portray a group that was more open minded / progressive vs a group that wasn’t as open minded / wanted to stick to traditional ideas in terms of the Victorian view. Though, I suppose that’s my own fault for not elaborating more? And yes, I’m aware that Stoker may have only written it for his own and others entertainment. But like you said, the environment / surroundings of his time could still influence the themes he wrote about (which I mentioned in a comment to another). 

I know Victorian society at the time had progressive groups / circles, though, I believe, traditional ideas when it came to gender roles still existed / were the norm (men being part of the working class / inherently masculine, and women sticking to the domestic life / motherhood). Although, I am aware some women at this time (especially of those progressive (mid class) circles) were able to obtain education, and men were obviously able to grieve (though, because of gender roles, kind of looked down upon to do so in public / when not appropriate). 

And what I mean with modern tech is stuff like the blood transfusions or the phonograph. Blood transfusions weren’t exactly new, but they weren’t that researched into, and the first transfusion on a human wasn’t somewhere until around the early 1800s. And the phonograph wasn’t exactly used until the late 1800s. But you are right, Britain was quite technologically advanced by the time the early 1900s hit. The mid-late 1800s kind of made a little pathway with these inventions for Britain to be that way. I just felt, at the time Stoker had written *Dracula*, these inventions were somewhat new for Victorian society at the time. 

And in terms of sexuality, I feel like the ideals of Victorian society at the time was all about morals. So, I thought (putting on these ideas together), perhaps Stoker was trying to say something about the group of Victorians who adhered to these ideals / morals that were promoted at the time and maybe what they viewed about those more progressive ideas (Dracula) vs the group of Victorians who weren’t so caught up / engaged with these ideals and favored change a lot more (Van Helsing and Co.). Or maybe even Victorian ideals / expectations vs. the reality of the time. Perhaps you can even make the argument for mid class vs upper class. Basically more social commentary than political.


In terms of the regression you mentioned, yeah, Eastern Europe wasn’t as developed compared to the west, but I also feel that idea could maybe apply to my interpretation since, wasn’t there a fear of regression within certain parts of Victorian society?

But yeah, progressive Victorian society vs regressive feudalism does make sense, and does make the contradictions I was having problems with easier to understand.",IKnowWutYouDid,2023-11-23T18:00:32Z,Dracula,COMMENT

181w0cy,"Sorry that people aren’t meeting your energy on this. There has never been a successful horror story that DIDN’T tap into some sort of societal fear. Many of them are situated in the time they were written. There are a select few that stand the test of time, because they are centered on fears that are universal. But even the Freddie Krueger movies were fairly clearly an allegory for puberty and sexual awakening. That time when your body starts responding in ways you never considered or intended. That’s why they were good. The straight slasher movies were centered on the fear of the sexual revolution, and whether that made victims responsible for the rise of famous serial killers in the 60’s and 70’s. They haven’t aged as well, for that reason. They’ve instead been satirized or updated. It Follows is basically a supernatural std, but it isn’t accompanied by the victim-blaming from Jason movies. 

Dracula is one of the rare ones that was scary in its time, and it’s still relevant today. The idea that “it’s just a story that sounded scary” is.. well, that’s fine if people don’t want to examine the why. But it’s weird to me that they are trying to dissuade you from it, unless people dislike using Reddit for homework help. But I appreciate that you added your thoughts, and you spent some time on them (as opposed to just trying to ask about themes). 

You aren’t the first (or will be the last) person to interpret Dracula as bringing new ideas to a conservative society. But I think it can trip you up to equate the good/evil and purity/sin angle. One of the themes of the book is that you CAN’T swap those on these characters. Mina can be physically impure without being morally impure. It was a pretty big distinction to make in Victorian society. Likewise, acknowledging that temptation is not the same as falling. I assume most people in Victorian society were aware of these things. They were human, after all. But all societies have ways of viewing themselves, promoting themselves. And there were several authors during this decade who wrote stories of the “fallen” who didn’t deserve to be thrown out. How easily these characters could have “fallen,” when they were really both victims and fighters. Thomas Hardy had been making it a theme in this same time. 

Dracula is also the book that set us on the sexy-scary-vampires trajectory that has never left us. We might have gotten there on our own, but this book was a watershed moment.",westkms,2023-11-23T22:20:38Z,Dracula,COMMENT

For me, it's a bit less of a book about a ~vampire~ and more of a book about friendship, and married nerds being in love, and Bram Stoker having clearly never interacted with a Texan in his entire life, and a profoundly Victorian excitement about using SCIENCE!!!!! to combat evils we've never understood.

If you mean “do you consider Dracula more impressive than these authors?” or “Do you consider the beginning of Dracula more obvious than these authors?”: Of your list, I have read Dickens, the Brontës, Hardy, Tennyson, Conrad, and Shelley (who is usually considered part of the Romantic era, but nonetheless). I don’t think Dracula is particularly impressive amongst that company. I also find that most if not all of those authors handle supernatural or quasi-supernatural creepiness in a more nuanced and less “obvious” way than does Stoker in Dracula.",WyldeBoar,2020-09-01T14:25:49Z,Dracula,COMMENT

Way to ignore the only possibly relevant  sentence. And you have proved the point. Those authors are ubiquitous. Also I think you misunderstand the point of Dracula and the social commentary and how radical a victorian book it is.  

Also it's Mary Shelley not Percy. I thought that would be obvious.",The_Vegan_Chef,2020-09-02T00:21:54Z,Dracula,COMMENT
ikb8qc,"Sure, those authors are ubiquitous. They also handle the supernatural in more interesting, more nuanced, and less-obvious ways than does Dracula. That’s my opinion and I’m sticking to it. I don’t understand the point you’re trying to make, other than you seem to be impressed by Dracula (which is fine) to the point that you assume anyone less impressed doesn’t understand it (which is silly).

Unless I’m missing something, the social commentary in Dracula is obvious to the point of being ham-fisted. Immigrants! Sexuality! The role of women! Yeah, I know. Again, other Victorian writing handles these in more interesting and complex ways.

While I personally consider period delineations to be rather artificial—it’s not like everything everyone was doing in literature turned on a dime in 1837—I assumed you meant Mary Shelley, who also is typically considered part of the Romantic era, since that’s when she wrote the majority of her work (including Frankenstein, 1818).",WyldeBoar,2020-09-02T00:41:25Z,Dracula,COMMENT
ikb8qc,"Maybe you should elaborate on these more nuanced and less obvious ways. The point is not that I am impressed by Dracula but that you seem to assume people are not familiar with victorian literature. The most ubiquitous genre of english lit.  
And it's great that you are aware of the themes of Dracula in a 2020 bubble. However that is a little irrelevant when placing a work in historical context. 
I find it funny that you have a problem with period delineation, but then turn around and try to use it to make a point. Shelley is thematically victorian. You could say post-romantic goth if you wish but the only reason she is sometimes classed as romantic is by association. Anyways delineations are not really as fixed as people seem to think.
And with regards to ""unless I'm missing something"", well yes. You are. You listed out HS themes, which leads me to believe you have recently started studying Lit and have a larger than warranted opinion of you understanding.

If Dracula has such amazing social commentary that isn’t hamfistedly obvious and has nothing to do with sexuality/women/immigrants (not that you actually specify what this might be), give me a link to some articles on JSTOR or wherever. I’d like to see it.

If Mary Shelley is “only...romantic by association,” the “association” in question is the fact of her having written her major works prior to Queen Victoria’s coronation. If you want to claim her as part of a “long Victorian era,” fine, that works.

She makes no mention of Lucy looking wan and sickly at that point. (Both of these are in Chapter VII

The sleep walking I think is being established as a pattern of behavior that Lucy had way prior to Count Douchebag pulling up in merry olde England and that was how she even became vulnerable to being exposed to his influence to begin with.

We're currently leaving a weird century long blip where that was not the case. And modern history classes don't seem to do justice to this fact; making it seem like men have always been toxic closed-off emotion-bottling stoics. I think Herodotus recorded one army battalion sobbing in joy together after seeing the ocean for the first time after a war. And even MacDonald (Scottish Victorian author; mid 1800s) consistently depicts vulnerable/crying/scared men who are also courageous, intelligent, and resilient.

g1t1db,"I think this take on *Dracula* comes up a lot on this sub.  I'm not sure many people consider the book a literary classic, because there are large sections of it that are real rough and not very fun to read.  I don't think the thing has endured because of Bram Stoker's writing.  Even as pulp fiction it's not incredibly tight.

I think Stoker does a couple of things well.  First, it's an epistolatory novel that's written from several different perspectives in methods that aren't just letters.  There are journals, letters, reports, and telegrams.  I'm not clever or well-read enough to know if this was the first book that made that stylistic attempt, but I thought it was a neat idea and gave *Dracula* a ""found document feel.""  Second, and this sub is wild about this shit, it's Stoker's world-building.  World-building is overhyped as a skill here, but Stoker, by hook or by crook, stumbled onto something with this one.

*Dracula* endures largely because of the culture cache attached to this ""world-building.""  A lot of modern-day vampire lore can be sourced back to that book.  It was incredibly popular when it was first published.  I think critics compared him to Mary Shelley (which... nah, not even close), thought it was a great novel, and thought Bram Stoker was a new literary force.  I think it's... okay.  People still *talk* about it because it is this vampire ur-text.  The politics of the story are dated, he has a real problem with a dragging plot (which is a big deal when you're essentially writing a pulp adventure), and his decisions getting increasingly simplistic as the protagonists get closer to their confrontation with Count Dracula.

Stoker was a theatre guy, apparently a pretty good one, and I think that's why the story keeps getting adapted.  Its actual plot is strong.  I don't think the thing is terrible by any means, it's just not a transcendent masterpiece or anything like that.

Personally, I really like the chapters in Whitby. There's strong dramatic irony as we the reader knows more about what's happening than the characters do. We know what happened to the Demeter, and what the ""large dog"" was that came ashore. We know who the mysterious figure is that Lucy met on the cliffs, and we know what is draining her of life and energy. The characters know nothing, and the tension between our knowledge and theirs builds suspense.

Add to that the fact that the two most interesting and entertaining characters in the book (Renfield and Van Helsing, respectively) come into play in these chapters and the result is pretty captivating.

eoeufo,"It's an [epistolary novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel), told entirely through letters and ephemera. So the reader has to do the work of a narrator, in a sense, as if *you* were the person who has learned the story from these materials.

The original *Dracula* novel leaves a lot on the table, in a way. The ending is a little under-developed, and there is enough world-building so more stories can be generated by a creative storyteller. Hence, it has been adapted many times, each version or spin-off superimposes a new unique vision. Scorcese's film added more to Dracula's backstory as a warlord and the tragedy of his wife's suicide, and added a more complete and satisfying ending. The latest BBC 3-part series is a huge departure, basically a whole new story, but all the important original elements are present.

Stoker's book is an excellent framework, but it takes some imagination to fill it up, to flesh out the details; and there is no definitive correct way to do that,  as we can see in its many adaptations.

iz7rai,"*Dracula* is a brilliant novel. I agree that it's targeted at an adult audience. I attempted to read it multiple times as a teen and couldn't get through it but absolutely loved it as an adult. I think this is because maturer audiences are able to appreciate the nuances of the novel and the gothic atmosphere Bram Stoker crafted. We're also likely to have read more and therefore have a wider vocabulary and understanding of the language that's used. *Dracula* is also very different from the modern vampire novel and I think that could be why younger readers sometimes struggle with it. Stoker's depiction of vampires is traditional and much more subtle yet grotesque. Dracula as a character isn't in your face; he's omnipresent. You can't see him, but you *feel* him at all times. It's part of what adds to the terror and suspense. It's a shame that *Dracula* seems to be so misunderstood in popular culture, which is only exacerbated by the various movie and TV adaptations.",its_the_stars,2020-09-26T22:57:46Z,Dracula,COMMENT

iz7rai,I have not.  How does the book handle thoughts and motivations? Stoker's Dracula was pure evil and the problem that I have always had with books from the vampire point of view is there has to be a internal monologue or motivation which usually ends up with a story line that pushes the vampire in a more sympathetic direction.,Bonmann,2020-09-25T18:19:36Z,Dracula,COMMENT

It's a quick read, you can polish it off in an afternoon. It also feels really ""modern"" compared to *Dracula*, despite coming out 26 years before, and influencing the latter.

And by modern, I mean it fits the way our modern fiction tends to portray vampires: as appealing and attractive, capable of feeling some degree of guilt over their actions but unable to deny their natures, and developing feelings for their victims. It also avoids a lot of the Victorian...fluff? I don't know how to describe it, just their tendency to natter on about stuff that doesn't further the story.

43owab,"Completely agree with the children aspect of the story, and on my first reading of the book I was surprised with just how much there was that I didn't know about the story. Many classics, like Dorian Gray or Jekyll and Hyde are, I find, mostly spoiled. Majority of the major plot points are commonly known and I was pleasantly surprised when I realized just how little I really knew about Dracula.

Character-wise I understand OP's point of view with the collapsing, but find that this seems to be something that comes up in several of the classics. Personally however, I chalked this up to being a style choice that was prevalent in generations gone by. As for differentiation of the characters, the males I found shared a number of characteristics as mentioned by OP. However, I also felt that each had their own distict traits and history that made them unique. Van Helsing being the wise mentor from a foreign land, Dr Seward being the clinical psychologist, Arthur being the well off vengeful husband etc.

One problem I did have with the book was that I found one or two sentences to be a bit wordy, but as OP has said, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and put it down feeling happy at having finished a horror classic that I'd been meaning to check off my list for a while, but with a hint of disappointment at the adventure being over.",Kerl1310,2016-02-01T15:45:20Z,Dracula,COMMENT

43owab,"I agree with your assessment. This book is great when Dracula is actually in it, which is surprisingly little. The parts when he is on a ship, and the poor crew don't know what is going on, are especially chilling.

I think you have expressed what is wrong with the hero characters in a way that I was having trouble nailing down.  They are all angelically noble (this is the same problem I have had with some of Dickens's characters) and therefore respond to stress in the same way, which makes their constant worry get annoying even though it is well founded. Van Helsing especially seems to spend half his time mawkishly telling Mina how wonderful she is whenever she is worried about turning into a blood sucking vampire. I guess this relates to the various sexual subtexts that have been suggested for the novel, but I found this side of it harder to relate to. 

The epistolary format is another thing that I wasn't sure about. It works some of the time but I don't know why the whole bulk of the novel requires it. Often a character will say something like, ""What a long, tiring and dangerous day! And more tomorrow! Let me spend a few hours writing it all down in detail before I get some rest...""

The climax was also a little disappointing. [***spoilers coming***] The heroes have to race across Europe to beat Dracula to his castle. Dracula spends the time asleep in his box. They manage to catch and destroy him just in time. This final confrontation is only a couple of pages, so the real battle was not so much against Dracula but against the train and shipping timetables.

This all makes me sound like I hate the novel, which I don't. I liked it well enough and I'm always happy to read these classic horror stories which many assume have been bettered by their imitators, but often have not. My favourite in this category is *The War of the Worlds*.",toilet_brush,2016-02-01T18:23:28Z,Dracula,COMMENT
43owab,"I've read this book three times. The first time I was 17 and the last time was when I was 35.  The last time I read it was the most unsettling to me. 

Harker's captivity and escape built a slow oppressive anxiety in me as I read it. The horror of Lucy's oppression by the creature Dracula enraged me throughout its portion of the novel. 

The heroic exploits of Van Helsing, Quincy, and Dr. Stewart throughout the ordeal had me cheering their goodness and bravery.  

Renfield was a revolting creature that reminded us what would become of the world if evil creatures like Dracula were allowed to torment the innocent unabated.

Dracula feeding children to his harem of she demons and vampiric Lucy bringing a child back to her crypt set the tone of the novel and shows us that these creatures aren't human and don't deserve any of our sympathies. 

To me, if you allow your mind to wonder into the realm where such creatures can exist, the book is the scariest that I've ever read.

However, I think the element of the unknown the crewman in Dracula faced increased the tension they felt dramatically.

And as I said above, one of my major issues with Stoker was his emotional exposition, and, IMO, lack luster characters. But Lovecraft is no great character writer either.

Literary vampirism (distinct from folkloric vampirism which in Western Europe had its own heyday in the 18th century -- see all those great theological treatises with titles like ""On the Mastication of the Dead in their Graves"" &c.) had been in vogue for quite some time before Stoker's novel. See Polidori's 'The Vampyre,' which was the actual progenitor of the genre, and popular enough in its day to inspire not one but several operatic adaptations, and a work that Stoker was definitely responding to / ripping off. If memory serves, 'Carmilla' and the hilariously titled 'Varney the Vampyre' also predated 'Dracula' by a good deal. Not to mention the story of anonymous authorship called 'The Mysterious Stranger,' which I can't believe Stoker hadn't read, because its opening is practically beat for beat the very same as an opening incident in 'Dracula.' The story begins with a carriage, chased along a treacherous mountain pass by ravenous wolves.  A sexy vampire saves our heroes by commanding the wolves depart with a wave of his arm.

Sure it might have included some stereotypes on women according to the time it was written. But I find Stoker's writing to have been purely genius and even daring to the Victorian era's mindsets. 
Lucy's character was clearly the antonym of the ideal Victorian woman. She was a bold and curious girl and she was even described in erotical ways in some parts of the book. Instead of appearing as a child caregiver, once turned into a vampire, she preys on children! That kinda destroys the old fashioned idea that women should be so attentive to children and constantly look out for them. As creepy as it sounds, and yet it's an amazing idea...
Mina was a heroine, at last in my point of view. She was very clever and played a major part in Dracula's demise. She clearly helped the men build their plan to take him down. Even Van Helsing admits, at some point, that they probably would never have succeeded to catch Dracula if it wasn't for Mina's intelligent planning.

q9eww4,"Yea, there was actually a conception of the New Woman at this time as a part of early feminism. Mina at once both embodies and criticizes this concept, but criticizes it positively, saying that the New Woman should be even more capable and have more agency. There’s one line where Lucy and Mina say the New Woman would be appalled at how much they ate for lunch one day. And that “trained like a man” line OP quotes serves to show that women are equal to men, only excluded from the opportunities to demonstrate it.

Similarly, the “foreigner” reading OP gives is also a criticism of Britain. A lot of horror at this time was the progressive voice trying to come to grips with what so called civilized Europe was doing to the world. To answer OP’s question about whether this book is only famous for establishing vampire lore, it isn’t. It’s a criticism of the Age of Reason/The Age of Science. The Western Worldview is predicated on rationality and recording things, but Dracula foils all that. When Harker sets out on his journey he goes to the British Museum to see what’s on record and looks at Maps but can’t find Dracula’s castle anywhere, it seems to exist between 3 territories but isn’t actually plotted. This is like Dracula’s being the living dead. He blurs the line of categorization and as such poses an existential threat to the West which depends on this to navigate the world. It’s also why the color gray is a huge theme in the book. Seward refers to God as the Great Recorder who will look at his ledger and see if it is to profit or loss. Aka God is like a purely rational scientist and salvation is thought of in economic terms.

Of course he is. He is a Count. He literally is feudalism in the flesh. He has underlings do his bidding, whether by force or magic. Something that would have been obsolete in 19th century Western Europe.

*Here (in Transylvania) I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land (England), he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for.*

This line says it all - Dracula's about to leave his own fief, his kingdom where everyone has learned to fear him and his ilk for centuries, and about to embark on a journey to England, where he will be treated like anyone else, and where he no longer has power and control.

>Feudalism ended in the 1400s. Seems a bit odd that such a concern would have occurred to Bram Stoker in 1897.

But that's the point. Dracula *lived* in the 1400s and is still used to living that way even into the 19th century, because the novel tries to make it clear that Transylvania hardly changes. 

>I also hardly think any of the characters in the novel are 'enlightened' except for Professor Van Helsing and he is not superstitious.

Van Helsing does *not* have experience with vampires prior to meeting Dracula as far as I can recall. This makes his belief in vampires a ""superstition"". He has never encountered vampires before; merely heard of them, what they are reputed to do, and the means to destroy them.

>Feudalism existing in small patches in remote areas of Europe is not enough to convince me that Stoker would have been more concerned or interested in feudalism than he would have been in industrialism, capitalism or Marxism. I find it a big stretch that Stoker would have cared about these topics at all in writing the book.

I mean it's my analysis, not his. We will never be completely certain what Stoker himself had in mind while writing the book, we can only surmise. Nevertheless, there are some passages that refer to this dichotomy of the old, feudal world of Dracula and the modern, industrial world of Harker and the team.

For instance, we observe Dracula's initial anxiety about moving to the bustling cities of England, away from his kingdom where he held sway for centuries:

>Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me.  **Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to care not for.** I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should be master of me.

Then, Harker on later states his fears that, despite being technologically and culturally ""advanced"", contemporary England may not be invincible to the unknown powers that be:

>It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.

All in all, I think it is possible that Stoker did have some commentaries going on while writing it, but it was either only subconscious or secondary to the main point; the undead. In the end, I think it is still, like Godzilla, King Kong, or Call of Cthulhu, a cheesy monster story, and any analyses we try to conjure up of a presupposed deeper meaning behind the text are just theories.",virgin693838281,2021-07-06T00:50:12Z,Dracula,COMMENT
odc5ou,"I'd argue the protagonists were hardly religious, at least initially - in fact religion is the element they overlook, dismissing it as mere superstition but eventually finding out how it's the only thing that can be used to destroy Dracula.

But yeah, his seemingly incestous polyamory was definitely at odds with Victorian norms and was certainly used to heighten the exotic and grotesque aspects of the character.

It's fitting how the Count, a feudal warlord sorcerer used to seeing other people as lesser than and subservient to him, eventually realises this won't fly in a contemporary society that has adapted a more democratic system. People have learned to think critically, and question authority, and after they rekindle the relevance of ""old superstition"", are fully equipped to deal with him. Van Helsing, I believe, notes how Dracula's outdated views may be the flaw that they could exploit.",virgin693838281,2021-07-04T10:09:07Z,Dracula,COMMENT
odc5ou,"Certainly. While the Transylvanian people were used to identifying (and probably destroying) vampires, Dracula's status as aristocrat and scion of the respected (if feared) centuries-old Dracula clan held them back from taking action. Whereas modern England, which had supposedly evolved from this feudal age, is ill-equipped to deal with a threat it generally deems as mere fantasy. It takes a combination of both science and faith for the team of Victorian intellectuals to outwit him.",virgin693838281,2021-07-04T10:22:10Z,Dracula,COMMENT
29g92f,"I for one LOVED Dracula.  I love the format of letters, journal entries, and newspaper clippings, as well as the different points of view and how they come together.  I also enjoyed the prose, and the interplay between the theological and sexual undertones.  

I definitely sympathize with your frustration over the characters though.  They tend to make silly judgments, overlook important information, and are often *very* wrong about things they pretend to know a lot about.  Especially with Van Helsing.  When he first showed up, I thought of him as a funny little polite and educated foreign man.  But so much of what he said, even beyond his dreadful grasp of English grammar, made very little sense.  He claims to be a doctor, but his medicinal knowledge is often wrong and borders on malpractice (I mean, really, using *three* different blood donors, rolling the dice each time that the new donor won't have a blood type that will be rejected.)  He claims to be a Catholic, but he commits sacrilege by  profaning the Eucharist by crumbling it on the ground, drawing protective circles with it, even *mashing it up* into a paste to seal Lucy's crypt.  Seems fishy.

But I think the success of Dracula is in it's presentation.  It is presented not as a novel, not as a legend, not as fiction at all.  It makes no promises, it just gives you what's there--an eerie manuscript compiled by a ragtag band of folks facing something they don't understand.  So while I agree that they often just blunder about and screw up repeatedly, I think it lends some credence to that atmosphere of discovery--not just their discovery, but yours as the reader.  You are as entitled to interpret the manuscript as the characters are when they made it.  So if you realize something before they do, it pulls you in, makes you part of it, adds that infuriating level of irony.

Anyway, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it like you expected.  I just read it a few months ago and it is one of my favorites.",gravyboatcaptain2,2014-06-30T06:17:14Z,Dracula,COMMENT

29g92f,"lol three months late, but currently doing a reread and looking for discussion on Reddit. It wasn't the first time -- he'd been drinking her blood for the past night or two.

Basically, Dracula is using the group's silence, and intention to protect Mina, against them. Remember: the men, being manly men who wouldn't burden a woman with the knowledge, have not spoken to her about their plans or anything they've learned over the past couple of days. They have decided that she must be left out of this for her own good. It's the ""separate spheres"" ideal of the Victorian family (men and women live in different worlds, the man protects the woman and the woman comforts the man) taken to an extreme, and Dracula is using that ideal against them. Mina was completely aware of the entire story up until now. She was the one who transcribed and put together all the documentation they've got. She's the one who helped everybody make sense of their individual stories by putting them together. But she was also a woman, which, according to the Victorian sensibilities, meant that she was delicate and must be protected. So none of them will talk to her about their plans and what they've learned, and she assumes that her strange dreams about red eyes and sentient mist are just her own emotions running wild (because that's what, in Victorian ideas about gender, ladies do: have wild, uncontrollable emotions).

At the same time, Dracula was hypnotizing Renfield -- in Seward's notes, he mentions that twice, Renfield is unable to even say the word ""drink"" with regard to consuming life. From Mina's journal entries, her memory is fuzzy -- she assumes it's just that all the stories about ""red eyes"" and her concern over her husband's safety are making her see the candle flame as a pair of red eyes -- and Dracula hypnotizes her to prevent her from being able to say anything. Later, Mina is unable to talk about certain aspects of the ordeal at all except for a few minutes each day, at sunrise and sunset. Dracula has hypnotized her, and prevented her from talking to them and just telling them what's going on and what needs to be done to fix it.

It's partly horror, but it's also comedy of errors. Dracula is using the Victorian mores against them: those mores dictate that they make sure Mina is coddled and protected and completely cut off from any knowledge of what they're doing, and Dracula uses the fact that they're paying no attention whatsoever to Mina as a way to disrupt their plans.",lesspoppedthanever,2014-10-10T19:06:39Z,Dracula,COMMENT

I think, too, is the fact that horror has also changed a lot in the last century and so something that an Victorian reader might find scary just comes off as cheesy. 

I do think it's a great book and what you say is considered one of the reasons it's lasted so long while so many other books of its type have been forgotten: it's a fascinating window into the fears and concerns of Victorian readers: aristocracy vs democracy, superstition vs rationality, the rise of technology, women's rights, class relations, etc. ",marisachan,2018-02-05T17:19:30Z,Dracula,COMMENT

g4nprz,"We never get a proper origin story for Renfield, so it's hard to say what he was really like before he fell under Dracula's sway. Perhaps he was always unstable, and the Count exploited that, or perhaps he was a normal man before Dracula somehow corrupted him. At the very least, enough humanity remained within him to try to protect Mina.

As for Mina, the mark seems to have been a sign that she was beginning to turn into a vampire, so holy objects like a communion wafer burn her. The mark disappearing when Dracula is killed proves that she is freed of his corruption.

g4nprz,"I'm currently rereading Dracula and I thought it started out SO STRONG but tapers in the second half. In the beginning the framing device of the diaries really adds to the story, the fact that Dr. Seward records his by voice instead of writing allows for some interesting monologue that a person would probably never take the time to write down but might say if they are speaking aloud. Jonathan Harker's diary at the beginning kept me from putting the book down.
But in the second half, it gets really redundant and seems to slow down, and I feel the framing device turns against itself. Now that all the characters are intentionally writing diaries for the purpose of tracking Dracula, theres an awful lot of explaining when they are finding time to write and stating over and over that they will update the group with all the info. It just pulls me out of the story. Plus I miss Dracula, he is only really in the first 1/4 of the book.",marshmallowz7824,2020-04-20T12:35:07Z,Dracula,COMMENT

IIRC, he tries to warn her that the Count was targeting her.    


Mina was burned by the holy wafer because she was tainted by Dracula. It's unclear if she would have become a vampire unless he continued feeding on her until she died (like he did with Lucy), but by making her drink his blood she became connected to him (which is why she could be hypnotized to see through his eyes) and tainted with his evil.

d2htef,"I love Heart of Darkness. The language there is at least sufficiently lush and moody and deep to sustain the description. It's certainly not for everyone as it's very, very dense but not in the same way Dracula is (in Dracula, it's a product of the time imposed quite accidentally on a modern reader whereas Conrad's density is intentional and forcefully done). I find Dracula suffers from the problem OP says of description becoming repetitious but that's not true of Heart of Darkness where the jungle changes as they tread the river.

 I think Conrad's writing is so much better that's an unfair comparison.  Also not the same kind of story.  Unlike Dracula, which really is about the plot, Heart of Darkness is about the structure and journey.  The strength of Dracula OP mentions absolutely does not exist in Heart of Darkness.  If you're reading Conrad for plot, you're in for a disappointment for sure.  

Last of the Mohicans, though, is a good comparison. That's a great plot wrapped into a tedious book.  Probably better than Dracula in plot but more tedious in how it's written.

However, as I was reading I kept imaging someone reading the book a century earlier by candle/lamplight and imagined that it would be particularly scary for them.

I read the excellent Oxford World Classics edition of the novel, the annotations for which does a great job of highlighting the cultural context at the time which would have made the novel so frightening for a reader back then.

This sense of fear would have been shaped by the lesser understanding of science back in that century and the greater belief placed in organised religion and the supernatural. 

There is also an often cited view that the novel also plays into that sense of unknown about the rest of the world, even simply mainland Europe which to many people in the UK and Ireland would have been a relatively unknown and mysterious place at the time, shrouded in myths. If we think of Dracula as a foreign enemy, arriving by boat to strike fear into the heart of London.

An example which really stood out for me were the blood-transfusion scenes, in which Van Helsing and some of the other characters attempted to revive victims of Dracula. The annotated version explained that this was a relatively radical and dangerous medical procedure at the time, which would have injected an even greater sense of danger to those scenes.

mw79eg,"Aside from all of the other things people have already said, Dracula is a much better candidate for an iconic villain. Carmilla is Laura's friend, even though she ends up being dangerous, and Laura doesn't really want her to be defeated. Dracula is framed as a monster to be defeated more than a character who is beloved in some ways and dangerous in others. *Dracula* kind of created the vampire as we think of it today, whereas Carmilla's vampirism is sort of vaguely discussed, and the Van Helsing character shows up at the very end rather than being a part of the big hunt for the bad guy.

I really like both *Carmilla* and *Dracula* and I think in a lot of ways *Carmilla* is more interesting than *Dracula*, but *Dracula* is kind of a kickass story about a bunch of friends teaming up to defeat a monster and that's something that has a lot of potential for widespread success (and a ton of adaptations).",sybil_vain,2021-04-22T21:08:06Z,Dracula,COMMENT
mw79eg,"I recently actually read through the book. I think part of the reason is...Carmilla doesn't really feel like a threatening villain all things said. At least, not to me in my modern day senses. She's repeatedly described as languid, cowardly and shows no real outward malice (actually seeming quite fond of the main character and we're told through dialogue she's evil and manipulative rather than actions). The only thing that I feel she really had that would have been *seen* as villainous is she really didn't seem to like religion and ranted about it. When the truth of her ability is revealed, it's through a story of what happened to someone else we've never met, in which we immediately transition to confrontation and defeating Carmilla (which happens fairly easily). Simply put, Carmilla didn't have the stage presence that Dracula ended up having.

There's also the political issues. The main character and villain are....very lesbian. And the book is clearly trying to present that as a bad thing, it's very present throughout and I can see how in 1872, a lot of people would turn their nose up at it.

While this obviously doesn't mean she actually desires him and in a modern context would still be considered rape in a sexual analogy, I feel like those things could be interpreted as seduction.

Edited because I thought about it some more: I also disagree that Dracula is supposed to symbolize foreigners. I don't know if there was a general fear of foreign cultures taking over in victorian England, but I don't think Dracula would be a good analogy for that, because he doesn't really represent a culture: he is alone, his manners and beliefs (if he has any beliefs) are not shared by his countrymen, they fear him and avoid him. In my opinion, his actions don't reflect back onto his country of origin.

I found the beginning such a thrill, as well as the parts where Dracula is in London. The ending didn't fit for me, it just seemed a bit anti-climatic, especially since the chase through Europe was so drawn out. 

I do think Dracula, as a novel, suffers a little bit as nowadays the legend is so much bigger than the book. As someone brought up in the 90s, I already had a clear image of who I thought Dracula was before reading it.

8gkm0a,"I read the book a few years ago and was not that impressed. A friend had suggested it to me saying how scary it was but I mostly found it dull.

Take my opinions with a grain of salt because I have very little training in how to analyse books and only really started getting interested in classical stories about 4 years ago, so I'm not a pro at dissecting them or anything.

I, like you, enjoyed the part at the beginning in Dracula's castle. 

I also liked (if I remember correctly) the parts where it focuses on the mental patient that was obsessed with Dracula but other than that I found it a chore to get through.

One thing in particular that really pissed me off was how long the author would sometimes take to describe something of very little importance to the overall story. I think I remember almost a whole page or more dedicated to describing a door, not a special door with lots of relevance to the plot but just a fucking door. 

Sometimes it gave me the impression that the author just liked to show off how well he could describe things, the writing equivalent to 'loving the way he sounds' so to speak.

One thing positive I can say about the book is that it definitely surprised me a lot. A lot of my information about Dracula had come from other forms of media (film, TV etc) and it's quite bizarre how wrong they get the character and Van Helsing for that matter. I'm pretty sure I remember Dracula being described as having a long grey moustache in the book and yet you rarely see him being depicted with one in other forms of media. It was also quite the surprise that the whole book (or even the majority) did not take place in Transylvania.

Id probably only suggest the book to massive fans of Dracula as he appears in other forms of media, just so they could compare him to the original. ",sandervich,2018-05-02T21:46:09Z,Dracula,COMMENT

I'd like to comment I didn't think the ending was predictable. For the most part after [Spoiler](#Dracula left England I was in doubt whether they would succeed in stopping him or if Mina wouldn't flip. Eventually these doubts dissolved, earlier than I'd have liked I must say, but I wouldn't call it predictable.)

Another thing that struck me about the ending is [Spoiler](#Quincey's death. It didn't feel sad or good or anything, it just felt really odd. My guess is because we never got much insight into his character or foreshadowing that he would die. I'm not sure how that could be done, but if, say, Mina did flip in the end, I think it would at the very least not have felt so strange. It wouldn't be a token death like Quincey's.)

It's a Romanian peasant who gives Harker a crucifix that protects him in Dracula's castle, and the rest is (Dutch) Van Helsing.

But it was Halloween season this year and I like Dracula the icon/character, so started reading it in my downtime on my work computer.

&#x200B;

I agree with pretty much everything you said, bar the last sequence, which I'm just getting to. Jonathan in Dracula's castle is great, easily the best thing about the book so far.

&#x200B;

There have been things I liked since then (Renfield is pretty interesting, if a bit repetitive, too), but the middle section is definitely a repetitive, tedious mess overall. So much of characters unnecessarily fawning over each other, Van Helsing draws everything leading up to Vampire Lucy's death out sooooooo long, etc. 

&#x200B;

It does rub me a bit weirdly how Christian it is. Not even so much because of their fears of dying unholy vampires, but just in the inherent fact that Dracula is so staggeringly weak against any religious object and the frequent (especially as the book goes on) calls to God for mercy, deliverance, etc. Of course, once it's established that vampires are weak against religious artifacts it basically establishes that the Dracula world has a Christian God, so fearing dying an unholy vampire starts to seem a scarier prospect. ",Whiskeycloned,2018-12-06T15:58:57Z,Dracula,COMMENT
a3fq6d,"I agree that the Christianity in Dracula took some adjusting too. Maldevinine (previous comment) is right, that it would have been central to the life of the everybody reading novels at the time. One of the ideas that I find really interesting to consider when reading Dracula is that his very existence is a blasphemy. Blasphemy, to me as a modern athiest, has been a very difficult concept to grasp. Having insight into the horror and offence of blasphemy within this book was illuminating more broadly. It reminds me in some way of the controversy around Salman Rushdies' 'Satanic Verses'. The pain felt by so many in the Muslim community in reaction to that book (which was published in 1988, and was reacted with violence and Rushdie was issued a fatwa) is that it is blasphemous. This is like a religious crime, where the sacred is not just insulted, but violated. The fact that Dracula has come into being at all is an afront to God and therefore all of life, which is the real terror aspect of his monster status. The blood drinking and killing is vile, but the blasphemy of his existence is terrifying. It definitely requires quite a high level of suspending disbelief reading it as I have never had spirituality of any kind in my life. But religions, and blasphemies against them, still spark wars. Anthropomorphism it into one monster is easier to understand? Or at least digest. (There's a blood sucking joke in there and I can't get it.)  


I agree as well, that the opening chapters of the book with Harker's stay at the castle are magnificent. I read all the way to the end because of the quality of that writing. Although, I hated the way Stoker made the very slow corruption of Lucy drag on and on including multiple POV's of the same events. It does make it feel longwinded, and then the end is much less climactic because of this? I despise the sexism surrounding Mina's character, and Lucy. Although I managed it because of the publication date. (To be honest, Mina is almost identical to modern ""strong female characters"" written today, but that's a whole essay right there?)  


And I have to say, I really enjoyed the way Stoker collected the writings of many people to piece together the story. I listened to it on Audio book, with many actors creating the voices of each POV. I imagine this made it easier going, and I've never managed to get to the end of the text in print. I really, really, loved the Ships log. It's a good, scary bit of horror. When the ship wrecks and that guys strapped to the wheel, and there's nobody left alive on board it's truly horrifying. I think this was emphasised by the fact it felt like a piece of evidence that had just been uncovered.  


One thing I struggled with MASSIVELY was why in hell is Dracula trying to get to England? I must have fallen asleep during a chapter, (audio book) but I would really have cared a lot more about Dracula's terrible quest to claim Lucy? Why did Dracula need Harker? Why was he moving to Whitby? All the fiddling about with tons of earth on the ship and hiding them in an old house would have mattered more if I knew what he was trying to achieve?

Well, right now most of the literature about vampires tend to portray them in a much different manner... in a romantic manner, even (see Anne Rice, Vampire: The Masquerade, the Underworld series, Twi...gah, you know what I mean). As we lose faith in an afterlife, the thought of becoming an eternal ""living dead"" seems to have lost a lot of its dread and to have become a conduit for people's fantasies about vanquishing aging and death. It seems to me the few Vampire movies and stories that portray them as things to fear in recent years tend to rely on gore and the good old fear of death, making vampires a monster like a savage animal more than something that inspires spiritual dread.

• He tells the female vampires in his castle multiple times that Jonathan belongs to him, and is all his for the first night before they can get in on the action - he’s not going to kill Jonathan, he must be sexually assaulting him.

• Dracula literally looks at Jonathan and says ‘Yes, I too can love’

• Jonathan observes Dracula sleeping, and touches his sleeping body while using words associated with phalluses like ‘swollen’ ‘bloated’ etc.

• vampire’s teeth, hunter’s stakes etc. are all phallic imagery

• Stoker supposedly based the character of Dracula on Oscar Wilde, whose trial for homosexuality was a huge deal shortly before the novel was written. Wilde and Stoker both came from Dublin, and Stoker even stole Wilde’s first girlfriend!


**Dracula isn’t gay, because he’s not a real person. He represents (in part) the danger of sexuality that are faced by women as well as men, and as such is a shape-shifting bisexual demon from a time of great sexual repression and rampant spreading of disease due to rising prostitution, which Stoker himself partook in and died of.**

But it also includes other aspects of sexuality like promiscuity, polyamory and incest. Dracula also touches on the fear of ""reverse colonization"" from the East and gender equality in the form of the ""New Woman"" who eschews traditional Victorian gender conventions.

About Victorian upper-class people who are skeptical of mythology and the supernatural (though religious) coming face to face with a monster straight out of mythology, having to embrace old superstitions and band together to defend then modern society from the curse of a monster from another era.

If you read something else into it, fine, but understand that this might be meaning you inject into the work and not meaning you extract out of it, and as such may say more about you than it does about the work you're analyzing. This reminds me of the case in the 80s when Tipper Gore (Al Gore's wife) was accusing the Twisted Sister song ""Under the blade"" of being about and promoting self-cutting, bondage and rape. In a famous testimony before a Senate committee, a member of Twisted Sister testified that the song was not about self-cutting, but about surgery and the fear of letting surgeons cut into you.

On the contrary, the words in question are about surgery and the fear that it instills in people. … I can say categorically that the only sadomasochism, bondage and rape in this song is in the mind of Ms. Gore.*""

I think the same is true of a lot of literary analysis: a lot of it reveals more about the mindset of the analyst than that of the author or of other readers of the work.",kchoze,2018-12-06T16:58:40Z,Dracula,COMMENT
7nkrpd,"I think children were seen in a different light then. Child labour laws were only just coming into place when Dracula was written (if you count banning children under the age of 9 working as a law...) and child/infant mortality were higher. Children were also to be 'seen and not heard'.

It's likely that Stoker didn't interact with many children, and didn't see them in the same light we do today - we are much more inclined to treat children as little adults, worthy of listening to etc.

Anyway this is all conjecture/based on the little context I know of the times. Maybe he just hated kids!!",elphie93,2018-01-02T07:28:38Z,Dracula,COMMENT
6efcpi,"I first encountered *Anno Dracula* when it was still a novella entitled *""Red Reign""* in The *Mammoth Book of Vampire Stories.*

At the time I was most interested in it because it featured Geneviève Dieudonné, finally decorated with the accents her name lacked in all of her appearances in Newman's fiction for Games Workshop, but when the Titan Books editions of the novels came out recently, I avidly devoured *Anno* and *The Bloody Red Baron*. Like yourself, I found *Dracula Cha-Cha-Cha* less engaging, though I did enjoy the Bond references and the Superman connection.

*Johnny Alucard*... is a bit of a mess, honestly. It's not properly a novel and it's really a collection of short stories that Newman's edited together with more linking material. While it's fun to revisit Geneviève and spot some more 80s/90s cultural references - Newman's text is never not going to be fun as an exercise in ""Did You Spot?"" - the story isn't quite as good as the first two. 

You can certainly feel Newman's passion for film and literary trivia, but I feel that he seems more invested in the Victorian/Georgian periods of *Anno Dracula* and *The Bloody Red Baron* than in the later timezones.

If you've enjoyed his work on Anno et al, I strongly recommend [Moriarty: Hound of The D'ubervilles](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10635411-professor-moriarty?from_search=true). The secret memoir of Col. Sebastian 'Basher' Moran, big game hunter and chief henchman of the Napoleon of Crime, Professor Moriarty, written in the style of Conan Doyle's Watson and Holmes.

And if you don't mind 'gaming' fiction, see if you can lay hands on Newman's writing as ""Jack Yeovil."" Especially his [Demon Download](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkFuture) *warning: TVtropes link* series for GW's now-defunct board game 'Dark Future.' It's a similar mashup of genres and alt-history, being described by one reviewer as:

4yemss,"I actually took an elective class in college on Vampire mythology, and we spent a good two or three weeks just on Dracula. From what I recall (and it's been several years), Dracula was kind of the first horror novel that inspired readers to ""route for the bad guy"", even thought that was not at all Bram Stokers intention and it was some years before that really evolved into the fully romantic Gary Oldman type Dracula we get today. 

People like Dracula. He doesn't kill his victims (not always anyway). Instead he brings them into his world where you never age, you never get sick, you never die so long as you stay away from Van Helsing, and the suffocatingly conservative values of Victorian society don't really apply to you anymore. Obviously that's going to strike a chord with some people and they're going to start thinking ""maybe Dracula isn't so bad"" and ""maybe VanHelsing should just mind his own buisness"". And that's how we start getting the increasingly charming and charismatic Draculas that we have now. 

Arguably all modern vampire books/movies in the West owe their existence, in part, to Dracula. Even your Twilight vampires that sparkle in the sun and only drink ethically sourced deer blood have more in common with Dracula than they do any vampire story that came before.

9l4dnt,"*Dracula* is roughly as real as *The Da Vinci Code*. Yeah, there really was a guy named Dracula (or something that could be Anglicized like that), and the book really does reflect his reputation in popular history but that was partly due to politics between then and now and the real story is more complicated... and that's about as far as the similarities go.

This article makes it look like *Dracula* was censored to cover up the fact that it was true, but the editor's rejection probably had a lot more to do with the fact that Jack the Ripper was active less than 10 years earlier. I'm pretty sure no serious historian entertains the idea that Jack the Ripper was actually a vampire. The article makes it look like the Dmitri's cargo of ""crates of earth"" was mysterious. I don't know much about sailing ships, but I believe they often use something called ""ballast.""

I thought that *Dracula: the Un-Dead*, co-authored by Dacre Stoker (Bram's great-grandnephew) was OK as fan fiction goes. It ""retcons"" important parts of the original novel to be more consistent with the Hollywood version (burning in the sun, mainly), and makes several other changes that just weren't there in the original.

1ln0lh,"The following is my personal take on an established genre and not meant to be a published thesis or anything. It's just recounting bits and pieces of what I've picked up reading about the history and contemporary reception of some of my favourite books.

Well, when Dracula first came out in 1897 it wasn't the cultural phenomenon that it is now known to be. It received praise from critics but wasn't a widespread success in terms of notoriety or sales. The massive popularity came later after the film versions of the story were released (most notably 1922's silent film *Nosferatu*). Dracula is a novel combining previous vampire stories and lore and is part of a longer history of a particular genre. 

The Gothic Fiction or Gothic Horror genre had been around for awhile and most scholars agree that it began with the novel *The Castle of Otranto* by Horace Walpole in 1764. 

Ann Radcliffe was another author who had a huge influence on the genre. She published a number of Gothic novels in the 1790s and really solidified the genre. In her time her novels were widely read but there was still a stigma around the genre. Very little is known about her actual life and when she was alive rumours abounded about her sanity (likely not true). Sort of like how mainstream media sometimes likes to paint Stephen King as a creepy guy (at least back when he was beginning to garner fame).  

There was a large debate going on about the affect that reading these types of novels had on society. Particularly the influence that they had on young impressionable women (presumably the largest audience for these novels in the eyes of the literary critics, although they were read by pretty much everyone). 

All you have to do is look at *Northanger Abbey*, published 1817, to see how important these issues were to society at the time and how seriously the concerns voiced by those professing morality (such as literary critics and religious ) were taken even decades after. It is a novel written by Jane Austen parodying Ann Radcliffe's novels, the Gothic genre and the way it influences younger women (Austen was a fan of Radcliffe's writing so her novel is more poking gentle fun and raising relevant questions than outright condemning it).        

I read somewhere that when *The Monk* by Matthew Gregory Lewis was published in 1796, people (librarians, older family members) would go through the book and cross out any passages that they deemed to be offensive in order to protect the impressionable youth who may stumble upon it.

The backlash against these novels is actually incredibly similar to the arguments brought against violent videogames or graphic movies today. People argued that when you read these types of terrifying novels you would get a rush, and eventually you would need larger and larger doses to get that rush, so that eventually readers would pursue these horrors in real life. There was a real concern about how these texts would affect the very moral fiber of society.

That is also where you get so many of these worn-out tropes. They originated in these first novels. The ""found text"" that was ""translated"" from another language and describing events that occurred in foreign (outside of England) lands. These novels were so frightening to contemporary readers that to really enjoy the terrifying events taking place in the Gothic novels the author had to place the reader a safe distance away from their audience. 

Still, a lot of these authors, such as Matthew Lewis were denounced as being sick, twisted lunatics. The genre was aligned with radical thinking and behaviour. These early novels came out during the same time period as the political upheaval in France and the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and numerous aristocrats. It was a very politically charged time.

Reading was also somewhat of a social pastime. Everyone would gather around and read novels aloud to one another. It was oratory rather than individual. Printing books at this time was a costly expense so one copy was often passed around and shared.  

I'm not going to profess to be an expert in historical technology and lighting but people were not necessarily connected in the myriad of ways that technology enables us to be in modern society. It was darker outside at night, homes in a lot of places were far more isolated. News and transportation traveled much slower and were not as reliable.

There was also a lot more superstition and lore infused into everyday life. At the beginning of the Victorian period you have alchemists and at the end of it you have scientists. There was a huge amount of social, cultural and scientific change and progress during this time.       

By the time the Victorian period rolls around and Dracula is published, Gothic fiction has become an established literary genre. However the fears that it explores are tailored to the current social and political climate. The rise of technology and the fears it brings along with it, Darwinism, the corruption of society, xenophobia, the ""Modern Woman"" (linked to the women's rights movement), all familiar themes that have been explored in relation to Dracula before by literary scholars.

Personally, I think it would be awesome to go back in time and experience what it would be like to read Dracula in the time it was written - or any other Gothic novel. Readers back then had a completely different relationship to the text because it was often a *shared* experience. Imagine reading aloud a particularly horrifying passage - you are introduced to and experiencing the fear of this scene at the same time as those around you. Similar to watching a horror movie and feeling your own fear rising as your friends' terror begins to influence your own state of mind.

As **LadyLark** said before, I think sitting in a darkened room lit only by candles or a flickering fire and reading these stories aloud among a small gathering of friends and family would make the stories seem far realer and so much closer to home. 

I hope I shared some interesting information. It's just my own thoughts on what people may have felt/thought when these types of books were first published. I'm not professing to be an expert.            ",VendingMachineKitten,2013-09-03T23:24:56Z,Dracula,COMMENT

And most of the reaction we have on record of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is speculation over who really wrote it because...a woman?!? Really???

1ln0lh,I read Dracula as a teen and was terrified by it. I also like horror movies but they mostly rely on grossing you out or cheep frights. Don't remember one that was really scary. So I would guess that the answer to your question is yes and relevant even today. ,CyclingM,2013-09-03T18:47:14Z,Dracula,COMMENT
1ln0lh,"What I've found with novels early on in the genre compared to horror today is that today horror (especially movies) seem to be all about shock value.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that people have seen just about everything, so not much shocks people anymore, so it's all about gore or cheap scares, etc.  

But I like going back to classic horror because people often wonder what made things like Dracula or Frankenstein ""horror,"" and it's because what is truly scary is what unnerves you.  It is scarier on a more basic level than cheap scares because it is more lasting.  It's an idea that gets under your skin and stays with you, essentially haunting you.  That's a real haunting, not what's offered to us in theaters today.  Shelley got that.  Poe got that.  Stoker got that.  

An example that I always use when I try to explain this to people is from Frankenstein.  Spoilers! if you have not read it.  Think back to when Victor Frankenstein explains and describes in pretty great detail over and over how he was raised from childhood with Elizabeth as brother and sister.  She IS his sister, albeit adopted.  They grow up and it is accepted that they will marry; a betrothal of sorts.  After the monster feels betrayed by what is essentially his maker and father, he explicitly tells Victor that ""he will be with him on his wedding night.""  Then, after knowing this and being reminded of it again by the monster, instead of doing something about it or warning Elizabeth, he tells her that he has something important to discuss with her THE NIGHT AFTER THE WEDDING.  The night AFTER he KNOWS the monster is going to do something.  All of this has to stem from something either consciously or subconsciously because he does not want to go thorough with the wedding.  Why?  Well what happens on the wedding night?  Consummation of the wedding.  Everyone reading this who has a sibling, do one thing for me right now: real quick, close your eyes and imagine you and your sibling having sex.  Couldn't do it, could you?  BECAUSE THAT IS HORROR.

I would argue that novels like these are still absolutely horrific to contemporary writers and readers and filmmakers and everything, because the ideas are still basically horrifying, it's just a matter of attention spans.  I think people are so used to shock value that they might be bored by these authors, which is a shame.",IAmSherLocked12,2013-09-03T22:44:45Z,Dracula,COMMENT
1ln0lh,"I agree with this. Reading Dracula (or any horror story for that matter) in the middle of a city on an e-reader in 2013 is obviously not going to be scary.

Rewind to 1900, you live on a farm out of sight of any other houses, you have heard almost nothing about vampires before and obviously know nothing about the story itself. You are reading it at night, with no background television or lights outside. Throw in the fact that it is 1900 and you are probably a little bit superstitious and the idea of a demonic force at work is not something laughable to you and it would be scary.

2y56kz,"I took a Horror film and fiction class once, and these two works were at the heart of the content, as most horror genres, in both mediums, focus on some type of aspect of vampirism or monstrosity. The Victorian Era especially gave rise to the very real fear of the ""animal"" or ""vampire"" or ""monster"" within. Works like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jane Eyre, and even Barie's Peter Pan saw the cultures near obsession with this concept.  This ties into animal studies as well. So many connections to be drawn from the fears that non-humans and human animals are related. Very cool stuff.

z3aqav,"Wrong. The first interaction with humans is with Viktor himself, and the first thing Viktor does is pass out at the site of the creature before running away for three days. Charming.

The next humans he comes across is a man in a hut on the edge of the woods, who shrieks at the site of the creature, terrified, and runs off. Then the creature comes across a village full of people who do the exact same thing and run at the site of him. That's when the creature realizes humans ain't it and decides to not interact with them. THEN he comes across the family in the hovel at the edge of a town--only it's not a blind daughter, but a blind father.

Yes, he lives in their wall (kind of) and spies on them. Yes, he steals from them and they're already poor. But he also doesn't know what poverty or economic hardship is, and once he does, he starts doing shit for the whole family like a secret monster fairy godmother. He ""Days of Their Lives"" their asses and watches them to learn everything Viktor failed to teach--about human society, culture, language, literature, history, social relationships, family dynamics, and how he fits, (or rather doesn't fit), into all of it. 

He reads books and it deepens his desire to integrate with humanity. After months of secretly living next to this family, he tries to have a conversation with the blind father, and even tho the two are getting on well, what happens? The family returns home and the son and daughter chase the creature off before even speaking to him because he looks grotesque. 

The straw that breaks the camels back? He finds notes in his coat pocket that belong to Viktor, written shortly before the creature's creation, detailing the disgusting and horrifying nature (see: made of corpses) of the creature. He also sees how disgusted his own creator is with his creation. 

At what point is the creature given a chance to survive peacefully? He is an aberration of nature, human yet not, despised by everyone he meets, yet desperate to belong. Should he just spend a miserable life parallel to humanity, always yearning for more? Or should he just abandon civilization and fuck off into the night? But also, why SHOULD he go peacefully into the night? Humans who cross paths with him seek to destroy him for simply existing. His creator hates him. He has every right to hate humanity right back, in its entirety, yet he saves his hatred for his creator, and though he kills others, he does so to torture Frankenstein, thus putting their lives on his conscience.

I am not saying Frankenstein's creature is Good, by any means, but I'm not comfortable calling him Evil, either. He is a singular entity at odds with a world that wants nothing to do with him, a spark of creation openly spurned by its creator.

lqvxk8,"It's much easier and less controversial to make a movie about a scary ""monster"" who is simply a monster. That Frankenstein created the monster, who actually has a predisposition to love, curiosity, kindness, and social belonging makes it a narrative on questions about identity of the self and morality in general. 

The true climax is not that Frankenstein made a creature that then ravished the world in violence, it's that he comes to question if he has a moral duty to provide an equal, a companion, to the monster, and eventually how he decides to sacrifice everything for the safety of humanity by destroying the second creation before it is complete. That destruction seals his fate with the monsters, and his price is a life of torment and suffering. It was originally subtitled: ""or: a modern Prometheus"" and I argue that it was this destruction of the second creature which made Frankenstein the modern Prometheus, as Prometheus gave the gift of fire to man and suffered eternal punishment from the gods for the transgression. Frankenstein likewise spares humanity of a race of hideous and potentially deadly monsters but loses everything for it.

lqvxk8,"So the first Frankenstein film from 1931 was practically made as if the story was told via the telephone game. It was adapted from a play that was adapted from the book. And apparently the play took a lot of artistic license - she was the origin of the monster being named Frankenstein. But the 1931 film does have similarities to the book - Elizabeth is still there, the creature is afraid of fire, and there is humanity in him. He is very child like in his naivety. 

The film is received well! By June 1932, it had grossed $1.4 million. So studios want to build on that success and make more Frankenstein movies. But there's no other Frankenstein book, so now they are basically writing fan fiction of an adaptation that was already pretty much fan fiction. (No hate on fan fiction! But that's kind of what's happening here.) 

They're making it up, and they decide the next thing should be a lady creature. So they make Bride of Frankenstein in 1935.  So now, the creature is a monster film character that is moving farther and farther away from Shelley's novel. They want to make sequels or other films with this successful character and they have to keep the audience interested by upping the ante. They make The Ghost of Frankenstein in 1942, Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man in 1943, The Curse of Frankenstein in 1957, and the Evil of Frankenstein in the 60s.

By that point, Frankenstein as the film creature feature is more dominant in popular culture, as it is an iconic image that is on posters, in magazines, Halloween costumes, etc. 

I would recommend Branaugh's version for accuracy. His portrayal of Victor is wild and dramatic... But Victor was wild and dramatic.",natelyswhore22,2021-02-24T05:18:02Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,">It seems the monster is not a monster at all. He feels and thinks.

Have you actually watched James Wale’s 1931 Frankenstein or ‘35s Bride of Frankenstein? Or do you just have a vague conception of them from popular culture.

While they make serious edits and changes to the narrative the idea of the monster being a tragic and misunderstood figure was pretty central to those adaptations. And while Bride certainly embellished things even further, parts of the book that were left out of the original such as The Monster’s “friendship” with the blind man in the woods are reintroduced. As is his need for companionship. Together 31 and Bride offer a pretty complete picture of Shelly’s Frankenstein in theme and character even if some of the plot details get changed.

Sure once the Universal Monster version had moved past those initial films into never ending sequel territory like Frankenstein Vs The Wolf Man or Abbot and Costello Meet the Monsters things went way off the books. But that happens with cheap cash ins.

Also while there was some unnecessary violence introduced and its quality is somewhat up for debate, Kenneth Branagh's 1990s version with DeNiro as the monster, much of that film remained even more faithful to the book.",Brad3000,2021-02-24T07:58:38Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"I was absolutely floored when I first read Frankenstein (the original 1818 edition). It still blows my mind that Mary Shelley was only 18 when she wrote it. It’s an amazing novel, and one of my favorites to this day. I think a lot of the issues surrounding the adaptations were brought up in another comment, because the original version of the novel really is aggressively atheistic (which would make sense because Mary Shelley was the daughter of two of the most well-known radical activists of the time - her mother was Mary Wollstonecraft, often considered by a lot of people to be the mother of modern feminism), and the parallels that the monster (or Adam, as he names himself, which I love to call him) sees within himself to Satan while reading Paradise Lost. Obviously changes had to be made when people adapted the story, and Shelley added some of those revisions to the 1831 version of the text, but man... that original 1818 story is so good. It’s a tale of hubris, seeking your own meaning to life, and quite honestly, there are some amazing depictions of multiple kinds of depression too (which makes sense, as well, because Mary Shelley struggled with depression and I believe she even had either a miscarriage or a stillbirth right before she wrote the novel).

I still have hopes that one day we can really see a true adaptation of the original novel rather than the pop culture version. The closest we got was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein in the 90s with Robert De Niro but that still missed the mark in several places. I think the only way to really do the story justice is to make it as like a miniseries or something, with 5 or 6 one-hour episodes to really do the density of the text justice.",trans_pands,2021-02-24T13:16:39Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"Mary Shelley believed that all humans were human. At the time, there were (among white British people) two prevailing scientific theories about human development. One was that white Europeans were human, evolved from ape species, and that Black people were a 'missing link' between white Europeans and ape species (i.e., that Black people were an inferior step on the evolution to white Europeans). The other prevailing scientific theory was based in Biblical interpretation; all people were descended from Adam and Eve, and that differences in skin color and facial features between people were due to environmental differences.

Shelley herself was heavily influenced by her parents,  William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Godwin was an abolitionist and believed in equality; he thought the slave trade was evil, that Black people were human beings with equal rights, and wrote stories and did journalism about the slave trade. Mary Wollstonecraft shared these beliefs, and was also a feminist; she wrote ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman."" Mary Wollstonecraft died when Mary Shelley was very young, but her mother's writing influenced her.

The 'Creature' in 'Frankenstein' represents Mary Shelley's observations of how we dehumanize others, and treat people that are human as less than human based on their origins. The story is about slavery. In the end, the Creature fights back against the evils of his master and creator, and no one is left better from the experience.

This understanding of the story isn't merely a modern take; the piece is an allegory about the central evils of oppression in her time. To me, it's no surprise that other audiences didn't see the evils of Slavery in it. Frankenstein's creation is a slave, and it doesn't surprise me that modern renditions of the story rendered the slave as the evil one in the story.",effdot,2021-02-24T16:13:48Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"That’s entirely the premise of the book in my opinion. You absolutely nailed it. That when it comes down to it, the monster has more heart and soul than a born human and the humans in the story are the real monsters. They are cruel, brutal and uncaring. It’s very interesting to look at Shelley’s personal experiences with family after reading this too and draw comparisons to that dynamic. Also the time in which she was writing. I might be looking at it too deeply and it could just be a good story she wrote with encouragement from friends but most authors draw from experiences and I felt that those themes came through particularly strong in story. 

Im sorry to sound like a bit of a hipster or high brow, but I think Hollywood has adapted it over the years because they new that those themes were too hard to access for the public en masse and it was much easier to portray a monster as a monster. I’m talking about the very early adaptions. And since then the iconic evil “FRANKENSTEIN!” Has carried through. Most people wouldn’t know that Frankenstein is the maker and not the monster himself unless they’d read the book.

lqvxk8,"It is a pet peeve of mine when Frankenstein’s creature is referred to as a monster. It has been years since I read the book, but I don’t think Shelley ever uses that term to describe the creation. It’s a monstrous act of creation/science and how it’s abandoned ugh breaks my heart!! The arrogance just grinds my gears.

Also, I’d love to see a film/TV adaptation where they visually depict Frankenstein’s creature as horrible as it’s described in the novel. All adaptations I’ve seen give the creature a softer look than what my imagination depicts....",Tuck6107,2021-02-24T03:41:08Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"Well, first off, consider how long it takes to read a novel, and Frankenstein in particular. It's language is extremely ""lofty"" and dated. Now consider reading it in the time it takes to watch a movie. You just can't do it. We're not supposed to experience books that way. So, most novels must be greatly simplified or otherwise excerpted in order to fit into the length of a film. Frankenstein is so layered. It would be quite a feat to capture all the narratives in one film.

Plus, movies are a completely different experience from books. They are designed to be experienced in a few short hours, and move at the same pace for every viewer. I am a huge movie buff, but a movie is a short-lived experience. Books allow us to ""live"" in that world for quite some time.

As far as the text itself, it sounds like you got it! Who is the monster? The man who built a creature from corpses just to say he did it? Or the misunderstood, abandoned creature itself?",,2021-02-26T21:20:04Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

The public reaction to the book further highlights this: so many people fear the monster lurking in the darkness, coming south from the Arctic to hide in their attics. 

I’ve never seen any of the movies, only how they are portrayed in other parts of pop culture. I came away from the book heartbroken and disgusted with the portrayal of humanity in the book. Upon thinking further I would find myself simply disgusted with humanity. The reaction to the monster is the same reaction to anything *new* and *different*.

lqvxk8,"I read Shelley's Frankenstein with the pop-culture version of the story ingrained in my mind, and I was actually pretty surprised with just how different the two versions of the story are -- namely how in Shelley's, the monster has a real psyche with complex emotions and thoughts, whereas the pop-culture version of the story doesn't really give the monster many psychological layers, if any at all.

It's definitely not impossible for pop-culture to shift the perception of the story closer to Shelley's original vision, but I think that the modern day story has a lot to do with taking something that's seen as having market potential and morphing it in order to make it easier to sell. I mean, a funny-looking green guy with bolts sticking out of his neck will probably have a much wider appeal when Halloween comes around every year rather than the original story, for better or for worse. That's just my view on why the two versions of the story are so different. I personally prefer the original Frankenstein from a thematic perspective, but to each their own!

lqvxk8,"I don't actually know, I'm just guessing, but my theory is this:

The book is not a nice book. It makes some really, *really* dark assumptions about human nature, stuff that Victorian society wasn't exactly comfortable with. So it makes sense that the book wasn't exactly table conversation when it came out. It was a good book, but people weren't really ok with discussing grave robbing, man's inhumanity to man, or the idea that a well-to-do family would produce a charming sociopathic vivisectionist obsessed with infringing upon the purvue of a jealous deity. At least, not at the dinner table.

So of course there would be bastardized, white-washed versions of the story floating around, ripe to be repeated to simple audiences at bars and parties in place of the actual, morally difficult story in the book. Especially the part where a man (mortal, non-divine) is capable of creating Adam, who is objectively better than merely human (thus outperforming the christian God in terms of creation). What Man creates must necessarily be inferior, if the priests are to be believed. Adam must have been flawed, or it becomes blasphemy.

By the time the first movie was produced, one of the major social causes of the day was the treatment of morons and simpletons (their terms) in asylums. That man's creation must be flawed was considered necessary; that audiences might sympathize with a shy yet terrifying simpleton was an angle chosen to sell tickets. Adam was stripped of all pretense of civility, made feral and stupid, but they were smart enough to leave him his *humanity* despite that (otherwise he would just be a boring sort of monster).

And so the story becomes a case-study in the failures of man at playing God, and the failures of the flawed offspring of that exercise to integrate in our world. Victor became a madman rather than a disappointed dreamer, because who else but a madman would dare to create life? And the villagers became terrified rabble because, politically, it was seen as useful to make the hamfisted point that Adam must have fared better in the dungeons of an asylum than out free in the world able to bother righteous folk.

And in its way, it's a perfect moral tragedy. Man's reach exceeds his grasp, and so his offspring is stuck as a clan-less alien in a hostile world because of it. Rather than an unflinching look at obsessive drive leading to dark ends, it became a religious morality play on the silver screen because that's what audiences--and investors--wanted to see.

Edit: accidentally posted early.

Cont'd: Remakes initially tried to capture the magic money-generation of the silver screen, rather than the spirit of the story. As it entered the zeitgeist, even filmmakers who knew better would stop themselves. People will pay more to see things they are already familiar with, and that's the Frankenstein that people had grown up with. It was what they expected, and so what studios thought they wanted. The movies rehashed the hyper-simplified, wildly inaccurate ideas of the first movie, because that's what audiences would pay for.",,2021-02-24T10:21:50Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Through the vehicle of murder and grotesquery, Shelley not only crafts an exquisite story of horror, vengeance and betrayal, but also expertly tackles the manifold themes of prejudice, responsibility, feminism, class warfare, child rearing, selfishness, ego, and the cycle of violence.

Whilst I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing the ""lowbrow"" Hollywood adaptations (I will always love Bride of Frankenstein) Mary Shelley's gothic masterpiece is so much more than a creature feature.",,2021-02-24T10:55:37Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
lqvxk8,"Hello OP, the reason for this change is due to early popular dramatisations of the novel. The novel quickly became fodder for popular entertainment at the end of the 1800’s and beginning of the 1900’s, particularly in British and other European music halls. These productions really leaned into the gothic horror elements of the story and due to the performances being staged in music halls, which tended towards melodrama, the productions largely skipped over the story’s more complex and subtle themes. This is the point where Frankenstein as a story became reduced down to more easily recognisable tropes such as the Byronic antihero with Dr Frankenstein, the dumb-show villain with the Creature, the love interest with the Bride and of course, Igor as comic relief. Early cinematic versions of the story built on these pre-existing horror melodramas, resulting in the dominant pop culture version of Frankenstein we have today.

Having Dr. Frankenstein punished for going against divine order by turning his creation into a ravaging monster is a moralization which took place even back then with the first stage adaptation in 1823, and led to Mary herself rewriting the story in 1831 to comply with those notions, to some extend.

Yes. That is entirely the point. Shelley was writing within the context of the early 1800s Romantic movement, so the horror is not the monster himself but how he came about - a perversion of Nature where a man gives birth.

Popular conceptions of *Frankenstein* are more than likely rooted in the Universal monster movies of the 1930s, so depictions often feature a big industrial lab with electrodes when no such thing ever entered Shelley's imaginings. Like how vampires were associated with opera capes for the longest time (also, the original *Dracula* had a mustache and walked in sunlight).",scythianlibrarian,2021-02-24T13:08:50Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

You must keep in mind that when she wrote the book, electricity was quite a new concept that still baffled scientists with its possibilities. This concept of galvanisation of human body to imbue it with Supernatural powers was a one of a kind idea many hap, which Shelly penned down as well. This is why Shelly's Frankenstein is considered to be one of the first sci-fi books to be published. The book version is a larger societal creature, a byproduct of man's curiosity, desire, and greed, and imbued with many of humanity's emotional responses to their surroundings. Hollywood chooses to ignore that and rather capitalise on the man-makes-monster trope and mint money.

Walton then hallucinated meeting the creature after the man died.

After learning more about Mary Shelley's life, it's less likely as it seems pretty clear that she was working through the grief of the death of a child and her upbringing and discussing the role that parents play in the upbringing of their children.

But I don't like it when people say that the movie isn't as good as the book.  True, it is very different.  But they both have the same theme and Boris Karloff is a genius. He really makes the monster relatable, as he shows how the monster feels and thinks.  The monster is not a monster at all is the theme of both.

lqvxk8,"Contextually, Frankenstein must be understood through the lens of Shelley’s main inspiration for the novel: Prometheus. In fact, the full title of the novel is Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus. The monster is a monster not because of the qualities of the being’s character, but because of the method of creation. Like Prometheus, who stole from the gods and was punished, Victor goes beyond what is considered human limitations by creating life.

Victor is aghast not because his creature is hideous outwardly (as many interpret and try making it into a novel about being nice to those who are different), but because he thinks he has sinned, so to speak, by playing god. The idea within the theological lens of the time was that humans, as creations, are not supposed to play creator.

The novel is incredibly philosophical, which doesn’t make the most interesting of stage plays or movies. So the characters are changed drastically for a different medium. But the novel itself can almost be read as a sci-fi horror, where a character does something no one thought scientifically possible, which brings about unintended consequences.

There was even an essay suggesting this in the edition I read. Personally, Victor is no saint, but he certainly is far from a monster. 

I emphasized with him more than I did Frankenstein. He is basically a man overpowered with an obsession for knowledge that breaks a line that should never be crossed before sacrificing his family and life to make sure he never does it again.

I honestly find it quite fascinating to go back to these characters, as it's quite interesting to see what ideas were present from the beginning and how those ideas were used (if they were used at all) to form the image they're known for today. It's kind of like how surprising it can be for people to listen to early Black Sabbath if you're used to the image of heavy metal music as fast paced music with someone screaming their lungs out into the microphone: you go in expecting that and then you get hit with a very slow, audibly blues influenced sound (albeit very downtuned) that leaves you wondering how the hell this sound turned into, say, Metallica or Avenged Sevenfold.",NemoAtkins2,2021-02-24T13:05:52Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"I have a little bit different take, although I agree with your point. Science and the ethics of dabbling in “God’s work” with the creation of life can certainly be debated. But I don’t find science the main culprit of what Frankenstein’s monster became as I do the sociological aspects of his upbringing. For all practical purposes, Dr. Frankenstein was the father of his creation. And like all children, his creation was looking to be loved. When he was shunned and cast out by his creator, he became the product of his loveless upbringing and the isolation that he endured by a society that shunned and hated him. I really believe that given a normal and caring upbringing, his creation wouldn’t have become the monster that he became. Prisons are full of people, that if raised in a loving and nurturing environment wouldn’t have arrived later in life the hardened and lost spirits they are. 

But that’s the beauty of great literature...it appeals to people in so many ways. This book has a really cool backstory too. I believe Shelley was the wife of a more famous (at the time) writer/husband and she wrote this story to entertain their friends while they were on vacation.

lqvxk8,"I agree. While I can think of a few versions where Frankenstein’s monster is out-and-out monstrous, most of them that I can imagine depict the monster as incredible sympathetic, usually the tragic hero of the piece. Granted, they typically make the story more about the dangers of mob mentality or on the emotional toll of being an outcast, but they certainly depict the monster sympathetically. I actually really like that about many of the adaptations, how each one uses the central premise of this “misunderstood outsider” character and draws different conclusions.

lqvxk8,"True. I get a little frustrated when people try to “point out” that Frankenstein, while not being “the monster” is “the REAL monster” as though the monster was angelic. Frankenstein is the catalyst for everything bad that occurs in the book, sure, and is one of the morally wrong characters, but the monster also commits lots of murder of innocent people for terrible reasons. Even taking into account the sympathetic reading and empathizing with his reasons, the fact remains that the monster is a highly intelligent creature that chooses to allow his mistreatment (and later his desire for a wife and children) become obsessive sticking points to the extent that he goes on to cause as much pain as possible to the man he believes responsible. His final dialogue in the book indicates this as well, that he devoted his entire existence to revenge and regrets it, just before going off and killing himself (or saying he would, though a lot of readings see him as probably too egotistical to have gone through with it).

Both Frank and the monster are terrible, terrible people with the intelligence and moral knowledge to know what they do in the book is wrong. Both are also sympathetic as to their motivations and reasons for doing those wrong things, but that doesn’t justify either, and just because the Doctor is a sack of shit and started things doesn’t mean the monster can’t be.",WeeweeFunAccount,2021-02-24T06:46:19Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"Yeah a face covering would not help Frankenstein,'s monster  or in a related note the Phantom of the Opera.  The monster was described as a hideously grotesque 8 foot tall brute with translucent taut skin that barely covered the workings of his muscles and arteries and watery eyes that almost matched the dun white sockets.  Guy would have to cover literally every piece of skin he had and wear sunglasses to hide his eyes and I guess say he was a basketball player to not stand out as a freakish monster.

Oh I know it wasn't mentioned but for the Phantom I mentioned his description was 

 

Erik is described as corpse-like and is referred to as having a ""death's-head"" (human skull) throughout the story. He has no nose, and his eyes are sunken so deep in his skull that all is seen are two eye sockets, except when his yellow eyes glow in the dark. His skin is yellowed and tightly stretched across his bones, and only a few wisps of dark brown hair are behind his ears and on his forehead.

His mouth is never described in as much detail, but is referred to as a “dead mouth” by Christine, and Erik acknowledges that his mouth is abnormal when lifting up his mask to display ventriloquism. He is described as extremely thin, so much so that he resembles a skeleton. Christine graphically describes his cold, bony hands, which also either feel or smell like death. There is debate among both English and French speakers as to whether the original French word used here, sentir, was intended by Leroux to mean ""smells like"" or ""feels like,” as the French word is used for both feel and smell depending on the context.

lqvxk8,"Sure, the 'profane' aspect can be seen in contemporary reception of the original story. There was a dedication to Shelley's father, William Godwin in the original release, who was a notorious radical figure in England at the time for a whole host of his own personal beliefs. As far as those related to the book, critics were wary of subversive, atheistic themes in the story, and that the very subject matter of a man making life from his own hand is ghastly. The Quarterly Review had this to say in 1818:

> ""Our taste and judgement alike revolt at this kind of writing, and the greater the ability with which it is executed the worse it is--it inculcates no lesson of conduct, manners, or morality; it cannot mend, and will not even amuse its readers, unless their taste has been deplorably vitiated.""

The Edinburgh Magazine said it was 'bordering too closely on impiety', and was perhaps even more dangerous than Godwin's works. If I recall correctly, the book released during the time there was great uproar about the vitalism movement (which I am in no way familiar enough with to articulate the exact impact which would've been inflicted on the book's reception), and the parallels drawn in Frankenstein quickly earned it a more sacrilegious air about the public. Certainly not everyone dismissed the story, and some early reviews were quite taken by it, but by and large it was a controversial release.

Thus, the first stage play of the book very deftly redirected the story into a version much more in line with what we're familiar with today in the classic monster movie, with a good bit more Christian moralizing from Frankenstein himself, who recognizes his transgression as profane, where he never even broaches the topic in the original text, which is almost entirely secular.

As for Shelley altering the 1831 text, I can't tell you all the differences off the top of my head, but it's thought that she was inspired by the adaptations of the story by then, and rewrote several speeches in the book to characterize Victor Frankenstein as a more explicit victim of great evils, being pushed by some compulsion to his creation, then recognizing his own impiety to his own horror afterwards, unable to protect himself and his family and friends from a cruel fate. The 1818 version gives him significantly more agency, by comparison. Allusions to contemporary and fringe sciences were also removed, distancing the text from controversial topics. I'm sure you can find an exhaustive breakdown online somewhere, I have not personally read the 1831 edition all the way through; the main takeaway is that Shelley seemingly looked to the popular stage play for inspiration in revising her work to respond/cater to more conservative audiences, which met her original story with a lot of backlash.

That's why, even though the 1831 text was the dominant one for many years, in recent decades the 1818 text has risen to popularity, being seen by many as a more faithful representation of Shelley's vision.

If you want to know more about such matters, the Second Norton Critical Edition of Frankenstein has a ton of supplementary material, which was what I primarily drew upon for this response, and my own general knowledge about the context surrounding the book.",Admiral_of_Crunch,2021-02-24T12:34:57Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

lqvxk8,"Not that I'm condoning what Frankenstein did, but it's not unbelievable in context.

Frankenstein is from a wealthy and respected family. He is horrified by his own creation, he only sees it as a monster and his own personal failing. So what is he going to do? Run around claiming he brought a pieced-together corpse to life and that the nanny didn't murder William, it was this creature he created months ago and didn't tell anyone about? He'd almost certainly be labeled insane and lose the respect of everyone around him, potentially damaging the reputation of his family as well. 

There's no reason anyone *should* believe him, he didn't have any real proof of his accomplishment. And say people did somehow believe him, then what? He's a mad scientist who played God and created a ""monster"". So he still runs the risk of damaging his family's reputation and being ostracized.

I'm not defending Victor's actions, he was unnecessarily cruel to his creation and took no responsibility for his actions, but at the end of the day I don't think it's out of character. Victor was a pretty vain individual. He picked out parts for the creature in an attempt to make it almost an Adonis-like figure. Then when the creature didn't live up to his expectations, rather than being impressed with the fact that he's quite literally created life, he was horrified and abandoned it. Even after being confronted and realizing the creature was intelligent he tried to hunt it down because he viewed it as a monster.

Thinking about it that way, I could absolutely see Victor neglecting to tell other people to prevent from being looked down upon, whether it's because they think he's insane or whether it's because they too are horrified by what he's created.

First by Victor, then the first common folk he comes across in the wild, and finally the DeLacey family, his pseudo-adoptive family that don't know they've adopted a monster, and promptly turn on him when they do.  

The Creature isn't human, yet he feels and thinks as a man would, desires companionship where none is to be found. This abberration of nature, which should not exist, and is absolutely and utterly solitary in its existence, is still cursed with the desires of a normal man. To feel wanted and needed and loved. Yet there is no one. The Creature is created and exists in a time and place wherein his mere existence is seen as evil, and he is treated as such. What sort of an existence can the Creature reasonably expect in a world that views him as, at best, a strange threat that should not exist, and at worst, an unholy beast that is innately evil?

I'm not disagreeing that the Creature does commit evil acts. He does. He kills Henry Clerval, Victor's best friend, and Elizabeth, Frankenstein's bride-to-be, out of spite when Victor refuses to make the Creature a bride of his own, and he kills Victor's brother out of anger and vengeance for being abandoned, and frames the housekeeper. All terrible things. 

But his only options are plead with a creator and master that wants nothing to do with him to make more, throw himself at the mercy of mistrustful humans (who have already tried to destroy him multiple times), flee humanity and live in eternal exile, or kill himself. And we go through them all to some extent. 

Sure, the Creature could have abstained from uneccessary bloodshed, but why? Why should the Creature see any value in the life of humans when they see no value in his? Why should the moral impetus be on the Creature, this thing that shouldn't exist and barely understands the wider world, and not the humans around him? No one even treats the Creature with a semblance of humanity, but we expect the Creature to show restraint when the rest of the humans in the book don't? Shelley does an excellent job of making the point that evil begets more evil, and the evil of men is often of their own making.",IrvineGray,2021-02-24T16:37:14Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

In all fairness, I have also done this as an artist and I get it. Tfw you spent so many hours hyperfocusing on crafting the perfect, shapliest nose and the most beautiful shining liquid eyes possible and you've never been more proud.

In it, The Creature is the sympathetic character, and it was the song “¿Quien Soy Yo?” (“Who am I?”) that made me feel the utter loneliness of The Creature from a lack of self-concept; without a past, without having had a family nor a childhood nor loving parents nor a sense of belonging anywhere.

Here’s a link to the song (sung in Spanish), I hope it works.

Frankenstein is only repulsed when he sees the monster's eyes open for the first time. 

The monster is a creation that should not exist in nature, so the contrast of the features which DEMONSTRATE life - eyes and lips - with the rest produces a repulsion and a horror. His life shouldnt be, so his lips are ""straight and black,"" and his eyes ""dun and watery"". 

It's THIS that people respond to - the fact that he is not a part of nature. That's the hideousness that sets the monster apart. 

And Frankenstein is also marked by this act- all his subsequent journeys are to get back to life and society but he can't because hes cursed. Not by the PRESENCE of the monster, but by his own soul which is set apart from nature too thanks to his actions.

He set up the girl but Victor knew she was innocent and did damn near nothing to help her. The creature then asked for a wife and then would leave society alone. At first Victor refuses and then decided to but then realizes its a bad idea and destroys her and the creature sees this. Thus creature basically says you killed my wife I will kill yours only Victor thinks that the creature will kill him not his wife so he only protects himself (this doesnt make it his fault she died and she did not deserve to die either).

w0i8n0,"Sure but it's the kind of debate a high school teacher assigns their class because it feels easy for them to grasp, and the actual goal isn't really to analyze that specific text but to hone the skills used to analyze media in general. Which is worthy usually, but falls apart here because Frankenstein isn't really about morality and certainly not a cautionary tale of mans hubris or whatever, and by focusing on that the point is entirely missed. It's an approach that makes the story so much less than it is. 

Frankenstein is about the horror and monstrosity of identity being inescapably tied to their body, and how social role are seemingly enforced by bodily imperative. In particular shelly draws on her own experience of that, being a smart, educated woman living in the 1800s in a society that views femininity as  deviant and Other and inherently defiled. 

I should at least briefly note here the tension between Mary Shelly's writing in Frankenstein and her mother's writing. Throughout A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft argues that Reason ought be the true source of culture, not gross physical nature; she present utopian vision of society as an androgynous one, where one's sex and one's body are only relevant at the points where society and biology actually intersect (sexual attraction, procreation, etc). Mary Shelly, unfortunately, never found that vision within her grasp, never able to escape the cruelty of a hyper pateraical society.  The themes of motherhood and sexuality and guilt and creation/procreation and defilement and death and how they're interlinked in the narative is the true meat of the text. It's why the driving force of the books conflict is how the creature is so utterly and thoroughly cursed, even in his own eyes, by the brutal reality of his own body. 

One of the issues with the morality tale view is in how it handles comparisons between Victor and Milton's Satan (especially those targeted at american highschool students). The oft focus is on Victor's hubris and transgression against nature, casting Victor as the villain and what results as just (perhaps divine) punishment.  But in reality that's utterly divorced from the actual context of the Romantic view of Milton's Satan. The Romantics view of Milton's Satan was not one of a villain, but an almost hero; see Byron's *Cain* and particularly Lucifer's monologue within it, as well as Percy Shelly's *On the Devil, and Devils*. To them Milton's Satan was as an symbol for humanity struggle against the cruelty and control of superstition. The parallel of Victor and Milton's Satan is twin to the parallel with Prometheus (The gift of fire being metaphorical for the gift of reason the light of which casts superstition away), neither of which ought be read as negative. The source of both suffering for both Milton's Satan and Prometheus is not presented as a moral failing but a result of them stepping beyond their limits and setting themselves against a force immeasurably beyond them. They're monstrous because they've set themselves against the order those superior forces have set for them. Likewise Victor's suffering stems not from moral failing, but is a simple consequence of setting the power of his own Reason against the immeasurably greater might of Nature and failing that contest. 

As a bit of trivia we should also note that the first way God is named in Paradise lost is as  Victor [...into what Pit thou seest from what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew the force of those dire Arms? Yet not for those, nor what the Potent Victor in his rage can else inflict...]. It's not a at all coincidence that's Frankenstein's first name. 

Victor's folly and suffering is symbolic of the conflict Wollstonecraft's Utopia and the gross physical reality of being a woman in the 1900s Mary Shelly and other women of her age experienced. His is the horror of seeing how far his desires exceeded his grasp and the sheer force he struggled against (""...and till then who knew the force of those dire Arms?""). The creatures suffering is thus tied to and dual with Victor's, and likewise symbolic. His is the horror of being damned by society and denied any form of humanity, even by his father and creator, simply because of his body.  

We should also note that for all the Creature refers to himself as Victor's Adam, Mary Shelly deliberately and pointedly parallels him to Milton's Eve. The way he describes seeing himself in the pool of water to Victor is outright parodic of Eve's awakening to consciousness in Paradise Lost. I'll quote that section down at the end of this, but it's worth comparing to that scene in chapter 12.  Without getting into a whole analysis of paradise lost, the ultimate source of Eves fall and her rejection of the order of Eden is the secondness and otherness of her existence; her desire to be more than she was created to be is the 'flaw' by which is she temped to eat the fruit, gaining both knowledge and sin. This has already gotten the hell long enough, but note the influence of Original Sin on Christian philosophy and  how the European view of femininity and womanhood as inherently dangerous and defiled was developed. Also note the parallels to the creatures own flaws and how they stem from his desire to be more than he was created, and how that drives his fall 

Victor isn't a great person, but he's also not the villain. Neither is the Creature. Both are doomed from the very beginning by forces far beyond their control or ken, and their suffering stems from their futile struggle inspite of that. 

Anyhow: Eve's description of her awakening in Eden. It's book 4 line 440 if you'd like it in full context and without reddit butchering the formatting. ""from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,"" is also noteworthy here given the source of materials for the Creatures creation; very literally the flesh of man.

His monstrous actions are seemingly out of human desperation but ultimately they just prove his creator right. He’s not human, and by extension his feelings are no longer valid.

I think ultimately we understand that he’s a monster because he hurts others as a means to an end, it’s not rage or hurt that fuels his killing; it’s his resignation to be the monster he was never intended to be. Frankenstein wanted to make the perfect man and bring the dead back to life, instead he made a monster.

I think the irony and futility of it all is what makes the story so versatile, everyone finds a different moral to the story and a different monster to condemn.  

Lastly I think I’d be wrong to ignore the monster fuckers here who just think it’s hot to have a brooding lonely 8ft patchwork bf. It’s fine to fuck a monster but not a murderer hence why people are so willing to ignore his crimes",mcduckinit,2022-07-16T17:50:44Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

w0i8n0,"The original novel is called the ‘1818 text’ version, the one considered by academics to be the best version, as the more popular edition of the book was ‘nerfed’ & altered, which really didn’t convey the essence of story that well. From reading the original version, I felt that the monster wasn’t so much horrific & gruesome looking, but rather just ugly and big. But the point you make is very much the point of the book, Frankenstein is indeed the bad person, and the book explores his regret in great detail. He was so infatuated by the science and idea of reanimating a corpse that he lost himself along the research and was appalled at what he had done. Frankenstein recognises he did a bad thing, and themes of creator & creation is a theme worth exploring in the book. He realises his bad acts at the end, which is why he refuses to create a companion for his monster. But it leaves him in a peculiar dilemma because he has forsaken his creature to a life of loneliness.

I don't think it's fair to say he ""kills and kills"". He has one count of manslaughter and two revenge killings under his belt, which obviously ain't great, but it's hard to call it out of proportion to Victor's crimes when the worst of it was a direct response to Victor killing the only person Adam cared about, or at least believed he could have come to care about.",Tommy2255,2022-07-17T05:05:37Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

w0i8n0,"In his 1981 nonfiction book *Danse Macabre*, Stephen King discussed Frankenstein at length. Regarding this moment in the story, King unsurprisingly made a salient point:

>At length, Victor agrees, and actually does make the woman. He accomplishes this second act of creation on a desolate island in the Orkney chain, and in these pages Mary Shelley creates an intensity of mood and atmosphere that nearly rivals the creation of the original. Doubts assail Frankenstein moments before he is to imbue the creature with life. He images the world desolated by a pair of them. Even worse, he imagines them as a hideous Adam and Eve of an entire race of monsters. A child of her times, Shelley apparently never considered the idea that for a man capable of creating life from moldering spare parts, it would be child's play to create a woman without the capacity for conceiving a child.

If any of you readers of fiction haven't read *Danse Macabre*, I think you really should, or at least should give it a look. I've lost count of the times I've re-read it, it's special to me in that very best way. When King really gets rolling with the subject matter (Chapter III), he lovingly talks - at length - of three special novels that to him have achieved a kind of immortality: *Frankenstein*, *Dracula*, and *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*. 

He spends the rest of the book talking about horror on the radio (remember, this was written in 1981), on the television, in movies, and of course, in novels. Given how early in his career he wrote this, and given the forty-one years that have flown by since then (with all the horror content forty-one years would entail) ... I so wish he'd go back and just do another version of *Danse Macabre* from scratch. Lol! He won't, he wouldn't, it's a silly idea.

Horror stories always begin with someone doing something they shouldn’t and then getting punished for it. Victor Frankenstein is the hero of the story, regardless of how things have changed from our understanding.

To view the story in a modern light and try to apply those actions to the Victorian age is foolish at best.

Remember in to kill a mockingbird the black dude gets hanged even though everyone knew the girl’s dad raped her? Those same people are the ones reading Frankenstein.

w0i8n0,"I would say the novel is very clear the Creature isn't inherently evil or bad, that his first instincts were neutral and kind. This doesn't absolve him of his evil, quite the opposite because his evil is quite conscious.  Victor thinks beauty = good.  Society hates the monster for how he looks.  Walton likewise begins so classist that he can think of no one as his fellow unless they are sufficiently well born and he's intoxicated by Victor's upper class handsomeness.

In the version where Elizabeth is not a cousin, in the rewrite which is SO much creepier than Victor marrying his cousin, the Frankensteins save her from poverty (and not her several siblings) and are ""helpful"" by taking her in from her living, poor parents who have too many mouths to feed; they save her because she's angelic looking and blond and too pretty to be poor, then they groom her to marry Victor from the age of like 7. Elizabeth is a good person, but the obsession with her beauty is clearly satirized in the novel.  

There are religious and mythic undertones and allusions in Frankenstein, but the notion that beauty = goodness really isn't supported as a theme itself.  Rather, Mary uses it to criticize society. 

One possible theme on Victor's hubris, that he was brought down by ""playing God"" is fair in some ways (though you can read the novel and very much think that if he'd welcomed and educated the Creature, it would be good, but of course that wouldn't make it welcomed by society). Hubris and pride are some of his frequent sins.  But it's a kind of ""easy out"" to say the creation was the issue.  When the Creature calls Victor his maker, he does criticize his mistake in creating him because he has a miserable existence but he more so criticizes him for abandoning him, leaving him all alone, being a neglectful and feckless god basically, shunning him for no crime.",berrieh,2022-07-17T14:00:12Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

It's not that the Monster did NOTHING WRONG, it's that at its creation, the Monster starts off as innocent, almost child-like.  The Monster isn't inherently evil, it becomes evil as the result of the life that is forced upon it, partly because of Victor's abandonment.  By the end, of course, the monster is truly a monster seeking revenge for the miserable existence Victor foisted on it.

Victor IS the true villain of the story, I don't see how anyone can read the book and not come to the conclusion.  Even Victor himself in the end acknowledges the atrocities he's unleashed upon the world.  If Victor hadn't either created the Monster or had actually taken care of the Monster after its creations then things would have gone differently.  This doesn't mean Victor was purely mustache-twirling evil, the point of the book is that even the best of intentions can lead to atrocities if you don't take care.",kia75,2022-07-16T23:53:30Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

w0i8n0,"Oh yeah I agree, I believe it's really a societal critique. (Also I haven't read that rewrite, but yeah that does sound creepy...)

From an interpretation standpoint, however, I enjoy drawing themes of mankind being both gods in their own right (due to our insane power compared to other species) and still animals (due to our instinctual habits and our lack of emotional control). In a very basic explanation!

I like to look at the story from this point of view because it could be interpreted as very ironic that Frankenstein abandons his creation and since he could be paralleled to god in this situation you could posit that mankind (and so Frankenstein himself) is similarly abandoned.

You could also say that his monster is MORE human in that their emotional flaws are brought out and highlighted more and that the monster can recognize the neglect towards them. While humans in the story make similar mistakes, but they're sort of less criticized? If that makes sense? Because the narrator being human is more forgiving and wants to ignore some similarities.

All from an interpretation standpoint of course, I know it's not the intended message. There's just a lack of media that outright plays with these themes so I have to extrapolate a lot and Frankenstein was the first story I was able to extrapolate this from.

I do find outright moral good vs evil and similar religious interpretations sort of boring and lazy so I'm happy you pointed out some flaws of the interpretation. It's very much a more emotion driven story.

Edit Tldr: I know it's the wrong interpretation, I just think the recognition that beauty = good in Victor's eyes can help draw similarly wrong, but more interesting interpretations.",CopperPhish,2022-07-17T17:37:37Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Now the average straight laced academic can see Satan as a Byronic hero, sure, and even see sympathy for ""why"" he's evil beyond that.  But that's after a lot more Romantic literature (Frankenstein is pretty early) and the post modern wave frankly. Byron was a famous figure of amorality. So his sympathies with Milton's Satan aren't necessarily proving the point that he's actively sympathetic. Byronic heroes became much more sympathetic in whole during the postmodern era than they were actually intended to be by the Romantics, who often didn't justify their evil with sympathies so much as see evil in all humans. It's an evolution of Milton's original point on sin, but the full tilt of justification of evil comes later. It's interesting to see how you'd read things like Paradise Lost or Frankenstein in different eras and sensibilities.",berrieh,2022-07-17T17:37:43Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
w0i8n0,"There's literally no way for women to take the place in society she discusses without dismantling the patriarchal system of power in place. 

These quotes directly relate to criticizing the patriarchy. 

From Vindication:

""There must be more equality established in society, or morality will never gain ground, and this virtuous equakity will not rest firmly even when founded on a rock, if one half of mankind be chained to its bottom by fate, for they will be continually undermining it through ignorance or pride.""

""A virtuous man may have a choleric or a sanguine constitution, be gay or grave, unreproved, be firm till he is almost over-bearing, or weakly subsmissive, have no will or opinion of his own; but all women are to be levelled, by meekness and docility, into one character of yielding softness and gentle compliance.""

""Men, indeed, appear to me to act in a very unphilosophical manner when they try to secure the good conduct of women by attempting to keep them always in a state of childhood.""

""Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers - in a word, better citizens.""

""Considering the length of time that women have been dependent, is it surprising that some of them hug their chains, and fawn like the spaniel?"" (about internalized patriarchy) 

From another essay, not Vindication. I used to teach this one with Frankenstein:

""Women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to their sex, when, in fact, men are insultingly supporting their own superiority.""

There's plenty more. Wollstonecraft was the revolutionary type and was absolutely looking to dismantle the patriarchy. Yes, by elevating women to an equal place, as educated individuals, and she mentions the ""chains"" their kept in by systems of male superiority that were explicit.  The patriarchy in the 18th century isn't hard to explain at all, though to understand it in the 21st century where many of Wollstonecraft's desires about female freedom and education have been realized by several major societies (the globe is a big place) is trickier. See, those societies (ours) still have gender inequality but of course it's from these past shackles, even the removed ones, as much as current ones so, like any systemic issue (systemic racism etc), you have to understand the evolution from past to present, it's continued influence on socialization. 

For biological sex aspects of gender, you also have to understand the impacts of having a uterus, which has very different gender issues to Wollstonecraft's day, where women often understood the danger and burden of bearing children but had no major systems of family planning to rely on (not to say Wollstonecraft would've aborted her children, certainly not Mary who was very much wanted, but she definitely would've been pro choice and understood how motherhood and marriage were intertwined with patriarchal systems of power).",berrieh,2022-07-17T14:16:31Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
w0i8n0,"I disagree, though not necessarily on the Creature being intentionally ""understandable"" per se.  I disagree on two points: 

1) that the shading of Milton's Satan was meant to *enhance* sympathy towards him.  In fact, I think that aspect serves to show the opposite: that his evil is intentional and wrong, though his initial motivations may be sympathetic. I think she uses techniques in other areas to make the Creature's trend towards evil ""logical"" and make his evil look avoidable and caused by society and his Creator though.  

2) that Mary intended Victor to be sympathetic in the first draft.  If you compare drafts, it does seem she intends him more sympathetic than the original publication in the second publication, which is nearly 15 years later (albeit still pretty unlikable, even then). But most of the edits that make him more sympathetic seem to be encouraged by Percy's suggestions if you look at the journals, and she adds other things to offset the additional insight into Victor's mind, such as the super creepy rewrite of Elizabeth as a poor girl who is ""adopted"" because she's blond and pretty and then is groomed to be Victor's bride, with Victor calling her ""mine"" (there's a little of this when she's Victor's cousin, but so much more in the rewrite). She also makes sure to elaborate further that Victor ""knows better"" as she elaborated on Alphonse's advice and that Victor remembers and ignores.  Unlike the more sympathetic changes (a few do give better insight into Victor's mind, even making him possibly look like he suffers a mental disorder in Ch. 4), these changes don't seem to have been suggested to Mary per se, besides not making Elizabeth a cousin (though the new story is SO much creepier). 

I guess I disagree on a 3rd part, which is that, far from no one being the villain in Frankenstein, I would say Shelley writes a tale of both Victor and the Creature being villains and only Captain Walton is given the chance of redemption, and while she hints he may take it with her Ancient Mariner allusions and the suggestion he's turning back, it's unclear if he'll reach full redemption. She makes both the Creature and Victor clearly and fully irredeemable, beyond a doubt. I would say if you focus on ""why"" style rationality, Victor's character is worse off for this, as he had all the privilege and support the Creature lacks and still continuously chooses selfishly.  But if you focus on actions, the Creature's evil is obviously far more evil in aggregation.

I think there are 2 villains in Frankenstein and the protagonist is actually Walton, but I can see other takes. He doesn't have the ""screen time"" to be a protagonist, unless you count sitting and listening, but he's the only character given capacity for change in the course of the actual plot.",berrieh,2022-07-18T11:30:54Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

The main issue I find isn't so much the antiquated language, although that can slow you down a touch when compared with reading something more contemporary, but the amount of extraneous detail these stories include because those who could afford to read for pleasure had the leisure time to do so and fewer other modes of entertainment competing for their attention. There are parts of Frankenstein that read, entirely unnecessarily, like a travelogue.

ps12dg,Of course each book can feel extremely relevant since humans tend to run into the same problems since the Neolithic Era but more in terms of that it wasn't until the 1900s before there were books diving into the fear that maybe humanity were like children playing with guns uncappable of comprehending the level of responsibility they need to have to not to destroy themselves. Yet Frankenstein despite being set during the infancy of the industrial revolution taps into fears of corrupting AI systems and making them as spiteful and cruel as their creators leading to our own destruction. The utter terror of being confronted by something that is so human yet so unhuman at the same time. It still amazes me how Kelly never seeing a robot or computer ever during her entire lifetime created one of the best rouge AI stories of all time.,,2021-09-20T21:28:46Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

To THINK that this was written at the start of the 19th century is NUTS. It feels so in the present day in some ways. What also blows me away with that context is the fact that another horror classic, Dracula, would have been written when Frankenstein was already well established in the canon.

13i6qiv,"I find the book's structure to be fascinating. Having these long monologues that all stack on each other is a great way to show how each of these characters view the world.

It also has a great opening. In the first few chapters, you see all of these different types of love portrayed. We see Captain Waltons love for his sister, Victor's love for his siblings, the Frankenstein parents' love for their children, Justine's love for the family she helps care for, Victor's love for his friend Henry. These all serve to contrast with the way Victor treats his creation. The Creature is for all intents and purposes, Victor's own son. Victor brought him into the world, and should love him, but instead rejects him.  He doesn't even bother to give his son a name, instead just considering him a monstrous disgrace. Their relationship really is at the core of the tragedy of the piece.

13i6qiv,"I read Frankenstein for the first time for a class I was taking about the gothic literary genre. It is an amazing book, and Mary Shelley is rightfully credited for proliferating the science fiction genre.

Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein for a ghostwriting competition between herself, Lord Byron, and I believe her husband, Percy Shelley. She was only 18 years old when Frankenstein was published, which means she was barely 20 when writing the novel. Her husband, Percy, encouraged her to finish the book because he liked what he had read so far. 

If you like Frankenstein, then I think you may also enjoy Dracula. Much like Shelley's Frankenstein became the progenitor of the science fiction genre, Dracula became the progenitor of the modern vampire.

As an aside, I would love to study directly under Mary Shelley. She's a divine wordsmith in my eyes. Bram Stoker isn't nearly as eloquent, but then Dracula was published in 1897, almost 90 years later, so the English language would have evolved to resemble our more modern way of writing.",Olympian-Warrior,2023-05-15T16:15:56Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

13i6qiv,"Some lesser known things about Mary Shelley

* Frankestein (The Modern Prometheus) was originally written by Mary when she was only around 20... 

* Her husband, Percival, would become a celebrated 'Romantic' poet of the period. Along with a close friend of theirs, Lord Byron (another celebrated Romantic poet), Percy and Mary made an effort to re-write the Classic Greek tale of 'Prometheus'... of the three, only Mary's version was completed and remains.

* The tale of Prometheus is related: >!Prom. was Zeus brother, who Zeus inflicted punishment upon, for gifting the race of man with 'Fire'. The gift from Prom. would come to liberate humanity from their animalism and prove that Zeus was wrong to wish to destroy them. Prom. was able to see the future and stayed his being killed by Zeus by teasing the idea that he knew who would come to kill Zeus in the future (Hercules). the motif here, which is shared with Frankenstein, is one of the god creating the man, who would come to kill the god (and his father)!<

* In Frankenstein, >!the 'Monster' is not responsible for Frankensteins death... that lies with Frankenstein alone.!<

* Mary's mother was Mary Wollestonecraft, auther of 'A Vindication of the rights of Women'. Mary's father was William Godwin, a celebrated Political theorist in his own life, who was also the first British philosopher to state 'I am an Anarchist'.

* Despite her (clearly radical) lineage, Mary and Percy felt the need to elope with each other, for fear of the judgement of British society regarding their political position(s). They were 'Free Love' practising, Atheistic, Church-Damning, King-Hating poets; I love them.

* The book itself tackles the whole notion of 'God creates Man / Man Kills God / God is Dead / Man creates God' about 50 odd years before Neitzsche considered writing it down... this lass was 20 years old...

* The whole spiel given by anyone that studied literature is as follows: 

> Those who havent read the book, think that Frankenstein is the Monster, >!but Frankenstein is actually the Doctor. Those who have read the book know that Frankenstein is the Doctor, and that the Monster has no name. Those that *understand* the book, realise that Frankenstein is the Monster!<.

I think it's misunderstood in the way you describe partly because Frankenstein's monster used to be seen in the public consciousness as just a monster. So people reacted against it to say ""actually it's Victor that's the true monster"". But you're right, the monster did some terrible things, intentionally, but at the same time it could have been averted if Victor had not run away from his responsibilities.

Keep in mind, however, that vocabulary is ultimately subjective to the reader. If you are more acquainted with more modern writing, then Frankenstein will seem intimidating (it's really not).",Olympian-Warrior,2023-05-15T16:21:20Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
13i6qiv,"There is actually some pretty convincing evidence that Percy Shelly was secretly the author of significant portions of the final book. 

Scholars don’t dispute the initial concept originated from the mind of Mary Shelly, or that she wrote much of the early manuscripts. 

But the final published volume’s themes, language, worldview, philosophy, references to classic literature, writing style, etc. bear a remarkable similarity to Percy’s published works before and after Frankenstein—too much so to dismiss—but little to no resemblance to any of Mary’s subsequent writings throughout her life.

Then you look into the personal and business relationships between Percy, Mary, and her father and the puzzle pieces start to fall into place. (They *had to* convince her father the book was hers alone or it never would have been published).

There also has been tremendous pressure among literary academics to preserve Mary’s status as the sole author of Frankenstein, along with efforts to suppress records and documents indicating otherwise. It’s fascinating to read about.

13i6qiv,"If you really want to be wowed, look up Mary Shelley's backstory. Her mother was Mary Wollstonecraft, a proto-feminist writer of *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman', who died 10 days after her daughter was born. Mary Shelley's father was William Godwin, also a super well-known essayist at the time. 

She met Percy Shelley when she was 16 and he was 27 - and he was already married with two children. They supposedly consummated their relationship on her mother's gravestone. Percy and Mary ran off together despite him still being married - a few years later his wife committed suicide and soon after, Mary and Percy got married. 

It's also thought that *Frankenstein* was influenced by her being pregnant at the time of writing (and having had an earlier still-birth)- technically, she wasn't participating in the competition, but she had a dream about the creation scene in *Frankenstein* and supposedly Percy encouraged her to write it down. 

Lord Byron was good friends with Percy (and participated in the ghost story competition) - he is considered one of the first literary celebrities, despite his clubbed-foot. He ended up sleeping with Mary Shelley's step-sister (who may have also had an earlier relationship with Percy), and she became pregnant. 

Percy ended up dying with his son a few years later in sailing accident. And there is more to the drama that surrounded Mary Shelley, but that's the basics of some of the most fascinating bits.",slothface27,2023-05-15T14:46:49Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Yearning to spend time with someone like him he desperately hunts down his creator to ask for a wife.

Yeah, Victor ""deserved"" what happened to him, the creature is just a victim. He didn't ask to be brought into this world, had to face the scorn of the people he tried to befriend and his own father treated him as a monster too.

10eutgn,"Prospero and Victor Frankenstein

*Prospero, back in Europe after the events of “The Tempest”, encounters Victor Frankenstein, who abandoned his search for the creature after an epiphany on his near deathbed.*

PROSPERO:

You, down low! That face you wear is  
Fit for none but scoundrels, knaves or wretches.

VICTOR:

Good sir, I am truly in a wretched state. I fear your judgment is sound, as my mind is not. A deep anguish has clutched my very essence. I feel the end is near. If only my soul could unburden itself, perhaps those who follow might elude the demons that hound me now.

PROSPERO:

Heed my warning! Fear for one who cedes to  
Hear your tale of woe, should give restriction  
To the urge. Do not my soul with trouble  
Cumber further. Woe betide me, likewise.

VICTOR:

Perhaps I can convey the meaning of my misery without the full explication of my deeds. I have distilled the wrongs I wrought so I may share without contaminating one of a more innocent nature. I would take kindly to the thoughts of one who is no stranger to melancholy of his own.

PROSPERO:

Well, a coward I am not, and nor the  
Keeper of a soul unsullied. Prithee,  
Make your peace and tell your tale. If I fall  
Ill with loathing and distaste, my feet walk  
Still through power of my own. I promise  
Not a thing to thee, say what thou wouldst and  
We will see how long I deign to listen.

VICTOR:

If only humility were a virtue of which I was possessed, I would not face you now with such affliction. I have lost all that was dear to me, all that I loved, for naught but the lust of revenge, revenge for a deed of which I was the cause. I could not trust the monstrous appearance of another, and give to him the affection that was his due as a creature on God’s earth, if not of His making. No man is an island; a soul without love will not thrive. Of this, I myself am living proof.

PROSPERO:

Hmm? A beast has plagued thee to despair? At  
Last it seems excited is my int’rest.  
Suffer not the suff’rings of a beast who  
Knows not ways of sons of Adam. Beasts are  
Here for naught but making less the load of  
Man. If serve a use he fails to do, concerns  
Are waste and only harm the bearer.

VICTOR:

This monster is capable of much more than you would expect. His cunning, quickness, strength, and stealth are not seen but in the most dangerous of rogues. Alas, he cultivated a sentimental nature most delicate, but was shewn no quarter in the hearts of men. I fear that in the end, it is I who am the beast. Do we not wish our fellow men charitable hearts in their dealings with us? If I had given as I had been so lucky to receive, perhaps this beast would have made a man of generous merit in turn.

PROSPERO:

Alas, delusion has encased your mind.  
A beast can no more be a man than fish  
Can fly or swine can sing. If bested you  
Have been, best you regroup and try again.  
The ruler of this earth is man, for God  
We strive to make things right, so that  
His children soundly sleep each, ev’ry night.

VICTOR:

But sir, you spoke of woe when first you came upon me. Why indeed would one so sure-footed as yourself be so distressed?

PROSPERO:

My sins be not against the beast, but men  
Who would see me deceased, my daughter, used  
Like one chess-piece in plans to seat me back  
Upon my throne. A puppet-master, I  
Did play. My soul? A bit was lost each day.  
The beast, I treated as a man. A grave  
Mistake, indeed, my friend. Respect, I thought  
Should be received, my neck he sought to slice  
Instead. But I am master, he the slave.  
Just punishment, deserves the scurvy knave.  
The men, I saw them and forgave. Forgiveness,  
Now I pray would come before my grave.

VICTOR:

So you subdue the beast and exonerate your enemies? I cannot catch the barest hint of penitence in your voice when his name is on your lips. Why did this beast seek to slay you? By whence did you become his master? These matters are of deep consequence if I am to believe a man whose cheeks flush red so readily.

PROSPERO:

Wilt thou lament in perpetuity,  
A monster, who great harm would do to thee?  
Mope not, your gloom, it bores me to the core.  
The end of mine, is happy in mine eyes,  
Your story, feeble, wretched, to despise.

VICTOR:

I wished only to reach a small peace before I must depart the world of men. I wish you well in seeking yours, if only this encounter could have been with one of greater compassion. It seems that rue is with me until the end.

PROSPERO:

I hate to see a man of such fine speech  
Relinquish that which makes him not a beast.",whomeverwiz,2023-01-18T07:08:12Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
10eutgn,"If I remember correctly, not only was she 18 when she wrote it, she wrote it as part of a competition with her husband (Percy Shelley) and Lord Byron, both poets and literary giants of their time. I can’t remember if they ever ended up publishing their respective stories, but she obviously won big time, which is awesome.

I love this book so much. I think this is partly because I grew up watching movies like Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein (possibly the funniest movie of all time), in which the Creature is presented unambiguously as slow, dumb, and frightening. In the novel, the Creature is so much more complex; he’s unbelievably clever, strong, and fast. He’s also filled with a lust for revenge that is both terrifying and tragic. Like the fallen angel Lucifer, or an unrequited Adam from the Garden of Eden, his experiences with people shape him into a monster that is far more hideous than what his corporeal form conveys. I find the Creature to be an equally fascinating character, and though I hate what he becomes, I understand him and feel an immense sorrow for him.

Victor is also a fantastic character. He truly embodies the hubris of Icarus, the one who flew too close to the Sun. I also wanted to hate him, but Shelley really does force us to sympathize with him. Maybe force is too strong of a word here, perhaps convinces is better. As he lays on the ship, dying and full of regret, we see that he recognizes what his vanity has wrought upon the world. Shelley displays a mature and nuanced respect for her character as a flawed person, something which helped endear him to me.

I have several Frankenstein quotes written down in my phone:

“Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.”

“But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.”

A very elegant book, and so packed full of meaning and allegory. I’m happy to hear that you enjoyed it! Dracula by Bram Stoker is pretty good as well, though I felt like it dragged at certain parts. In terms of Gothic horror, I have The Haunting of Hill House and The Castle of Otranto on my “to read” list still. Thank you for your post!",majin_donut,2023-01-18T13:45:25Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

10eutgn,"For me, one of the most fascinating aspects about the novel Frankenstein is the theme about how evil and cruelty are created, and the notion that no one is born to be evil or cruel but become so through the trauma of experiencing cruelty and neglect from society and the people around them. Humans are social animals who require love and kindness to properly grow and develop, and the novel explores what might happen when we are denied that. It’s a very psychological novel. Frankenstein's monster starts out as being innocent, kind, cultivated and very good at heart – but becomes cruel, vindictive and even murderous because of the way others treat him.

In a way, its themes remind me a lot of the themes in Wuthering Heights – which is one of my personal favourite novels. How the traumatic experience of cruelty and evil only gives birth to more cruelty and evil in return, until someone is able to break the chain. And Heathcliff reminds me quite a bit of Frankenstein’s monster, in that he is a misunderstood outsider who is probably not hateful, cruel and vindictive from the start but becomes so through the trauma he experiences as a child and as a youth.",Malthesse,2023-01-18T17:29:13Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

He started out so nice, not knowing anything (like a baby) and just wanting a friend. If people weren't so shallow, none of the deaths would have had to happen. Was it still wrong for the creature to murder? Yes. But I understood completely where he was coming from. And Victor also shares the blame for them. If people had just not been shallow and given the creature a chance, none of it would have happened. It was all avoidable and breaks down to ""people are shallow, can't see past someone's looks"" which is very realistic, unfortunately.

I am absolutely obsessed with Frankenstein and Mary Shelley, reading biographies and information on her and such. There is so much one can unpack from it and I get something new out of it every time.",Wickedjr89,2023-01-18T16:24:28Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
10eutgn,"Just finished, reading one classic book a month this year to clear up a list of those I haven't read yet for whatever reason. I was actually really looking forward to this one, but...

Pretty dissapointed to be honest. Written well and a quick read, but Frankenstein's insanely weak personality does NOT drive things for me. >!He sees his horrible creation, shrugs, and carries on knowing it's no longer in his rooms, with no concern for how it got away or where it is? If I was so horrified by the thing I had just brought into the world, as a scientist especially, I'd want to follow up. And it's not enough that Justine dies (almost was okay with that since the court held her and seemed pretty set on their verdict) but then he has the opportunity to sit with the monster in a tent and does nothing to end him. Clerval dies and he collapses into a heap, he doesn't even consider Elizabeth's safety on their wedding night and after she's gone he's crying with the women over her body instead of, oh, I don't know, using his rage to hunt down the monster? Even the final chase is unimpressive, the monster's telling him to follow and egging him on, and there's no thought of trying to outthink his own creation or getting the better of him.!<

I get what you’re saying about modern perceptions of Horror though!  I think people tend to pigeon-hole the genre into *needing* gore & other gruesome elements, that give a more physical shock value for the audience.    

And that element has its place, for sure!  But the parts of horror stories that really stick with me personally have always involved more existential dread & heaviness.  After it’s read & done, those are the parts I can’t stop thinking about.

82ne2p,"The Sun's point is silly. The students are only new readers--no reason for the Sun to rake them over the coals. 

But for the record, Frankenstein's monster isn't a victim. There's little substantive literary criticism that even tries to make the point. The monster as victim is one of those internet theories, sort of like Ron Paul or ""Harry Potter is actually playing make believe under the stairs the whole time,"" that are fun for people of a certain age but doesn't really make sense. 

People can buy into his self-serving perspective for why he killed a half dozen people but ultimately that's Shelley showing how shitty and self-justifying the monster can be. It's not just a dumb brute who kills. It's a he, a someone with a rich interior life, who kills people for really bad reasons. 

But since most people read it in high school they don't have the sophistication to disagree with a novel's viewpoint, even if its one the author is dying for the reader to disagree with. It's sort of like reading Nabokov's Lolita and going: ""H. H. isn't that bad of a guy! Sure he molests that little girl, but he's actually a victim: just ask him!""

Of course it's fun to argue in the classroom: 'is H.H. actually a bad guy?' To Nabokov, probably not. But to Shelley the answer is definitely yes and you got to simply ignore a lot of book to come to another conclusion.

There's probably also an element of the following: since we don't teach civics teachers smuggle it in by other ways, like English class, where they know the students aren't really reading too closely and there's a desire to teach certain values as coincidentally surrounding great works of literature. So the monster's importance becomes an easy way to shoe horn in some classic civic lessons about how bad prejudice and ignorance is, though there's really little in the book about either of those concepts, which naturally leads to the monster becoming the 'victim' in today's nomenclature. 

I promise the commentators taking the students side: if you re-read the book a little older, a little wiser, a little more well-read the portion of the book that got you tear-jerking in high school about poor Frankenstein's monster is going to come off a lot less convincing and a lot more heavy-handed. It's like reading Wells' the *Time Machine*. First read in high school and it's an pretty good sci-fi thriller. Read it a little later and it's a painfully obvious commentary on capitalism. Similarly, Shelley is showing us how humanity squared is twice as violent, twice as self-serving and half as convincing. 

The whole ending of the book--where the monster burns himself alive at the North Pole--is probably one of the least compelling parts of the book in just how moralizing Shelley was: whatever possibility that Shelley was just 'showing us the facts' is gone and instead we get the author flatly informing us that this monster dude is bad and he realizes how pathetic he is. Like any great Victorian England morality cliche, he has to kill himself because of how much of a victim even he realizes he definitely wasn't. I say this only to point out that while I don't think it works in the book, it at least puts a kibosh on the whole 'the point of the book was that Frankensteins monster was a victim.'

He didn't start off a monster, and he didn't end as a simple victim. He was victimized, and his resulting actions truely WERE monsterous.

>But for the record, Frankenstein's monster isn't a victim. There's little substantive literary criticism that even tries to make the point.

... but since at least '90 there's been a tonne of criticism written about the morale responsibility of the creature with some even suggesting that the original '18 publication was intended to be sympathetic to the creature...

...and even before the edition arguments, one of the two major critical angles taken on the novel is the novel as foil to Milton's Paradise Lost...

...and the fact that most of the prominent criticism in the 20th-21st century has been feminist criticism, which often views the creature as a metaphor for either the working class or an oppressed underclass...

...and the fact that Shelley's biographical information, in combination with the drastic changes between the 1818 and 1832 publications, paint a picture of someone broadly sympathetic to political radicalism - in particular, a plethora of essays contextualize the original publication in the context of the pre-1832 English cadaver laws, and suggest that Shelley was aggressively supportive of the political reforms that became the 1832 Anatomy Act, which is a fairly easy argument to make even based solely on the differences in the prefaces, let alone the descriptions of Victor's education and motivation behind it.

So while it's perfectly fine to say ""My opinion on *Frankenstein* is very simple, free of nuance, and solely an opinion - and that opinion is that the monster was a bad dude,"" it's completely absurd to say that ""there's little substantive literary criticism"" that tries to make the point that the monster isn't a victim. Not only is there a great deal of substantive literary criticism that equates the monster to either an oppressed class, a foil for Milton's Adam, or a metaphor for victims of the Anglican Church's hardline policy against the Anatomy Act, if you sum it all up it seems likely that the *majority* of substantive literary criticism does not take the view that the monster ""isn't a victim.""",xveganrox,2018-03-08T06:22:25Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

82ne2p,"> They teach in schools today that the monster is the victim.

I don't know that that's true at all, and if anyone's just teaching that without any nuance then they're doing their students a disservice. I teach and work with mostly English undergrads and that certainly isn't true here. 

>Before the 90s was it just radicals who held the belief that the monster was a victim. Or, was it a wildly accepted view of the the novel since it’s inception. 

I used 1990 because that's when the most widely used English reader started to include a preface discussing differences between the first publication and the third publication, and because there was a surge in articles and essays on the first publication's connections to Shelley's political views and the Anatomy Act. All of that was pre-dated by feminist and Marxist criticism of the monster as a class metaphor. Even setting all of that aside (and the connection was made by some people well before 1990), there's criticism going back to 1831 which analyses the monster through the lens of Milton - which pretty implicitly suggests that it's a victim.

All of that is beside the point, though. I'm not arguing that the monster is the ""victim,"" and I don't even think that that's a very meaningful question to ask. I'm just pointing out that the idea of the creature as a ""victim"" as the poster describes it isn't in any way new. 

>From what I remember, Shelley painted Frankenstein with just as much sympathy as the monster. He had more color and attachments with other characters.

As a slightly nerdy side note, you probably read the 1818 version if you thought that Shelley painted Frankenstein as somewhat sympathetic. One of the differences that stands out the most between the first and third publication is Frankenstein's origin story. For example, describing Frankenstein's education, compare 1818 1.2:

>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors, and among others to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The professor stared: ""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?""

to the same section in the 1831 text:

>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. **Chance -- or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door** -- led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. **He was an uncouth man,** but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. **I replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt,** mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared: ""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?""

It's generally accepted now that the changes to the 1831 edition were made to prepare it for a more anti-science, Anglican audience, in order to secure Shelley's son's financial future. Some of the misunderstandings and miscommunications around it might be because the two editions are 95% similar but frame things in very different ways. Someone who only read the 1831 edition - which was certainly the dominant version until a few decades ago and is still in print - would have a different and probably less sympathetic impression of Frankenstein and his creature than someone who only read the 1818 edition.",xveganrox,2018-03-08T20:07:59Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

What I also think is that the Victor could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd just given the female creature an hysterectomy. Or just not put a uterus in the body in the first place. Then he wouldn't have had to worry if the couple could procreate.

Though...for a woman she sure wrote some male privilege there. With Victor and his creation both thinking that the female creature is going to want what they automatically assume...that she'd want to spend her life with the male creation. They're treating her like property.

tsy1w5,"I wrote a paper a couple of years ago about Frankenstein thought from the point of view of post-partum depression and child neglect. It gives you a completely different perspective, of a child that has been abandon, pushed away by his own ""father"" who sees him as an ""atrocity"".  

&#x200B;

>""How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?""

&#x200B;

The monster doesn't have a name, taking away its individuality, I think in a way, Frankenstein sees himself in it. He was a child of neglect, who continues that cycle of negligence, when in replacement of his mother he creates a son he abandons, as he felt he was abandoned too.

&#x200B;

>“My mother had much desired to have a daughter”

&#x200B;

It is interesting to see it from that concept, a child which is pure, a white canvas, becomes he is unwanted and treated as such. In Mary Shelley’s book, the monster is seen as a murderer and evil in Victors eyes. All Victor does is play the victim card when he is the main reason of why the monster ended up like that.

&#x200B;

>""I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me: and in the bitterness of my heart, I Cursed him.""

&#x200B;

>""There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No. From that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery""

&#x200B;

He even asks for a companion, someone so he is not alone, and this is also negated to him. It all depends on which point of view you take, the one of the scientist who feel haunted by his own creation, or the one of the creation who's never received anything but hate.

Frankenstein's book always brings a quote by Eileen Sendrey to mind:

However, I agree that while I can commiserate with how he was abandoned even by Victor, his creator, it was quite a gray area toward the end when he expressed remorse *after* killing so many innocent and causing his makers death.

The teacher still tried though, got to the point where she just gave us a sub 10 page summary to get some sort of participation out of the class and one dude had the audacity to say “this is too long, can I get a summary of the summary”.

prn9pp,"Low key though, a lot of them aren't that good. 

To kill a mong bird, Dorian Grey, brave new world, animal farm, childhoods end, they're all incredible.

Some others are valuable for what they say about human nature despite being a bit of a slog to read like Flowers for Algernon, Moby Dick, slaughter house five, etc. 

But others are dense and just not as timeless as English teachers wish they were. 1984 doesn't connect with Z-oomers because they grew up with the surveillance state and it turns out that it has almost nothing to do with communism or the cold war. The western world accepted it in exchange for security. Maybe that's good, bad, or indifferent. But it does make 1984 unrelatable.

I feel like Frankenstein is in the second category and slipping into the third. The language is foreign enough to modern readers that is difficult to connect. The moral dilemmas debated are now handled by scientific specialists on a daily basis and by legislation which is revised periodically to reflect public opinion. And frankly I don't think people should be tanking life advise from Mary Shelley on top of the rest. I think Frankenstein should be allowed to die.

The titular character doesn't do a single thing, everything just kind of happens _to_ him until the very end.

Overall I was rooting for the Monster once learned from his part of the story. It pains me what could've been if Victor had actual courage to have been with his creation from the start, to have made his creature a mate after hearing their honest tale, or at least had tenacity to have told his friends and family of what had happened to give them the conscious to help themselves instead be in ignorance of their danger.
Frankenstein indeed had created a monster, though the monster wasn't born when they were created, quite the contrary; it became a monster through the evils and ignorance learned from Victor and other humans tainting their heart.

sx7h45,"My thoughts on this book are honestly just too extensive. It was transformative in my life. I've read it more times than I have kept count of, but ultimately I was always just as interested in Shelley's life and the inspiration behind it. It seems like I'm usually that way with the books I love most. I remember a documentary I watched in the mid 90s about the book's influence on our culture, and honestly, I recorded it on vhs just so I could watch that over and over for years to follow until someone taped over it. 

Now I know that being an author who wrote an alternate telling of the story, my opinions here can easily seem like self promotion, and sometimes I do try that,  because I'd love for people to read and discuss my book. Of course I wouldnt want that to overshadow my comments. I really believe fans of the original would enjoy what I've done weaving together the creature's perspectives with the Shelley family's lives, or entangling that with a new take on Lord Ruthven from ""the Vampyre"", but first and foremost, I'm always going to be a lifetime fan. 

For me, the top list on my favorite reads is always 

1. Frankenstein
2. Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables
3. Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
4. Count of Monte Cristo, tied with the Time Machine
5. Tolkiens' ENTIRE middle earth saga

That surprises some people because they assume knowing me, that Tolkien would come first (I am literally trying to remodel my house to look like a hobbit hole interior. I proudly display my tolkien collectibles. I'm planning a hobbit themed wedding, etc)... but when it comes down to it, it's always been Frankenstein first... I get a lot out of my love for Tolkien. I want to live in that world. I do... I want Sam's courage and Frodo's resilience. I want Bilbo's sense of adventure. Its romantic to think about how Tolkien built his world, but Frankenstein was just more personal to me. I felt like the creature growing up. I related to the struggle of his pains and otherness. It's a deeper connection for me abd by extension, I have so much respect for Mary Shelley.

I'm not into the pop culture version of the character and I honestly don't want pictures of Karloff or anything around, but I deeply relate to the story. My sympathies for the creature and how I feel about him, are what led me to become an author. Truly, I can not praise it enough.",Fit-Cover-5872,2024-01-07T19:21:50Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Some have issue with Piers Anthony on his writing style on certain characters, but I thought his first book in the series was best, and Zane was an interesting viewpoint on why Death is as they are, who many deem callous but others call kind.

The way I see it, once a story is made to be consumer for others then others can interpret it their own way. Obviously I can understand if people read Frankenstein and just go along with the story and accept the story as is told, but for some reason while reading it I became way too suspicious of the Doc lol if that's how you enjoy the story then keep it that way, and who knows maybe two summers from now you read it again and maybe see it in a different light.

5nxd6g,"In one way I find Frankenstein comforting. It shows that the mildly depressing loneliness of life isn't a modern thing. That it's something humanity has faced for a long time. The people of the past felt alone, so it's okay that we do as well. Being an outcast isn't a result of technology isolating us from one another, or the media only reporting on the harshness of the world. A student in a university in 1818 could feel alone, and he isn't so different from a student in a university in 2016. Isolation isn't an invention of the 21st century.

In another way it's completely depressing. Because in some fundamental way we haven't changed since 1818. Despite modern science and understanding we are still the same inside. We still face and fail to meet the same expectations and challenges that we did then. Despite instantaneous, global communication and an easily accessed repository of all knowledge many of us are still incredibly alone.",mrbibs350,2017-01-14T19:28:47Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
5nxd6g,"I really do like this novel for many of the reasons given here by others. Something no one has yet mentioned is the subtitle; The Modern Prometheus. Shelly didn't invent the phrase; Kant had previously dubbed Benjamin Franklin the ""Prometheus of modern times"" for his electricity experiments. Just as the original Prometheus created man and gave him the ability to survive Victor created the ""new man"" with the ""new fire"", electricity. The story of his crime and punishment in Prometheus Bound (probably Aeschylus) is continued with his release from captivity in Prometheus Unbound written by Mary Shelly's then lover later husband Percy Shelly that was almost certainly in the works when Shelly wrote Frankenstein. The Promethean analogy runs throughout the story. Page one the sailor writes to his sister that he is in ""a country of eternal light where the sun is forever visible"". Victor describes the moment he knew it would work as ""a sudden light so brilliant and wondrous"". The monster's first sensation is ""the light pressed upon his nerves'. It is not until the end that Victor is ""borne away by the waves and lost in darkness"".

5nxd6g,"I have heavily studied this novel as well as the author, Mary Shelley, herself. It absolutely is applicable to this day and age in terms of us having to understand that neither reason nor romanticism can stand alone without the other.

The authors father was a critic of the enlightenment and felt that reason alone couldn't fully provide the need of humanity.

Dr. Frankenstein created the creature, also known as the demon. Frankenstein was not the creation but the creator. Frankenstein galvanized, or brought to life, a being that he immediately abandoned and there were dire consequences for both the creature as well as the scientist.

Not only is it commentary on ethics in science nowadays but it also is a good example of why we need to consider the emotional ramifications of rational or utilitarian acts. 

It also has some very interesting feminist undertones, with him entirely destroying and dismembering the female counterpart. 

And the story behind it's writing is quite interesting. The author, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron were in a ghost story writing competition while they were spending time together at a cabin. The novel was released without an authors name, so most assumed it was her lovers writing because how could an 18-year-old girl have written such a such a controversial novel that because so famous?

The figure of Frankenstein was later used to demonize liberals, because Mary Shelley's father was quite the radical.",,2017-01-14T22:48:08Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

5nxd6g,"In my mind this is the chief ingredient that's been lost in every single adaptation of the book. While the theme that science can run amok has been told and retold again and again (I read a fascinating essay in college positing that ""Jurassic Park"" was an update on the Frankenstein myth), this critical theme is nearly always discarded.

My hunch: it's very easy to make a mad scientist the bad guy because he is presented as something ""other"". That is, not many people of Shelley's time were galvanists or even scientists nor are most of us in the present day geneticists. We perceive those who operate outside the realms of what we understand threatening anyway, because frequently they exercise some degree of control over things which are greatly out of our control. But we're less likely to heap such fear upon the act of cruelty or rejection because each of us engages in it at some point.

To condemn Frankenstein for his casual cruelty is to condemn us ourselves. To condemn Frankenstein for toying with the laws of nature is to condemn the ""other"". That's why the latter myth has become integral to retellings of this story and the former is all but ignored.

As Robert Sawyer's agent once told him: there's a lot of money to be made by telling people to be afraid of science.

An experiment that takes on a life of its own, seen as an atrocity to the rest of the world, yet forced upon it against its own will. Fundamentally without purpose and alone, longing for fulfillment in any way it can find it.

Shelley is living in the middle of the industrial revolution, and while not a scientist, she is almost a visionary when it comes to predicting the potentials of science. The consequences can be dire if we do not consider them carefully. In this case science has created a living and conscience being. The beast is an outcast to the human world, because we were not quite ready for it. As a response to the rejection he experiecnes multiple times, the monster turns bitter and vengeful. He originally sought love and a place in this world. No one could offer him that, and so he killed. In the end, Victor and the beast are in a eternal  struggle, leaving us somewhere in the Arctic.

Personally I read it with a religious mindset, which opened my mind of the relation between man, God, and our souls.

5nxd6g," Definitely relatable to current times, especially given current feminist movements. I'm not sure how a woman author would be perceived during her time, I believe she was early 1800s? Or if people would have even cared at all. She could definitely be a role model to female activists currently. 

 Although I am not sure of the intention of the book, if it was a social commentary or simply a story. I never like to assume the authors intentions, but the story can be used as a tool to look at the progression of science in current times. Especially dealing with ethics and moral responsibility. 

 If the goal of Mary Shelley was to provide a story to provoke thoughts on morals and ethics, then she was very right. If you look at in that sense, the story itself, in pop culture shows a direct reflection of what Mary Shelley could have been trying to explain. Children stories, movies and TV all show Frankenstein's creation as a horrific monster which seems to be the opposite of what the book is trying to say.

5nxd6g,"Absolutely. When I read Frankenstein for the first time, after growing up a lifelong horror fan, it was my first semester in college and Mike Brown had been shot less than a month before. All of a sudden, this book was connecting a group of people who had nothing in common with one another but where they chose to study and the books they had to read. Frankenstein is a powerful commentator toward society, yes, but the level of humanity demonstrated by a supposedly non-human being is the major takeaway. Frankenstein - yes i will refer to him as such; his being created rather than born does not exempt Victor from being his progenitor - is made of human parts. He expresses human emotion. He does not begin to act inhumanly until Victor, his last chance at acceptance, breaks him. Society scorns him, his every attempt at connection is thwarted, and all he asks is for companionship so he will not have to suffer alone. Victor denies him and, in retaliation for the inhumanity shown to him, he responds in kind. Forcing the reader to examine themselves, to realize that little is straightforward and morality does not a good man make makes the story so much more than its era - it's one of the best examples of ""what a good book does"" that has ever graced us.",thebestsamoyed,2017-01-16T01:23:38Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

9o59mk,"I think one reason is because so much of the book is internal - the internal experience of Frankenstein and the creature. It's hard to translate that kind of internal experience to the screen, so most adaptations have gone for the cheap thrills (or laughs). 

Besides, popular culture has developed a bunch of Spark Notes-level ideas about this novel - it's about creation, or whatever - when the real thing is much more complex. So the more the novel is adapted, the less it's tied to the source material and the more it's connected to the wider cultural \*idea\* of the source material. I'd bet some of this has to do with when the earliest adaptations onscreen were - before effects and locations, let alone film storytelling, could really handle the full text. I bet if no one had adapted Frankenstein until the 1990s, you'd see a much more faithful, or at least a much less narrow, interpretation of the book.

I remember when the creature attacked Frankenstein's lady, one of the hardest street toughs in the class was shocked. Listening to those kids who had never had much cultural exposure to reading or sci fi become enthralled in the story was a testament to it's power. 

(Also it was very entertaining with their street thug discussion on the book. When he tore out the heart that one kid went ""Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn yo! He did his lady like that?!"" ... Might sound funny but he was sincerely upset! Pretty amazing to see a kid who never read a book to going hyped for one!

The layers of narration are amazing, every now and then you are at a point where you're reading someone's second hand accounts and realize that this is still being told to the sailors sister through letters from a story he heard from Victor. It's like 5th hand accounts. Also, Shelley's original version, and not her husbands hamfisted edit published after, has a lot of interesting themes and views on women at the time. Her husband's edit took out a lot of that to make the women more meek helpless. And the fact that the creature was the victim of the story surprised me, Victor was the narrcisist that brought everyone around him down and abandoned the helpless creature, not even giving him the benifit of a name even when telling the story to the sailor.

The Branagh/DeNiro version that's been mentioned a bunch of times is faithful aside from a twist at the end. There's also a little remembered TV movie from like 1992 with Randy Quaid as the Monster that keeps the story mostly in tact. Beyond that I'd argue the first two Universal  movies and 'The Curse of Frankenstein' (1957) qualify as damn good if not faithful. ,DustyFeedbag,2018-10-15T23:01:02Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

They actually add some elements that I think were for verisimilitude, like a plague breaking out in the college-town, but I don't know if making it a period piece services the film in any meaningful way. The way in which they choose to portray the monster's creation is... inexplicable. It's got such vision in the stage design and the performance from Branagh, but it just ends up being incredibly stupid because it tries to make you feel whimsical even though the whole movie has been playing up a dreary mood of dower depressingness. Then they do it again later in the movie, and it's just as hilarious the second time around.

9biett,"Mary Wollstonecraft lead a tragic life. During the French Revolution she internalized Enlightenment principles like the “libertine lifestyle” aka sexual freedom, from an “oppressive and prude Christian society.” So she followed through and became sexually active. 
She got pregnant and the man left her while the blood was running through the streets of Paris. 
She wrote letters to him saying how much she missed him and how tyrannical men are, etc and then died, alone and the height of her despair. 
Mary Shelley read those letters and after nearly making the same mistake her mother did, when she found out “sexual revolution” was just a trick pulled by men to pump and dump women at their convenience. The women become victims because they forsook the shield of marriage and a stable family, so now they have to raise the kid on their own or get rid of it. “Feminism” was born from the horrors of the “sexual liberation”. This same process happens countless times, like in America during the 60s. 

Just like any other horror novel or film, Frankenstein is ultimately about the consequences of sex and unrestrained passion. The “free love” movement is a lie that destroys the familial structure and brings many negative feelings to everyone involved, like isolation, unloved, etc etc. Tragic lives inspires great works of art.

I think what was interesting, and not always picked up by people who liked to pithily go ""Victor was the real monster"" is that the monster does actually do some quite monstrous things. In the end, it's the choices that both of them make that leaves them where they are at the end.

I know some people also connect it to modern AI, although what we call AI now is a long way from the Bladerunner scenario, though the idea of a creation that we can no longer control is an interesting one to think about.",onemanandhishat,2023-10-30T11:49:24Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

17jl1ly,"From a philosophical and science fiction stance, I think the point is that whatever the Monster does is inherently the responsibility of Frankenstein as the one who brought him to life 

In a similar way, one could read that as a question about whether Victor is really responsible tho, if he was created by Someone as well. Where does that end?

I think that theme of “playing God” inherently goes back to the question of how well God plays, so to speak. Whether it’s Frankenstein’s Monster or Tyrell’s replicants or Cyberdyne’s terminators.",crichmond77,2023-10-30T15:19:41Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
17jl1ly,"I agree that's one of the questions that the story provokes. I think it comes through more clearly in something like the 1931 Frankenstein film where we get the iconic version of the monster, and the monster only harms people in self defence or by accident, like a child with too much strength, and has no experience of love or chance to learn how to live properly. 

The monster in the book has a hostile beginning, facing rejection. But it also learns and reads and develops a bigger understanding of the world, and chose to take actions like blackmail and murder, that it does fully knowing the seriousness of those actions, and even deliberately choosing them because it knows how bad they are in order to hurt Victor. For me, the book gives the monster enough knowledge after its early days that it should be held responsible for its later actions.",onemanandhishat,2023-10-30T23:54:36Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

1b1q8g8,"Came here hoping to remind myself what this type of novel is called, thank you! Also wanted to add that Gothic novels especially used the epistolary method, in Dracula it really works in its favour, because (like most Gothic literature) a big theme is veiled anxiety about the Industrial Revolution. Like how fear of ghosts was at an all time high when the camera was invented. In Dracula each character has a sort of diary, in which they confess their deepest thoughts and fears- all of them machines. Mina’s stenograph, Renfield’s phonograph, etc., and the villain is an immortal predator that can hypnotise, seduce and perfectly mimic a human to feed on human ‘essence’.

y3cp1i,"I agree with some points, and disagree with others. Overall, I love the book. One of my top favorite books of all time, and I've read it a dozen times. I just finished it a couple days ago, so it's still fresh on my mind, too.

I agree that some pages seem like filler. I think a big part of that is that Shelley wrote it in a different era than we know. Everything goes so fast for us, but 1818 would be much slower, The focus on details (like the Rhine scene you mentioned) would've been interesting for Elizabeth & Viktor, whereas what we're used to would be a video game, or a book, or our phone. Personally, I think maybe we're just not used to the times the book was written in. But I definitely can understand feeling it was unnecessary.

As for the characters, I definitely agree. I empathized with just about every character that was introduced, even the French villagers and the crew of the ship in the Arctic. That's one thing Shelley did really well, is allow the reader to connect with every character. It feels like maybe it was meant to help us connect with the Monster. If we could come to care for a character featured on 10 pages, then we could do the same for the Monster.

However Viktor only kinda abandoned the monster, he did leave the monster alone in his apartment but the monster went out into the world by himself Viktor never kicked him out. Of course that’s understandable as coming into existence is probably scary and confusing. 


Once Frankenstein is out and about and realizes how difficult living in this world is he doesn’t attempt to go back to Viktor and explain his troubles, he instead goes straight to killing a child. Viktor had sympathy for the monsters story and seemed to have an understanding that he failed to uphold his duties, but he could not get over the rage of his little brothers murder.

For instance, it seems to me a good fantasy or sci-fi  story should have, ideally, only ONE premise that is counterfactual (e.g. that a scientist can create life in a laboratory), and that premise should be established early in the story, and the rest of the story should be as realistic as possible, and should seem to flow naturally and logically from the premise.

ych7y2,"He actually learns French lol. But pedantry aside, from scratch is the only way for anyone to learn a language. The Creature admits that he spends months completely ignorant of what the inhabitants are saying but he realised understands the significance of communication between humans. By the time Safie arrives, he only has a very rudimentary knowledge - a few words which he repeats to himself. He then effectively receives language lessons by watching Safie's lessons. His complete mastery of the language is, admittedly, unlikely, since he rarely has cause to practise, even including the 3 rather heavy tomes he finds in the woods (Lives, Paradise Lost and Werter), but children do learn quickly. And I suppose we shouldn't forget that his fluency is related to us as readers through both Frankenstein and then Walton. 

His presence isn't noticed because... he's quiet, I guess? He doesn't crash around, he actively doesn't want to be noticed because of the treatment he first received. And the cottagers are happy to believe that a miracle provides them with firewood each night and clears a path in the snow, rather than an 8-foot tall newborn. 

Regarding how Frankenstein goes about it, he states that he would never reveal it, particularly to someone so driven by a passion for knowledge and scientific discovery like Walton, because he believes now that he was wrong to play God. However, galvanism is an implied method (he turns away from the out-of-date alchemists that shaped his youth when he sees lightning obliterate a tree). The assemblage of the body from stolen body parts is almost outright stated, Frankenstein mentions hanging around graveyards and charnel houses, he says he chose the best, biggest, most beautiful body parts for his creation, he knows that what he has done is so awful and grotesque and that he could never tell anyone, and when he tears apart his second Creature, he has the foresight not to leave human remains in a small hut in the Orkneys.

okms3f,"The monstrous part of Viktor Frankenstein is attaining the godly power to create life and immediately ditching all responsibility afterwards. He made the monster and left it in the world without guidance or protection it could rightly say he owed it. The Monster's feelings of rage against Frankenstein are those of a suffering mankind against an absent god in a cruel world. Only the Monster has the power and the means to hold his creator accountable. There's also some themes of a power struggle between father and son / creator and creation here (i.e. Chronos eating his children or Oedipus killing his dad).

This constellation is further fueled by the first three books the Monster finds and reads and which heavily form its outlook on the world: Milton's *Paradise Lost* (It's about a somewhat sympathetically described Lucifer rebelling against God and being thrown out of heaven), Goethe's *Sorrows of Young Werther* (A young romantic despares against the state of the world in general and fails to find love as his only potential remedy, so he eventually commits suicide - heavy on the *Weltschmerz* and ""existence is suffering"") and Plutarch's *Parallel Lives* (I'm not familiar with that one).

okms3f,"It's been a long time since I've read the book, but I'll explain the argument as best as I can.

Dr. Frankenstein essentially has the ambition of reanimating a human being without having any concern for the responsibilities that are inherent in the task.  He is so single-mindedly devoted to this goal (which one begins to realize is driven by his own vanity and ego rather than as a noble cause to further mankind) that he seriously deprives himself of sleep and then decides it would be a good idea to bring his creation to life while in this state.  He then panics at the sight of his own creation and runs away.  The first thing that Frankenstein's monster sees is the sight of his own father screaming at his existence.

The monster is a bit of an odd person, being both exceptionally intelligent and eloquent but also with the mentality and severe lack of discipline inherent of a child.  And much like a child, he has an inherent and extreme desire for affection, which is why he became so instantly enamored with the De Lacey family.  Remember that Frankenstein's monster has no fucking clue was is going on.  He literally is birthed in the middle of nowhere, a man screams at the sight of him, and he has no clue what to do, where to go, or what anything in the world is about.  He maintains the intellectual capacity of whatever brain was transferred to him, but no memory of any previous life.

The fact that he was so large and (presumably) hideous drove the De Lacey family to run from him despite him acting as friendly as possible.  Not only that, but they were \*so afraid\* at the mere sight of him that they fled their own home, possibly permanently.  If this didn't drive home that he would forever be denied the affection he so possibly craved, I don't know what would.  Dr. Frankenstein, through his moral failings, had trapped his creation in a living hell literally from birth.

So, naturally, Frankenstein is pissed, so when he comes across William and hears his last name, he flies into a rage, or what might be better described as a temper tantrum a young child would have.  Except that Frankenstein's monster is nearly 7 feet tall and swole as fuck and he's shaking a child as violently as he can.  It's not surprising that the child dies, although it is doubtful that murder was ever the creation's intent.  Imagine that if, every time you got angry during your terrible twos, somebody died a horrible and violent death, and that you \*also\* had the mental capacity to understand the implications of what you had just done.  Dr. Frankenstein, in making the creature so gigantic and failing to imbue him with either discipline or temperance, made it so that his creation could never have a proper outlet for his rage without harming an innocent, further cementing his living hell.

And the thing is, when Dr. Frankenstein *finally* comes back to meet his creation (and let's note that it took the death of a relative to drag his ass back to his son), Frankenstein's creation does not strike him in rage like he did William, demonstrating that he has clearly been affected by the consequences of his actions and is capable of empathy and introspection.  Instead, he begs Dr. Frankenstein to make him a wife so that he can have somebody to love, and promises to stay far away from people so that he can never hurt anybody ever again.

Dr. Frankenstein agrees to this, gets mostly done building her, changes his mind, and -- without consulting his creation or respecting him at all -- tears her limb from limb in front of his creation's eyes.  He literally tears apart any hopes that his creation has of happiness.  Like literally, physically tears them apart.  He then proceeds to abandon his broken-hearted, enraged, 7 foot tall creation to go fuck and marry his lover, showing no remorse, empathy, affection, or care for the welfare of anybody else in the area.  For all he knows, his creation could fly into a murderous rage and kill everybody in sight.  He gives zero shits, as long as he doesn't have to take responsibility or culpability for his actions and he can go and get his dick wet hundreds of miles away.

But Frankenstein's creation has grown wiser and more tempered since his birth, and he decides to punish his creator by forcing him to suffer in the exact same way that his creator made him suffer.  Just as Dr. Frankenstein had torn apart his wife *just before* he could spend the rest of his life with her in happiness and joy, his creation -- specifically on his wedding night -- tears apart his wife in front of Dr. Frankenstein's eyes.  It is a brutal act, and possibly also the first time in Dr. Frankenstein's life that he faced the consequences of his actions.

The punishment is even more layered, though.  The creation intentionally stays just far enough ahead of Dr. Frankenstein to keep him chasing him, choking on his rage until he finally succumbs to the experience and dies, perfectly mirroring what Dr. Frankenstein had done to his creation.  Frankenstein's monster lives in eternal, Doom-guy style rage at the loss of his wife and his mistreatment, a suffering that would only be ended with his death.

And Frankenstein's creation, even after doling out this punishment to his creator, is found weeping on Dr. Frankenstein's corpse, for all he ever wanted was the love of his father, but his father -- the true monster -- was incapable of such an emotion.  Convinced that nobody on Earth would ever see past his monsterous form, with no wife to love, and no father to guide him, he aims to die in a frozen wasteland, a physical metaphor for the lack of compassion that the world had shown him.",WolffUmbra,2021-07-15T07:54:55Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
okms3f,"I think the whole issue of the word monster may be throwing people off a bit. The novel doesn't actually ever call anyone a monster. It most often refers to Victor's creation as a ""creature."" Pointing out who and what is a monster is not really the underlying point.

I think you're right. Victor is flawed in ways that a lot of human beings are flawed. I actually think that's central to what the novel is saying.

Remember the second part of the title as it was originally printed: Frankenstein, Or the Modern Prometheus. Prometheus, as the story of the God who stole fire from the heavens to give to humans, is usually told nowadays as a positive thing. Fire is arguable man's first technological achievement. It gives us light, cooks our food, keeps us warm in the winter.

But think of the negative things that we also have used fires for. Burning people alive. Razing whole cities. Slashing down rainforests. Perhaps Zeus was right to be mad at the arrogant and naïve Prometheus for what he did.

And fires aren't even always used for outright destruction. Think of the ""gender reveal"" parties that accidentally started huge wildfires in the American west. Those terrible results are just from irresponsible use of fire.

Frankenstein is the Modern Prometheus because he is stealing power from the gods/God that mankind was never meant to have. The power to create sentient life. Unfortunately, mankind, unlike God, is imperfect. Not evil. Not monstrous. Just flawed. But even our ordinary run-of-the-mill flaws can lead to terrible consequences when combined with great power, no matter our initial intentions. In the case of Frankenstein, his ambition, unreliability, and inability to take ownership for his actions aren't all the uncommon. Most of the time, nothing terrible would result from these flaws. But when you combine them with the power to create life, it leads to his death and the death of most of those he loves.",ryes13,2021-07-15T12:40:12Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

okms3f,"The creature is the real monster, and that’s a hill I’m ready to die on. I was shocked when I finally read this book last year: I kept waiting for Frankenstein to do something messed up, or to hear what convoluted justification the creature had for murdering a child. But no! Victor was guilty of fleeing from a shambling inhuman thing, and the creature became a serial killer because people treated him bad. 

Could Frankenstein have assumed more responsibility? Yes. He acts pretty irresponsibly and downright cowardly, ditching years of work in a moment and not returning to check on things for ages. He’s one of these melodramatic Victorian characters who seems super irrational to modern ol’ me. But in his defense, he had no way of knowing what he had created, if it had feelings, even if it was going to survive for more than a few hours. It’s not like he saw this creation as a literal child and turned his back. He might have tried harder to work this question out, but I think the case of him being an absent father is overreaching. If anything his duty was to hunt and kill his creation to protect the public against an unknown element. The hubris angle would work better had he failed at what he was trying to do. I can totally accept that people will have different impressions of his culpability, and some will condemn him. I get that. But he is a Boy Scout compared to the creature. 

The creature is vengeful and cruel. He got dealt a bad hand, but he seems to have developed mental and moral faculties very quickly, and nearly as quickly decides his feelings and whims are more important than innocent people’s lives. He murders a kid to send a message. He lets an innocent woman die for his crime, he kills others just to terrorize Frankenstein. That’s cartoonishly monstrous. If the creature deserves our sympathy than so do school shooters. I’ll pass. 

As with all the classics, the population that pretends to know the book is dozens of times larger than the population that actually reads it. Saying that Victor is the real monster is just another piece of folklore that gets passes around which someone can use to appear smart. The absurd part is that probably 100% of people who haven’t read the book would be familiar with the idea that the monster is just misunderstood, so there is nothing novel with parroting that contrarian cleverness. 

Again, if you want to say victor is bad, okay, I can see that point of view. But man that creature is a villain.",saluksic,2021-07-15T08:35:34Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

He is clearly immoral and a murderer and that plays a big part in the plot and the decision to not make him a wife. He also views women as something he has a right to, which mirrors Mary Shelley's own experience. Victor Frankenstein is the flawed hero.

He just didn't know that the man he thought of as father was not that and that the guy he killed was just that.

Frankenstein himself, on the other hand, *has* a full life's experience.  He has the capacity and experience to reason out what the consequences of leaving an 8 foot tall monster free to run amok will be and he does so anyways.

Think of it this way, imagine the bible's garden of Eden story, except god creates Adam and immediately leaves the story before even presenting him with the choice of taking the knowledge of good and evil, he's a crude mockery of his creator instead of a handsome likeness, and instead of a beautiful garden he's abandoned in a strange cold place and has to flee into the forests alone and fend for himself.

If it did, then for instance Ezra Pound should be credited as a co-author of The Wasteland, and about a million more instances. Authorship is often far more complex and social than many people would recognize. 

Most scholars would say it's the wrong question to ask essentially. ""Did Mary Shelley write *Frankenstein*?"" is a question that most see as reeking of lingering sexism about how a young woman couldn't possibly have achieved what she did, it needlessly discredits an extremely talented woman. It distracts from far more interesting and fruitful questions about Percy and Mary's collaborative relationship and the impact they had on one another as artists.

>In May 1816, Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and their son travelled to Geneva with Claire Clairmont. They planned to spend the summer with the poet Lord Byron, whose recent affair with Claire had left her pregnant.[53] The party arrived at Geneva on 14 May 1816, where Mary called herself ""Mrs Shelley"". Byron joined them on 25 May, with his young physician, John William Polidori, [NB: Author the first modern vampire story]

>""It proved a wet, ungenial summer"", Mary Shelley remembered in 1831, ""and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house"".[57][note 5] Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they ""each write a ghost story"".[58][59] Unable to think of a story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: ""Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.""[60] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. ""Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated"", Mary noted, ""galvanism had given token of such things"".[61] It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her ""waking dream"", her ghost story:[62]

You have a bunch of young people, all with emotional and relationship baggage, spending a summer beside a lake in an isolated mansion telling ghost stories and trying to scare each other. One of the youngest of the group can't figure out any story to tell the others... until she has a waking nightmare in the middle of the night that inspires her to tell the scariest ghost story of all.

81ca11,"The monster was human. Our society likes to construct the notion of “human” as something good, pure and noble (it’s even turned into an adjective, “humane/inhumane”), but the truth is that there have been plenty of humans who have done a lot worse than this creature. Humans have inherent capacity for cruelty, abd intelligence doesn’t reduce it, on the contrary, some of the worst serial killers or cruel dictators like Hitler were also highly intelligent. But we also have inherent capacity for love. If you look at the most violent criminals, most of them had bad childhoods, they were often abused as children (which, studies show, is one of the best predictors of future criminal activity). The creature didn’t start out as evil, all he wanted was companionship. But he was abandoned by his creator, later shunned and rejected by him openly, and every human he’s met treated him the same way. All he asked was to be given a mate, a companion who’s like him, but Frankenstein denied him that. It was only expected that he would turn out like that. And most of his cruelty wasn’t random, he specifically targeted his creator, wanted to ruin his life as a revenge. Revenge too is a very human notion.

I think the point to make us question this distinction between “human” and “monster”. Humans can behave monstrously. “Monsters” can behave like humans. In a way, the monster was part of Frankenstein, his dark side that he rejected and tried to run away from. If he cared for his creation, nurtured him, raised him with love, he wouldn’t have become like this. It’s just like our own nature, it’s what we make of it.

While he was never officially named, Adam is the easiest way to refer to him. If this were made in Greece, he probably would have been named Hephaestus. As for the last name though, I think it makes sense to call him Frankenstein. You bring up a good point about Victor casting him out for his physical appearance and the symbolic meaning of no last name. But every chance the zombie (who I will call Adam for brevity) gets, he constantly returns to his creator. He is cast aside by his own creator, but still wishes to return to the grace of humanity. He can not escape the truth of his lineage, even if it was through the equivalent of adoption.

lefgpi,">I’m not going to lie, this was a hard read. Not because I couldn’t understand it, it’s because it’s in what I like to call “old English”... words that are long forgotten or sentence structures that we don’t use anymore.

Just to throw this out there, the 19th century vernacular in *Frankenstein* may seem a bit archaic at times, but it's definitely still Modern English.  Actual ""Old English"" (also known as Anglo-Saxon) was brought to Britain in the 5th century and gradually began to die out after the Norman Conquest (1066), when it was replaced among the ruling classes by Old Norman French.  It's the language of *Beowulf*, and it's totally unreadable to present-day English speakers.

The influences of Old Norman French (by the Normans, of course), Latin (by the Romans), and Old Norse (by the Vikings) slowly transformed Old English into Middle English, which *can* be difficult but is definitely readable.  Well-known 15th century works like *Canterbury Tales* and *Le Morte d'Arthur* were both written in Middle English, if you want to check them out.  But this was before spelling rules were standardized, so it helps to read them out loud.

Early-Modern English (or ""Elizabethan English"") had developed by the late-16th century, and it was most famously used in the works of William Shakespeare and in the King James Bible.  The first authoritative and full-featured English dictionary was published in the mid-18th century, which could arguably be considered the birth of Late-Modern English.  And then in the centuries that followed, British imperialism spread English all around the world.

lefgpi,"I love Frankenstein and I think it’s a great feminist work. >! Frankenstein takes on the female role of creating life, but his approach is typically masculine. He’s cold and clinical about the being he is creating, purely driven by his own ego and passion for his science. He has no emotional bond with his creation- he’s a parent but doesn’t act like one and never even thought about having to care for or guide the being once it came to life. He virtually abandons his own family while absorbed in his project, barely even writing to his father, and he fucks up all their lives in pursuit of his egotistical goals. I thought it was poignant that at the end of the book the creature mourns for Frankenstein as his father, even though Frankenstein had completely detached himself from that role and wasn’t capable of feeling anything but hate and fear for him. !<",snowysleepycozy,2021-02-07T16:20:41Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

The monster in the books was also described as beautiful - except for his horrific eyes, could speak multiple languages, and discourse on philosophy. The movie wanted to go for more of a traditional horror vibe (rather than the existential horror that the book was). So out went the beauty aspect and in came the body horror.

lefgpi,"So I know I'm gonna get some details wrong, but way back in the olden days when things were filmed in black and white, makeup didn't care about what actual color was used so long as it translated well into Black and White. What resulted is that a lot of green makeup was used in things to give sort of an unusual shade to faces. Again, I strongly encourage you to look this up, because this is second- (and now third-)hand hearsay. Basically green was used as B&W makeup and then they kept that practice up during color filming which created stereotypical Frankenstein's Monsters and Wicked Witches in color.

Also also, I hear (again, secondhand) that the original movie created around Frankenstein was a veeerrry old film. Like, film as a medium was still new. So the movie is listed as 71 minutes, which by today's standards is short. A lot of plot was cut from the movie, and I'm going to assume that a lot of the draw was from the horror of creating a creature and the film didn't focus so much on Dr Frankenstein's Bad Dad enactment. So it's an early example of the movie butchering the source material to appeal to audiences.

Not really, Frankenstein quite failed on his ambition to make a beautiful man:

His yellow skin scarcely covered the  work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,  and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only  formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost  of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his  shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",SwingJugend,2021-02-07T09:54:10Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

18t3tn9,"In terms of authorial intent it’s worth knowing that Shelly was deeply influenced by Milton’s Paradise lost. Which also delves into reader’s response theory because it was her reading of Paradise Lost, that casts Satan as a tragic hero betrayed, provoked, and cast out by his father - which is certainly his perspective in the novel (also expressed quite well by the angels in Dogma). 

This is why the creature says “Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”

Shelly casts Frankenstein as Milton’s God - her reading of him - the Father Figure of revealed (biblical) religion, and his creation as the victim of an arbitrary and neglectful creator. She makes a similar point about religion to Euripides- if we overly personify our God (or gods) in such human terms, their actions, in human terms, become horrific.",Katharinemaddison,2023-12-29T11:01:07Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

s963jk,"In high school, when I read Frankenstein, I hated it. Victor seemed like he was unable to change his path and future. He was unable to escape Fate which dictated all his actions. I hated him and it felt like a weird ye olde excuse that Fate and the Angel of Death were to blame for Victor being a dick. It also felt less epistolary compared to Dracula and other novels of that style.

Then I took a gothic lit class in college and we read the 1818 version (Mary's original) and the revised 1831 edition. 
Turns out, I had read the 1831 edition previously -- which Mary Shelley revised to make it less radical, removing a quote from Paradise Lost and other symbolism throughout, and making it more clear that Victor Frankenstein is a puppet to outside forces. It also expands some other areas greatly, such as a single sentence in Chapter 1 about Caroline turning into a multiple page reflection on childhood. Several passages from the Creatures perspective are edited out. Victor is made out to be more sympathetic.

The 1818 version, on the other hand, clearly underscores that all the decisions Victor made were his own. He has significant freewill and can choose to deviate his course but does not. On one hand, this makes him frustrating, but also more believable as a character. Victor is a shitty person and we, the audience, understand this and he is slightly more aware of this fact -- making him, in my opinion, more tolerable. In this version, the Creature is more sympathetic. I also found the 1818 edition to be more believable as an epistolary work, more to the point, and more capital-R Romantic than the 1831 edition. 

Here's a summary of the changes:
https://edwardfjames.com/teaching/frankenstein-1818-and-1831/

Worth noting, as well, that the 1831 version was the most successful in a cultural level and the one from which most adaptations are based off of.

He's often criticized for being a douchebag and not accepting responsibility for the consequences he created, but I find that while his irresponsibility is inexcusable, it is understandable (even relatable for some) and not motivated by any fundamental moral fault. His motive is self-centered, sure, but his actions are a reflection of his inability to escape the logical hierarchy that he has built for himself (the Ti-Si loop). His life is basically a constant confirmation that his ideals are part of reality rather than an active effort to ignore them. He basically is surrounded by very obvious signs of his wrongdoings, and yet I feel that he is so overwhelmed by grief, pain, and incapacity to accept anything outside the strict logical hierarchy he has built for himself (this idealism is also something that the Creature suffers to, but he learns to change). These feelings are an integral part of the human experience, though it is the ""dark side"" of it. I guess where I'm trying to get at is instead of seeing the black-and-white scenario of characters like Frankenstein, we should try to understand why they behave a certain way and help these people out of their isolation rather than further isolating them.",Ok-Thanks1018,2023-01-28T16:22:34Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Each time I read a review or analysis, there is always a new and cogent interpretation that adds to our collective understanding. It's a text that keeps giving. (In one of my introductory English courses in college, my professor armed us with several lenses with which to read the novel — one of them was the relationship between Victor and his creature as a homoerotic one. In another audio-analysis on Spotify, a professor noticed a relationship between oppressed people and the creature, being forced into hiding from an ignorant population and denied basic dignities. These discussions will likely continue until the end of literature itself.)

(Also edit: the well-known anecdote that the descriptions of the creature were eerily similar to Shelley's journaled description of her stillborn baby.)

(Also edit edit: The director of the original *Frankenstein* films was [James Whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whale), who was openly gay throughout his entire career.

mzcnem,"The book is awesome, especially given the context of how/when it was written.  The original adaptations came along when monster movies - and movies in general - were getting hugely popular and lost a lot of complex characterization for the sake of thrills/drama/scares.  I'm not judging, it was just the times.

If you get a chance, read some of the ""monster"" books from the 19th century that were ultimately turned into movies in the mid-20th century (e,g. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, etc.) There were a lot of things lost in translation between book and film.  I guess it's not really different today.  ""The Turn of the Screw"" was faithfully adapted in the 20th century a few times, but I always found that one boring.

In ""Frankenstein's"" case, what was really lost was that they turned the ""monster"" from an embittered, suffering, lamenting, tortured soul into a confused, lumbering, child-like monster.  And they change Dr. Frankenstein from an unempathetic, egomaniacal a-hole with a god complex into a misunderstood scientist who struggles to manage his resurrected man-child.

I think the best movie adaptation was the one from the early 1990s with Robert DeNiro and Kenneth Branaugh, though the cast was wrong.  It was pretty loyal to the book in spirit and complexity of character.  Alternatively, the ""Frankenstein's monster"" character in the ""Penny Dreadful"" series is a pretty nice adaptation as a character....the series itself, not so much, of course.",ZebrahCadebrah,2021-04-27T09:07:22Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Shelley's thesis is personal and psychological.  Kaczynski was making a more general argument about technology and its social and political implications.

Another way of looking at it is that  Kaczynski's thesis is only true if one accepts the premise that political freedom is valuable. So,  Kaczynski's thesis is only going to resonate in certain cultures.

Shelley was pretty hooked up on technology, she drank her own kool-aid and believed lots of quacks saying they had actually reanimated a cadaver using the ideas from her book.

I'd say she didn't think the allegories in that book from beginning to end, and wasn't worried with revolutions (industrial, social, technological, French or otherwise) as much as she was worried with personal choices of individual scientists.

On the other hand, The Unabomber Manifesto has deeper roots that it shows. Kaczynski was a reader of critics of the industrial revolution that were also critics of gender roles and labor specialization (industry requires specialists, specialization creates and reinforce social roles, social roles based on gender create violence). Before going bombing, he broke relations with these people. He admitted being very confused at the time with how his own gender (and possible sex change) and specialized work (educated scientist) fit the criticism of industry, broke up with the theorists and went kabooming stuff as an outlet to his frustration.

The story of how he got to be so Bad is the heart of the novel, sheltered innermost: told to Victor in the first person by the creature himself, then nested inside of Victor's own narrative, which is nested in its turn in the letters of the arctic explorer Robert Walton. However much of ''Frankenstein's'' longevity is owing to the undersung genius James Whale, who translated it to film, it remains today more than well worth reading, for all the reasons we read novels, as well as for the much more limited question of its Luddite value: that is, for its attempt, through literary means which are nocturnal and deal in disguise, to *deny the machine.*

While her husband and the people she hung out with were Romanticists in a strict sense, I'm not sure the same can be said for Mary Shelley. For me, a lot of what Frankenstein is about is how the failure to take responsibility can ruin your life. Victor created the Creature, but failed to show it love, or anything besides cruelty. Therefore, his creation destroyed him. Before writing Frankenstein, Mary lost a child, and her husband was constantly running around sleeping with other people, and failed to help her through that difficult time. Mary may have felt that the miscarriage she had was her version of a monster. She was also trapped in a loveless marriage, and while it gave her freedom, it also ostracized her from participating in society back home. In a way, Percy Shelley's lack of desire to help her after the miscarriage could be seen as irresponsible. Mary eloping with a famous poet could have also been viewed as irresponsible. And while I think she wouldnt have wrote Frankenstein if her life had been different, I do think it's more about how it's important to hold to our responsibilities to provide love and care for each other.",s0rdiid,2020-10-25T21:42:53Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

As far as I remember, nothing else regarding Frankenstein's research and scientific discovery is even slightly relevant to the book. And while the creation of the monster as a consequence of that is very far from meaningless, I don't think that it was particularly thematically fitting with much else from the book.

I think the closest you can get  to a major theme that relates to the myth is ""responsibility for what you create"", but that's barely even a theme in the myth of Prometheus itself, and somewhat more broadly applicable as used in Frankenstein.

If all the book is saying is ""technology bad"", then all the interpersonal relationships (and the trauma caused by a lack thereof) are meaningless window dressing. It discounts the role that humanity's inhumanity to man and willingness to ostracize the ""other"" plays in the ultimate downfall of both creator and created.

4ldsx0,"I think most people tend to read the novel and stop analyzing past ""SCIENCE BAD, NO PLAY GOD."" But that is a shallow reading that doesn't come close to approaching some of the best themes of the novel. 

In my mind, Frankenstein does two things that qualify as monstrous. 

1. He suffers a bizarre and unnatural attachment to his mother. I think the incestual and oedipal themes are apparent throughout the first few chapters of the book. He calls his future wife his ""more than sister"". She's all at once a cousin, sister, and wife. That's odd even for the time period. It's also the death of his mother that drives him toward the breaking point. 

2. He is profoundly self centered in a way that makes him seem completely inhuman. During the trial of Justine he says, ""The tortures of the accused did not equal mine.""

 This poor girl is being put on trial for a murder she didn't commit and is in-fact less guilty in its occurring than he is, yet he believes his ""suffering"" to be more than hers? He cannot get past his own ego to experience empathy.

Because Frankenstein is the narrator, we experience the story through his self-pitying tone, which paints the monster in worse light than we might if he was the protagonist (which he kind of is in part of the narration and he is more sympathetic here).

Monster is a bit of an overstatement but I think Shelley definitely wanted us to sympathise more with the monster, similar to Milton and Satan in Paradise Lost. Personally, the main reason I believe Frankenstein is portrayed so negatively is because of Shelley's femenist views. He disregarded Elizabeth, destroyed the female monster and abandoned the creature, who is often considered symbolic of women as a whole. Because of this, he had to suffer and be shown negatively. This said, it's a fairly morally ambiguous novel.

4ldsx0,"Ok, so there are two ways Mary Shelley defines morality in the novel. Victor Frankenstein is punished, but is it for bad science or bad faith? Does he play God or does he not take responsibility for his experiments? Both are plausible and can be argued thoroughly. Victor creates life, something reserved only for God, and by tampering with morality, he creates a malicious creature. BUT when he first created it, he couldn't stand the uncanny horror of it, so he ignored it. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. Imagine not caring for your baby after you've given birth to it. How does that affect the child as it grows on its own? Look up Feral Children for some examples. If Victor were a good scientist, he would have taken responsibility for his creation from the beginning and raised it to be better, but since he didn't, the creature's actions are partially Victor's fault. This is what makes him a monster.

There is a third definition of morality in the novel that most people miss. The creature refers to Victor as his ""Author"" on at least two occasions. The creature, in this manner, is an allegory for the Novel, and Victor is the author. Mary Shelley first wrote the novel to scare her freinds, who were authors, so it's plausible that she continued that motif in Frankenstein. The creature roaming the world is not too different than when one releases a novel. It meanders, forever changing the lives of those it touches. For better, or for worse. It becomes its own entity outside the author's control. People interpret and ignore and reimagine without the author's presence too correct them.

4ldsx0,"I think the reason why the monster turns out to be a fiasco is because of the way Victor Frankenstein reacts to him as he comes to life. He shows an unmasked disgust towards him which causes him to feel indignation and after Victor flees, these feelings get bolstered into a deep sense of abandonment and alienation. The underpinnings here could be that if one chooses to bestow 'life' upon an entity, be it an artificially created body or a child or a piece of intelligent technology, one must also have immense respect for that life itself because the entity, once independent, has the ability to think and evolve layers of consciousness. A creator being malevolent or apathetic towards his creation could be potentially dangerous. If Victor Frankenstein was forthright enough to sense the danger that the monster could bring about he should have diligently applied his science to also put a prompt and respectful end to his life instead of running away. Victor Frankenstein could have been a scientist extraordinaire but he lacked a sound system of ethics and he failed to think on his feet in the midst of a crisis.

As another poster mentioned, Mary Shelley lost her mother. Keep in mind though, that Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft (who was an accomplished writer herself, see *A Vindication of the Rights of Women*) died in childbirth; Mary Shelley didn't just lose her mother, but was actively (though unintentionally) responsible for her death. 

Her father, William Godwin, cast her off and remarried, perhaps blaming Mary for the death of her mother, perhaps never truly forgiving her, perhaps never truly forgiving himself for his part in her loss. Mary *was* a creation who was capable of ""destruction"" (although we know the death of her mother wasn't truly her fault) and rejected by her creator. Godwin rejected his creation, even as she was only learning how to be a human being. She/the creature is a victim of circumstance.

It does when the ignorance is not of a moral nature. Give a very primitive native a loaded and unsafed gun, and he shoots his own child because he is ignorant of its use. This is a monstrous result, sure, but the native is not a monster. In effect, the giver is kind of the monster here because of the nature of the gift.

hpwhxb,"Hi! I think it's not so much that the creature is innocent, but there are two common misconceptions about the novel: first, that the creature is named Frankenstein (he's clearly not); second, that Frankenstein is a victim (he's clearly not). 

There are different types of readings you can make of the novel, but the way we interpreted it in class last semester was: 

1. Victor is always blaming others over his responsibility. He says that if his dad had taught him better, he wouldn't have been interested in the science of the guys that actually led to his experiments. He blames the creature for being horrible (and thus rejects him), when he is the one who made him. 
2. He does not save Justine. He suspects that the creature was guilty of the murder of his brother, and he can easily explain something to that end (at least to Justine, to appease her of her guilt), but he remains mum. Not only is he condemning her to death (just because he assumes the jury will find her innocent), but he also lets her die with her believen herself to be guilty. 
3. Victor creates the creature without giving second thought to what he is doing. His megalomania gets the best of him as he thinks he is above Man and above God, and believes himself to be a source of life. Yet he does not concern himself over the looks of the creature (not that he should be aiming to make someone like Chris Hemsworth, but, you know, at least not someone hideous). And the second the creature is created, Victor shuns it and rejects it. 

The creature, highly intelligent and capable of acquiring knowledge as he is, is tormented by his looks - no one who sees him will ever accept him due to the hidesousness that he was born to. This leads to constant rejection, violence and solitude. I'm not justifying the creature's murders, because he's conscious of what he's doing to Victor's brother and to Elizabeth, but at first, when he is unaware of what he is doing (like the little girl drowning), it's an accident. 

And then there's Elizabeth. Victor is so self-centered that he doesn't contemplate the possibility of sharing the truth with the woman who's supposed to be his partner, and his narcissism and selfishness lead to her death. If he had told her the truth, they could have sought some form of help or she would have been at least aware so as to try to avoid the creature. 

So, overall, I think the issue is that the creature becomes violent and a murderer because of the way in which he is created and due to the rejection of society upon him, based entirely on his physical appearance, yet Victor is the bigger a-hole if you will, because he never considers the consequences of his actions, he never considers coming clean to his peers (or he does at once but thinks that he won't be believed so he shrugs off the idea), alerting the police, letting Elizabeth know, or, you know, not trying to play God.",,2020-07-12T16:01:34Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
hpwhxb,"I also recently finished the book and although I appreciate your review, I disagree with the innocence in which you paint Frankenstein's character. The flippancy in which Frankenstein rejects and disregards his creation, even at the time of creation when the creature is most helpless and alone, implicates responsibility over the circumstances that then proceed. You say a father cannot be responsible for the actions of his child - but what about if you considered the situation if this were the story of a father and child, rather than of a father and monster? Certainly, the monster is evil too, especially after he is fully sapient and understanding of his crimes. However, as someone else said, the monster's actions are those of someone who is desperate, while Frankenstein's actions are those of someone who is selfish and egotistical. Frankenstein gambles with people's lives the entire book - is haphazardly risking an innocent friend's life that much better than actively taking a life? I think this discussion is really what makes the novel so fascinating - it really provokes the thoughts of how the reader assesses responsibility, how the reader perceived who is a victim, and how the reader determines accountability of someone based on the circumstances that led them to committing an act. In my opinion, both parties are guilty, but Frankenstein is primarily responsible for igniting the flame, ignoring every aspect of human nature (as he perceives his creation as lacking human nature - would the situation not have been avoided if he treated the monster as a human? Instead he gives him the mental ability of a human, denies him his humanity, and then shuns him for acting on his human nature when faced with desperation and solitude), and failing to take any responsibility for his actions.

Edit: thinking more about it, it is even worse than I initially thought. The novel is written by Frankenstein as the protagonist. And even still, we feel that he holds responsibility in his actions. Yet, he is the author, writing the events how he perceives them. This creates massive bias of us viewing the monster as a monster, and a wretched creature. So we further perceive and characterize the monster as evil and Frankenstein as the victim. However, at the time when we hear the monster's tale of his story at the cabin, we empathize with him as we understand he is only human. Then we go back to Frankenstein's perspective, further removing the monster's narratives, abandoning his feelings, and heightening our concept of him as evil.

The gods tortured Prometheus for eternity for the crime of giving fire to humankind (which he is also often crediting with creating from clay) and possibly their ability to procreate again. While there are multiple interpretations of this set of legends, one common variant considered popular in 18th and 19th centuries is one based on fire being roughly equivalent to the ability to commit mortal sins through industry as well the connotations of original sin. 

Consider with this that Mary Shelley’s father was an early utilitarian who was a major critic of the aristocracy. 

So, Victor Frankenstein is the prime immoral agent, creating life from nothing. He creates not a child but a full-grown man, giving no consideration to raising it morally. He abandons it and gives Adam nothing, no love, no comfort, no education, nothing. 

In this act of extreme negligence, Victor thus unleashed a creature with the strength and vigor and natural drives of a human animal onto the world. He then takes no steps to protect others, keeping his creation to himself, not bearing the responsibility of either hunting down the creature and ending the situation or revealing to the authorities all that he can so that they’ll take action. 

Victor plays god but acts like a selfish brat when faced with the consequences, essentially. And then people die again and again. He is aloof from society and its institutions, caring only to preserve himself and his safety. And he doesn’t even recognize his motives usually. 

In refusing to create the woman for Adam, he deprives Adam of the one possible and central drive that humans have, thus making the creature worse than he was before. By this point, Adam has learned to read and has seen and even felt the joy of human companionship. However, Victor has made him so ghastly in appearance that he is rejected by strangers. He then returns to the only person he knows who can and will help him, his creator. 

While we might blame this on the strangers being unkind, this isn’t a normal situation. If Victor wanted to  be God, then he should have taken care to give the creature the visage of a good and wholesome person, rather than merely making it “good enough”. In some ways, this reflects the growing connection between aesthetics and ethics, which is explored on The Strange Case in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and other works of the time. Victor’s insulated moral wickedness is reflected in the physical deformity of Adam and the social isolation it brings to him. 

I’ve wandered a bit but those are some somewhat brief thoughts on why Victor is ultimately immoral rather than the creature alone.",ebookish1234,2020-07-12T16:42:21Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
hpwhxb,"TLDR: You fail to consider the monster’s mental health/social development at all, and you are way too forgiving of Victor’s many  shortcomings. 


Frankenstein does build a new body out of parts and gives it life, but he doesn't do it to create a servant, a soldier, or a monster. 

• Debatable. Victor frequently refers to the creature as his slave who should be obeying its master. At best, he fears and despises the creature for being ugly, and refuses to acknowledge that as a sentient being, the creature has certain needs and rights that Victor is responsible for providing. 

He does it out of (admittedly misguided) scientific curiosity and expects that his experiments will help mankind. 

• Again, debatable. I think you’re giving Victor too much credit, he speaks about “earning his place” more than he does helping others. In fact, he specifically says his interest in the life sciences was about achieving personal glory. Additionally, his curiosity isn’t misguided. If he hadn’t been such a coward, and cared for his creation, he really would have changed the world for the better. 

After giving life to the body, he realizes his mistakes 

• what mistake? Everything worked perfectly. 

and flees his laboratory, only to later return and find the creature missing. This is pretty much the only thing that Frankenstein does wrong in the novel, in my opinion, rejecting his own creation at first. 

• Letting Justine die, lying to Elizabeth, lying to the monster, destroying the bride, and allowing everyone who cared about Victor to suffer for his vanity? That all gets a pass? 

This does mean that Frankenstein is somewhat responsible for everything that happens next, but it is not all too different from a regular child in my opinion. A father cannot be blamed for the crimes of his son, regardless of how they were raised.

• Frankenstein creates an adult and unleashed it on the world, running away from the consequences. It’s not child abandonment, it’s more akin to opening a tiger cage at a zoo. 

The creature, at first with the mind of a newborn, unable to speak and with no memory, flees into the forest and lives of nuts and berries. Eventually, he finds refuge in a hovel next to the house of a family, from which he learns to speak and read by eavesdropping on them. When he tries to approach them to take him in as a friend, they are scared away by his hideous appearance. The creature starts hating all of humanity after this, but especially his creator, whose name he has now learned.

This is the turning point for me when considering which of the two of them are the most monstrous. I think that many people have gotten the idea that the creature is either a mindless beast or has the intelligence of a small child that doesn't know what they are doing. After this point, the creature is just as intelligent and eloquent as any other adult. In fact, since the family he was learning from was a noble family, 

• they weren’t, they were three people living in a cottage. Minor point, but it’s a strange detail to change.

he is probably more intelligent by the 18th-century standard. 

• why does it matter how well he’s is able to read and speak? You act like the emotional and mental health of the creature doesn’t matter because he is able to read well, and I don’t understand why. People aren’t robots. We don’t raise children by throwing them into the woods with a few books and checking in on them once they’ve memorized it. Humans are social creatures, and without proper social development they go insane. The monster’s experiences would never have allowed for anything but a raging lunatic to develop. 

It is only now that the creature begins performing actions out of hatred for Frankenstein. He travels to Frankenstein's hometown of Geneva, finds Frankenstein's younger brother and kills him. He then frames one of their childhood friends for the murder, for which she is hanged.

• which again Victor could easily have stopped

It is at this point you wonder; surely it would be morally justified for the creature to attack and kill Frankenstein himself, but how can it be justified that it kills his brother and gets their friend sentenced to death? Neither of them knew anything about Frankenstein's work or had anything to do with it. The creature is fully sentient, sapient, and aware of its action, so surely it must be evil at this point? Many people have been rejected by society for a number of things but do not go on killing sprees for it.

• sure, the creature is morally wrong here. But you, much like Victor, are somewhat obtuse lay refusing to look at things from the creatures perspective. He declares war against all of humanity, because all of the humans he’s interacted with have reacted with hatred, disgust, and fear, all because he is different looking. He has never been treated with kindness, or been able to build healthy social bonds, or know a mother’s love. All of the essential steps in healthy development are skipped. He acts like a feral beast because, despite his literacy, he is. 

After this, the creature demands that Frankenstein build him a female companion, 

• entirely reasonable, this is the least victor could do. No man is an island. 

after which they will disappear in the South American jungles forever. If he does not do it, the creature threatens to kill Frankenstein's bride on their wedding night. 

• this is completely false. The monster makes no threats to Victor until after watching his only hope for happiness destroyed. 

After initially agreeing, Frankenstein changes his mind and destroys the female. He does not do this either out of hatred, revenge, or malice. 

• Seriously? Hatred, revenge, and malice are perfect descriptions of Victor’s motivations. 

He is worried that the female will either hate the male creature, turning him even worse, that she will be eviler than him, or that they will have children that eventually destroy humanity. 

• again, Victor’s post hoc rationalizations for why he did a horrible thing shouldn’t be taken as fact. He’s been making excuses for himself all novel. 

For betraying him, the creature kills Frankenstein's best friend and his new wife.

Am I wrong in thinking that the creature himself did just as much wrong or more than Frankenstein did? 

• if you make a tally sheet of the actions of each of them with no context, sure, the monster did worse things because murder is worse than just about anything. But looking at things in such a simplistic lense isn’t really helpful. 

Frankenstein has only himself to blame for his misery, 

• and yet he doesn’t. He blames a lot of people and forces outside of his control, but never has a serious moment of introspection. To his dying breath, he blames his creation for everything that happened after he fled the lab. Even his creation, as deranged as he is, is able to have a higher degree of self awareness for the wrongness of his actions than Victor. 

but what about all of the innocent people that the creature killed, all of them after he gained the intelligence of a normal person? I honestly expected a much different story based on what I have heard about it over the years, with the creature often discussed as misunderstood or friendly in nature, rather than the hateful, revenge-seeking, murderer it is in the book.

• he read a half dozen books in a forest, and you’re ready to deem him as responsible for his actions as an adult? Just because he has more sophisticated linguistic intelligence does not mean he has any degree of emotional maturity, social intelligence, or mental stability. Also, why does the abuse he’s suffered not mean anything? Victor is a rich kid with loving parents, friends, a healthy love life, and still manages to be a terrible person. The monster is forced to live on the fringes of society, constantly shunned, belittled, and demonized by everyone. He isn’t given a name. He is never shown any respect. How does he ever have the opportunity to become better than he does?",Canuckleball,2020-07-12T19:52:02Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
hpwhxb,"Frankenstein's monster had no moral compass.  So the fact that he killed without guilt is no surprise. However, Frankenstein created him and he had a moral obligation to find his creation and either kill him or teach him how to exist in society by instilling morals in him. Personally, I think Frankenstein was the real asshole.  He knew his creation was killing people.  He let an innocent person be hung instead of pleading for their life on humanitarian grounds.  Instead, he wrung his hands and shrugged, what could I do?  He spoke with his creation and agreed to make a mate for him. If he was against the idea he should have said so. He realized that his creation was basically a killing machine, he should have killed him instead he let people die because he didn't have the balls to fix the mess he made.

hpwhxb,I always saw it as a God (or parent) abandoning it's creation. Intent has little to do with it when you create life. His creation bears no responsibility for its actions until it reached an age of cognitive understanding.

hpwhxb,"I think a big theme of this book is creation. I agree with you that the creature acts in terrible ways but I think that this is because of the neglect he suffers and complete rejection. I believe that Mary Shelley wants us to consider the whole idea of creation and what this means, what is right and what is ‘owed’. I think a lot of the creatures dialogue around being ‘Adam’ gets at this. Frankenstein is his creator and wrong to just abandon him. 

Within this you can then start to wonder about morality and the role of nature vs nurture. Was the creature made bad as a result of Frankenstein rejecting him, followed by other people rejecting him too?

I also think you can’t overlook the title of ‘modern prometheus’. To some extent the creature is there to represent the means by which Frankenstein is punished for going against the ‘natural’ creation in favour of science.

I think it’s such a shame this book is misunderstood by people who haven’t read it due to it being misrepresented in film. It has some very interesting ideas and themes.",BeingKhaleesi,2020-07-12T20:40:10Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
hpwhxb,"I think what people mean when they say “Victor Frankenstein is the monster” is just about the name “Frankenstein” : in popular culture, the monster is called Frankenstein, and his creator is some nameless mad scientist. In the novel, the monster does not have a name. 

So the statement is not about which one is morally worse. Although, as you point out, it’s an interesting question. 

The book is brilliant, no? Some say it created the genre of science fiction. 

I think one of the reasons it is so good is that it can be interpreted in so many ways. It was written by a pregnant 18-year-old woman (who had previously miscarried), so “creating life” can be read as childbirth, and the relationship between the creator and monster is about parenthood. 

Or: her poet husband “created” her as an artist, so she is the monster. 

Or: the relation between creator and created is a metaphor for the relationship between God and man. We are all the monster. 

Or: the monster is a metaphor for technology. Recent developments in artificial intelligence are already considered to be an existential threat to humanity. So we currently have armies of Victor Frankensteins working to create new monsters every day, and as a culture we are in the process of repeating his errors.",honkeur,2020-07-12T16:17:13Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Frankenstein created the monster because he came obsessed with power and forbidden knowledge. When he succeeded he bailed and refused to take responsibility for what he had created. 
Like a shit father basically. 
Frankenstein had a good upbringing and a family so should have known better. 

The creature had to learn everything by himself. He didn't get taught right from wrong because his father left and had to learn everything himself. Because of the worlds reaction to his appearance he was always going to be ostracised so he learnt pain rather than love. Which is why he demanded a wife, and why he killed Justine as revenge. 

Frankenstein is the monster because he sort out forbidden knowledge (necromancy), created something that couldn't function in society, and refused to teach it when it was born.

Frankenstein, however, is the monster who created the situation that led to those. He created life out of his own selfish desires for success and fame and never stopped to think about the ramifications. Then, when he saw what he had created, he abandoned it and made no attempts to find it or fix the mistakes he had already made. On top of all that, Frankenstein consistently shows more care for himself than the people around him. He doesn’t stop to think, in his own selfishness and self obsession, that someone else might be the target of the monster on his wedding night.

The fact that it takes the constant disgust and fear from human beings to turn him towards revenge makes him a more complicated character.

Is the Creature still responsible for the murder? Yes. But it’s easy to imagine that if Frankenstein had been more involved the Creature never would have turned to murder in the first place. The Creature still has agency but much of his worldview was shaped by a neglectful creator.

Frankenstein’s hamatia is his ego and the rejection of his creation. Well that and the fact that he still lets Justine die. Is he a 100% bad person? No. But he does create the situations through his abandonment that leads to much of his own suffering.

I look at the book from a few different perspectives; how it shines a light on society, religion, technology, feminism, and responsibilities. In all ways of looking at it both Frankenstein and the creature have good and bad qualities, the reader can sympathize with, and despise, both characters easily and equally. However, I do not think they are direct parallels to eachother so I don't think it's fair to say either are worse than the other.

In my personal opinion I think they're both as bad as eachother, it's one of the reasons I love the book so much as there isn't supposed to be a single character that is the clear monster of the story; instead it forces you to think about why they are the way they are and suddenly the larger concepts become the subject of discussion. 

Also as a sidenote, if you can find it National Theatre have a recorded version of the stage play with Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Lee Miller who play Frankenstein and the creature interchangeably.

wwudjn,"it's so tragic to see the contrast between the way people treat the monster and his capacity for generosity/friendliness.  it's clear he would have been exceedingly kind if he had been treated with kindness.  He shows more patience with his poor treatment than pretty much any human would.

frankenstein's shock and dismay at the horror of the monster is understandable.  I think his trauma comes not just from realizing how ugly the monster is, but from realizing that his grand experiment which he expected to be a worthy endeavor turned out to be so antithetical to nature.  he flouted a dramatic law of nature and expected to feel triumphant for it.  The whiplash of his fear from seeing how abominable the monster was traumatized him, especially since he thought this moment would be proud, and he seemingly didn't realize that the monster has intelligence.

but once the monster demonstrates his intelligence to frankenstein, frankenstein should have reevaluated. it's frustrating that he refuses to try to see the monster's perspective.  I can sympathize with frankenstein's horror and disgust at the results of his experiment, but at a certain point once he knew of the monster's sentience, he should have considered that the monster's utter rejection from the world it lives in is his own fault and that it's his responsibility as its creator to fix things (and not just by killing the monster). he had years of time to empathize with the monster, but he did not.  I wonder how much of that comes from his sheer disgust with the monster, and how much of that comes from an involuntary refusal to acknowledge the monster's humanity (which would then force frankenstein to admit his awful treatment of an intelligent being).

wwudjn,"The most circulated version of ‘Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus’ is the 1831 text—so you most likely would’ve read that. 

As one of the other commentators said, the 1818 text and the 1831 text are considered definitively different works. Definitely worth comparing the two if you have the time. :) 

For funsies, I’d recommend reading them alongside: Wollstonecraft’s ‘Vindication’ to see how Shelley was inspired by her mother and Paradise Lost to see what allusions she drew from that text. (The wretch reads Paradise Lost and not the Bible)

Also, Frankenstein may not be lauded as a pop culture icon like Harry Potter, but it is immensely celebrated within Gothic studies and the like. Definitely deserves better than man with bolts in head.

zectyy,"Jane Austen also does this in Sense and Sensibility (same era). A female character is very depressed, isn't taking care of her health, and then gets a bad fever from having wet socks.

I think the idea, especially with Frankenstein, is that he's not taking care of himself and thus becomes ill. We know with the first creation, he was working night and day and not really eating, so it makes sense that he would become sick. And then the second really bad fever is after creation 2, and a severe shock.

It's the idea that mental distress can weaken you, and they aren't wrong. This does happen to people even today (though we have better cures).",RoseIsBadWolf,2022-12-07T02:36:40Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

Its creator, in fact, gave it life only to immediately abandon it and live in denial.

vau3yu,"One very important point about the ending to keep in mind is the framing device. Remember, this book doesn’t end with Frankenstein or the Creature giving thoughts on the nature of humanity. It ends with Walton deciding not to continue his pursuit of scientific knowledge at the expense of humanity. Victor also started his journey wanting scientific knowledge; but neither wants knowledge for knowledge’s sake. They both talk about their dreams of glory for being the ones to “discover” in their respective fields. Both the Creature and Frankenstein make excuses about their nature and how their parents set them on their paths (Victor’s father let him read terrible science books, the Creature’s father abandoned him). The opening letters to Walton’s sister mirror that, but listening to Victor’s tale changes him and allows him to realize he can’t abandon humanity in exchange for glory. The book isn’t about “science=bad.” It’s about maintaining humanity and listening to others. I see the ending as hopeful because Walton decides not to make the mistakes, Victor and the Creature did. He listens to the crew and chooses life over potential glory (or infamy, in the Creature’s case). Walton is a Victor who makes the right decision.",idroled,2022-06-12T22:35:41Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

f10h7f,"Some background is in order.

At the time she wrote Frankenstein, Mary was living in Switzerland with her step-sister Claire.  

She was a second-generation modern.  Her mother,  Mary Wollenscraft, had written a tract called *A Vindication of the Rights of Women,* and had lived with a married man and borne a child out of wedlock.  Her father, William Godwin, was a minister turned freethinker, author of a radical critique of society called *Social Justice, a*nd a social novel, *Caleb Williams.*

Poet Percy Blyshe Shelley had been dismissed from Oxford University in 1811 for authoring a pamphlet entitled *The Necessity of Atheism.*  He sought out Godwin as the foremost freethinker of the day.  He met Mary Godwin at her parent's home in 1814 when she was sixteen.  With the aid of Mary's stepsister, Claire, he eloped with her.  Shelley was five years older, and married, with a child and another on the way, but no matter.

She began Frankenstein in 1816, when she and Shelley were living with Claire near Geneva, Switzerland.  She had borne Shelley two children, one of whom had died two months after birth. She and Shelley would not be married until December of that year, when his previous wife committed suicide.

Their party was joined by poet George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), with whom Claire was having an affair and would bear a daughter in 1817.  He and Shelley hit it off well.  Along with Byron was his physician, Dr. John Polidori.

The weather was inclement, and they were amusing themselves by reading ghost stories. Lord Byron proposed to the party that each of them should write a ghost story. All agreed to try.  Shelley had been pushing Mary to write as her parents had.  But she foundered on coming up with a story.

The impasse was broken when she listened to a conversation between Byron and Shelley.  They were discussing whether the underlying principle of life might be discovered, and referred to the experiments of Dr. Erasmus Darwin (the grandfather of Charles Darwin), who had preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass jar till it exhibited independent motion, with galvanism likely involved.  Luigi Galvani had performed experiments where he caused severed frog's legs to move through the application of electricity, giving us the term *galvanism* to describe it.

Mary went to bed but could not sleep, as the concept for Frankenstein formed in her head.  She began writing it the next day.

The literary roots of Frankenstein go back rather farther, and the progenitor was likely Horace Walpole's *The Castle of Otranto.*  Indeed, Frankenstein was first published anonymously, with a preface by Shelley which made the same sorts of qualifications Walpole made in his book.

Victor Frankenstein is an engaging but ultimately tragic character.  The essence of tragedy is inevitability.  The protagonists will fail and tragedy will ensue because they are the kind of people they are.  (This is not a *moral* judgement.  Failure is not evidence of sin or evil, but rather of inability to deal with what confronts them.) 

Victor performs a successful experiment, but cannot handle the implications of his success.  He runs away, and this turns his creation against him  Things spiral down from there.

This not being at all sure how they feel about things is characteristic of the society of the time.  Mary is confronted with the possibility of man usurping the rights of the Creator and creating new life.  Frankenstein is her attempt to sort out her feelings about it, and it's unsurprising she's not at all sure it's a good idea.

You can likely easily come up with lists of current SF with the same preoccupations, focusing on things like AI and genetic engineering.  The things discussed have the potential to transform the world.  Whether the end result is desirable  is another matter.",cuivenian,2020-02-09T14:41:03Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
108ybb5,"I think this is accurate, but also glazes over one of the motifs. Frankenstein is a classic example of the Nature vs. Nurture question. Do you become evil, or is evil something you are born with? In many instances, Victor seems evil in nature. His arrogant personality, actions, and thoughts, while easy to write off as reasonable in this situation, speak to biblical sins. Therefore, we can comfortably say that Victor is naturally evil. On the other side, the Creature, while acting in ways that are evil, does not have evil at heart. The Creature is not nurtured by Victor, or anyone else for that matter, and thus is shown the harshness of the world around him. He does evil things, but he does them out of a deep sense of hurt from parental and societal rejection. Victor's actions, however, are not due to a lack of nurturing. Victor was a wealthy, and well-cared for man. He was embraced by society, yet was still evil. Thus he is considered the real monster.",cj0813,2023-02-08T20:37:34Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

The one I always think of as rebooting the franchise is the interplanetary computer in Fredric Brown's ""Answer"" (1954), the one whose reply to the question ""Is there a God?"" is to fuse the switches and pronounce that ""There is now.""

2tj6dk,"I recently just gave this another read in my free time (I read it years ago for school) and I must say I really enjoyed it.

Yes Frankenstein could've prevented a lot of his pain by taking responsibility for his own actions but instead says nothing, and that's part of the tragedy of it all and the lesson to take away from it.

The ending also hit me a lot harder than it initially did when I read the book for school. I never realized how truly sad it is. Frankenstein and his creation essentially confess their mistakes and in a way their love for each other as Frankenstein lies their dead. Unfortunately it took Dr Frankenstein to be on his death bed to admit his mistakes.  It was tough to read.

She's being attacked!"" If he fucking STAYED WITH HER that wouldn't have happened. Also, towards the beginning I really pitied the monster but towards the end I decided both have had terrible lives. I was so pissed when the monster was standing over Frankenstein's dead body and said ""my life was still worse."" YOU FUCKING KILLED EVERYONE THIS MAN LOVED AND THEN KILLED HIM YOURSELF BASICALLY BUT ""WOE IS ME""? FUCK THAT. If the monster hadn't killed Frankenstein's brother, maybe Frankenstein would have been like ""sure bro I can build you a wife."" I totally sympathized with the monster for not wanting to be alone, especially after the whole incident with the family he tried to talk to, but if I was Frankenstein I don't think I would have wanted to build a second monster. But on top of that, what was with Frankenstein's lack of responsibility in the beginning anyway? ""I just created life. Instead of trying to teach it love or interact with it in any way, I'm going to hide in my room."" I understand that he became gravely ill, but he was the creator! He could have made the monster better looking and then taught it to be nice.

Frankenstein willingly married Elizabeth knowing the threat, and without warning her at all or allowing her the ability to make informed decisions. He never even conciders the threat was against her because everything is about him. Remember when he said of the condemned chick, that he suffered more than the woman who was going to die did? Asshole. His hysterical fleeing from the life he spent months creating was infuriating to me. He never once stopped to concider the implications and when the thing moves he screams and runs? Asshole. His refusal to build a bride was the ONE time he actually almost fully thought the implications of his actions through. Why he didnt realize the monster would go after his friends baffles me though. I wonder if he committed suicide to deny the monster a target, would that have saved everyone else? But no, he figured he could beat the superhuman vengeful monster without innocent casualties even though he was specifically warned they would happen. Asshole.

As for the monster.... yeah. Rough start. I seriously felt for him. But there comes a point, ESPECIALLY when you are that intelligent, when you need to take responsibility for your actions and have a sense of proportion. Yes your life sucks, but does it justify hating the entire human race and making any violence against anyone just because you felt like it okay? No. At that point you are a psychopath. And an asshole. He has an issue with victor? Okay, dude, at MOST you are ethically entitled to kill victor. Not kill 3 other people just to mess with him. Thats what insane serial killers do.

It's a minor novel that is gravely over-prescribed because of A) who wrote it, B) its much later adaptations, and C) its fairly obvious relationships to popular literature.

8nds41,"*Uncle Tom's Cabin* is only a few decades older. It is still being talked about. It's still of minor and often overstated importance.

That's why I mentioned it in my original TLR.

The first line of my TLR explained why *Frankenstein* is 'still talked about' despite being a minor work.

'Being talked about' is *one* way of assessing import, but at most a limited one and insufficient on its own, and ultimately a misleading one to the point of irrelevance. Chatter is a poor criterion.

There are, for example, works that we know are lost, which practically no-one is 'talking about', and no-one could be reading, but which are *still* of greater importance than works we have which are 'talked about'.",varro-reatinus,2018-05-31T09:10:04Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
8nds41,"That's rather an expansive question. (I take it you feel I've addressed all your previous concerns, so we're moving on to this one.)

I would suggest first that it's more efficient to debunk spurious claims of importance than to attempt to set up some kind of arbitrary rubric for determining importance. (That's how we get into a 'without feathers' scenario.)

To put it another way, works of genuine importance are relatively scarce, so it's easier to say what isn't than what is.

That said, I think I can take a rough stab at it.

To paraphrase Whitehead on Plato, the safest general characterisation of literary importance is that 'a major work' must stand in notable relation to prior art (in the technical sense).

If you write a dialogue, your work must stand comparison with Plato and Peacock in order to be called important.

If you write a play, your work must stand comparison with Aeschylus and Shakespeare.

If you write a satire, your work must stand comparison with Swift, Pope, Juvenal, Horace, etc.

That's not to say it's impossible to compare works beyond their formal, generic, or specific contexts. For example, i don't even think *Frankenstein* is the best piece of work to emerge from that rather dreary 'Year without a Summer' 1816 sojourn at the Villa Diodati; that would be Byron's ""Darkness,"" which isn't a great poem, but is at least a skillful one.",varro-reatinus,2018-05-31T11:43:14Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

8nds41,"> My criteria are simpler and, in recognition of the ultimate subjectivity of any attempt to compare works on technical merits, pertain more to the relation of the work to society.

Are you actually suggesting that ""the relation of the work to society"" is *less* subjective?

I would gently suggest that several decades of historicist scholarship is available to refute your implicit claim that ""society"" is a singular, monolithic constant. I don't agree with the historicists about much, but they're right about that.

I find it curious that you tried to reduce what I said to ""technical merits"" and subjective evaluations of quality, because I said nothing of the sort; that's a gross misrepresentation of what I said.

I said very clearly that my governing criterion were about *relative* and *comparative* evaluation.

I'm also not sure how expecting people to know about ""the relation of the work to society"" in toto is ""simpler"" than comparing apples and oranges respectively -- even if talking about ""society"" as a whole was reasonable, which it isn't.

> If something keeps bringing people back to a work, it's important - whether that be its immediate impact on the zeitgeist, or some thematic element, or the beauty of the language, or some other element that has broad and lasting appeal.

And I would point you back to the case of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*.

What keeps ""bringing people back"" to that work is predominantly a spurious anecdote involving Lincoln, that was invented by the family to market Stowe's works decades after the alleged meeting.

Similarly, I would suggest that what 'keeps bringing people back' to Shelley's novel is not the work itself, but a variety of later derivative works that have basically nothing to do with it, except the deeply misleading outline of 'someone makes a monster by accident, bad things ensue', which is a plot as old as literature itself.

> Frankenstein is not a perfect work - personally, I find it rather purple, though charmingly so.

I think we're in agreement that personal taste is not a meaningful criterion, even if we're talking about the taste of an important critic.

Samuel Johnson hated *Gulliver's Travels*; he was mistaken.

And I like that you just undercut your own suggestion that ""the beauty of the language"" could be part of what ""something keeps bringing people back"" to *Frankenstein*.

> But some aspect, whether the grotesque concept of the creature or the broader themes of hubris and ambition and all that, allowed the novel to escape its cool early reception.

But the mere presence of ""broader themes of hubris and ambition and all that"" could be attested in many works, including many that are not only unimportant but incompetent. They cannot be used as criteria.

3i5rv3,"> Is he monstrous because he abandons his newborn creature, viewing him with disgust? Well, sure, that's undeniably a shitty thing to do, but I think to call him a ""monster"" for this goes too far.

I think that he is monstrous for abandoning his creature. It is not just a ""shitty thing"", it is his tragic and fatal mistake.

We, as readers, know how little help the creature would have needed to become truly good. If we trust the creature's narration, its intention were good until they were frustrated several times. And for the simple reason that the creature is ugly. No other reason that that. People see it and are afraid and throw stones at it. No creature, no matter how patient and kind, can stand ostracism and hate for too long.

But Frankenstein didn't know how little help the creature would have needed.

So, what do I blame Frankenstein for?

I don't blame Frankenstein for giving life to the creature. ""Hybris"" and all of that are not crimes on their own - or better, it's easy to cry ""hybris"" when someone is trying to do something new. Two hundred years ago a group of brilliant doctors decided to eradicate the plague and typhus and so on. People screamed that it was hybris. A Pope wrote a Papal Encyclica where he said clearly that it was folly (I wish I still had the source of this). Result? Who cares about ""hybris"", we have actually succeeded. Our ""hybris"" wins, and without any bad consequence, the plague has disappeared. Gone. Vanished. Good riddance. We were right in ""playing God"" and destroying a species of Bacteria. We were right and we were successful and nobody regrets that we did ""play God"".

No, ""hybris"" doesn't make Frankenstein a monster. Refusing to even look at his creation, however, does.

Frankenstein had responsibilities. To the creature, and to the society of man. The creature might be an independent being, but that doesn't mean that Frankenstein can run away as he did. What fool abandons a creation in a society that is sure to hate it? Conversely, what fool lets loose a ""monster"" in the middle of a city?

And let it be clear, Frankenstein never gives the poor creature a chance! Not for a second he hesitates in refusing his creature. Why? Either because he is ashamed of his hybris and folly (both things are irrelevant to the character of the creature) or because is disgusted by the ugliness of the creature (and this once again the fault is Frankenstein's). How damn unfair is this? Completely. What has the newborn creature done to deserve this? Nothing: the newborn creature has literally done nothing except walking into its maker's bedroom and trying to speak.

At the end, to me the tale of Frankenstein is really a moral parable on what happens when our creation is alien to us.

We have two choices: we either accept our creation, or hate it from the moment of its creation.

Frankenstein may say that he is a coward, that he is weak, that he has made too many mistakes, but his only fatal mistake was never giving the creature a chance.

From the moment that the creature's heart beat its first beat, Frankenstein could no longer see a living being but could only see a monster. And this, fittingly, makes Frankenstein a monster.",MaracCabubu,2015-08-24T21:36:29Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I don't at all mean that assessment positively; I mean just that it's normal (""human"") to regret decisions, to back out of commitments. It's not commendable, but it's not *monstrous.*

Now, to be fair, ""backing out of commitments"" becomes a lot more morally questionable when the commitment in question is your child... however, I do hesitate using the word ""child"" to refer to the Creature. I know the monster reveres Frankenstein as his father, but does Frankenstein ever mention returning the sentiment? From  the impression I had (and please do dig up any quotes to the contrary if you can; it's entirely possible I missed some things), Victor throughout the assembly process never really thought of the creature as a child, but more like a project--it doesn't seem like Victor cared as much about *what* he would create as for the *proof* that he could create something in the first place.

3i5rv3,"They happened before & during the writing of Frankenstein.

Byron had pushed Percey Shelley into the idea of open relationships -alledgedly to sleep with Mary- but Percy wanted to be with Mary's sister -who according to several biographers was intensely jealous & wanted Perey to herself.

Mary Shelley's strained relationships with men from a young age, especially how Byron & others dominated Percy's life, supposedly influenced a lot of how she created the character of Victor -as young, egotistic and unable to take responsibility for his actions. Where as the old blind man who teaches Adam is meant to be men such as her father, who were teachers.

Also factor in the new sciences & philosophies that Mary was studying, which put forward the idea of nurture over nature.

Basically, if you take it all back to Milton & Paradise Lost (which Adam reads and from which names himself), Victor Frankenstein is a seen as the figure of a selfish god who, seeing what he has created chooses to abandon it rather than take responsibility. This is further pushed when creating the mate & Victor envisions it choosing him over Adam or them birthing a race of monsters which will usurp man (as man did the angels in Milton).
As a man, Victor's only response are abandonment & destruction and, as a child, Adam can only feel adoration for his creator before it turns to bitter loathing over the realisation that he was not only unwanted & unloved but never intended to be in the first place.",andthegeekshall,2015-08-24T06:14:15Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

> Considering how insecure Mary was about her creative and reproductive capabilities, *Frankenstein* can be read as ""a woman's myth-making on the subject of birth,"" according to Ellen Moers in the ground-breaking study *Literary Women* (1976). Int he novel, Victor learns the hard way of the consequences of usurping the female pro-genitive role. As he labors to create his monster, Victor experiences pain and insecurities that are typical of pregnancy's gestation period; his shock at seeing his deformed and hideous progeny at birth must have been shard by most nineteenth-century women, in their ignorance and fear of the birth process. Most power of all (and the subject of most of he novel) are his feelings of depression and detachment after the actual birth. Even in our time, post-partum depression remains a misunderstood and often misdiagnosed condition; for Shelly in 1818 to depict the negative consequences of this disease left untreated was a revolutionary act. ""The idea that a mother can loath, fear, and reject her baby has until recently been on of the most repressed of psychological insights,"" writes Barbara Johsnon in ""My Monster/My Self,"" another important feminist essay. ""What is threatening about [*Frankenstein*] is the way in which its critique of the role of the mother touches us on primitive terrors of the mother's rejection of the child"". As a writer who was also a mother (a rare combination nineteenth-century England), Shelly broke down long-standing rules of propriety by retelling the myth of origin from the female point of view.

Self-love to urge, and reason, to restrain;
Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call,
Each works its end, to move or govern all
And to their proper operation still,
Ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.

Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;
Reason’s comparing balance rules the whole.
Man, but for that, no action could attend,
And but for this, were active to no end:

Fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot,
To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;
Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,
Destroying others, by himself destroyed.

Most strength the moving principle requires;
Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.
Sedate and quiet the comparing lies,
Formed but to check, deliberate, and advise.

Self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh;
Reason’s at distance, and in prospect lie:
That sees immediate good by present sense;
Reason, the future and the consequence.""

Frankenstein has amazing insights into humanity. For example, I find it to be fascinating that, although Dr. Frankenstein has made a literal subhuman creation, the monster is oftentimes seen as more ""human"" (or, ""humane"") than Dr. Frankenstein. Also, I love the book as a study in the relationship between social conditioning and one's formation of self-identity. To me, Frankenstein is a non-cheesy, raw, and authentic cry for empathy, blind love, and the sanctity of human life. 

I read the book alongside Coleridge's ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" poem, which I recommend as a short read if you enjoyed Frankenstein; there are many parallels!

If you calculate the time between Walton's first letter to his sister, and the last, it is exactly 9 months. Or the gestation period of a baby. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was also pregnant, gave birth, and lost the baby at a few days old around the time of writing Frankenstein. She later gave birth again to a boy which she named William. The same name of the boy, Dr. Frankenstein's little brother, the creature intentionally murders.

She sure didn't think much of parenthood, did she?

Ha. A bold defense, but that doesn't really work as both Frankenstein and Captain Walton do it. I think it's more likely that it's just not something that she was much bothered by.

6z99jh,I think Frankenstein expresses *regret* not remorse in the book. He only cares because his experiments are affecting his life negatively. He's an extremely selfish character.,CroweMorningstar,2017-09-10T16:48:18Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
6z99jh,">So his ambition becomes his downfall: still, he carries it with such a responsibility that it practically demands respect.

He expresses remorse, but the way the book skims over the actual motives of why he created it suggests that his thought process prior never really stretched beyond ""why not?""

He essentially stuck a fork in the light socket of the universe just to see what would happen.

Then with his creation he never takes on himself the critical responsibility of actually treating it as a human. He just wants it disposed of as an accident, which is why it becomes a ""monster"". 

Danny Boyle worked with Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller on a stage production of Frankenstein a few years ago where both actors would alternate roles each night as monster and creator. One interesting thing about the production is that the script of the adaptation started with the birth of the monster, cutting everything before hand, so the audience POV is firmly from the view of the monster as it first experiences into the world. 

Part of the point of the story was that the monster was a true blank slate (maybe the first in history, a creature created completely from whole cloth) that could have been anything, and Frankenstein fucked it up with his shitty influence and lack of moral guidance. The fact that Frankenstein regrets the monster being born doesn't make him a good guy - is a parent who abandons his kid because he regrets it being born a good parent?",potat-o,2017-09-10T21:08:33Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

But you're absolutely right. The way Frankenstein handles the situation post-creation is reproachable in every way, he abandons it in his sickness and cares not for its existence until it influences his own life. 

Still, I don't think this makes him an entirely bad person. Selfish perhaps, but nevertheless skilled and accomplished. We forget how pleasing he was in the first chapters on the novel. I'm willing to wager a defense for him. ",IndifferentTalker,2017-09-11T00:54:20Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

And overall I'm in complete agreement. His actions after the creation of the monster are entirely reproachable--and I agree with that last point too: no doubt an element of the monster's turmoil is directly caused by Frankenstein himself.

And yet, I feel as though Frankenstein takes responsibility for certain things that are entirely out of his control. His initial treatment of the monster after creating him is a response to his (SPOILER) murder of William, and after that he expresses a true sadness for what he's created. Perhaps he wouldn't have felt remorse if the monster had not directly affected his life, but it's remorse nevertheless. 

I wonder if Frankenstein would've treated his creation as equals if their first meeting was not under dire circumstances. Some may say he would've condemned it anyway, some may disagree.",IndifferentTalker,2017-09-11T01:03:55Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

73z3a9,"One of the reasons I like reading classics is to be able to compare the actual source to pop-culture representation.

You have people proclaiming things like ""Frankenstein is the _real_ monster, his creation just a victim."" Well, that's not really what I got from the book at all. The monster _did_ undeniably monstrous things - things that are inexcusable. All attempts at justification come from the culprit themselves - a very intelligent and ruthless culprit. It is kept open for interpretation if the monster is telling the truth or just attempting to manipulate. Mary Shelley did a great job at emphasizing Frankenstein's inner conflict and projecting it to the reader.

Regarding the actual story, my biggest surprise so far was Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. There is a big difference between the full version and the children's version, which skips over some experiences. Reading the final rant of the main character makes the existence of a ""children's version"" also kind of tragic.

Regarding characters I was really surprised by Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers. I never expected the ""heroes"" to be such unpleasant examples of douchebaggery.

In the past year the biggest surprises for me were Vilette by Charlotte Bronte (positive) and Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (negative).

I expected to dislike the main heroine in Vilette, because I expected her to be similar to Emma Bovary, Effie Briest, Catherine Earnshaw, or Caroline Meeber. Luckily I was mistaken and I ended up rooting for her, which made the end all the more tragic. (I find it difficult to really like a book if I cannot like at least one of the main characters. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert is one of the exceptions. Love the book, hate the character.)

I expected Robinson Crusoe to be a normal classic - maybe a bit difficult to get through, but worth a read nonetheless. How bad could it be? There were children's cartoons made based on it, right? Turns out it is eye-openingly bad. Not only is the main theme that you are not supposed to rebel against your station in life (or you get repeatedly shipwrecked), but you have the main character spending sheer endless monologues about the White Man's Burden and similar topics. It is good that the book exists as evidence for changing pop culture and I am glad that I read it, but I did not expect that.",EQ2bRpDBQWRk1W,2017-10-03T11:23:36Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

73z3a9,"One thing I never quite understood about ""Frankenstein"" is how her female characters are the typical damsel in distress. She was the daughter of Wolstencraft (a women's rights activists) and I cannot readily imagine Byron nor Percy having a problem with a slightly more empowered female supporting character. At first I suspected that it was due to the era, but Austen had published several novels before ""Frankenstein"" and certainly would have been a known author.  I'm not saying the novella is bad, I rather enjoyed it, but I always found this facet of it a little surprising and disappointing.  


A novel that surprised me was ""Disgrace: A Novel"" by J.M. Coetzee. I found myself empathizing with the protagonist and even understanding some of his fears. The reason this is surprising is that he is a racist.  The book is both powerful and disturbing.

p4l1r7,"Because it pretty much started the science fiction novel. It’s the first novel to really be considered sciences fiction. The point of Frankenstein isn’t necessarily the creation of the monster. It’s the psychological impact it has. It’s a science fiction psychological thriller with religious undertones.

It’s about the punishment that can come when someone reaches beyond. The monster is social commentary but it’s more about the limits of science and the role or limitations of religion. It’s also about the complications of birth, considering Mary Shelley’s very complex relationship with birth (her birth killed her mother, she had several miscarriages prior to writing the book) so in some ways it’s semi-autobiographical.

It’s certainly not for everyone. It’s slow, and it’s not full of outright horror but more of the slow building dread. It’s more closely related to something like Crime and Punishment than some of the more classical horror works.

Placing this when it was written and looking at what was happening: the industrial revolution was in roaring in, the rise of science and engineering, people moving from villages and rural areas into the cities for jobs. The uncertainty showed in religion as well, people went from being certain of faith and place in the world to uncertainty to agnosticism. Science and technology began to replace both religion and maybe the supernatural/magic. So that’s why I read a lot of literature from this period as a kind of warning and cautionary tale, great social upheaval brought so much uncertainty, and no one knew if society was making the right turns.",crankygerbil,2021-08-15T06:08:25Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

If you write frankenstein using modern day technology without adding anything original, many critics that know what they are talking about will consider you one of the greatest writers that ever lived for the work you did. That's how good and classic Frankenstein is. The greatest critics of all time will look at 2001 or Ex Machina, and say ""These people remade Frankenstein without adding too much original material.

7i0s5p,"I really liked the ending; if it feels jarring and unsatisfying, that is because Shelley got you to relate well to the Frankenstein's monster. At the end, he's left with nothing; mid-novel he recognized that he turned to evil because his creator reviled him. In the end he realizes how dedicating himself to revenge only left him empty, but he is unable to better himself with that knowledge. He is unable to gain enough self-identity independent of Frankenstein to be able to feel like he matters at all outside his creator. 

I think it can relate well to social media (deriving self-identity and value from your online presence) or any other unhealthy system of self-worth we impose on ourselves. Obviously, we are different from Frankenstein's monster in that we aren't created by these things, but people often give themselves to social media or what have you just as much as if it did create them.",isotopes_ftw,2017-12-06T22:53:44Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

7i0s5p,"In my opinion, Frankenstein is a novel with a very original and interesting central idea, but it's terribly badly written from the point of view of plot structure.

You mention the ending, and I agree it's hugely unsatisfying. The climax consists of the monster giving a long speech which describes in excruciating detail exactly how he's feeling. Then he leaves to kill himself. Nothing actually happens. It might have worked if this had been a logical end of subtle character development, but it's not. It's the first time we've heard him speak or even really seen him act since the murder Elizabeth. His feelings towards his creator just seem to magically reverse moment he learns of his death. 

Of course the shock of hearing of someone's death can change a person's feelings about them. I think most of us are more inclined to see the good parts in a relationship with someone who has died than the bad. That doesn't work in the novel though as there was nothing good in the way Frankenstein treated the monster. He always regarded him as subhuman, never accepted him, never even tried to do his duty by him. I read the final speech by the monster wondering what he could possibly have been talking about when he praised Frankenstein's gentleness and kindness (I think those were the words used). When did Frankenstein ever show those qualities toward him? Why would the death of Frankenstein cause such remorse when killing or causing the deaths of several innocent people had no effect?

There are other problems which come earlier in the book, but I think this is the biggest, and I'm in danger of rambling on here.

k71ccp,"While not sure how people responded to the book, she was using real struggles/innovations of the time to put them in a different light 

[source](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/english-literature/the-historical-context-of-frankenstein-english-literature-essay.php)

The monster himself is a symbolism of birth of science—an acquisition of intellectual power beyond the common learning. “At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification (Shelley 112).” This statement of Victor’s creature signifies his extreme power and knowledge beyond human thoughts. During the period of 19th century science emerged as a profession. It becomes one of the distinct points of learning during the said era. It means that Shelley is aware of the capability of science to create different entities. Science is one of the most significant points of the novel because it establishes the conflict of the story. When the monster perceives his face into the mirror, Shelley conveys the authority of science over human existence because it has the power to create abnormal creatures—beyond expectation.

Aside from the birth of science, Shelley also discusses the representation of women in the society within her novel. “At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been (Shelley 185).” This statement of Victor encompasses his guilt towards Justine. He knows that this woman is not the murder—it is his creature, but because of his weak character, he lets Justine suffer. This idea is a depiction of women status in the society. During the period of 19th century when Shelley writes this novel, women have no voice in their culture. They remain as weak, unprivileged, and servants of men. Using the character of Justine as innocent, weak, poor woman, Victor tends to utilize her to surpass his sins. It happens without the knowledge of Justine because she does not know the situation within her midst. Therefore, Justine’s case is a composition of 19th century history wherein women are objects of the society and not treated as individuals.

Shelley’s novel is also a construction of social enlightenment during 19th century civilization. This is what Fred Randel (2003) believes in his article entitled “The Political Geography of Horror in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” “Victor now resembles the European intellectuals who flirted with or actively promoted radical ideas at home, but were aghast when overseas colonies chose to apply Enlightenment notions of human rights to their own condition (Randel 469).” Randel states that Victor’s character is a signification of social enlightenment through his acts and determination to unleash the secrets of physical life. It means that Victor tries to deconstruct the traditional perspectives of people towards the existence of humans. Shelley uses Victor’s character to encompass the idea of enlightenment towards the birth of science. Since science is also a form of physical and intellectual enlightenment, the novel produces a point of history that talks about the non-traditional structure of civilization.

Lastly, Shelley describes the concept of Marxism in her novel through the structure of Victor’s creature. According to Diana Reese (2006) in her article entitled “A Troubled Legacy: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the Inheritance of Human Rights,”

“Victor Frankenstein can hear the justice of the monster’s claim (as an ideal citizen) but cannot grant him the corollary rights of man: the protection of the necessities of his life. In the “series of his being,” as an unfinished citizen, the daemon comes to figure something akin to the “unreal universality” of the rights-bearer in Karl Marx’s analysis of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.” (Reese 65)

When the monster states his story, Victor perceives the human thoughts of the monster but his physical appearance hinders him to become real human. The concept of Marxism emerges in this point because the creature is called as the “unfinished citizen” due to his appearance. Therefore, he could not obtain the privileges and rights of human beings. This scenario encompasses the history of the society during 19th century wherein people are not equal due to physical appearance. The civilization of this era is degrading as what Shelley is trying to convey because people perceive the beauty and humanness of a person through physical appearance—not by heart, mind, and soul.

In conclusion, it can be said that Frankenstein depicts the historical context of 19th century in different portions—social class, knowledge, and enlightenment. Shelley unleashes the fact that Frankenstein is not just a simple story of horror, but a narration of social issues during the period of 19th century—the period of revolution, knowledge growth, and social awareness. Therefore, history reflects throughout the novel as it unravels the life beyond the conventional.",Nevermoremonkey,2020-12-05T05:00:58Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

This is an artists representation (via make up) of how he might have looked like. I think it corresponds to the textual description quite well, though I would've imagined the eyes a bit more watery (probably hard to change that on a living model.)

I always envisioned him looking a bit like a rehydrated mummy, if that makes sense. With the yellow skin, black lips and so on, I'd imagine he does look a bit like a walking dead man. Like his creator tried to choose body parts that fit together reasonably well, hide the scars as well as possible, give him a handsome face, lushious hair...
But as soon as he gets up from the table, you can't shake the feeling that something is wrong about him, just like another poster described. You can sense that this is dead tissue that shouldn't be walking around, yet it does, and it speaks and it looks at you with intelligent eyes. It breaks our perception of what ""should be"" on a level that's even more basic than body parts stitched together. 

Combine that with him being 8ft tall and it's honestly no wonder that people would be so afraid of him.",Agai_n,2022-05-26T05:05:14Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

am0qgh,"Just from reading this thread a lot of people don't ""get"" Frankenstein because they're unfamiliar with the narrative structures underpinning it.

It utilises both a frame narrative (Walton recounting Frankenstein, who himself recounts the creature) and an unreliable narrator. Victor's often verbose and melodramatic style is a deliberate attempt to convince Walton of his innocence and to abdicate responsibility for the creature's crimes.

But look closely and you can see Shelley doesn't want us to sympathise with Victor at all. For example, ehile Justine awaits execution for a crime she didn't commit, the narrative at this point revolves entirely around Victor's own sense of dread and fear of the creature. He constantly begs the listener/reader (who remember is Walton, due to the frame narrative) to sympathise with his internal grief and struggle at this stage, while simultaneously making Justine's sacrifice all about him. In short, it is megalomania in action.

Another good example is when the creature is born. ""It held out a hand - seemingly to detain me."" We know from the creature's narrative though that this was a lie - he held his hand out for help, not hindrance.

Overall I think it is absolutely remarkable to think this book was written by a 19 year old girl. It's not perfect - what is? - but it takes on a new lease of life when you read it with an understanding of the narrative structure and how that affects our view of Victor.

The message of the book was really good. Frankenstein's creation and Robert Walton seemed like the most 'human' characters to me but I really did not like the way the rest of the characters were written. 

I don't claim to be an authority on literature or anything but damn. 

Victor Frankenstein was so bloody melodramatic. Everyone was perfect. His father, perfect. Justine, perfect. His cousin Elizabeth, perfect. The kid who died, perfect, his friend Henry, guess what! Fucking perfect! 

Oh and the 'wretch?' yeah he was the worst thing ever. I mean did this guy feel neutral towards anything? Another part that annoyed me is that whenever someone died or something bad happened he just got sick. That's not how it works. What is going on?

Then there was the dialogue. Yes people spoke differently in 1818. Fair enough. Frankenstein's creation spoke for 5 chapters straight. Five! And Frankenstein couldn't get a word in edgeways. I reckon what must have happened was that Frankenstein thought that a well defined jawline made a good looking man and concentrated all his efforts there and neglected everything else rendering the creation ugly, but hey, at least those jaws were able to carry on talking for five fucking chapters. 

Okay, that rant turned out longer than I expected. 

TLDR: Very interesting message, but incredibly annoying writing-style with really ridiculous characters

am0qgh,"I think it’s hard to read books like this without comparing them to every single Frankenstein’s monster idea you’ve seen. 

The point of the book is that it’s told in 3 parts, it’s boxed up as a story within a story within a story. 
Frankenstein couldn’t have told anybody he’d created life. With no proof people would think it was crazy and heretical. He’d be locked up. ",DrDouchebaggins,2019-02-01T15:08:51Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
am0qgh,"""I think the story had quite a slow start.""

I so agree with you! The whole frame story with that artic explorer guy rescuing Frankenstein and then pretty much is never heard of again...like wtf was that


""I felt the majority of the cast was repetitive, flat and 2D with exception of Frankenstein and his monster.""

Have you read Dracula? Same fucking deal. So annoying. But yah, I think all the characters (except monster and Frank) were pretty much over used tropes.

Considering Mary Shelley's very (very!) scandalous affair with Percy, which was arguably responsible for the suicide of Percy's first wife Harriet and indirectly linked to another suicide (a half sister of Mary's, I think?), I always thought the monster was either Mary herself or percy. And Frankenstein is...her Dad or society. who knows...

""Wasn't really sure why Frankenstein never told anyone about his creation, or was he too full of pride and/or shame?""

To create the monster, Frankenstein became a grave robber, a desecrator of corpses...a crime in modern times, and most certainly a crime back then, if not a legal one than a moral one. also, the monster looked exactly like what it was, something patched together from the dismembered body parts of corpses. so maybe Frankenstein achieved something amazing scientifically, but his means were so repulsive and violated way too many fundamental human moralities for him to be able to show it off (he felt, I think lol).

Also Frankenstein was behaving in a way that people near to him were assuming he had lost or was losing his mind. remember that he had also been sick for a long time with fever, and fever was associated at that time with delirium etc. The real story of the monster is so incredible that Frankenstein reasons that if he told the truth, then people would believe him mad/crazy. And tbf, he had a point.

"" although i feel it could be written better ""

people like to speculate alternative authorships for Frankenstein because the reasoning goes that such a work of genius could not have possibly been written by a 19 year old girl. Germain Greer points out the inherent misogynism and sexism behind such claims, and then goes on to point out that the book is pretty badly written, from a technical perspective.

5uy4nb,"When I first read Frankenstein in school, I was resentful as hell that this arrogant man and his creation conspired to create another creature that would live in the same misery as the original creation--only for the bride, it would be her duty and obligation to make life easier for the original. Do either of them even stop to consider what she would want or feel? What if she is happy alone? What if she is disgusted by the monster physically? What if she wants to have children with a man of her own choosing? What if she wants no children and no husband? No book had ever made me so angry. 

Then I realized Mary Shelley was some sort of genius because this is exactly the story of Adam and Eve, here replicated by the man of science. A man of science would make a different choice than God, and would see flawed creation (humans) as a mistake. Thinking about this conundrum (are humans a mistake because they are an imperfect image of their creator), I reread the entire book with a more analytical eye (as a counterpoint to Milton's Paradise Lost). I read up on Mary Shelley's history (her in-/famous mother) and Enlightenment principles upon the social fabric of her times.

5uy4nb,"I was raised on old movies, so I saw the majority of the old Universal Frankenstein movies well before I ever read the book.

They are... quite different from the book. The original film with Boris Karloff as the monster is from 1931 and it feels like it. It's an odd experience to watch now if you aren't into old movies. I am into old movies and I found it odd to watch. I think I had my expectations set at a different place than I do when watching most movies from that time just because it was Frankenstein, and because I'd seen a lot of the later Frankenstein films that were of somewhat better quality in terms of filmmaking.

In any case, they make a decent stab at preserving what is the initial innocence of the monster and the way in which his monsterois actions are the result of how he is treated because of his appearance and his having be essentially abandoned in a world he doesn't understand, but the fact that they completely remove the creature's intelligence and make him utterly inarticulate robs it of a lot of the thematic weight of the novel.

The creature comes across as more like a rabid dog that needs to be put down, which is a rather different form of tragedy than the one that exists on the page.

Also, they decided to change Dr Frankenstein's first name to Henry and gave him a best friend named Victor in what feels like a bizarre creative decision that I can only assume was fueled by someone thinking that Victor was too exotic of a name for the leading man of the piece.",Muroid,2017-02-20T05:01:54Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
5uy4nb,"Actually, alot of critics called Frankenstein a ""modern Prometheus"", because of how the actions of man go against God. In Paradise Lost, to my knowledge anyway, the tragic hero is often argued to be Satan. Before his fall and permanent transformation into a serpent, he declared to God that angels ought to be self governing and should be regarded as deities. Out of spite, he decided to ruin God's creation, man, to make man suffer for his banishment. The parallels between Frankenstein and Paradise Lost is easily noticed because of their similar motive and narrative structure. Secondly, during the Victorian times where technology was advancing, the idea of putting people out of work and making them suffer as a result is another idea to consider. If a machine takes your place, how can you feed your family or yourself? That's like a form of punishment. 

Now, about Frankenstein's promise to create a mate...That's another argument. Back then, as you already know, women did not have the rights they have now so the idea of what she wants did not occur to Frankenstein and his monster. However, Frankenstein did play with the ideas of what she would do or is capable of doing, which is why he destroyed her in the middle of creation. He did not want another threat to lurk around in the world. The creation of man, humanity itself, is God's design therefore it is deemed natural. Humanity procreating, is natural. Humanity creating life from things that are dead, is unnatural and defy God's design. A human being is not a God, we are not perfect. We have our flaws because, like in Paradise Lost, we were convinced to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. 

This could get into a whole other discussion about the Bible and Paradise Lost but, I think a religious discussion might not be a good idea, considering people of multiple faiths and respecting their viewpoints. What I will say is, I agree that the female monster was not truly thought of but then again, Frankenstein did not think of his monster either when he created him. It was out of sheer ambition, blind ambition. And that blindness led to his demise.",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-19T18:19:51Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
5uy4nb,"Frankenstein was arrogant and created the monster out of sheer obsession. He had tunnel vision and he literally spent days without sleep just to work on his creation. Now, breaking the promise and the consequences that come afterwards make sense. ""Oh, you don't want me to have a mate but you get to? Screw you, she dies and you'll feel my loneliness. "" That was the monster's mentality. But, after killing an innocent child William, framing an innocent woman who was loved by the community, killed Clerval and then killing Elizabeth, they did nothing to the monster. This was pure vengeance. And it took Frankenstein's death for the monster to realize his mistakes. Also, he deliberately made Frankenstein endure a hell that nobody deserves just for a sick game of cat and mouse. 

Like you said, nobody but God should create life. Not because of religious reasons, but because creating life from death is an unnatural phenomenon and rejects the laws of nature. And this is something I thought of while reading the story, Frankenstein is an amalgamation of dead body parts, he can't really have kids because his parts are essentially dead. Same case would be for his would be bride. I could be wrong in that regard but, Frankenstein's idea of the monster procreating and spreading this undead curse, I think it's a bit of a stretch.",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-19T14:27:12Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I'm assuming the writer or writers of the script were having a bit of fun with the source material. As for the monster himself, making him into a dimwit who caused trouble probably made it easier in terms of production. The novel builds up both Victor Frankenstein and the monster quite well but over time and through alot of dialogue. By cutting out alot of dialogue, which was necessary for the monster to describe his side of the story, you get just a horror film for that year. 

Someone mentioned in the thread earlier about a show called Penny Dreadful and how they portray the various characters in classic literature like Frankenstein.

5uy4nb,"My point exactly: it's a layered text. 

You can approach it in various directions from Milton's text (Victor is like Milton's Satan, thinking he should have the abilities reserved for God, or the creature is like Milton's Satan, as the creature revenges himself upon his maker and ruins his endeavors), or from the story of Prometheus (Victor steals the power/might/knowledge of the gods), or from Plato's Theory of Forms. You can examine the theme of technology displacing man's work, the theme of knowledge/education, the place and role of women and motherhood (*conspicuous here by its lack--you suggest that this is overlooked on the author's part; well, it's certainly not treated explicitly, but it is the subtext of the work, IMO; Victor is also cutting out the mother from the procreation equation, refuses to share in creation by producing a child in the regular way. He refuses to build a female creature who can ""create"" others, too*), etc. You can get a lot out of the book, but only if you don't sucker yourself into thinking it's just a horror story, meant to entertain and not reflect upon its time. Lots of people, when they pick up the book, think they know what they're going to be getting into (the first SF-horror novel, similar to the popular idea of Frankenstein as the monster itself, complete with bolts and stitches) and have no idea of the profundity of the work. Even more challenging for some, really enjoying the novel requires active, not passive, reading.

(And...Personally, I believe you cannot discuss Frankenstein without discussing Adam and Eve. EDIT: Your comment about the female creature being overlooked is not actually my point at all. I don't think we are really encouraged to ignore the problem as readers. That was simply my first and less analytical response to the work, since you asked in OP.

5uy4nb,"I watched the first episode of that, actually, but I think the creature only got flashed on screen briefly at the end of that (assuming I'm remebering correctly), so I don't really have a point of reference for his portrayal on the show.

The old Universal version ranges from a tragic simpleton to a walking MacGuffin with even less of a personality than as initially portrayed. In thinking about it now, I find it interesting that he is not usually portrayed in the typical fashion of horror. 

Most horror that has a monsters plays on the audience or characters not knowing what is lurking in the shadows or where or when the monster will strike. Thr story is told from the perspective of the heroes or victims with the monster being shrouded in mystery.

Frankenstein's monster is always never portrayed in this fashion. It doesn't strike and recede off-screen as a lurking presence. It's more like a roving natural disaster with damage done being either accidental or often provoked by the victims in some way.

The reason I find this interesting is that, at least by the later part of the novel, the creature really fits the template of a traditional movie monster in the way he hovers as a malevolent force at the edges of Victor Frankenstein's life than the actual movie incarnation does.

5uy4nb,"I agree with you, Frankenstein is a layered text and can be interpreted in multiple ways, which is why it's such a fantastic read. When something is complex and has ideas for a reader to dissect and draw parallels, it opens the scope of what the encoded message in the story is. As for the female monster, I didn't think too much into it because Frankenstein had a reason for not going through with creating a female monster. You do have a point though, he's essentially eliminating the woman from the procreation, I did not really think of this idea until you pointed it out to me. 

Since Frankenstein is eliminating the mother from the procreation equation, as you said previously, then where does that leave the humanity in the monster? In my interpretation, since the monster and his would be bride would've been made out of dead flesh, they can't procreate anyway because they are sterile. However, under the supposition that they CAN procreate, then having the woman is a necessity. Although, when put into that context, it seems that all a woman is supposed to do is have children. On both sides, Frankenstein promising to make her out of fear and self interest and the monster's base desire for a companion, are selfish ideals. Even destroying the woman is, in itself, selfish. That selfishness is a shared flaw between creator and the created. ",AlbireoTai18,2017-02-20T00:16:31Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I never saw Penny Dreadful, but I felt emotional for Frankenstein and his monster. I did not hate the monster or Frankenstein, I felt sad and pitied them.

How reliable are these narrators?

This is one of my favourite aspects. It brings another layer to the question of who is really the monster, or monsters. Each of those narrators could have so many motives for telling the story the way they do. I think people think they know the book from the film depictions of *Frankenstein* plus the well-known 'Frankstein isn't the name of the monster but Frankenstein is the monster' piece of wisdom, but I found that when I read it there was far more than one monster in *Frankenstein*.",satanspanties,2018-08-03T17:56:47Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

It's not a mystery why Frankenstein's creation turns out wrong, and given how he is able to teach himself so much, we can see just how much potential is squandered due to his creator's negligence and active malevolence.

i23ymi,"In my opinion it's not even close. I also read them back to back recently (Frankenstein for the third time, Dorian for the second) and Frankenstein is insane in how it tackles such existential and religious questions and themes. The concept of a man creating life itself is a great one, and Shelly managed to take it, add layers to it, and create a story with more analysis potential than most other classics imo. Plus it has probably my favorite dichotomy of two main characters in literature.

Dorian Gray, meanwhile, while it certainly isn't lacking in depth or good characters, doesn't even approach Frankenstein. Also it seems to have some unnecessary stuff in it, like... a lot of Lord Henry's dialogue (Wilde is a master of witty quotes and it's clear he used Henry as a conduit to express that, but it doesn't really lend Henry's conversations towards being as succinct and on-topic as the plot of the book). The only times I felt Frankenstein dragged were the descriptions of how depressed Victor was, it got redundant after the third or fourth complete physical and emotional collapse lmao.

7abuto,"1. Be careful about mixing 'Frankenstein' and 'Frankenstein's Monster' when you're under pressure.  But yes, there is a very solid 'the monster was us all along' sub plot to the whole thing.

2.  As for Shelley, she basically invented science fiction.  The 'life from death' bit has been a staple for a long time, nothing new there, but what was prompting Shelley was the new (ish) science of electricity, which was promising to change everything in strange and poorly understood ways.  Galvinism, in particular, was a hot topic. The 'dancing frog's legs' had already taken the world by storm, even though it never truly performed a resurrection.

So like any good sci fi writer, she was channeling the thinly understood miracle tech of her time through the lens of an old story - remember it is sub-titled 'Modern Prometheus' so there are call backs to classical mythology.

3.  You don't feel remorse until after you've done the evil. Everything else the monster experienced was in relation to his relationship with his creator.  It drove him to continue.  Surrender doesn't come until that relationship has reached its conclusion. ",malwayslooking,2017-11-02T14:41:12Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
7abuto,"I think this is fairly good for a high school analysis. Here is some more background for you:

1. *Frankenstein* is largely considered the first horror sci-fi novel ever written. It was designed to be frightening, yes, but scary in the sense that we're frightened for the future of humanity. malwayslooking's ""The monster was us all along"" is a good summation of this theme. Shelley plays with this theme a lot in her other works, as well, and it became a staple of sci-fi literature later on down the road. 

2. Look up the story of Prometheus, as that will help you understand many of Frankenstein's underlying themes. Wikipedia should be adequate for this. It's an interesting read.

3. ""Protagonist"" doesn't necessarily have to mean ""good guy."" Think Patrick Bateman from *American Psycho.* We follow the character and his thought processes throughout the entire novel (or movie) even though he's a terrible guy. Victor Frankenstein has good intentions in the beginning, but he tries to play God and ends up creating something that he is both frightened and ashamed of. This isn't necessary for your analysis, but I would encourage you to look more closely at the relationships Victor has with female characters throughout the novel, specifically Elizabeth and the creature's female mate.

4. I'll admit, it's been a long time since I last read *Frankenstein,* so I'm not sure that I could give the best answer to your final question. If I'm wrong, I'd like it if some other user could correct me. Without Victor, the creature no longer had a purpose. He had no one left to create a mate for him, no one left to hunt down and torment except himself. The creature hated Victor for bringing him into the world and then shunning him, but he also felt attached to him like a son would feel toward his father. ""The sins of the father"" theme is prevalent in this novel as well. You could give that a google. Without a mate, and without Victor, there was nothing for the creature to do except kill himself. No one else in the world would ever accept him, and no one would be around to explain what he even was.

I hope this makes more sense to you now.",OFGhost,2017-11-02T15:41:11Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
7abuto,"First, ""Frankenstein"" should be used to reference Victor Frankenstein. Victor's creation is generally referred to as ""The Creature,"" not the monster. Calling him ""The Monster"" implies that he is evil, which he is not. What you might ask yourself is, who is the real ""monster"" in this novel? Also, in general, Christian theologists view evil as one of God's creations. Thus there is nothing that is evil, only good corrupted.

Second, what is Victor's responsibility to his creation? In Christianity, God imparts knowledge and rules to his people via the prophets. Does Victor do this for his creation? Remember, Mary Shelley was not a scientist, so the science part of the novel is intentionally vague. Victor's ""science"" borders on magic or alchemy. This is made clear by Victor's reverence for Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.

Lastly, I'm not sure the creature feels remorse. Remember, the creature tells Victor that there was no one to teach him how to live his life. The creature had to learn about society by observation. The creature's spiritual views are formed by reading Milton's Paradise Lost, which he views as history, rather than fiction. 

One thing I would like to add is Victor's fear of the creature from a masculine standpoint. There is a kind of sibling rivalry that happens between Victor and his creation, some would argue that a Zeus/Cronos analogy is more appropriate, but consider that the creature robs Victor of his wedding night. Thus stopping Victor from consummating his marriage. The creature is physically superior to Victor and, in some ways, intellectually superior. I would suggest checking out Blade Runner, as it offers a modern analogy to the Frankenstein story.

In the end, what is Victor's responsibility to his creation? What is our responsibility to our creations? Should science do or create things because they are able to? Does that fact that the creature is self-aware, change the narrative? So many questions generated by this 200 year-old novel. Good luck on your test.

7abuto,"Hello! I just studied *Frankenstein* in my literature class the semester before last! 

1. I think you're pretty dead on with this one. You're supposed to feel bad for the monster essentially but I guess he isn't necessarily the good guy

2. For this one the time that she is writing really plays a roll. The romantic period (correct me, someone, if I'm wrong) has strong beliefs. They thought that living in the country got you closer to God and living in the city took you closer to sin. Notice how all of Victor's 'evils' start when he leaves the country side and gets an education. She is definitely discouraging ""playing god"" especially because (from what i was taught) Victor's aim was to create a super human race that he was the God/father/creator of

7abuto,"One thing: I think you should be careful to avoid labelling characters as 'good' or 'bad'. We all have a capacity for doing good and bad things and a perceptive writer (like Mary Shelley) will depict that through ambiguous characterisation. 

As for point 1) and the question of the monster's morality, I think you could mention the strong allusions to Milton's **Paradise Lost** throughout the text. Some of the epigraphs are direct quotes and throughout the text itself there are references to PL. Basically, Victor Frankenstein assumes the role of God/Creator, and the monster, his unwilling creation, is Adam. This complicates the idea that the monster is purely evil. He is an unnatural creation, meaning he is doomed from birth. He isn't entirely blameless, but he is a result of overreaching human curiosity and arrogance. We have to ask to what degree Victor Frankenstein's actions are immoral. He is indirectly responsible for multiple murders, but does he feel guilt or does he lay all the blame on his monster? 

Good luck on your test!

dy5oof,"I re-read the book this autumn, and I found myself relating to Frankenstein a lot more than I did when I read it in high school. On your third point, I think he went crazy before he met eyes with his creation, probably during the period of isolation when he was fervently working on the creature, collecting body parts, living in his mind while ignoring thoughts of potential negative consequences, and thoroughly neglecting all other parts of himself not devoted to his project. I had more sympathy for him this time around, because it is such human folly to deceive oneself to achieve aims. 
And yeah, on your last point, I could not get behind Frankenstein’s self-absorption. He really seemed to enjoy his Creator role too much to share his experience with the people around him and to accept that the creature could form associations and affect things beyond him (until it’s too late). 
I also really enjoyed the writing style and how the themes resonate still today.

It's not to excuse them, or to make us sympathetic, but to show us that there is a very thin line between us and what we consider abominable.

It was the childhood of science - there was both enthusiasm, but so little was really known (perhaps outside of math and some astronomy) that the imagination wasn't bound by the limits we have since discovered about the natural world.

>But, to that extent was his folly, and I found myself trying to really understand the evil Victor had caused to deserve his misery.

Well, you asked us not to come at you with sympathy for the demon, so I'll try to avoid doing that. But ultimately Victor's sin is that he is weak-willed and a coward. It ties in a bit with your question below, so I'll start my general rambling there:

>And, why not tell his father, or Henry, or Elizabeth of his ""creation""?

Victor was ashamed. In the book, he glosses over exactly how he animated the demon, describing it along the lines of being too dreadful for thought (although it does make me wonder where the trope of animating the demon with lightening/electricity comes from). Even in our day and age, what he did would be considered incredibly perverse. Taking peoples' bodies and hacking them together to try to create a superhuman? Plus, the general religious stigma of trying to play God. Victor shows cowardice at every turn where it would have mattered most: he animates the demon, and then immediately runs off. When he discovers the demon has escaped, he just kind of flails about, never attempting to figure out where his creation went, until he gets a letter telling him to come home ASAP. When he gets home, it's obvious that Frankenstein has killed his brother, but he lets the nanny hang for it rather than telling anyone his story. He says 'yes' to the creature when asked to create a bride for him, then later changes his mind. Instead of risking his wedding plans by telling his family that there's a psychotic madman on the loose trying to kill everyone close to him, Victor goes through all the motions of getting married, sticks to the plan so that no one knows something is wrong and, quelle suprise, Elizabeth is murdered.

It isn't until after his father's death that Victor finds the strength of character to deal with the problem that he has created, and that is only after the problem he created took absolutely everything from him. In this, both Victor and the demon are mirrored: Victor's secrecy around his creation begins the process of isolating him, begins the process of making him just as lonely as his creation. The demon is lonely and isolated because he is too hideous to be looked upon, no one would accept him into their society. Victor is lonely and isolated because of the condition of his soul - playing God and unleashing a psychotic demon on the world has made his soul as twisted and ugly as the demon. Ironically, they are a perfect pair for each other by the end of the book - both twisted, ugly beings, full of hatred and murderous revenge.

So, anyway, I took the opposite side. I really disliked Victor.",NotAFishYouCanCatch,2020-05-03T03:26:02Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

And if Im not mistaken, Universal owns the concept that many Americans view of Frankenstein (like the flat top head, giant stature, scarred face, bolts on neck). So if someone does an interpretation of Shelley's Frankenstein (even though it's in the public domain), Universal can  step in if their version resembles the iconic Frankenstein Universal Monster from the 20s or 30s (which did very well back in its day!). Why don't other companies do their versions of cinderella and sleeping beauty since those are in the public domain? Because Disney did them in such an iconic way that you're probably going to step on their toes in the process.

7r0u54,"I haven't read the original, but I've recently read ""Romantic Outlaws"" by Charlotte Gordon and she does talk about the differences between the first edition and the second one. This is what she had to say about it:

>Most important, Bentley’s Standard Novel series offered Mary a place on its list for Frankenstein if she revised it so that Bentley could own the copyright.


> Mary was happy for the opportunity to rethink her first novel. Far from becoming more conventional after Shelley died, as Trelawny and Claire had claimed, she had grown increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisy she witnessed in daily life. When she sat down at her writing desk, she applied herself to painting an even bleaker picture than in the original, making changes that emphasized her darkened outlook. In her first version, Victor Frankenstein has the freedom to choose whether to pursue his ambition to create a man. When he makes the wrong choice, it is his own action that brings about his downfall; like a character in a Sophoclean drama, his actions determine his future. But in the 1831 version, Mary strips him of any agency. Victor is a puppet in the hands of inexorable forces, both inner and outer, a man who must obey his impulses and is helpless in the hands of the fates. She lengthens Walton’s letters to his sister, having Frankenstein redouble his warnings against ambition: “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness?” Frankenstein says to Walton, “Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” Elizabeth, Frankenstein’s bride, who was no paragon of strength in the first edition, is now even more powerless, silent and weak, reflecting Mary’s pessimism about women’s chances for happiness when they are dependent on men.

> By the time she had finished, Mary had written a new Frankenstein that was far more critical of society than the first. The 1831 edition depicts the harm caused by human (male) ambition and the lust for power. The female characters may lack the ability to save themselves or others, but they are entirely innocent. They suffer solely because they are connected to Frankenstein. For those naysayers who believed that Percy Shelley was responsible for the writing of the first version, and for those, such as Trelawny and Claire, who accused Mary of being a timid compromiser, the 1831 Frankenstein stands as a supremely original accomplishment, a dystopian vision created entirely by its author, Mary Shelley. Without Shelley by her side, Mary had been forced to become increasingly independent, and, in becoming so, she was now able to write a more complex and powerful book than when she was nineteen years old and her beloved was still alive.

As you see, Gordon doesn't mention the fact it was heavily edited by Shelley's male contemporaries, but considering the fact people kept accusing her of not having written Frankenstein at all, it wouldn't surprise me if the supposed external influence in this was made up as well. I mean, she was basically a kid when she wrote the first version of Frankenstein, and anybody who's ever written something knows how cringe-worthy it is to look back at a  crystallized version of your thoughts that hasn't caught up with how your life changed you; so it makes sense to me that she could want to update the story girl!Mary wrote to catch up with the (many and heartbreaking) experiences woman!Mary had had.

gr5lth,"You have to consider how people felt about science at the time. The conflict between science and religion is still going on, and at the time there was plenty of public anxiety surrounding it. Victor Frankenstein is a man who is trying to use science to usurp the role of God. As you probably already know, the application of electricity to dead bodies was at the time creating an idea that people might be able to be brought back from the dead. People didn't understand why dead bodies moved when a current was applied. 

So, compare Frankenstein with Michaelango's  *The Creation of Adam*. Adam is just about to receive the spark of life from God. Before that happens, Adam sits docile and passive. It is only after receiving that spark of life that he becomes human. 

In Frankenstein, the opposite happens. When the monster is brought to life through this new scientific spark of life (electricity) from his own creator, he becomes something terrible instead of something divine. Frankenstein instantly understands that he has created something that goes against nature. Victor was prepared for how the creature would look. As you said, he collects the parts and puts them together. But until he gave that spark of life, he didn't know what he was going to create. It is only when science has gone too far that you realise it has gone too far.",,2020-05-27T00:29:57Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

q3z2xj,"Okay, so this is my fourth or fifth time reading Frankenstein, but it's been about a decade since the last read. Something that's really sticking out to me this time is how prevalent the theme of parental abandonment is and how common an occurrence it is within the story's early stages, particularly these chapters.

Walton, from the start, in his notes to Margaret, claims to want friendship, someone to share in his ambitions, successes and defeats. Yet, when he describes the ideal friend he seeks he specifies he wants someone with higher education, more means and experience than himself. Given the dejection of his father - forbidding him to read his uncle Thomas's books on seafaring - and this description he's clearly looking for more of a father figure than a peer, at least that's how it seems to me.

This echoes Victor's own familial lack. In fact, so much of the novel's characters' backstories detail parental dejection and absence. Robert, Victor, Elizabeth, who was callously pawned off by her father to her aunt and uncle after her mother's death; Victor's mother whose father died, and Justine, too - the lack or rejection of parental figures forces them to become autodidactic/self-taught in their youth - perhaps grimly shading their formative years (particularly Victor and Robert, here) and allowing their growth into adulthood to be clouded by insufficient or misguided education, leading each to their ultimate failure. Not just the failure of their ambitious quests for scientific glory, but their failure to notice that their parents' lack and the emotional needs they feel are absent are already filled by their existing familial relationships, namely Margaret, Waltons sister, and Elizabeth and Henry Clerval for Victor.  Victor clearly passes this on with his immediate abandonment of ""the daemon"" who in turn follows the exact same path - inadequate self-education leading to rushed judgment and failures to connect to the society at large.

It's certainly interesting that Mary Shelley tapped into some of these generational traits, possibly due to being still a teenager when writing this and having strong opinions on class systems that she sort of satirizes a little bit in *Frankenstein*. I'm so happy and excited to dig into this book again and discuss it.

Also, fun note, I'm reading from *Frankenstein: Annotated for Scientists, Engineers, and Creators of all Kinds.* I have a physical copy but wouldn't you know it, open-access library has a [full pdf version](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/24cb1da5-a512-4de1-b24c-639b6452dbec/628778.pdf) online. It's incredibly insightful.

Ah, questions, didn't see those at first. 

>What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?

""M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.  
Clerval was no natural philosopher. His imagination was too vivid for the minutiæ of science.""

I find it insightful in his recounting to Walton just how dismissive Victor is. It's his major blind spot throughout the story. 

Also, I really love Shelley's description of the thunderstorm over the mountains when he returns to Geneva in the early, early morning, and the passing glimpse of the creature in the flashes.

&#x200B;

>What, in your opinion, is the nature of the origin of horror in the novel? What is your relationship to the horror genre (especially gothic) and your familiarity with Classics?

Some familiarity with classics - Shelley's *The Last Man*, *Crime and Punishment*, *Portrait of Dorian Gray*, *Dracula,* etc, but not a vast knowledge.

I think the horror in *Frankenstein* comes in the realization of trauma. The monster, for Victor, fully realizes his traumas and obsessions in physical form and the trauma emerges from his own anxieties and his own search for a mentor, filling the gap that his parents seemed to leave. It exposes to Victor - violently - that perhaps Victor abandoned his parents rather than the opposite.   


>How necessary were the conditions that lead Shelley to create her story? Could another author, even a contemporary writer, have penned a similar tale?

I think Shelley's youth and liberalism led her to view aristocracies at the time a certain way. I don't know much/can't recall much about her, but I know a tenuous relationship with her mother could clearly lead to Victor's characterization in the novel. I think another writer could hit the same plot beats, but miss the heart of the novel. I think the countless poor adaptations of the novel are a sign of that.

&#x200B;

>Why do you feel the novel unfolds in letters and nested tales? How do these devices affect the themes and central terror?

I think you need unreliable narrators in a story like this. You catch more character glimpses with that. A footnote in the edition I've read points out that Victor makes no mention of taking notes while ""creating"" the monster for posterity or publication. You get a window into the obsession and the paranoia that unfolds in the chase between Victor and the monster, or the developing relationship between Walton and Victor express what happens at the bounds of the known world - which is a terrifying place to be. The horror is clear - what do you do when you find the unknown? *Create* the unknown? 

&#x200B;

>What role do sickness and dreams play for Shelley and her characters? Do you feel these elements service the style of the novel or feed the exploration of existential dread and ambition?

Dreams seem to act like Freudian hints to the characters' anxieties. That Victor is open to sharing his dreams with Walton shows his development as a character and his understanding of his mistakes, but also expresses his acceptance of damnation. He is doomed, and he knows it.   


>BONUS: which song, album, or musical artist would be a good accompaniment for the reading thus far?

Tool. I think Tool has a unique way of not only discussing similar themes of anxieties, progress, mysticism, science into one package, but the music itself is also both violent and contemplative in turns. *Pneuma* is about the spark and breaths of life, *Forty-Six & 2* discusses many of the same anxieties that obsessively drive Victor

q3z2xj,"From a literary perspective, for me the true genius of this novel is a study of the unreliable narrator. All three narrators - Walton, Frankenstein and his monster - commit illegal, immoral or questionable acts. How they justify that fascinates me. It's a novel you have to read with a critical mind.

This is best summed up for me in how Frankenstein first describes seeing his creation move:

""He stretched out one hand, seemingly to detain me""

That one word ""seemingly"" is so telling, because in the Monster's narrative he stretches out his hand for help, not hindrance.

q3z2xj,"**What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?**


This may sound a little morbid but I liked the letter that Victor received from his father. I was so engaged in Victor's life and studies that after his sickness I mostly forgot that it was a gothic horror novel we were reading. It was such a twist and gut wrenching it really had an effect on me. 
A quote that I like is in chapter ch (pg 31 in my kindle ed) ""A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.""



**What, in your opinion, is the nature of the origin of horror in the novel? What is your relationship to the horror genre (especially gothic) and your familiarity with Classics?**


I've only read two other horror classics: The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Haunting of Hill House. This is my first reading of Frankenstein. 

With the Picture of Dorian Gray >!I felt like the horror came from Dorian not knowing of the atrocities he was cable of doing. Like a self vs self conflict. And with The Haunting of Hill House instead of the typical haunted house it was more of questioning reality. Was Eleanor really not able to handle the creepy things happening to her and the other guests and did she really lose her mind in the house or did the house really drive her to her demise?!< 

I feel like Frankenstein might go about something similar as in what we see is not really the whole story. So far as an audience we may believe that Frankenstein's monster did commit the murder of William. But what if it was Justine and if not Justine maybe another human. It would be hard to admit that humans are capable of such atrocities when there is a literal monster whom we can easily assign the blame to. 
I not sure exactly how to put into words what I think horror classes nature is but I my best guess is that it puts more emphasis on psychological horror than things that jump out you from the dark. 



**How necessary were the conditions that lead Shelley to create her story? Could another author, even a contemporary writer, have penned a similar tale?**


I actually no little to nothing about Mary Shelley or the conditions that lead to her creating the novel so I can't really answer this. 



**Why do you feel the novel unfolds in letters and nested tales? How do these devices affect the themes and central terror?**
I love the letters and then later on the tales from Victor. It's kinda of like a game of telephone. It's like it messes with the reliability of the narrator and we don't know how ""true"" the events are which leads to a little doubt and increases the horror. 



**What roll do sickness and dreams play for Shelley and her characters? Do you feel these elements service the style of the novel or feed the exploration of existential dread and ambition?**


I think that the dreams force Victor to come to terms that he may have screwed up by letting his creation get away and now is doomed to suffer any and all consequences from that mistake. It think he's doomed to suffer. 



**What questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Is there a question you would like to posted to the group for next week?**

I really don't want Frankenstein's ""monster"" to be responsible for William's death. And that being said I hope that we as an audience come to sympathize with Frankenstein's creation because the poor thing didn't ask to be part of this world and he was just left alone to fend for himself in a scary world were even his own creator thinks he's a monster.

q3z2xj,"This is my second reading, and I was pretty excited about digging a bit deeper into the text now that I knew the adaptation-divorced plot and characters from the first a few years ago.

These are some random notes I took while reading this first section, so they’re not aligned to the questions really, but they hit some of the points:

- The richness of the language is still challenging, but can also be so satisfying. Indulgence is no sin.

- I still don’t know how to feel about the relationship between Victor and Elizabeth. Is it supposed to be a genuine romantic ideal? There’s no denying that there’s tenderness there. But even beyond the (modern?) weirdness of going from such a strong sibling relationship to a romantic one, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the way Victor talks possessively of her in Chapter 1 could be either parallel or foreshadowing of his relationship with the creature, and also a bit of feminist critique on Shelley’s part on the possessively-termed gender roles of the times.

- One thing most adaptations fail in is reminding us that Victor is no more than twenty or twenty-one at the time of the experiment. That’s a far cry in terms of characterizing and judging him, and the themes of his character and the novel, from picturing him as a white-haired professor. I wish that in art and on screen he was more often shown as, essentially, a boy. It would paint a different picture in culture.

- Frankenstein the book and the character are rarely talked about in regards to mental health but Frankie’s breakdown following the creation seems an unusually sympathetic portrayal of trauma for the time. Shelley takes some care to show a genuine seeming recovery, with Clerval’s companionship and Viccy finding purpose in nature balancing out the time it takes to recover, and the very genuine assessment of science equipment as a trigger. On that point, isn’t Clerval a treasure? “Excellent friend!” (exclaimed by Victor towards the end of Chapter 6) about sums it up. This in contrast to the creation, who in his abandonment, is never allowed that healing companionship.

- Shelley seems very fond of (a) Switzerland and (b) Asian literature. I like the bit about Victor being healed by reading poetry that “appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses.”  It’s also a lovely upswing of humanizing, in a section that feels just the same way, against the gothic tide of the novel overall. On the Switzerland point it’s interesting thinking of this fairly progressive English lady spending time in one of the first European republics (I’m a little fuzzy on that history, but in Frankenstein she basically says as much) and coming to idealize it out of a combination of insight and probably some nostalgia.

q3z2xj,"I’m not really a horror person, so I tend to avoid books that are billed as “horror” due to the strong associations I have between the term and supernatural horror or slasher movies. As for classics, I read a bunch in high school and undergrad, but I read more new releases these days and really only read classics when I go out of my way to read a specific book or author.

I think the environs of Lake Geneva and fellow writers, the time in which it was written, plus Mary Shelley’s own life events, helped bring together this story and make it an enduring tale. Another writer today could write a similar story, sure, but I think it would be difficult to create one on the genre-defining level of Frankenstein. Similarly, another writer at the same time could have written a similar story, but the physical environment and the influence of Percy Shelley and Byron made Frankenstein unique. And at the end of the day, no one else is Mary Shelley and no one else would have been able to do exactly what she did.

_x000D_  
I do like a good frame story, and the letters and storytelling framing of the story create a campfire-y feel, like when you’re a kid at camp and everyone’s telling the scariest ghost stories they can think of so you’ll all spend a sleepless night huddled terrified in your tents. It places the story at a remove, being related secondhand by the narrator rather than firsthand. Secondhand and thirdhand and etc-hand scary stories are always embellished a bit with each telling, but they also happened to your best friend’s neighbor’s cousin’s sister, so there has to be some grain of truth, and that’s what makes them scary. Maybe Victor is exaggerating his tale a bit, or Captain Walton hasn’t remembered all the details correctly, but it’s told so vividly that you feel that you could, like Victor, wake up to the creature standing over your own bed.",carolina_on_my_mind,2021-10-12T22:42:43Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

The book ends I seem to recall with Walton planning to return to England, but we never read of his homecoming.

45z93l,"As was said, Victor's biggest sin is creating the monster. The monster didn't asked to be born and Victor shirked his responsibility. In this I don't think the monster gets praise as much as it gets sympathy. 

The monster is the neglected child that, well, grew up to be a monster. Does the monster still bear responsibility for its actions? absolutely, but Victor from F is the deadbeat dad who was not ready to be a father and ran away when faced with consequence. Remember in the time the book was written, the modern ideas of what is science, and what are science's responsibilities were being codified. The book calls itself The Modern Prometheus, but more accurately, in the context of its own story, it's a modern Pandora. In this, the whole story can be seen as a giant metaphor for the scientist and his/her work. Regardless of if he could, Victor didn't really question if he should. Pandora's box was opened and Frankenstein PhD was humbled by the ramifications.

From this heuristic, for myself, I will never blame the monster because I see the monster as a consequence to bad science first and an autonomous being second. When Oppenheimer built the bomb, he took it upon himself to call for nuclear proliferation and heavily criticized the arms race; a potion which would see him stripped of his political influence. Were the bomb built by Frankenstein, the good doctor would have left it to the politicians to figures and his only internal conflict would be whether he should claim any responsibility, or wash his hands of all things and let Serber be credited/blamed for his work.

qdlspv,"**What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?**

This was so depressing it's hard to say that I had a favorite part. Through all this the monster still just wants companionship. Even though he thinks himself a monster he still believes that he deserves companionship... ""yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am quite alone."" I think this makes the monster very human to desire companionship. And with his creator gone he is not only missing compainonship but also meaning. 


**How do you feel Frankenstein's understanding of free will changes over the course of his life and his studies? How does he apply this estimation to his own actions, to that of his creation, and to the potential mate for his creation that he ultimately refused to animate?**

I think by the second half of novel Frankenstein believes life to be somewhat predetermined, otherwise why would he be so adamant in thinking that his creation would end up a monster. He already sees his creation as a monster before he commits any crimes and only sees him more so as a monster as time goes on. 


**What morals do you feel Shelley wished to impart on her audience with this tale? For what purpose do you feel the novel was made to include the subtitle ""Or the Modern Prometheus?""**

I'm pretty rusty with my Greek history and Greek mythology but I really don't see the connection with Prometheus and Frankenstein. Promethus stole fire from Olympus for mankind and was punished by Zeus because of it. But I honestly don't see how that connects to this.

That being said I think that Shelley wanted to show her audience that we create monsters with our actions. Kind of like a nature vs nurture. Yes Frankenstein's creation looked like a monster but he didn't start committing monstrous acts until mankind abandon him. Of course he was going to retaliate. He was lonely and never given
love. Love and human touch is vital during the infancy age of humans. If you neglect a baby it could very well die. Who's to say that humankind didn't kill monster's affection, kindness, his desire to love?


**Why are Frankenstein and his monster both ultimately miserable, bereft of human companionship, and obsessed with revenge? In what ways are their respective demises similar or different?**

Frankenstein was an idiot. He suffered exactly what his creation suffered through yet he could not sympathize or empathize with his creation. In the end they both desired the same thing companionship and happiness but vengeance and revenge robbed them of that happiness.


**Why do you feel Walton abandoned his journey in the end and how are his purported or true motivations revealed 
to his sister and to the audience?**

I've honestly forgotten what was Walton's whole purpose in his journey. I did like the fact that Frankenstein 
tried to convince the crew to continue on with the journey.


**What further reading, by Shelley or another author, would you recommend to someone who loved this novel and wants more?**

I'm curious how was the monster portrayed differently in the earlier version? I couldn't find much online, admittedly after only a short search. He didn't strike me as unsympathetic in the 1831 version, at least for a ""monster.""

But what got my mind reeling is the cousin/adoptive sister change. Putting the incest angle aside, I like it being an adoptive sister much better. I had always assumed it was intentional with her part in the family being ""created,"" opposed to by blood and how the family cared and loved her.

e7d6qj,"Glad I was able to interest you enough to send you down a rabbit hole! 

It's the same, but it isn't. It's little details, like for example, Victor Frankenstein creates the monster in an act of free will in 1818, he does so because he wants to, despite the consequences of it. He only regrets it once he's done bringing the monster to life. In this way, the monster was the result of an act of strange coincidences and Victor's own desires, the monster becomes human becuase there's not much of a reason for him to exist, yet unexplainably he does. It's shitty luck, and God is absent through the entire novel, just like he's absent of our lives. In the 1831 version, Victor becomes the victim of strange forces of evil, and despite this not being the monster's fault, it still implies his existence as the result of evil, as if he was brought to life because of the devil, and not because of...the chaotic forces that drive our lives. It's basically Shelley herself being the monster who killed her own mother at birth and remains motherless for the rest of her life, in a chaotic way, in a humanly shitty way. Or her being the victim, just like Victor, of destiny, of evil forces. It's almost a religious interpretation of her own tale. Was Victor to be blamed for the monster? Of course not, it was destiny! He's still human in the 1831... but diferent. From a text I found online about the topic:

Anne K. Mellor’s “Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach” is reprinted in the Norton Critical Edition. Mellor reckons that “Mary Shelley’s philosophical views changed radically” primarily as a result of the pessimism created by her own personal circumstances and the deaths of those close to her. “The values implicitly espoused in the first edition of Frankenstein—that nature is a nurturing and benevolent life force that punished only those who transgress against its sacred rights, that Victor is morally responsible for his acts, that the Creature is potentially good but driven to evil by social and parental neglect, that a family like the De Laceys that loves all its children equally offers the best hope for human happiness, and that human egotism causes the greatest suffering in the world—are all rejects in the 1831 revisions” (209).

In 1818, Mellor notes, Victor Frankenstein possessed free will; in 1831 he is the pawn of forces beyond his control. He is a victim rather than an originator of evil; and the morally superior Clerval has in 1831 become someone as ambitious of fame and power as Frankenstein. The idea of the bourgeois loving family is undercut in 1831: Caroline Beaufort deliberately sacrifices her life. And in the preface “Mary Shelley presents herself as she now represents Frankenstein, as a victim of destiny. She is ‘compelled’ to write; her imagination ‘unbidden’ possessed and guided her” (210).

7siy8t,"A recent Bodleian edition of the book was profiled in the Chronicle of Higher Education (EBSCO source at bottom). Apparently the question of proper authorial attribution has at times been considered a relevant question by scholars because of Percy’s “interventions,” but this is not heavily indulged by scholars today.

From the article: “To prepare it, Robinson [the editor] returned to the Notebooks and stripped Percy out of the text altogether, leaving the reader alone with Mary's voice. Robinson also included the text of the 1816-17 draft, with Percy's edits clearly marked. The juxtaposition gives us a closer look at the creative give-and-take - word by word, sentence by sentence - of the Shelleys' relationship.”

Percy’s efforts to aid Mary: “Robinson picks out some suggestive examples that contrast Mary's taste for direct language with Percy's penchant for Latinate elaborations. Mary describes a character entering a sick room before ""it was safe""; Percy revises that to ""before the danger of infection was past."" Walton, the ship's captain to whom Frankenstein tells his hair-raising tale, calls a reverie of Victor's ""peculiarly interresting"" [sic] in Mary's draft; Percy changes that to ""almost as interesting & imposing as truth."" Victor's lament that ""the brightness of a loved eye can have faded"" becomes, in Percy's words, ""the brightness of a loved eye can be extinguished.""” (I’m too lazy to edit the double quotations marks to contained singles)

Quantifying Percy’s “interventions”: “All told, Robinson identified about 3,000 words that Percy wrote into Mary's draft. Add that tally to changes that Percy is known to have made later, during the run-up to publication, and you have a total of about 5,000 words of Percy's in a 72,000-word novel.”

From this article, it seems Percy and Mary worked together to make the published story work best based on whatever standards they held at the time, but that it is a Mary Shelley creation. She wrote it, he tried to make it sing. 

Hope this helps.

q8otwb,"This is my second reading of *Frankenstein* and the first classic I have consumed in recent memory having favored more contemporary works for a while now and I have been completely enamored with Shelley's style. I adore the delicious the delicious irony of how often Frankenstein speaks of existence in words which would have been just as apropos had they been spoken by his creation:

> ""Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear."" *(In reference to Justine's death)* . . . ""Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.""

Or the turn of phrase on being ""animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm"" in application to his studies of life and death. It was fascinating to hear the formative experiences which defined the creature's consciousness, especially as something on an archaic account of how identity was modeled in the 18th century. Or how - on an a related note - the creature with his immature if burgeoning knowledge of worldly affairs wept at the fate of the original habitants of the new continent. Not sure I have come across many personal opinions from other nationalities of the era which describes the colonization of America. 

The responses in the last discussion were absolutely wonderful. I have really enjoyed hearing all of your detailed and original insights. I would love to revisit other classics in future club selections.",XBreaksYFocusGroup,2021-10-15T15:09:38Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
q8otwb,"My internet is out so I'm doing this on my mobile, bare with me...


**What are some of your favorite parts or quotes? What parts did you find confusing or wish were different?**


I didn't read any parts that are confusing. My favorite parts were when the ""monster"" was experiencing the world for the first time. I loved how he seemed so childlike with his naivete. I also felt so bad for him when he came to find realization that he was alone and that people considered him to be a monster.


**What is Victor Frankenstein's relationship to the environment or nature and what role does nature serve in the larger novel? When is he blind to nature and when is he enraptured by it?**


It seems like Frankenstein does appreciate nature and finds it to symbolize goodness. But with this understanding and appreciation comes guilt because he doesn't think he deserves to bask in the goodness of nature. I feel like Frankenstein feels he deserves to be excommunicated from the goodness of nature.


**What are your feelings upon hearing the creature's tale, as Frankenstein did? Do you agree with the doctor's reaction to the request for a second creation and with which character(s) do your sympathies lie?**


I fully sympathize with the monster. I cried when his plan failed. You're a product of your environment. And the ""monster"" knows no goodness or kindness for mankind. Of course he's going to retaliate against his creator. He simply does not want to be lonely.

That being said, I understand where Frankenstein is coming from. I don't agree with it but I understand. Yes the ""monster"" has shared his story and it is a tragic one. But how does he know the ""monster"" is not lying just to get what he wants? How does he know if the ""monster"" is capable of keeping his promise. I don't agree with Frankenstein's reaction towards the ""monster"" but I understand it. I'll also say that I'm glad that Frankenstein agreed to create a companion for his ""monster"".


**Who do you feel is culpable in the deaths of William and Justine?**

Obviously you can't dispute the ""monster"" is responsible. He murdered William. But to say that Frankenstein holds no blame is a faulty notion. He is responsible for his creation. Frankenstein also KNEW that Justine was innocent and didn't try hard enough to acquit her. The ""monster"" states he hates mankind because they hate him. The ""monster"" knows only hatred and horror from mankind, they deny him sympathy, kindness and love all of which are virtues that are needed to bring up a happy healthy child. The ""monster"" is childlike in that he is learning how the world works and where his place will eventually be in the world.


**In what ways are parental relationships depicted in the novel and what do you feel Shelley means to illustrate in these explorations?**


I'm not sure what parental relations Shelly is trying to depict with Frankenstein's father. However, there is a parental relationship with the ""monster"" and Frankenstein. Frankenstein is not only his creator but a parental figure as well. And as a parental figure Frankenstein is terrible. Frankenstein treats his ""monster"" as a monster. Frankenstein abandons the ""monster"" and lets him fend for himself in the world on his own without any basic knowledge. His ""monster"" is shown to be able to learn to read and speak french. So he's not an idiot he has intelligence but that intelligence is not nurtured and because of that his character may indeed rot to the monster that Frankenstein and the world believe him to be.


**What questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Is there a question you would like to posted to the group for next week?**


I'm really wishing for a happy ending, but this is a Gothic literature and I foresee a tragedy coming. I'm coming into the story pretty blind. I've never seen Frankenstein nor have I read the book before so I don't know how it ends.

We as an audience know that Frankenstein is following somebody. Who is he following and why? Here's my prediction: something is going to go wrong with the creation of Frankenstein's second creation and this will be the tipping point for our ""monster"". He will finally become the monster that everyone keeps telling him he is, with that we'll probably see the monster try to get revenge on Frankenstein. That maybe who Frankenstein is following in the beginning of his story.",Pythias,2021-10-16T02:15:41Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
q8otwb,"Here’s a question, do you think the creation has any ground to stand on when he says that Victor creating a companion for him would solve all his problems and quell his directed but clearly very real and dangerous rage? When you compare that to his own creation, it’s not so different. He (the monster) wants to bring life into the world with a firm plan, determined that this genesis will have the outcome he predetermined– just like Victor did. When you think about people like that, who are so full of anger at the world because of their own isolation, they often think that a partner will solve all their problems. But that’s obviously a misconception when there are much deeper seated issues than that.

q8otwb,"I didn't feel as driven by this section as I did the first, but that may have been my exhaustion during the week. I think, narratively, things grind to a bit of a halt to hear the story of Frankenstein's monster recounted at such a pace. It does create sympathy for the creature much the same way the first volume created sympathy for Victor, despite his own heinous acts taken in creating the monster (grave robbing, animal abuse, etc). 

  
However, the description of the monster's intellectual development certainly mirrors Victor's, up until the formal education. To a point, I feel the plot has a few conveniences that modern critics would deride: The monster tells DeLacey he speaks French, but being Swiss, does Victor speak the same language? I don't know if French was an official language then as it is now, but do we know that Victor speaks French? I do find the detour into Safie's backstory, while thematically interesting, aside from adding to the creature's education slows the pacing again. And worst of all are the conveniences of finding Victor's bag with the novels and the notes on the creature's construction seemingly out of nowhere. That and the pure luck in finding William before killing him, the creature seems almost to be guided by divine hands.   


Overall, from what I remember of my previous readthroughs, this middle section - with its constant turns into despair and wretchedness, elaborate description leading to events we already know, and plot contrivances, is my least favourite section of the novel. 

 

>What is Victor Frankenstein's relationship to the environment or nature and what role does nature serve in the larger novel? When is he blind to nature and when is he enraptured by it?

&#x200B;

I believe Victor is done equating himself to a god. He sees the scale of the world and its control over him after the loss of William and Justine. His suicidal thoughts and his method of which (drowning) signal his subservience to nature as its subject, not an equal creator. 

&#x200B;

>What are your feelings upon hearing the creature's tale, as Frankenstein did? Do you agree with the doctor's reaction to the request for a second creation and with which character(s) do your sympathies lie?

&#x200B;

I understand Victor's hesitation to the creature's promise to leave him alone, yet I feel Victor realizes the only way to absolve himself of his sin is through some sort of penance. That Victor makes no attempt at a counteroffer, however, to accept and take in the monster is still a sign that he doesn't fully realize his culpability, despite the lip service he pays to it. This is why he firmly rejects the offer several times before finally accepting it.

&#x200B;

>Who do you feel is culpable in the deaths of William and Justine?

  
Victor. While the monster acknowledges the pain and despair the murders cause Victor - of course making him culpable - Vicor's neglect resulted in the social stunting of the creature. In all honesty, due to his failure to observe ethics in creating the monster, culpability, in my mind, leans heavily on Victor.   


>In what ways are parental relationships depicted in the novel and what do you feel Shelley means to illustrate in these explorations?

I explored this in more detail in my [first book club post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q3z2xj/comment/hfvdh2h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but I believe in this section Mary continues her motif of abandonment, whether physical, emotional, or intellectual. While the DeLacey's are a sort of outlier here, Safie's story continues he rend. Her father very much treas her as if property, emotionally and intellectually rejecting the independence to the point he may as well have abandoned her despite her making the choice to leave. Shelley seems to stress the important of emotionally involved parenting by presenting its lack in abundance throughout the novel.",viper1001,2021-10-15T16:57:23Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I like books that have a sense of humor, and I like books that have a satirical element, though not exclusively.

7ywy8k,"I was at a writing workshop, and we were critiquing a story by Benjamin Rosenbaum titled ""Senseless and Insensible"" that was a surrealistic takedown of Jane Austen. It was very weird and very funny. As we talked about it, I realized that Austen and Shelley were contemporary writers, but in English departments they are seldom talked about together. I wondered if there might be a story in combining them.

Then I went back to the books and discovered that in Frankenstein, when Victor goes to England in order to make a bride for the Creature, he stops in the town of Matlock. It turns out that in Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy's estate is near the same town. So it would be possible, by juggling the dates, for Victor to run into characters from Pride and Prejudice. That got me going.

In FRANKENSTEIN it says that Victor traveled through England ""collecting the materials"" he would need to create a female creature. Well, one of the materials he'd need would be a female body. And of course, in Austen's novels men are always seeking brides. The idea just grew and grew the more I thought about it. ",JohnKessel,2018-02-20T17:23:39Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I agree the frame story of the arctic explorer seems redundant. But I think part of the problem is the baggage that people come to the book with after all the movies and cultural tropes. We start the book expecting...Frankenstein and the monster. Instead, we get a bunch of stuff about Russia etc. But imagine if you never heard of Frankenstein, and u came to the book fresh and with no assumptions.

2389zq,"If you're reading consistently and thoroughly, you'll notice that the story is told by a man, Walton, writing letters to his sister. He's writing about Victor Frankenstein's story of creating his monster and hunting it down, and later he tells the story from the monster's perspective as Victor described it to him.

So, Walton is telling his sister what Victor told him and Victor is telling Walton what the monster told him. 

The point of these framed stories is to give the reader a range of character descriptions and leave it up to him or her to judge each character for themselves.

 Robert Walton paints Victor as a kind and interesting person because he finds him under certain circumstances, but once you start reading the story from Frankenstein's perspective, you being to see how cruel and twisted he is. As Victor tells his story, he describes his monster as a horrid, hideous mutant, and that gives you a sense that the monster is evil in some way. But once you start reading the narrative from the monster's point of view, you see how innocent and human the monster really is. He learns from sensory experience and he sees beauty in the world. 

I read Frankenstein for British Literature 2 so this was kind of fresh in my mind. Hope this helped!

We don't know much about her except that she is native to England, but went abroad for marriage. Essentially, Shelley places Mrs. Saville as her character stand-in. She does not speak but watches over the events of the novel from a safe distance. The text begins and ends with her. 

Not convinced? Take a look at their initials - Margaret Walton Saville and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.

3pf0o1,It's actually referencing a different story of Prometheus. Prometheus was tasked by Zeus with the creation of man and he did so by shaping mud which Athena breathed life into. So it's a little more literal since Frankenstein creates the monster (aka Adam note the parallels between this mythos and Christian creatonism).,capincus,2015-10-19T23:25:01Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
3pf0o1,"You know, I'd never thought of it that way, but i have to say, I agree with you, for the most part.  There is a correlation between the ""moral"" of these stories.  They both did the ""unthinkable"" as prescribed by a ""higher power"" than themselves.  In this case; Zeus and God. because they both did what was forbidden, they are both punished by recurring torments (eaten by crows and watching everyone die, one at a time).  And, in between the gift and the punishment, there was a glimmer of hope that things would work out.  Fire helped man tremendously while Frankenstein's monster had redeeming qualities of his own... 

I think this might be a stretch to some people, but I can definitely see how you came to this conclusion. ",goagod,2015-10-19T23:18:34Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT
3pf0o1,"I've missed the first five hours of this conversation (where I'm standing, it's been going on in the middle of the night!), but the different points I've read make a lot of sense. OP's idea about punishment definitely works, but /u/capincus must be right about the link Shelley is making to Prometheus's task of creating man from clay. 

The discussion has made me realise what I find good and bad about this novel. As a narrative, it's always struck me as the work of a novice. It has *debut novel* written all over it, and the endless repetitiveness and the psychological crudity seems explicable that way. But Shelley has a very firm grip on the moral universe within which she writes. She seems to be part of an early 19th Century tradition in which virtue is rewarded and sins (such as Frankenstein's pride) are not to be tolerated. In other words, Prometheus, a figure from pagan mythology, is given a Christian spin. The endless guilt that tortures Frankenstein (as cited by /u/penduh) becomes his own personal hell on earth.

What isn't clear is whether Frankenstein will ever be redeemed. This is a vital aspect of the Christian moral universe, and fallible characters in 19th Century fiction (think of Jane Austen) are usually able to achieve redemption through a change in their own self-satisfied or self-centred behaviour. I don't see Frankenstein ever forgiving himself. Is there any closure for him?",wecanreadit,2015-10-20T05:29:14Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

I loved that society made the monster bad by telling him he was monstrous (tehehe).  I thought the question of scientific responsibility (something also present in Cat's Cradle, one of my favorite novels) was fascinating.  

And finally I thought the story was so much more intriguing than the movie.

I wrote about it, briefly, after I read it back in 2014:

> Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.
Its reputation precedes it, and I found it very disappointing.
My knowledge of Frankenstein comes from popular culture where Dr. Frankenstein is a maniacal madman (redundant, but whatever) who is creating a monster for evil purposes. Or at least for kicks. And that he loves his monster as his own creation.
However, that’s not how the book goes.
Instead, Dr. Frankenstein creates the monster (and we’re never told how) and immediately hates and fears it when it comes alive. Then he flees and leaves the monster to its own devices. The monster eventually learns to speak. And is like a superhuman — it is faster, stronger and more capable of surviving physical extremes than humans.
There is none of the lumbering giant that is portrayed in movies and TV shows.
Eventually the monster and Frankenstein reunite, after the monster has killed a few people.
Overall, the book isn’t that bad, and I can’t blame it for how the movie studios have recreated it.
And I guess I have only myself to blame for thinking it would be better than it was.

Edward and Alphonse play God by breaking No. 1 rule and pay for it by losing body parts.

6do0v0,"Thanks for your questions! In the ""Professor Nightmare"" series, the specific authors I've presented so far include William Shakespeare (in book one, ""Hamlet and the Ghost King"") and Mary Shelley (in the latest, ""Frankenstein and the Monster""). I'm still in the planning stages for book three, but I'm thinking about doing something with Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" though that's not really book-length. 

I cover a variety of themes in the ""Professor Nightmare"" series, though the books serve mostly as an introduction to the stories -- what they're about, who wrote them, what the setting is, etc. In the current book, for example, the characters are surprised to find themselves stuck in the Arctic, which is where the original ""Frankenstein"" opens and closes. I didn't know this till I was in college, so I thought it'd be fun to start there. The books also play with the ideas explored in the original works. So in the current book, for example, the kids learn that Frankenstein is the name of the scientist, not the monster, but they also touch on the question of who the real ""bad guy"" is, and what makes a true ""monster."" There's even a paragraph in there about how the original book is an epistolary (""A pistol what?"" as one character asks), which is a story told through letters. 

One theme that seems to pop up seemingly organically over and over again in my ""Professor Nightmare"" and other ""horror"" books and stories for kids is the idea of friendship. I always seem to drop kids into stories who have issues -- with each other or otherwise -- and who, through the course of the story, come together to overcome whatever obstacles there are. In the ""Professor Nightmare"" books, the protagonists are two boys, the class clowns, and ""the smartest girl in their fourth-grade class."" They don't always get along, but when they're thrust together in Professor Nightmare's books they tend to recognize each other's strengths and band together. In another of my books, ""The Diamond Gnomes,"" my 6-year-old came up with the initial ""scary"" parts of the plot, and when writing it all out the narrative that ended up tying it all together wound up being about two best friends who'd had a falling out; their dads had worked together and one had gotten fired while the other was promoted. There was a whole rich cool kid vs. loner poor kid dynamic. Then they ended up trapped in a cave and had to work together to escape, etc. 

It's an interesting theme that tends to pop up in the genre a lot; you see it in Stephen King a lot, for example, it's central to the plot of ""Stranger Things,"" etc. I wonder how many writers go into a project with that theme in mind and how many writers it just ""happens to"" in the course of the writing...

I have way too many ""favorite"" authors and stories to list here, but when it comes to classic horror I don't think anyone beats H.P. Lovecraft. He's got a big following in the geek and creative communities, but he's relatively unknown by a lot of people popularly, which is really too bad. His works as whole pieces aside -- which are amazing -- there are so many specific moments and scenes in his various stories that have inspired so many of the horror and science-fiction themes and scenes we consume today, and many of us don't even know he's the guy who probably did them first. Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" is great. If you've never read the original, it's reputation is well deserved; it holds up really well and really is a page-turner. Two recommendations for old-school horror not many people have read, both published in the 1790s, are ""The Monk,"" by Matthew Lewis (it's long and mostly boring, but just skim those parts; the scary parts are capital-H horror and worth wading through the rest) and ""Wieland,"" by Charles Brockden Brown. The latter holds up surprisingly well and reads like a 1790s ""X-Files"" episode. 

Thinking of current genre writers I immediately go to R.L. Stine, just because his ""Goosebumps"" books were such a HUGE part of my youth. His influence can't be overstated. I dedicated my first book -- ""The Barrens House"" -- to him and mailed it to him and he wrote me back thanking me; the letter is framed on my wall. I've been digging back into comics and graphic novels lately, which is a pretty intense phase I go through for a few months every few years for whatever reason, and there are a lot of great horror or horror/sci-fi writers doing great things in comics. Scott Snyder immediately comes to mind (try ""Wytches"" to start). Jeff Lemire's ""Black Hammer"" and Brian K. Vaughan's ""Paper Girls"" are both current ongoing series that cross the science-fiction/horror genres and I'm really enjoying both. 

What about you? What are your favorites? What are you reading now?

6do0v0,"Great questions, thank you! As a full-time digital marketer for a college by day, a lot of my time is spent creating content for various websites, social media platforms, blogs, etc., and a lot of that content is visual. I also serve as the official college photographer, and years ago in my senior year of college as an undergrad I interned at the local daily newspaper as a copy editor, where I'd lay out several pages of the newspaper each day. This is all background to say that I actually don't hire anyone to do my covers; I just do them myself using editing and design software that I also use professionally. 

More formal graphic designers would probably do layout in a program like Adobe InDesign, but I usually use Photoshop because that's what I'm most proficient at using. I keep my covers pretty simple. Here are a few of the latest:

[""Professor Nightmare Recommends 2: Frankenstein and the Monster""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x8hw9kwrg035ar4/Frankenstein%20cover%20FINAL.jpg?dl=0)

[""Professor Nightmare Recommends 1: Hamlet and the Ghost King""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8lbxm6u91nnz93/Hamlet%20cover%20final%202%20front%202.jpg?dl=0)

[""Avi & Simon's Freaky Tales 1: The Diamond Gnomes""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgwff0c5fvm1uq8/4x6%20diamond%20gnomes%20one-piece%20cover.jpg?dl=0)

Through some trial and error I've landed on a kind of template for each series. So I know going in to each of the ""Professor Nightmare"" books, for example, that each will have a different color scheme, will feature a photo representation of the main ghost or creature in black and white, and will feature cartoon-like drawings of the kids looking freaked out. I don't consider myself super talented at the drawing part necessarily, I just do it because it's most convenient to do it myself and it works well enough. I take the traditional comic book art approach to the cartoon part, penciling first, then inking, then scanning it in and coloring it digitally before laying it out over the photo. I'm getting better and faster at it as I go, I think, which is nice to see. For the photo element I search around in various public domain archives online, like the [Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections/), etc., and slowly narrow things down from a bunch of possible photo options. These archives are great for inspiration for new stories, by the way, if you ever want to start a new project but aren't sure where to begin.

I think the most annoying thing about the covers, especially working with print-on-demand online printers with slow turnaround on projects, is getting the cover dimensions/size correct. The systems tell you what the dimensions of your cover should be, including where the spine starts and ends, etc., but every print run is slightly different, and it takes an order or two of books and slight tweaks here and there before I get things to a place I'm OK with. 

The design part is fun but it's also really time consuming, at least for me. Each ""Professor Nightmare"" book takes me approximately 20 hours to create from start to finish (not counting any research and outlining to prep), and close to half the total time is spent figuring out and executing the cover design. One big benefit of working with an actual publisher, in my opinion, would be that I could just work on the writing and maybe provide some insights or direction on the cover but generally leave the actual cover execution to the publisher's design team. I'd probably have a much larger output in terms of the writing, that's for sure. 

It does help some to kind of know how you want your cover to look like ahead of time, especially if you have all the elements together already (the photos, colors, fonts, etc., selected in advance), because then it takes less time to put it all together when it gets to that point. That's another benefit of using a template for the series, as well. 

As for valuable general lessons about self-publishing, I'll probably come back to this one later with a more in-depth reply when I've had some time to really think about it, but I think knowing what you want going in is important. You need to be doing it because you like it or because you're passionate about it. If you go into a project thinking it'll make you rich and you'll never have to work again, you're likely setting yourself up for discouragement, and the last thing any writer needs is more self-doubt. I wrote about this in another response in this thread, but a big reason I like to produce books like this is so my 7-year-old daughter will see that writing books is something anyone can do, something she can do, if she wants to. I regularly print copies of various books so she can give them to the kids in her class, which is fun. Also, after two full years of grad school -- I finished last summer -- where we regularly had to write research papers that were 20 pages long or more (I think my final was 60 or 70 pages), writing book-length manuscripts that don't require days of dry research for references is relatively easy, and I have fun doing it. 

Hopefully some of this is helpful. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions!",SimonThalmann,2017-05-27T22:21:02Z,Frankenstein,COMMENT

qe33qi,"I was impressed with his sequel to The Shining (Doctor Sleep). Danny as a grown-up who manages to use his ability to help others, in spite of his own trauma. Then fighting the energy vampires. Plus some closure for him in there too. Well worth the read coming off the first book.

qe33qi,"What I always liked about *The Shining* in contrast to many of his other novels is how controlled it is. It's very tightly focused and intense. He takes just a couple of characters--and really only one primary character--and isolates them far away from everybody and everything. It's an extremely introspective and ruminative novel which sets it apart from many of his others which suffer from what I always think of as the 'cast of thousands' issue. Some of his other novels seem to depend upon a big, big supporting cast of folks to prop up the main story and there's a certain sameness which obtains after a bit. *The Shining* is really just Jack and his demons and that makes it feel very tightly wound up, and I like that.

As far as the Kubrick adaptation is concerned it is common knowledge that King did not care for it very much and he made his displeasure very clear. But the thing about it is that it is not a Stephen King adaptation as much as it is a Stanley Kubrick film, and Kubrick gives his own interpretation of King's novel which is a re-imagining of King's novel and most certainly not any kind of a mirror image.",death_by_chocolate,2021-10-23T14:38:07Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"My advice for watching Kubrick’s *The Shining* for the first time:

- Watch it on the biggest screen possible with a good sound system.

- Accept that it has almost nothing to do with King’s book.

Seriously, besides character names and some basic plot points, the two are completely separate products. King hated Kubrick’s adaptation, which is understandable because the film deviated in almost every way from the book, including character developments and major themes.

That said, the movie is an absolute masterpiece, visually groundbreaking and disturbing and layered. Kubrick was a literal genius (IQ of 200) and operating on a singular creative level. The most famous scenes of the movie are not even in the book. There is a whole subculture of people who do nothing but analyze the movie and come up with thematic conspiracies based on little hints and easter eggs. It’s a trip.

Both book and movie are great for different reasons. If you treat them like separate, unique experiences, you’ll appreciate both for their respective strengths.",ArtlessCalamity,2021-10-23T14:26:17Z,The Shining,COMMENT

What they do with that is actually narratively interesting, and circles back around to give us a meta callback to the ending of the original Shining book, which I found very satisfying. If you dislike the difference between the Shining book and movie, Doctor Sleep the movie actually goes a long way to correcting some of those wrongs and ""fixing"" it a little bit.

qe33qi,"Maybe so, but the movie features only four characters, and as a character study, it’s just awful.

Danny is a stereotypical young boy, with only stereotypical young boy interests, and no actual personality. The book had the sub plot of his imaginary friend that turned out to be named after Danny’s middle name and was an extension of his own psyche dealing with trauma, all of which is internal conflict, and all of which was absent from the movie.

Danny’s mother (whose name I can’t even recall without looking her up) is a shrill, annoying, horse faced woman that contributes literally nothing towards the movie other than victim hood, completely missing the effects that she had towards her husband and son in the book.

Halloran is a caricature of a black man, introducing concepts to the audience that are never expanded upon, and he dies the moment he tries to be anything more to the story than expository lore. In the book, Halloran took on the role of mentor and was extremely useful towards keeping Danny alive against the forces of evil. In the movie, he was entirely worthless towards any of the other characters or the overarching plot.

The worst, however, is Jack. Jack Torrence in the book is a tragic figure. A man torn between a temper he cannot control, an addiction he cannot overcome, and resentment he has yet to actually address. As a character in the book, Jack Torrence is a message to the reader, a sort of “there but for the grace of god go I”. At the end of the story, because of the temptations of the Overlook and it’s malevolent spirit entity, Jack succumbs to his own inner demons and is cast out of his own body, being used as a puppet to slay his own family. Jack in the book was dead long before the Overlook blew up, and throughout the story that ending was alluded to in references to the faulty boiler. In the movie, Jack goes insane for no real explored reason. He’s just an asshole and a psychopath that decides to torment and terrify because he’s **bored**! His death at the end of the story was pointless, as was his murder of Halloran. In the end, nothing was gained, just a spooky ghost story whose elements never add up to anything more than Cabin Fever hallucinations.

It’s not just that the themes are opposite. The movie is inconsistent in its plot, one dimensional with its characters, and shallow in its morals. It was visually striking, and the sound and set designs were excellent, and that’s about as much positive things I have to say about it.

Like I said before, Stanley Kubrick was a brilliant artist. Several of the scenes from The Shining, like several scenes from most of his movies, in particular 2001: A Space Odyssey, are art in motion. But the script is bad, the acting is sub par, and the story is disappointing. Kubrick may have been a great artist, but he was a shitty storyteller.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T15:50:09Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"That’s just my point, though. If The Shining is one of the best examples of a horror movie that is good, that’s a scathing indictment of all the other horror movies, because it is not, objectively, a good movie. It is poorly constructed, poorly written, and poorly acted.

As far as I can tell, the sole reason why The Shining is hailed as a masterpiece of horror movies is because of the (admittedly) fantastic cinematography. That’s it.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T21:20:17Z,The Shining,COMMENT

qe33qi,"I get that. I'd seen the movie many times and always enjoyed it, but when I picked up the book it was an entirely different experience and I understand exactly why it gets flack for the vast departure. That said, I've learned over the years to appreciate adaptations for what they are and enjoy them as different interpretations of source material, and judge them on their own merits. Game of Thrones departed greatly from source material and was still very good, until it went down the shitter, while The Mist took a King novella and turned it into something even better than the original. In the case of The Shining, yeah, the movie only resembles the book in the broadest of strokes, but I can still appreciate it as an alternate take on the story, albeit the inferior one.

Doctor Sleep feels like a double-duty continuation and band-aid for the original film. It sticks to it's own source material *very* closely, while also throwing in some callbacks to the film version that it's acting as a continuation to, and in adapting to accommodate the changes in the original film, it manages to repair some of the damage, so far as it can. What we missed out on in the climax of the original film we get a taste of in Doctor Sleep's, and those that were fans of the book will greatly appreciate how they cap things off, even if it changes the ending drastically. I still prefer the book, but Doctor Sleep the movie just comes across as a sort of apology to fans of the books for all that they got cheated out of, and for that I genuinely loved it.",DomLite,2021-10-23T16:28:40Z,The Shining,COMMENT

But you're right that it's completely different. I just don't think those differences are worse. It's just that it uses the same basic plot to tell an entirely different story with a different point. And it uses things like Halloran's anticlimactic death to tell that story in the way it needs to be told. You don't like that point, or the way that it's told, and that's fine.

It introduces plot elements that are later forgotten or abandoned, it introduces characters that end up not mattering in the way they are set up, it brings up interesting concepts such as the existence of the supernatural and then fails to expound upon them or explore them, and it features characters without any discernible character arc or motivations beyond the surface level.

qe33qi,"You misunderstand the nature of my criticism of the Shining as a movie. I am not criticizing it because of its differences from the book. In fact, I saw the movie before I read the book, and hated it from the first viewing.

The movie is bad on its own merits, which is why it’s popularity has always been baffling to me. It’s poorly written, featuring red herrings, audience based misdirection, and useless additions. It adds elements it does not explain nor fit together, and has a payoff that is unsatisfying in its pointlessness. It follows four characters, three of whom are portrayed by untalented actors, and the fourth of whom is clearly having the time of his life playing an unrepentant, irredeemable jackass that acts like a cartoonish villain in the third act for reasons that are insufficiently explored.

From a narrative perspective, The Shining is simply a bad movie. It’s great from an atmospheric perspective, but a good atmosphere does not a good movie make.

That the book is so good makes me hate the movie more, but even just judged as a stand-alone movie it isn’t good.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T18:55:09Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"I really don’t see how one could claim that the movie for The Shining is deeper than the book. I just flat out fail to see how the claim has any merit. The fact that the book, like most books, allows the reader an insight into the inner workings of the characters minds is just an immediate boost to the depth of said characters. It’s an intrinsic problem to the medium, it’s much more difficult for cinema to give the audience that perspective.

More so, the supernatural elements of the story are core to the book, whereas they are in the movie only for shock value and atmosphere. It’s not deep to have the encounter with the zombie in room 237 without any understanding of who that woman was, why she killed herself, and how the Overlook claimed her soul. It’s not deep to show a man stalk his own son with an axe because he’s gone mad, it is deep to show a demonic presence playing at the insecurities of a family to satisfy its malevolent desire to keep its occupants as permanent prisoners to torture.

I just don’t see the argument from your perspective. You’ve asserted depth without demonstrating any, whereas I think I’ve done a decent job of demonstrating the shallowness of the screenplay. I think the best example of that was the twins. “Come play with us, Danny.” Who were they? Where did they go after that scene? Where did they come from? Why did they want to entrap Danny? All they introduce are questions without answers. That’s not depth, that’s “you know what would be scary?” being pitched for a movie. It’s art, not story.

As for Minority Report, I’ve never read the book, so I don’t have much opinion. I liked the movie just fine, even though it was (intentionally, I presume) misnamed. After all, John Anderton didn’t actually have a minority report. But the story was cohesive, the script was fine. Later events were nicely foreshadowed, and everything that takes place fits within the narrative. You can’t honestly say that about the Shining, where Danny’s visions had no impact on the sequence of events, where Halloran’s supernatural expertise ended ten seconds after he entered the Overlook, and where the ghosts and apparitions appear and disappear as the script demands with nothing in the story actually connecting them together in any real way.

I get that you disagree with my position, but as far I can tell your disagreement is based on feelings, because you’ve raised no valid objections to any particular point, and your own points don’t seem (in my opinion) to hold up to scrutiny.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T18:47:43Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"In fairness, The Shining is infamous for the fact that Stanley Kubrick outright tortured Shelley Duvall during it's production. He made her do dozens and dozens of takes back to back while screaming at her and not allowing her to rest or take a break. He had a vision of Wendy that was very different from the book version and pushed to ensure it got captured on film. Shelley Duvall herself was a very accomplished and capable actress, so any appearance of her being annoying isn't due to Duvall herself, but rather what Kubrick wanted to portray.

Regardless, even if she was retooled specifically to be annoying in the film version compared to her quiet yet determined nature in the book, that only reinforces the fact that Kubrick pushed for Jack to basically hate his family from the jump, rather than being a good guy with a dark past who is making a monumental effort to be better because he loves them so much. Movie Jack shows no such inclination, and one could easily imagine that in a different set of circumstances, he might have finished his book, got published and instantly dumped Wendy and Danny on a curb somewhere to go do a few lines off of hookers ass because he cared so little for them.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:06:53Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"And that's fair game too. We all have personal tastes. I agree that the film feels a little bare bones, but Kubrick is kind of prone to those type of screenplays, where he leaves a lot to the imagination, leaving the impression of turning to the camera as the credits roll and asking ""So what do *you* think happened?"" I can enjoy films that leave some things unexplained and up to the audience to fill in the blanks, because it can lead to some phenomenal debate over the story, philosophy, logic and any number of other subjects brought up by the material. I think that's exactly what he was aiming for with The Shining. The book tells things in a rather concrete manner, while Kubrick took the concept and just decided to make all of the happenings supernatural and mysterious with no explanation, so as to make it more scary via the unknown nature of it. We know Freddy Kreuger gets you in your dreams, and Candyman can only get you if you say his name three times in the mirror, but The Shining basically throws in the idea of psychic people and the impressions left behind by evil then leads you to ask if that bartender Jack talks to is a psychic impression he can see because he shines and doesn't realize it, an actual ghost, or the devil himself taking Jacks soul in exchange for a drink, leading to his absolute loss of sanity and descent into murderous rage. Or maybe it's all just visual symbolism and none of it actually happened. If it's just psychic impressions and not actual ghosts then why does Wendy see the torrent of blood from the elevators, and the Dog Man? She's not implied to shine even in the slightest in the books. Maybe she's just hallucinating?

I know it all sounds a little pretentious and film snobby, but I kind of get the angle he was going for. He took a story outline and turned it into a film that was scary on the surface but prompted debate on the nature of evil itself, as well as the nature of the evil within the film. The spareness of it all is intentional so as to make the nebulous evil of the Overlook more menacing. Vampires are burned by the sun and holy water. Werewolves die to a silver bullet. A nameless, formless evil that seems to inhabit a place and corrupt those under its influence while trying to feed on those most sensitive to it is a much scarier thing to come up against. You can fight a monster. An evil place that has no heart to stake or head to cut off and constantly tries to get its proverbial claws into you and make you a part of it is a lot more unsettling, and by leaving so much up to debate, Kubrick portrayed it as something sort of unknowable and powerful, and the fact that the only thing Wendy and Danny could do to survive was to simply run and never look back without ever truly defeating it was an intentional choice I feel.

Of course, this is all just my personal take on things, and it's also perfectly valid to just... not like something. I've seen plenty of highly acclaimed films and thought they were hot garbage, and even I acknowledge that The Shining isn't a perfect film by any means. I just appreciate what the approach was and the way it tries to portray evil by... not really portraying it at all. It just *is* and the only thing you can do is run away and hope you live to see the dawn.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:32:45Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"For what it's worth, I completely agree with every point you've made. I don't think Kubrick made a decent film post-*2001* except for *Eyes Wide Shut*, which is a masterpiece. He was a cold and controlling person and this overwhelms all of his work—his utter misreading of *The Shining* (if you don't subscribe to the opinion that he simply bought the rights to strip-mine the book for cool ideas and images to film) shows how completely he failed to understand and present actual human emotions.",HugoNebula,2021-10-24T10:55:08Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"I also fully agree the movie was way deeper than the book. Stephen king wrote a story about a haunted hotel. Kubrick was not trying to directly adapt the Shining, but rather use it as a vehicle to explore themes of generational trauma, the atrocities committed by humanity over the decades, genocide and familial abuse. I'm not saying that the book didn't explore those things as well, but it was much less abstract and thought provoking than Kubrick's movie because it wasn't exploring the human condition the way Kubrick was. I feel like you're looking at the movie through the lens of the book and trying to make sense of the movie through that book which I believe is the wrong way of looking at it. Kubrick had no intention of directly adapting the novel and included several specific details to show the audience that that is what he was doing. I think you have to look at the movie and book as two completely different entities that can be valued separately for different reasons. Personally the movie is one of my favorites of all time because of how incredibly well Kubrick uses elements of the book stripped of their original intent to create not only a new story, but as well create allegories and explore themes of historical atrocities that continue over time, way beyond the surface level events of just what happened at the overlook. I think what you are mistaking as shallowness is just trying to view the movie through the lens of the book which is just never going to work. The movie is actually like, super notorious for the amount of deeper meaning that was layered into it and as far as what I understand the book does not inspire even close to the same kind of analysis that the movie does. The book attempted to be more of a character study, the movie never attempted to be that even for a second because that's not the story Kubrick was trying to tell.",TDS_patient_no7767,2021-10-23T20:20:54Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"I don't really want to get into an argument about the Shining because while it's one of my favorite movies, I don't have it on top of my head and it has been a few years since I've seen it.

 Appeals to popularity don't invalidate the argument. You saying that the Shining is objectively bad is counteracted by people who study the movie and say it's objectively good. Perhaps different people look at different things and attribute different value to the same thing. Maybe what you think makes a movie bad is something I do not care about and what you think makes a book good is something that I don't care about. 

Despite not knowing the movie by heart, I'll try to address your points.

The Shining being irrelevant to the movie? Don't think this matters at all, it adds to the mysticism of the universe and lends strength to the supernatural elements of the movie.

 
Danny being superfluous to the story? Couldn't care less, he's a small child dealing with things he doesn't understand and has little control over.

The supernatural elements are scary for the sake of scary? Do not agree at all. When Wendy sees the dog giving a blowjob to the waiter, that is not being scary for the sake of being scary. Narrative explanation doesn't have to be explicit to exist and also does not need to exist at all.

Halloran being a red herring is another thing I don't think matters. It emphasizes the point that it's Wendy and Danny alone that must deal with the monster that is pursuing them.


Have you seen The Shining mini-series directed by Stephen King? Do you think it was better than the movie? The movie being much more open ended and leaving things to be explained make for much more memorable and valuable media, in my opinion.",,2021-10-23T21:46:32Z,The Shining,COMMENT

qe33qi,"I’m really confused by this argument. You’re like the fifth person to argue that I’m looking at the movie from the perspective of the book. I can assure you, I am not.

Firstly, I saw the movie before reading the book, and I hated it from the first viewing because the cinematic narrative flaws were apparent to me even then.

The Shining itself is entirely irrelevant to the plot of the movie, nor are the ghosts and various supernatural apparitions ever tied to hallucinations or otherwise made to be an exploration of the human condition. That’s why this argument doesn’t hold up. The movie was loaded with scary things there for the sake of being scary, and that detracts from any potential message about the exploration of generational trauma.

This reeks of post hoc rationalization, where rather than judging the content by its own merits, you are judging the content based on the messages **you** have applied to it.

That’s about as far from objective as you can get. I am criticizing the movie for as close to objective reasons as I can manage.

For example, the character of Halloran is, cinematically, a red herring. He is introduced to the audience as another person with the special quality as Danny. Never in the movie is the nature of the Shining explored, it is intentionally kept vague. Through The Shining, Danny is able to receive visions, though these visions fail to change anything about the sequence of events, nor do they explore Danny or his father as individuals. Narratively, they are white noise. Danny is then able to use The Shining to call for help from Halloran in the third act. Halloran comes to the call, demonstrating that there is some truth to the usefulness of the phenomenon. Only this is untrue, as Halloran gets slaughtered ten seconds after entering the hotel. Had the scenes with Danny calling and Halloran answering been cut from the movie, the plot would have been unchanged. That Danny and his mother stole the dead man’s snow speeder to escape is almost irrelevant given that happened in the last seconds of the film and their escape was still ambiguous (prior to the release of Doctor Sleep, anyway).

Cinematically, the movie is poorly constructed. The ideas are muddled and the themes unclear. The idea you can honestly argue that the movie wasn’t about a haunted hotel given the presence of literal ghosts is a little silly. Kubrick just didn’t commit to the supernatural elements and used them purely for atmosphere. Which is bad filmmaking.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T21:34:19Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"I mean, I loved the ending of the novel immensely with Danny unleashing the ghosts on everyone and siccing Abra's grandmother in particular on Rose. That was powerful. The Hotel needn't be involved for it to be impactful that Danny finds some measure of closure for his personal (and very real) demons while also paving a path forward to a better life for himself at the place where all of those demons were born.

That said, I give full marks to the film for taking the original ending of The Shining and recasting Danny as the tragic figure who is subsumed by the evil of the Overlook and forced to chase down someone he loves and wants desperately not to hurt before the place goes up in a boiler explosion, exactly like it did in the original. It's a much darker ending, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but both have some great merit on their own. The movie gives it a darker bent, as well as adapting one of the best parts of the original book that got gutted in terms of impact in the original film, while the book tells a tale of a man who's had a rough go of life from the very beginning returning to the place where all his troubles began and *literally* vanquishing his demons so he can move towards a brighter tomorrow. The film version rights a wrong from the original adaptation and delivers some feelings and concepts that should have been in the original, while the book provides a triumphant showdown against evil.

I enjoy both, though for different reasons, and I quite enjoy having two different takes on the same story. I still think one is better than the other, but that doesn't make either of them ""bad"", just different.",DomLite,2021-10-23T19:17:07Z,The Shining,COMMENT
qe33qi,"I’ve admitted on multiple occasions myself that the cinematography and set/sound design for the movie are incredible. I’m not denying that. The entire draw point of the movie over the book is the phenomenal atmosphere Kubrick managers to cultivate.

But it’s poorly written and constructed. That you appeal to how the movie made you feel rather than how it was put together, as well as the fact that you characterize the book’s ending as poor, honestly just tells me you don’t have any appreciation for narrative structure.

And that’s totally fine.

But the problem is when you’re arguing against objective evaluation with an attitude of not caring about objective evaluation. If you don’t care about the things a movie does right and wrong, and you only care about how it makes you feel, then such discussions are entirely pointless. We’re just speaking past each other.

So I’m glad you enjoy the movie, but I insist that there is a meaningful difference between something being enjoyable, and something being well made.

Kubrick was a wonderful artist, and The Shining has several moments that are art in motion. But the story is awful, and the script is poor, and I honestly don’t understand perspectives like yours that choose to dismiss all of that.",I_are_Lebo,2021-10-23T22:12:28Z,The Shining,COMMENT

They cannot be dismissed, they are present in the entire movie and take up center stage in many of the movie's points. You mention the phenomenal atmosphere, and the phenomenal atmosphere was precisely what Kubrick was trying to create and what the majority of people resonate with. In the same way that you say I'm dismissing your objective criticisms, I can also say that you're dismissing the things that make the movie great.

Other things that are good.

Jack Nicolson is incredible. The feeling of isolation is incredible. The portrayal of domestic abuse is incredible. And honestly, seeing the majority of the movie from Jack's perspective makes it much more powerful as well. I do not see Danny as being the main character in the Shining, it is all about Jack. 

I can't speak of the script because, again, I don't have the book on the top of my head, but I find the movie's story to be way more compelling than the book's, I couldn't take it seriously. The changes to the story are a big improvement, in my eyes.



The things you say are badly made, for me, were not badly made at all, but even if they were, they are completely irrelevant to the quality of the movie. King's writing is very simplistic.

The movies honestly so different I feel its better as it's own thing. Reading the shining for the first time (and not having seen the movie except the iconic scenes) I kept expecting to see the elevator blood scene or the little girls calling to Danny and none of that exists in the book.

j1a18t,"This is how I felt when I read The Shining. It isn't my favorite King book, but I totally sympathize with him feeling like the movie erased all of Jack's merits and took away a lot of Wendy's agency. 

I think King hates it so much because of that, and that book is also very very personal to him. To see the characters and story portrayed as they were made audiences think that that was the story he had written, and it wasn't. I don't think that adaptations need to be symmetric to their source texts, and The Shining is an excellent piece of art in its own right. 

The main problem I have with the movie is that Stanley Kubrick is a bad person on a human level. The psychological abuse of the cast and crew, particularly Shelley Duvall, is what makes it hard for me to love that movie. I don't care how good his film making was, Kubrick was a major prick and I think that's another reason that King hated it so much. It was a dishonest portrayal of the characters he wrote (regardless of how good their reinvention was) and the environment of the production itself was hostile as hell. 

I totally understand your emotions (and King's) on this, but unfortunately I have to admit that the film was still an excellent piece of cinema. Fuck Kubrick though",lunaappaloosa,2020-09-28T15:12:41Z,The Shining,COMMENT
j1a18t,"I'm know that I'm biased; the movie is one of my favorites. And -is- my favorite horror movie, hands down. So, grain of salt.

But i do think it's unfair to call Kubrick's The Shining a generic haunted house movie. The slow burn of the tension, the amazing practical effects, the feeling of being off-kilter for the whole film. Even the subtext, which may or may not have been included,  and what Kubrick may or may not have meant by it, is interesting. 

I do agree that the movie does not reflect the book well. But then, it's hard to translate such a book into a visual medium and not lose something. And we know this, because we have proof. In 1997, Stephen King  wrote and produced a TV mini series based on his own novel. He was involved in pretty much every aspect of the series, and so gave us his version of The Shining as a visual media product.

And it's dull. 

It's not awful. The character development is much better. The woman that plays Wendy is ages better than Shelley Duvall (who, in my opinion,  is the weakest part of Kubrick's version). But it remains drawn out and slightly boring.

And look at Dr. Sleep. It was a decent enough novel, but the movie, i thought, was messy and saccharine. 

Kubrick was notorious for cutting up source material to fit his own ends. Just look at the controversy surrounding A Clockwork Orange. But I don't think that diminishes the merits of his version of the Shining. I like to think his movie is a distillation of King's novel, and goes a long way to doing what King himself recommends when storytelling: show me, don't tell me.",KinshuKiba,2020-09-28T12:20:54Z,The Shining,COMMENT

j1a18t,"I completely understand. I read The Shining for the first time when I was 13 and immediately fell in love. For years that was my number one favorite book, and to this day remains in my top five. So when I finally rented the VHS to witness the controversial masterpiece that is Kubrick's The Shining, I was mad! I could not accept the crude handling of Wendy as a shrieking helpless pixie. The maze wasn't interesting to me. And I didn't care about Jack's thousand yard stare. But I think that the Danny and ghost interactions where what upset me the most. To me they were bland and of little importance while in the book it was so much more. 

I didn't rewatch Kubrick's Shining for another 15 years, but I reread the book countless times. I am better able to appreciate Kubrick's work as a stand alone entity loosely influenced by King's book now as an adult. I can see the art that is that piece of cinema. I like its impact on pop culture overall, the twin girls is always a great meme, but no it isn't as good as the book when it comes to telling a frightening story of madness, ghosts, survival, and a strange little boy.",Treadingresin,2020-09-28T13:29:53Z,The Shining,COMMENT

j1a18t,"I think your first sentence is way off the mark to begin with. Stephen King's movie adaptations have almost universally been critically acclaimed.

I think it is a big stretch to say he has a ""long history of poor adaptations"". In fact, regarding film adaptations of famous books, I would say that King probably has the best record of any author whos books have adaptions at all.

That being said, yes, the Shining film does leave a lot of internal monologuing out of the narration. You don't quite get the same sympathy for Jack in the film as he appears in the book.

The book is so on-the-nose in its addiction allegory that it took me a level or two out of the action. It did not consume me like the film does when I watch it. The film is full of mystery in a way the book is not.  

Perhaps the book resonates more with those who have struggled with addiction. But for me, it was a little too obvious and not my favorite of King's.

Kubrick obscures the addiction theme and instead focuses on madness and isolation.",mthrndr,2020-09-28T12:35:51Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I watched The Shining before ever reading the book, and despite loving horror movies it did so much nothing for me that I put off reading the book for years even after discovering my love of King.

I was hoping Flanagan would retcon it a little at the end of Doctor Sleep, but I guess he was under too much pressure given how many people primarily knew (and again - liked!) the original story from Kubrick's film. I understand why King hates Kubrick's version - while there have definitely been other adaptations that have been bad or at least badly received, I can't imagine any of them have so completely and aggressively *missed the entire point of the story* the way the film version of The Shining does.",jcpianiste,2020-09-28T13:09:39Z,The Shining,COMMENT
j1a18t,"Your opinion, while valid, represents a misunderstanding of the difference between artistic mediums and the purpose of adaptation, and I'd like to respectfully offer a counterpoint. 

First, your reading of King's *Shining* is sound. King's been on top of his genre for decades, and upon reading something as seminal as *The Shining*, there should be no question as to why. King is a masterful storyteller, when given the room to explore themes and craft characters, and with *The Shining* clocking in between 400 and 500 pages (depending on your edition), he undoubtedly had the time and space to craft an intricate and moving story. 

However, great books rarely make for great films when adapted at face value. Look at the works of Jules Verne, Mary Shelley, and J.R.R. Tolkien, or more recently, Madeleine L'Engle, Eoin Colfer, or Lois Lowry. While the relative greatness of these books can be debated, it is fairly universally accepted that adaptations thereof have ranged from disappointing to abhorrent. This is due to the inherent differences in the two media. Both are narrative, but literature has the benefit of much slower consumption and digestion, while film has to use an entire audiovisual arsenal to get its concepts across in realtime over the course of a few hours. 

That brings us to the matter of adaptation as a whole. While some near 1:1 adaptations have been attempted in the past, and to some success (the *Lord of the Rings* and a few of the *Harry Potter* films come to mind as immediate examples of close adherence to a text), these are typically exceptions to the rule, and films that get more liberal with their source material often have a better chance of survival. Point in case - and probably the most extreme example of rampant success beyond an original text - *Forrest Gump*. A fair amount of viewers have no idea it's an adaptation, and those that are familiar with the source text strongly abide by the creative decisions made by Roth and Zemeckis, citing its runaway success. 

And finally, to deem Kubrick's *Shining* a generic horror movie is outright false. Perhaps you're referring to the film's similarities to a number of contemporary (and shallower) imitators, to which I'd like to point out that, as far as ""generic"" horror movies go, Kubrick provided the prototype rather than following the design. Every one of Kubrick's films represent wild innovation. From the ambiguity of the film's conclusion, to the impeccable attention to mise en scene, to the brutal treatment of the cast during filming, he pushed the envelope to the point of bursting. The narrative spin towards cyclical violence and predestination allowed Kubrick to tell a largely similar story to King's novel without an overreliance on it. There are significant departures from King's writings, especially in regards to lost themes, but all of these are for the express purpose of delivering a Kubrick film over a King adaptation. 

In short, King was perfectly within his rights to dismiss Kubrick's film as a visualization of his novel - and a phenomenal novel it is - but as an adaptation, and as a prototype for modern horror, *The Shining* is nearly unparalleled. It sits atop dozens of ""greatest horror film"" lists, largely because of Kubrick's ruthless innovation.",darkbloo64,2020-09-28T14:35:42Z,The Shining,COMMENT

The very end of the film grabs us and up to the last screen we're filled with terror. It never ends, even the credits are creepy.

I can also see King being upset because Jack is obviously an avatar for himself. To see what Kubrick did with the character, to the point where it's Kubrick's version of Jack that is analyzed by pop culture influencers. I've seen different views of what Kubrick's Shining means, but it seems like the novel gave us a straight forward horror story.

Now again, that may be because of the medium, the end of a story on page pulls different emotions than the final screen in a movie. 

There was a video I watched where during Scatman's return to the hotel we see a red VW bug in a car accident on the side of the road, the car that Jack drove in the novel.

But yes, Kubrick scrambled the story completely and just made it a phycological horror with good cinematics but otherwise terrible acting (besides Jack) and lackluster deflated plot. There wasn't any emotion in the movie dispute Jack trying really hard, but he was given a bad script. 

Doctor Sleep paid perfect homage to the books and even the Kubrick movie which I can appreciate. It also gave the duology the ending it should have had instead of what the shining did.",wdvisalli,2020-09-28T22:10:20Z,The Shining,COMMENT

It just seems like random events that escalate at the end and your left with no reason why any of it happened.

They’re both entities in and of their selves and should probably be treated as separate stories. For me when I saw The Shining first then read it much later, I felt just what you’re talking about when you said the film lost flavor. The thing is a lot of the flavor in the book is from an over abundance of detail in a really good way. Very descriptive tangents give Jack and everyone else a lot more robust traits and ideals.

I’m no Jack Nicholson fan anyway, but his contempt for his wife and his son’s feelings was so upsetting for me. At the end *spoiler alert I was just happy he froze to death. I think it was triggering for me as I myself grew up in a home with an emotionally abusive (step)father, a somewhat loving but not always completely helpful mother, and a beautiful house that did not feel welcoming. I actually had to decompress for a while and just be left alone to process my feelings.

The miniseries is boring as sin, because it tries to adapt the book exactly. Kubrick had 2 hours and 30 minutes to adapt a 447 page book. You can’t accurately portray Jack’s descent into madness in that time, so he changed the story from a descent into madness into the Overlook stripping away the thin veneer of sanity he was wearing, which can fit in that time.",AcediaRex,2020-09-28T16:54:05Z,The Shining,COMMENT
j1a18t,"I have not read a lot of King, *The Shining* is the only one I read in recent times, but I really didn't love what I saw there. I thought the book is overlong and meandering, each one of its points drags and drags and it's constantly repeated. There's almost nothing left there to be inferred from the text because everything is very clearly spelled out. 

Also the notion of the hotel having a ""small"" problem with a boiler that causes it to *literally go up in flames* was a bit much - and the ending, with the hero jumping into a burning building to save the victims felt very cliched.

I don't know, I didn't *love* the book, but maybe that's because I came from a preconveived notion of loving the movie and having watched it first. It's really hard to be objective with this things when you get to it already prejudiced.

I'm of the opinion that Kubrick really salvaged the story by making it into a fable about domestic abuse. It's quite unfair to call it a ""generic"" horror movie when it's hardly a horror movie at all. 

Not about a father that *deep down* is a good guy but gets turned evil by external forces (and so can be ultimately forgiven) but an irredemable prick. In the movie, the setting of the hotel only brings out Jack's limitations and frustrations, but they were all already there from the start - hence the fact that he never actually wrote a word of his play. 

Ultimately I prefer the movie because it really doesn't allow for any ""buts"". Jack wasn't a good guy *but* for his drinking and demonic possession, he was always an abuser and his wife was always an enabler, which is a lot closer to what happens in real life. And, of course, there's no magical hero who jumps in and save the day; instead, he gets the axe.",DoctorWhoSeason24,2020-09-28T17:06:34Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I'm a fan of both King and Kubrick but he was the absolute worst choice to make a King Movie. I hated The Shining movie (to spite giving it a few tries)... it has always bored me to death.

King's books need a mini-series to even come close to doing them justice. We saw this with The Stand. Under the Dome had potential but it lost steam halfway through (in all fairness it was a weak story to begin with).

The best Stephen King books/stories (IMO) are Apt Pupil and Needful Things. Needful Things would have made an awesome mini-series (with the right director). Apt Pupil just needed the right people writing and directing it.",StevenArviv,2020-09-28T18:30:50Z,The Shining,COMMENT

j1a18t,"I would hardly call it ""generic"". If The Shining was a generic horror movie then you would have some guy running around with a hockey mask and a machete killing teens that are having sex in abandoned campsites. Its fair to criticize it *as an adaptation,* sure, but a bad adaptation does not a bad movie make. The fact that you liked it the first time through and then only changed your mind after reading the book is evidence of that. 

Now I haven't read the book, but it does bother me a bit when people complain about movies not faithfully following the source material 100%. Books are almost always more dense content wise than movies are by the very nature of the medium itself. Few books are capable of fitting their entire plotline into the narrow space of a two-hour film. Movies have to cut things, its just the way it is. Now that doesn't mean its impossible to make bad decisions about what content to cut and how things are presented, but I do think we should strive to judge adaptations on their own merit as completely separate entities, because that's exactly what they are. You have to view them as a non-cannon or alternate universe version of the original. 

Personally, I think a perfect recreation of a book into a movie would be boring, anyway. What would be the point if they're identical? New interpretations of the same thing are fun.",BloomingBrains,2020-09-28T22:54:25Z,The Shining,COMMENT
j1a18t,"I had similar thoughts when I first finished reading the book, but after re watching the movie I now think differently, what made me love many of King’s books is very difficult to replicate on screen, his books are often very slow burn and there are a lot of inner monologues, which is hard to do in a 2 hour movie. I’d say The Shining is so far my favourite movie adaptation of his books, because it tried to capture the feeling and atmosphere instead of blindly following the plots, which to me is never really the essence of King’s stories. 
I agree with you in that what I loved most about the book is missing in the movie, but the movie is great on its own in a very different way nonetheless.",A-cake-crusader,2020-09-28T22:58:07Z,The Shining,COMMENT
j1a18t,"I think it’s a bit unfair to call ‘The Shining’ a generic horror movie. It shaped the genre as we know it today, and helped bring more respect to an often overlooked genre of movies. 

I do however agree with your sentiment on how Stephen King viewed the adaptation of his book. Too often, despite how good a genre-defining movie may be, we tend to dismiss the thoughts of the author of the source material. There parts of the novel that make it clear how personal this book is to King. He adapted his most raw and real experiences with drinking, into a character version of those worst moments, when he no longer felt like a person, but something else entirely. 

An author is not required to like to the film version of their work, especially when it means that much to them and strays so far from the original text. But to deny the beauty and atmosphere of Kubrick’s work, and baselessly insult his vision, is crude and off point. Kubrick adapted what he saw in the book. A man already broken in his own right, slowly teetering towards the brink of full blown destruction. There is a reason the movie is so beloved, you don’t have to insult the fans to make your point.",tiddymiddy,2020-09-28T22:59:57Z,The Shining,COMMENT

Both did a great job of creating an atmosphere of dread and the slow-burn into chaotic horror, but the warmth in the novel is a great contrast that made the final scenes more impactful.

j1a18t,"I've recently watched The Shining (Kubrick)
a few times and have taken a different opinion on it ans forgive me but this is just my opinion of an adaptation Kubrick did on it.

I think starting with the point of when Jack first drinks and meets ""Lloyd"". I'm quite sure Lloyd existed back home wherever and was his bartender, as Jack has the conversation with himself and gets drunk I really think the story in it's entirety to begin with is Jack struggling with his own demons. He loses his sanity, alone (with his family there). He's told of the story of what happened in the hotel and it plants a sort of seed in his brain and festers and grows which explains the dream. Albeit the house is haunted and left dark energies behind all of Jacks demons get him throughout the movie and grow. Yes there's spirits there and the little boy senses them with his gift but I believe the party and caretaker is Jack in his own mind battling demons and they get the better of him.

j1a18t,"They tell a different story really. I'm much more knowledgable about the moves, King's version, if i'm not mistaken, is about alcoholism. Whereas Kubrik's version is about the inescapable and cyclical horror of humanity, in particular genocide. The people of the movie are reflections on society. The one who sees the truth but cannot comprehend. The one who comprehends the truth but refuses to see the significance. The one who tries to help and is killed for it. The one who has with full knowledge of the problem. The one who succumbs to the evil. From the very begining the signs are there that something is very wrong with that place (the impossible architecture, moving furniture, advertisements for activities not offered).  everyone chooses to ignore it. We know that Jack is not the first to commit atrocities in that hotel but almost nobody remembers. >!In the end, jack is shown as having been at the hotel since it's early days, but no one remembers.!< Like genocide, it's always been around, but humanity keeps forgetting about it, finding themselves in complete astonishment that their beloved humanity could treat them like that - could try and kill them.

j1a18t,"Well yeah, cause Kubrick was trying to use The Shining to describe his activity working on a fake moon landing video that was to be played if the Apollo 11 crew had died during mid way orbit or during decent. It didn't matter if the crew made it back, just that the US said they made it to the moon. It's probably Kubrick's best work that no one got to see, but yet, no moral person would want that footage to have to be used, right? The moral quandaries of watching and waiting as the A11 mission was occurring probably drove him insane - were they going to use his footage? He'd know instantly if they did. If they did use the footage, was the crew dead? But then it comes over the air waves - A11 works. A sigh of relief comes over Kubrick as they'll be no 'theatrical play'. That peak excitement now leads to Kubrick feeling dull. He's become nothing; a spook; some specter that can never talk about it. Kubrick had lived with keeping secrets before after filming nukes in Nevada(you know that really picturesque footage of troops rising out of the trenches) for the Army, but people still saw that footage. Every High School kid in America has seen that footage; it's what the US Army uses to drum up fascist support and get troops in boots. But how could he get people to remember his work that was never shown? By subverting the plot of one well known story in order to subconsciously overlap a hidden message through imagery and sounds. We know Kubrick knows about this kind of hypnosis and mental manipulation because Kubrick depicted its use in A Clockwork Orange, a film he followed nearly 100% to the book, much like almost ALL of Kubricks film's faithfully did. Such a hyper focused man as Kubrick, authenticity was key. That's what is so terrifying about the brainwashing scene in ACO - it's real. That's a real surgeon putting clamps in his eyes. He's actually strapped there, and the screen is showing actual imagery of Ultra Violence. Except here's the thing Kubrick realized - not only had he actually injured the actor while doing so, but that kind of method of mind control just wouldn't work. He needed something far more subtle. Remember, he's just trying to get people to remember something that was never seen, not slice off everyone retina. And this is when it hits him - people want to see a film that is almost word for word adaptation of a book/play/etc. When it is NOT, the human brain subconsciously picks out every single flaw and says ""this shouldn't be here"". To most humans, they write this off to 'artistic' interpretations, however, Kubrick is not the kind of person to just subvert the authenticity. That's cause he didn't give two licks about some coked out writer; he was going to tell his own story for once. Things like the twin sisters(reference to those lost during the Gemini), changing of the rooms from 217 to 237(rough distance to the moon in Km), ""A11 work(s) and no (theatrical) play makes Jack a dull boy"", and the continuous attack on the rocket ships that are disguised as Native America imagery(which was designed specifically for the movie with zero input from natives) never occurred in the book.

I think Kubrick's version could have redeemed itself to King by including one simple moment.>! At the end of the book, Jack has Danny trapped in a hallway. He approaches menacingly for the kill. The real Jack manages to fight his way to the surface long enough to tell Danny to run and delay his possessed self and give Danny a chance to get away. !<Including that moment would have significantly altered the tone of the ending, making it much more like King's version.

While I can see your point about the movie—and you are certainly entitled to your opinion—what that movie did for horror and the art of filmmaking is not to be belittled. The music is haunting, the cinematography is thoroughly unsettling (the way Kubrick angles all the cameras low so as to make the Overlook look massive), and Jack Nicholson’s performance (that bar scene with Loyd being one continuous take).

Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut, and basically every other one were adaptations of books. Nobody ever complains about any of those because they weren’t by a massively successful author. Kubrick’s unfaithfulness to the source material in The Shining is something that I can see upsetting the author and fans of the book, but that was his MO at that point. 

The book was inspiration and in the same way that one killer inspired both Psycho and Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Does the book deserve a faithful adaptation? Sure. But Kubrick is largely considered the greatest American filmmaker there ever was and he gets to treat Stephen King’s book how he wants.

j1a18t,"I’m in the same boat. The Shining as a film is a tense experience and completely different, but still a great watch for the disturbing imagery, music, atmosphere and the fantastic performances. I read the book a few years ago and it just evoked a while different set of feelings. Jack was a good man, all the way to the end, Wendy was a stronger character and Danny was a clever kid who was wise beyond his years. The hotel felt more evil and honestly the whole thing made me afraid to leave my room at night for a few days. It was powerful. Doctor Sleep evoked a different kind of dread, but also horrified me in other terrible ways, with the True Knot being some of the most evil monsters I had ever read about, and yet somehow making them into people too, which drew conflicting emotions. I think the film actually did a great job adapting the book more faithfully with the ending altered to pair with the film of The Shining while also paying homage to the original book. It was heart-breaking but I kind of enjoyed the tragic ending for the films versus the books. They’re two alternate takes on the story and I can appreciate them both, though the books will always win out in the end.

I’ve learned to be more open-minded about adaptations after the Silent Hill movie. I adore the video game series and know all the lore and creepy shit behind it, so when the movie went off-the-rails with characters, beings that didn’t belong and the general flow of the story, I was a little off-put, but in the end I just looked at it as an alternate take on the story and was happy to enjoy it for what it was. Yeah, there are bad adaptations and those deserve to be criticized, but there are also adaptations that simply draw inspiration from the source material and tell a different version of the story. Sometimes they’re great and can enrich the overall experience, and sometimes they flop hard. You just have to give it a fair shake and make your own decisions about what you like and don’t, but in this one case I truly believe that both versions of The Shining and Doctor Sleep deserve praise, if not exactly equal merit.",DomLite,2020-09-28T19:53:10Z,The Shining,COMMENT

The movie excels with giving you that feeling of dread, as well as the  very creepy atmosphere and of course the acting which make this film a classic. With that being said, I can see why King was upset with how it was adapted. I almost don’t even think of them as the same story.

I think this is the key thing to appreciate about adaptations. Kubrick was a hell of a director, and he fundamentally understood how to create a powerful cinematic experience. He keenly understood the medium.

King is a master of his medium. The unfortunate part, is that the two mediums have entirely different pressures and methods of telling stories. They correlate to a degree, but they only seem to overlap in broad strokes.

You can get away with 800 pages of setup, only to resolve the whole novel in 200. In a film, you have three acts to work with, and your setup needs to be done after the first or you lose your audience.

It really is apples and oranges. When you compare character building, motivation, and story arcs though, you can really make clear comparisons. The real difficulty is when you rigidly cling to aspects that work in one medium and fully expect them to work in another without taking away from all of the other aspects that make the film work as is.

And let's not forget the trainwreck that was Maximum Overdrive. King couldn't even do a good film adaptation of his own work, so it really shows that it's a completely different skillset. No one ever let him direct again after 1986.",,2020-09-28T22:11:35Z,The Shining,COMMENT

It's just a different medium, trying for very different things. I totally understand why King dislikes it, it tramples all over his original vision, and throws it in the trash. But if the goal of an adaptation is to be faithful, what's the point? A direct translation to a new medium will always be worse than the medium it's intended for. 

If your summation of the film is strictly about plot beats (characterization, motivations, etc), well then, that's not really the heart of the movie? Film is a visual medium. If you evaluate any movie on the terms of a ""summary and bullet point presentation"", then that's entirely missing the point. 

Doesn't mean you have to like the movie. It's a pretty alienating watch, on many levels (pacing, acting, unresolved loose ends, intentional ambiguity, etc). But if your reaction is purely ""the book painted the family as loving, and the movie is dark and cold, so it sucks"", that's pretty shallow? It's perfectly fine to use that to articulate why you prefer one to the other (we all have our own tastes), but I'd at least keep an open mind as to why the film is still discussed decades later, and is very well regarded by many critics. My university recently did a fancy restored 35mm print showing of it, with a lecture before, and a packed house. I wouldn't just leap to the conclusion that those professors missed the part where Jack was supposed to be a loving father, and be dismissive of the reasons people might be packing the room decades later.

I've never read the book, but I've seen both movies and I think the remake captures your quote much better than the Kubrick version. The dude from Wings who plays the main character really comes across as loving his family and that there's ""something other"" which is compelling him to act as he does.",ToiletPhoneHome,2020-09-28T12:33:43Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I feel like Kubricks version is much like 2001 a space odyssey (which he also made) as in every viewer walks away with a different interpretation, and i think OP is not doing it justice by only giving the film a surface level reading.

j1a18t,"I'm not surprised because any character Jack Nicholson plays is going to go from 1 to 100 at the drop of a hat and come across as pretty crazy or over the top at least.  I'm sure that Kubrick intended to change Jack's characterization from the beginning or he would have cast someone else.

The Shining is the only Kubrick movie that I can enjoy watching, and that's only if I see it as a story that happens in an alternate world from the book - or a different level of the Dark Tower, since we're referring to King.  It's a great story about a man on the edge who succumbs to insanity in a creepy, isolated hotel and who's insanity infects his family in different ways - to the point where it could be argued that everything Danny sees was influenced by his father's madness.

The book is about a fractured family who still love each other, but who are isolated in an evil, haunted hotel that uses the fractures against them in order to steal the psychic abilities of the little boy by first terrorizing him and then manipulating his father into killing him.  

Of the two plots I prefer the haunted evil hotel over the human insanity.  I hear about so much human evil in the world that it is unsurprising to find it in movies too, even when paired with possible supernatural events - but the idea of a hunted hotel with an evil agenda to devour the soul of an innocent child is terrifying! 

I will admit to loving most of King's concepts because he takes the usual horror tropes and twists them into the realm of the unexplainable ""what if"" that has no logical explanation.  I see where it leads to unsatisfactory endings in some of his books - but then again, I can't see any real-world fight against the supernatural having a satisfying or even clear-cut ending.",kayjee17,2020-09-29T02:02:36Z,The Shining,COMMENT

j1a18t,"I think you really hit the nail with this explanation. I feel many viewers don't recognize there's also a difference between a writer/director making a film ""adaptation"" and a film ""interpretation"" of a book (though, marketing any/every book-based film as an ""adaptation"" doesnt really help). LotR and Harry Potter films are good examples of adaptation since the goal was to visually project the author's ""mind's eye"". The Shining, on the other hand, is a good example of an interpretation because the goal wasnt to visualize Steven King's vision, but Kubric's re-imagining of the story. 

You can draw good parallels to things that happen in the music industry all the time, though I feel there's generally less of a negative visceral reaction in deviating from the source material. One example would be to compare Disturbed's cover (read: adaptation) of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" with Johnny Cash's interpretation of Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"". In both instances, the lyrics and the general music share significant commonality with their respective sources, but in terms of audience perception and artistic license, the gap is much wider between NIN's ""Hurt"" and Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"" than Disturbed and S&G's ""Sound of Silence"". 
(Disturbed did a version of Sound of Silence vs Cash making a song called Hurt with the same lyrics/base melody as a song called Hurt written by NIN)

Edit: now that I think about it, distinguishing between an adaptation and interpretation isnt really marketing's fault as much as it is us as viewers reading ""based on"", ""inspired by"", and ""re-imagining"" as different phrases saying the same thing.",McCuumhail,2020-09-28T16:33:10Z,The Shining,COMMENT

In terms of the literature world, King is a giant, but the Shining isn't a footnote, whereas the film is widely considered to be one of the more important films in both horror and cinema's history. It's also why it's been the subject of documentaries. 

It's not uncommon to find people who read a book who say just that. I often say it too. I don't think the book is bad, i was merely pointing at why King feels such an animosity towards the film. It's tough pill to swallow when another artists takes your creation, and churns out a version that significantly impacts society in a way your work of art couldn't .

In the end, it's my opinion and feeling, and I don't really see it being that controversial. Google the shining, and see what comes up first. The film, or the book? In my country, the Book isn't even one of the top 10 results.

oy74p9,"The shining definitely changed my perception of horror. It’s not about jump scares but the feeling of uneasiness. 

One of the biggest draws of king is the slow burn of that uneasy feeling. It’s the slow incorporation of slight environment changes over time that build that suspense and anxiety of the unknown, to where it finally boils over.

This is easily the biggest drawback of king books vs films. The shining movie moves too fast compared to the book. Where the books feels minute to minute, the movie can feel hour to hour. How many times does Danny come around the hotel room? The eeriness of the scrapbook giving the history of the hotel, all the conversations Danny has with tony. (Which leads me to another point is Danny’s “shine” is very underutilized in the movie. ) the hedge maze sculptures, the list goes on… 

I can say the same thing about misery too. 

But that slow burn would take too long for a theatrical release, got to trim it down. 

Don’t get me wrong, both are great. And there’s tons of theory on Kubricks classic interpretation of the book that makes it stand on its own.",jmh2013,2021-08-05T02:09:45Z,The Shining,COMMENT

What Kubrick did, set up and align shots, tell actors how to perform, and even making sure certain visual elements were present within a scene are all part of the directorial aspect of filmmaking.

Yes, they are linked - but a clockwork orange is a kubrick film not the Burgess novel and the shining is a kubrick film not the king novel. As an artist, kubrick should not feel free to make the work of art he desires, but rather indebted to that of a previous artist?

1wkoc0,"I remember some of the ""Making Of"" for The Shining, shot by his daughter (and subsequently censored by the man himself). Kubrick would hang out with Jack Nicholson and egg him on, in order to give him the manic energy he needed for the part, and the two of them would play pranks on Shelley Duvall to keep her constantly agitated, again to make *her* part convincing. There's a scene where she comes to Kubrick and shows him her hair is falling out because of the stress (she actually takes a lump of hair off of her head) and he just laughs at her.

Another very telling story was by Malcolm McDowell, who said that Kubrick was his best friend during the shooting of A Clockwork Orange, they hung out, laughed together etc, but as soon as the shoot was finished, Kubrick broke all contact with him, and never spoke to him again.

Personally, none of this ruins the movies for me, which are arguably the best in cinematic history. The work and the man are simply not the same thing. Quite apart from that, you only need to watch his movies to realize that he was someone deeply in touch with the human condition.",zeptimius,2014-01-31T00:30:54Z,The Shining,COMMENT

That said, The Shining by Stanley Kubrick is a movie paramount to symbolism. It’s his version of King’s great book. But he changed so much about it. Watch Room 237, the documentary. It explains Kubricks version while also kind of explaining why he went in a totally different direction. 
Kubricks version is more about the human psyche & disregarding children as a culture. The documentary has some “interesting” interpretations. But it is absolutely enthralling if somewhat out there.",dastufishsifutsad,2022-12-17T05:02:28Z,The Shining,COMMENT

He said that years later, after he himself got sober, he realized that what he was describing in Jack’s situation was “white knuckle sobriety” - basically when people manage to stay sober, but failed to address the underlying problems, and hence have to “power through” their urges. The approach more often than not fails.

Whatever lived in the hotel was able to get to Jack, because he was emotionally vulnerable, and all the violence Jack displayed when drunk was still in him under a thin coating of “I do it for my family”.

King has a tendency for self injections in his books, but I think it’s fascinating that he didn’t realize he was describing himself in Jack until years later.",AsFarAsItGoes,2022-08-04T12:25:09Z,The Shining,COMMENT

As the child of an alcoholic, it was both incredibly relatable, and deeply unsettling to see how well King nailed that feeling of dread at seeing your parent change before your very eyes into something monstrous.

enqb6i,"The first paragraph in this review of doctor sleep sums up the difference between the book and the movie in the best way I’ve read.

“As Stephen King once (or maybe twice) said, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining is a good horror film but a horrible adaptation of King’s novel, one that arguably misses what makes the book so harrowing. And yet it’s nearly impossible to weigh one against the other; both are equally great for entirely different reasons: King’s novel is about alcoholism and the cycle of abuse, of battling ancient familial demons and the desperate struggle to assume control over something that seems uncontrollable. Kubrick’s film is a cinematic masterwork, but it’s more about the inherently evil nature of man and our precarious grip on sanity; it’s less concerned with exploring human themes and more preoccupied with treating the psyche like a poltergeist.”

The movie is called “The Shining”, which refers to the psychic gift Danny has. In the book, the Shining allows him to “communicate” with the hotel, and in the end - and this is important - it’s the Shining that allows Danny and his mother to survive his fathers madness.

In the movie, we get to understand the Shining, what Danny sees because of it, and his ability to communicate with Mr Hallorann. But then the last time the Shining is of any significance is when Danny calls on Hallorann to save them, only to be unceremoniously axed to death.

The book is about family, and the gift of the Shining is the thing that saves them. The movie is about a haunted hotel and really has nothing to do with the Shining.",stubept,2020-01-12T19:20:13Z,The Shining,COMMENT

enqb6i,"This is one of those comparisons that’s almost impossible to make because the shining transcends the medium and is pretty much a completely different work than the book. It’s barely even an adaption. 

King hated it, but I think the author and it’s critics misses the point when they critique the shining from a character centric point of view. It’s just a different animal. King’s book makes the most out of it’s medium as a book and Kubrick wanted to make the most out of the medium as a pure standalone film without the restrictions and expectations of a book.

Kubrick doesn’t use dynamic characters. He’s not really even concerned with character growth in the traditional writing sense. His films are deliberate in canceling out empathy and Kubrick as a director is known for demanding takes from his actors that are more alien, void of emotional connection, or just straight out outlandish. His films forces you to be an objective observer instead of an emotionally invested member. This was a common criticism during his time, but it’s also a quality that made Kubrick timeless and often cited as the greatest American director next to Hitchcock. Taking out empathy from his films allowed him to highlight his concepts, themes, screenplay, and cinematography in a really powerful way. I think the approach worked well in the shining because it gives the film a really eerily uncanny and trancelike atmosphere that haunts you the whole time through. Couple that with the intimate tracking of the overlook and the play on the subtle impossible rooms/spaces and you have a really creepy viewing experience.


With that said, it’s completely understandable that King had no love for the film since Kubrick certainly had no respect for the integrity of the source material.",yuushamenma,2020-01-12T23:02:06Z,The Shining,COMMENT

Yes? That's in the book too. It just takes a lot longer + actually makes sense.

> Second, Jack is not exactly the picture of calm stability at the beginning of the book. Within the first 15 pages, we learn that he has serious anger issues. Before we meet Jack, he's already broken his toddler son's arm in a fit of rage, and beaten the shit out of one of his students to the point that the boy required hospitalization. 

You're conflating ""anger issues"" with psychosis and hallucinatory delusion? Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo K. See, that's not even correct as the entire concept in the book revolved around the ""activation"" of the house and the shining, where in the movie it was just... cabin fever.

It's one thing to say ""it's not supposed to,"" which is the common argument for what that's worth, but to say ""it actually does follow the spirit + source"" when the author themselves, and, you know, people who've read it as well as professionals who could create screenplays or direct the film know what could have been done disagree? Fine... but... uh...


The original ending had them not even find a body and give the kid the tennis ball. I mean, derp, ""it was all just a dream"" was the original ending of the movie and you're saying it was true to the source?

The movie barely even touches on the shining at all, it has a magical negro, and the wife is about as brained as a bag of doorknobs.

Just no. I was there on opening night, as a fan of the books, and it was the equivalent of watching a suspense horror flick, not this ""symbol rich tapestry"" that people have pointed out only because the industry's idea of horror today is sp00py jumpscares.

Nothing wrong with that, at all. But if you ask people ""what is the shining about,"" those who saw the movie will have a different answer than those who saw the book unless they grossly simplify it to the caricature that it became.",eqleriq,2020-01-13T10:03:33Z,The Shining,COMMENT
enqb6i,"I'm... not sure about that. The book explores the cyclical nature of alcoholism and domestic violence with spoopy haunted hotel framing. Being trapped in a situation that no one involved can escape from... something that is inevitable without a herculean effort. 

The movie -- while great in its own right -- just sort of mentions these things. I mean, it's there, but I don't think it's explored in-depth, partially just due to the medium; we don't get to see these characters' inner lives. 

Jack's horrific struggle to be a good man, Shelley's constant anxiety and conflict between supporting her husband and protecting her child, and Danny's abrupt and traumatic loss of innocence, making him feel as though HE must protect his parents from the demons within.

enqb6i,"My problem is less with the actual content in the beginning and more the execution. I actually really like how George Hatfield is introduced in such a way you think he's just an irredeemable little shit but eventually it's revealed he's more of a mirror to Jack himself. But most of this stuff could and should have been left for later in the book instead of all garbled up for us at the start.

While I do think the ""ghosts as capitalism"" is an interesting angle I don't really think it holds up; Al Shockley is genuinely Jack's friends and he effectively uses cronyism to get him the Overlook job. If the book is a critique of capitalism's mental health effects on its workers, then shouldn't that be the core of Jack's trauma rather than his abusive father? Jack's pressure from his job isn't long hours or bad conditions, it's from Hatfield, a character specifically written in such a way to mirror him. Most of his stresses are only tangentially work-related. 

That said, I do think you could tell the Shining as an anti-capitalist allegory without the ghosts. I said in my first comment that Jack destroying the snocat struck me as the best written scene in the book, and his primary motivation for staying is because he knows this is his last real chance to get meaningful employment. But I honestly don't think it needs to be more explicit than the family having obvious finanical struggles that force them to isolate themselves. Give Jack a shaky support structure that is taken away from him the moment he's forced to take this job to support his family.",Bennings463,2020-01-12T22:16:31Z,The Shining,COMMENT

enqb6i,"Yeah, I totally get King’s gripes, but when the result is an absolute industry-standard giant of a horror movie, it’s maybe time to accept and acknowledge someone else’s creative vision.  This doesn’t mean that the movie is above criticism, but criticism doesn’t have to be dismissal, as is the direction so many fans of King seem to take it.  

Years ago, I read a piece by John Le Carre, who was in a somewhat similar situation after his novel *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* was adapted to a BBC miniseries.  Not that it was unfaithful (it wasn’t at all), but the character of George Smiley was played so distinctly by Alec Guinness that Le Carre simply had to admit that the character no longer belonged to him.  That even he could never look at him as anyone other than Guinness, and couldn’t help writing him with that embodiment in mind.  It was such an interesting little piece of writing, both thrilled with how far this character had gone, and melancholy with his loosened grip on it.  I always think of it when I hear about King’s displeasure with the movie adaptation of The Shining, because it gives me a bit more insight into how it must feel having your own creation become someone else’s, and to see it become wildly successful in their hands.",sdwoodchuck,2020-01-12T22:43:22Z,The Shining,COMMENT

That said, I really don't think he was the right choice for the Shining in that case. The inner life of the characters, particularly Jack, IS the story. 

I suppose what I'm saying is that going into it, I'd read the Shining and knew that King famously hated the Kubrick version, but given Kubrick's reputation and how much people like the movie, I assumed I'd find King's complaints unfounded. 

Instead, fifteen minutes into the movie, I completely understood and agreed with King. 

If I had written the Shining and that was the ""adaptation"" I got, I would have been pissed. 

It's a brilliantly shot and designed movie in many respects, but it butchers the book. Now, that would be forgivable if Kubrick replaced it with... something. But instead, all we really get is some great cinematography. 

I'm honestly seriously reminded of newer directors like Christopher Nolan and JJ Abrams.

enqb6i,"I feel like I'm not doing a great job of communicating. The point I'm ""trying* to make is partially what you touched on: that I don't think any piece of art is above reproach or more accurately, above critique. 

It seems you really want me to say what my issues are, so here goes. Keep in mind, I said they are subjective(even for art), and nitpicky. 

First, I feel all of Kubrick's films are... cold; inhuman. A stupendous imitation of human emotion, but an imitation, nonetheless. I haven't seen all of his films, and I suspect that if true, possibly intentional. The Shining is probably the worst example of this, but I still feel it. 

As far as my ""problems,"" I stated that I don't see the point of Holleran in the film. I'm not talking about how cool he is in the book here... I'm talking about a character that seems to have no point other than subverting expectations. I'd be curious if I'm just missing something. 

The movie also seems to show Jack as an everyman who is driven insane, but as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Nicholson seems crazy from the word go. 

What's Wendy's character, besides mother who is also scared? 

Now, see? I told you my criticisms are not deep enough to really figuratively fight over. I just wanted to try and say -- again, what you already said for me -- that no piece of art should be on a pedestal so high that no negative word can be uttered without scorn. 

I guess that's it. The movie is amazing. Beautiful cinematography, mysterious, disturbing, and rife for different interpretations. 

Nothing should be sacrosanct.

io5052,"No doubt, King is a good writer. That's - *duh.*

In my opinion, he's a terrific master of the *craft,* but his novels too often devolve into cheesy third acts, and rushed *deus ex machina* endings.

Not all of his books share this problem - *Misery* is fantastic, as is *Deloris Claiborne,* and *Pet Sematary* is absolutely scary. But many (most?) of his books do.

Maybe it's an issue of length - his short stories are fantastic.

Anyway, I'll always have King to thank for my love of reading. During the summer between fourth and fifth grades, I read *The Shining.* It took me all summer, but I finished it - and since then, I haven't stopped reading.

But even way back then, I knew that Kubrick's version of *The Shining* was a better, scarier *story.*

I thought that the novel's ending >!(in which Jack starts morphing, and bashes his own face in with the mallet, and the Overlook blows up)!< was lame.

For me, Kubrick's version wins.

Interesting bit: In the novel, the Torrances arrive at the hotel in a red VW Beetle. In the film, they drive a yellow Beetle.

There's a part in the film during which Dick Hallorann, on his way to rescue Wendy and Danny, drives past a red VW Beetle crushed under an overturned semi.

It's believed that this little bit was put into the film by Kubrick as a way of saying, basically, ""The Torrances in the book didn't survive the trip to *my* Overlook. This is my story.""",EmilioEarhart,2020-09-07T14:23:46Z,The Shining,COMMENT

io5052,"I actually read and watched The Shining for the first time this summer in that order. I was very excited to watch the movie since I’ve heard so many great things about it over the years and like you I was extremely disappointed in the movie having just read the book. Kubrick is a fantastic director and some of the shots in the movie are incredible but overall the plot and character development that was in the book was butchered for the movie. Jack is supposed to be this flawed, yet overall good guy who slowly descends into insanity at the hands of the hotel. But in the movie he’s just outright loony from the beginning and seems to have no qualms about his new hatred for Wendy and Jack when in the book it is a really big struggle for him. Danny is in my eyes the most important character in the book as he is the one with the shining and the hotel is reacting the way it is because of him. He’s also very mature for his young age and you get to see and learn about his evolving thought process and all the hard decisions he has to make watching his beloved father go insane and become dangerous. In the movie Danny is kinda just this creepy little kid that does the weird finger thing and doesn’t really offer much else to the story. Finally, Wendy. In the book Wendy is a total badass. She doesn’t put up with Jacks shit as he gets crazier and is constantly battling with him making sure he knows that Danny is her number one priority and she will keep him safe no matter what. In the movie Wendy is just a big whiny cry baby who’s only purpose in the movie was to scream and cry. I really didn’t mean to rant this long but this post really struck a chord with me as I just read the book and watched the movie for the first time and was also very unimpressed with the movie when I thought it was gonna be great. My final complaint is a lot of the major plot points from the book (Dick sensing something was wrong and coming back from Florida to save Danny, Jacks intense regret for breaking Danny’s arm hindering his thoughts of harming him that the hotel was putting in his head, etc) seemed to happen in the movie with next to no explanation.

io5052,"I agree with Stephen King's criticisms, especially in regards to A. Jack Nicholson seeming insane from the first scene and B. Wendy's depiction/Kubrick's treatment of Shelly Duvall. That said, I think the Shining novel is pretty bad and disorganized relative to the books King was putting out at the time. If you look at Carrie or the Long Walk (which was published later but written before the Shining), you see SK telling a tightly-written, engaging story with evocative, subtly deployed themes. The Long Walk is an allegory for Vietnam that is both pointed and not obvious or even necessary to understanding the book. Carrie is a pretty brutal account of child abuse/bullying/conformity that uses its epistolary format to implicate the entire community for being complicit in the abuses Carrie suffers. SK wrote the Shining, which is around three times as long as these books, before he had a handle on how to tell a big, ambitious story, and the novel suffers from that. In the beginning we have obvious exposition/foreshadowing in the scene with Jack and the boiler guy, which goes on forever and basically spells out the entire ending of the book. We've got the ridiculous wasp scene where Jack is like, ""REALLY LIFE IS LIKE WASPS"" or whatever. Not very subtle or compelling. The whole novel feels really disorganized like this, with tons of great ideas peppered with some really weak writing and some structurally bizarre choices.

 I think that to call Kubrick's movie a ""bad adaptation"" because it doesn't literally adapt the action of the book is kind of dumb. Or at least a too literal understanding of what a good or bad adaptation is. As a filmmaker there's nothing saying you owe a direct fidelity to the source material; the version of the Shining that perfectly adheres to SK's vision already exists, and it's the novel. So I'm not really into nitpicking whether a movie captures this versus that, it's its own thing and should be judged on those merits. So I think a lot of the Shining book versus movie discussion is kind of pointless: who cares if Kubrick wasn't interested in the same things as King? To say the Shining film would be more interesting as a direct adaptation of the novel is totally disengenuous. If you want a direct adaptation, there's the Shining tv miniseries from the 90s, which closely adheres to the book (Stephen King wrote the screenplay) and is unwatchable.

io5052,"There was a made for television adaptation of The Shining that was actually filmed at the hotel in Estes Park, The Stanley Hotel. that inspired King to write the book. I've stayed there. It's an extremely cool old hotel and I wouldn't doubt for a minute it's haunted.

Anyway, I thought the television adaptation was great but it  gets a lot of hate from movie fans of Kubrick's version. I guess those people never read the book and they're probably into that whole secret baking powder native American genocide imagery mania from the Room 237 documentary.... which I personally think is a ridiculous stretch and a bunch of horseshit. But whatever, to each his own.

I had read The Shining before I saw Kubrick's movie in the way back times and I thought the movie was pretty disappointing. The set was very cool, but the movie missed the mark for me. The movie came out when I was in high school, and,  no, it wasn't widely critically acclaimed when it came out. Many people thought it was a disappointment.

**The  movie reviews for the Shining when it was released were generally quite bad, that's a fact, and anyone who is telling you otherwise is just full of it. It was not a critical success when it came out.**

And hello, as you rightfully noted, the room in the book is 217 not 237 which is the thing I think that kicked off the whole baking powder nonsense. There was no real reason to change the room number except that the hotel they used for some of the exterior shots didn't want them use that number because they had a room 217 and thought people wouldn't want to stay there. It didn't have a room 237 so that's actually why the change. But of course, the hotel interior in Kubrick's version was a just a sound stage. Completely made-up.

217 was actually the room King stayed in at the Stanley Hotel and it's the room everyone wants when they check into the hotel obviously. The hotel has also got a hedge maze (no topiaries) but honestly you'd be a little disappointed in that because the hedges are waist high. I figure it's for safety reasons because the leading wall of the hedge maze is lined up to a pretty precipitous drop so if someone were to cut through the bushes not knowing that, they'd probably fall off the edge and die. But honestly being stuck in a maze of waist-high bushes ends up feeling more irritating than cool.

In the Cusak movie, at that hotel the room was 1408 (also the name of the movie) because, as King pointed out 1+4+8 = 13, obviously.

Kubrick seems to me a masterful cinematographer (and photographer) who made a series of interesting films, peaked with *2001*, and then parlayed that into a career as a frustrated and largely incompetent writer - hampered by his remote and cold nature - and was pampered and indulged by Warners to an absurd degree, allowing him to be as uncaring and perfectionist as any human could be in making increasingly cold and heartless movies largely indistinguishable from product anyone else working at the time - given similar studio leeway - could have made as well or (possessing, presumably, a warmth and humanity Kubrick struggled with) even better, all of them middling adaptations of novels, until he made the masterpiece that is *Eyes Wide Shut*, which I think is probably his best achievement, and I can't imagine why most people hate it.",HugoNebula,2020-09-07T12:10:18Z,The Shining,COMMENT
io5052,"I don't think anyone here said the ""critics"" loved The Shining when it was released. Everyone who has followed this knows it was controversial in 1980. But many films undergo critical reassessment over time, and today the film is regarded as a classic of the genre and has an 84%/93% score on Rotten tomatoes (the TV movie which you love so much is at 42%/54%).

Your whole post, when you're not bizarrely whinging about the room #, is a complaint that it's not close enough to the book (which is also excellent) for your liking. Even though Kubrick didn't give a damn about that and it wasn't his goal. And in any event, most people in this thread understand cinematic adaptations don't always have to follow the book closely to be successful and are able to judge them on their own merits.

I love The Shining as a movie, and if it wasn't connected to King's book in any way, I wouldn't have many criticisms of it at all. But as a huge fan of the book, I can't stand this adaptation. It shares so, so little with the book, and it left out so much of what I thought made the story itself so interesting.",bendingspoonss,2020-09-07T17:23:38Z,The Shining,COMMENT
io5052,"I thought the movie was one of those movies that gets liked more for its visuals and its mood than for its story. I found the storytelling to be a little flat. I think Kubrick's earlier work was far superior to his later work and it makes me sad that his world had gotten so small that by the time he got around to making Eyes Wide Shut he had become so flat he seemed like he was ripping off his younger self, unsuccessfully. I think it would have been better had he just retired before then.

As I said before the room# had already been brought up before, and not by me,  and you may be aware of this, there's also a documentary made about the Shining called Room 237 which I found not only preposterous but worst still, sooo boring. It has a small fanboy following on Reddit. Sorry if that includes you, but as you said, I'm entitled to my opinion.",,2020-09-07T16:09:39Z,The Shining,COMMENT

There's very little filler in the book imo but King loves to describe things down to the smallest detail, so it might feel like there's a lot of unnecessary filler to you.

upyct9,"I liked the book but felt Kubrik did a better job at taking the core of the story, polishing it and expressing it. For me the book is a good supplement to the movie especially if you give yourself time to forget some of the details of the book before watching the movie again. 

Reading the heartwrenching scenes of abuse make me feel that much more for the characters in the movie. I personally like the changes Kubrik made. 

My only - and to me minor - complaint is that Jack played Jack crazy all the way through. But it was effective as hell though. I have the same complaint re: the Exorcist, it gets too unambiguously supernatural too early on (would’ve been interesting to have the audience and Karras doubt a bit once he meets Regan, whether or not the possession is real). But it’s fucking startingly effective. For both films it’s only a complaint I’ve had after watching each many times and really letting them sink in and pondering their power and messages. 

There’s a reason they’re commonly the top two horror films on many lists, Exorcist edging out Shining in my opinion due to the sheer ferocity and startling visceralness of some of the images and the ever-so-slightly stronger sense that it could be a true story, unlike the Shining which is still a good old fashioned haunted house ghost story at its core, though terrifyingly believable, especially as mental illness and trauma are woven in and experienced vicariously by the audience.",HuttVader,2022-05-15T06:31:19Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I say this because it always felt like the movie was more about Jack than anyone else.


I also think the book is far scarier and more emotional than the movie, IMO.


But yeah I’d say the changes to Wendy and Dick are the most significant, what the movie did to them is bordering on character assassination lol",aSpookyScarySkeleton,2022-05-15T10:59:42Z,The Shining,COMMENT
zn24oe,"The Shining (movie) is a not a faithful adaptation of the book, but in my opinion is much more frightening than the source material. 

I love both. However, Kubricks film while much different from King's novel is one of the greatest horror films ever made and I wouldnt have it any other way. I just wish it wasnt tainted, knowing how Shelley Duvall was treated on set. She was a great actor and her performance in The Shining deserves a lot of credit, not just for how good it is, but also for the shit she had to put up with from Kubrick. I also always hear people saying the miniseries is better, its not. More faithful to the book, yes, but Kubrick's direction, editing, cinematography brought so much to the table, nobody made films quite like Kubrick did.

I really enjoyed how Doctor Sleep (the movie) tied both the original novel and the film together. It felt like the director, Mike Flanagan, made it out of a place of love for both the novel and the film, and was doing what he could to do justice to both. Its well worth a watch even if you disliked Kubrick's film. Hell, it might even change your mind about it.",,2022-12-16T05:00:49Z,The Shining,COMMENT
zn24oe,The Kubrick film is a GREAT movie -- but it's not Stephen King's The Shining.,Alternative_Effort,2022-12-16T07:16:35Z,The Shining,COMMENT
zn24oe,"Stephen King was critical of Kubrick's interpretation of The Shining, as King's theme is that characters make their own decisions, rightly or wrongly, and that's what matters. Kubrick's film places forces outside the characters' control. In the novel, men are violent when they cannot abandon their entitlement, and it's a choice they consciously make. In Kubrick's movie, it is delusional destiny. King criticised this as his characters being reduced to ""like insects"", as they cannot shape their own fates. King claimed Kubrick ""thinks too much and feels too little"", though critics have reversed that onto King, claiming he ""feels too much and thinks too little"".

King later made a TV miniseries of his novel, also called The Shining. In it, the inhuman horror of The Overlook Hotel is much more greatly emphasised. It gives deceptive visions and focuses temptation on Jack Torrance's weaknesses, but ultimately the character of Torrance is the one who makes the decisions and, at the end, has his chance of redemption (another theme of King's). It was compared poorly to Kubrick's version, but runs much more like a horror story.",Hattix,2022-12-16T10:45:05Z,The Shining,COMMENT

zn24oe,"Stephen King hated the movie adapation of ""The Shining.""  I don't really know his reasons, but apparently he thought it strayed too far from the meaning of his book.

The movie (Kubrick's movie) is a conundrum that is both confounding and befuddling ( I mean when else am I gonna get to use those words together?).  The meaning of it all comes down to which character's point of view you identify with.

I think that was deliberate on Kubrick's part.  You know that scene where Wendy confronts Jack as he sits at the typewriter, close to the beginning of the film?  

When she talks to him, there's a table and chair behind him but when he answers her, there is no furniture behind him at all.  He's just torn the paper out of this typewriter and his hair is disheveled and he is angry at Wendy for interrupting him.

After she leaves the room, we see Jack at the typewriter, the paper still inserted in it, his hair is neatly combed, and the table and chair are behind him where they were before.

Is Wendy the one who's cracking up?  Is Jack being manipulated by the house somehow?  Is Danny really being possessed, did jack really molest him as the movie implies?

It's one of those point-of-view situations that can leave you more confused than anything else.  I can see why King thought it went a little too far astray from his vision.",tygerprints,2022-12-16T17:20:47Z,The Shining,COMMENT

He doesn’t always follow through on that build and I think he really leaves a lot of it up to his readers. My favorite parts of the few King books I’ve read are when the main characters are scared because their own imaginations are running wild. They’re expecting a bloody dead corpse with cloudy eyes and rotten teeth reaching out for them, grabbing them, eating them. Their hair is standing on end and sweat is tickling their scalp and running down the back of their neck. Then they reach for the doorknob, turn it, open it wide and… sometimes nothing is there. But King just spent two pages making the reader feel what the character feels. THAT is what he’s good at. When I read King, I live in his stories. However, endings are not his strength and the books I’ve read tend to fall off towards the end. Regardless, I’ll probably keep picking up King books in the future.

In the miniseries which was written by Stephen King, King takes out one of my favorite images: Where the Overlook embodied in Jack spins the wheel of the boiler --- the hot metal sinking into the palms of his hands and setting them on fire --- and when the gauge goes down, it shuffles in a victory dance with its flaming hands waving above its head.

Instead King replaces that with a scene where Jack takes back control of himself one final time as he stands in front of the boiler and deliberately refuses to spin the wheel to release the pressure and so makes the decision to blow up the Overlook.",Dana07620,2022-10-26T06:17:19Z,The Shining,COMMENT
ydcmxw,"Also having recently finished reading The Shining, it very much is fantastic psychological horror. Absolutely loved the way Jack's lies that he had built up to protect himself slowly decayed as the hotel tightened it's grip on him. 

On a personal level, his struggle to maintain his sobriety really was relatable. So many times he struggles with the choice of doing what's right for his career versus his family and resists the urge to have a strong drink or two or ten to numb the pain by recalling the trauma of the problems his alcoholism caused in the past. Having worked in stressful environments, there have been plants of days where I would have loved to have just let the boiler blow up and end it all, but had to do what was required and then try to resist the urge to hit the bottle.

I also found Wendy's character really interesting, because you really get the sense of how much damage her mother caused her by how overly protective she is of Danny. On the one hand, she was totally in the right being cautious of Jack after what he did in the past, but any time something was off, it was automatically his fault.

In the end though, the most horrifying thing about the whole thing is the trauma of it all. I mean, Danny's just a kid and went through that whole ordeal. That's pretty messed up. Then trying to think of the mental and physical trauma Wendy suffered. And not to mention Dick Halloran as well. Yeah, sure the hotel was creepy,  but... oh man, that would be tough to recover from.

I loved the shining because of the mystery that it provoked: “was it really magic, or was it just cabin fever?” It made the book feel like it could exist in the real world, and slightly touched magic, but just enough to be enjoyable and to provoke questions. Doctor Sleep threw that all in the garbage, and just said “yeah it was all magic, here’s some vampires, that should satisfy the masses.” I wish he had never written the book, and I wish I’d never read it. It ruined the magic of the Shining by adding more than was needed. It felt sloppy and like King only wrote it to satisfy the masses, and it genuinely upset me.

But, yes, you are on the right track and the change in the room number is very specific. It's been a long time since I looked into it, but in the Shining the room number references something specific about the Apollo mission. They did something for the specific number of minutes that the room number is assigned (or the first broadcast with the simulated Earth background that NASA admitted to appeared at that specific time in the mission. Can't remember which.) It's all in the book, and the theories people float about Kubrick's films, if true, put the man into the stratosphere as far as revelatory film making goes, which is pretty good considering how high he sets the bar in the first place on just the standard genius level.

In a way, the film version of *The Shining* reminded me a little of the film *Picnic at Hanging Rock* by Peter Weir. *Picnic at Hanging Rock* is not an obvious horror film like *The Shining*, but both feature an edifice that seems to have a malign power or intelligence of its own, and it isn’t clear whether the edifice “corrupts” innocent people, or whether there is some innate malignity in those people who fall under the edifice’s spell. Very mysterious. I have never forgotten either movie.",,2023-09-05T20:22:35Z,The Shining,COMMENT

fs6xjb,"The Shining is my all time favourite book. I hear in the Kubrick film, Jack is already crazy from the beginning. In the book, that isn't the case at all. He starts off fine, until the Overlook eventually gets at him.

Sorry, did not see the part about recommending another one. Out of those you have, I recommend 'salem's Lot. Not as good as The Shining, bit it has a great story and buildup. Also, I would read *It* before 11.22.63 since there are some references in the latter from the former",HairyBaIIs007,2020-03-31T06:07:49Z,The Shining,COMMENT
fs6xjb,"I loved The Shining, but It has been my favorite of his so far. If you get burned out and need a break, give his son's work a try. His name is Joe Hill, he has his father's talent for writing, but he knows how to finish a book and his subject matter is alot more dark and twisted (yes, it's possible). I've read Horns (the one they made into a crappy Daniel Radcliff movie) and NOS4A2 (which had become an okay-ish tv series), both were spectacular. His character development is just as good as King's, but he really gets into the nooks and crannies of your brain.",kn0ttyl1brar1an,2020-03-31T13:10:06Z,The Shining,COMMENT
fs6xjb,"Firstly, I absolutely love your take on The Shining (both book and movie) and agree. Stephen King's writing of Jack's past and his slow descent into madness as the hotel's evil play on his weaknesses, was masterfully done. His moment of redemption as well was a necessary moment especially for Danny. This character devolution and redemption moment were things I think the movie sorely lacked. Wendy's character as well, was much stronger in the book than the movie.

IMO, definitely IT for the next read. Amazing book. For me it is always a toss up between The Shining and IT as my favourite SK books. You can also get the sequel to The Shining i.e. Doctor Sleep. Not as good, but a satisfying read with an adult Danny.

11/22/63 is also really good, as is Salem's Lot. For me, Cujo is just tragic and I never could reread it. Even now I get tears in my eyes when I think of the last lines in Cujo.

The best other SK recommendations IMO would include (amongst others): Duma Key, Bag of Bones, Misery, Needful Things and Different Seasons (the last being a collection of four novellas, all of them excellent).

You can try Dark Tower for a fantasy slant, though I never really got into it, and although The Stand is probably one of the most recommended, it is not a favourite of mine. Try his short story collections as well if you continue to love his work.",Lanfear_Eshonai,2020-03-31T16:10:10Z,The Shining,COMMENT
fs6xjb,"I absolutely agree about Shining. But I have to admit I find Stephen King very inconsistent in his writing genius. What ai mean is that some books are masterpieces, others are rubbish and some of them are great but have such a ridiculous ending that it ruins the whole book for me. The shining and the green mile are perfect from start to finish, a small story called the langoliers is great until the very end that is so stupid it left me very disappointed. Another short story that I think it's called the sun dog builds up great suspence but is utterly idiotic. I've been told his last book is good though

fs6xjb,"A book by Stephen King that was my ""this man is a genius!"" book was Gerald's Game. To be able to write an entire novel that essentially takes place in one room, and to make it interesting to the point of not wanting to put it down, in my mind, is an an act of sheer literary genius!

Kubrick's The Shining is a film I have watched at least a dozen times over the years. I finally got around to reading the novel and had to tell myself to totally forget the movie. Kubrick's film is another example of genius, I think. However, I have to say I loved Stephen King's novel as much as the film, for his talent at allowing us to see inside the characters, which of course is something you can never really do in a filmed version; I don't care how talented the film director may be, and let's face it Kubrick was about as talented as they come.

fs6xjb,"Right? 40 years later people are still debating what Kubrick was saying scene by scene in that movie and the overall themes of it.     

No one is debating King's book, it's very straightforward with very little subtly or depth. Moreover I'm sure most people don't even know about the 1997 version of the Shining King made. It, like every other movie King has strong influence over (including doctor sleep) is fucking awful.

fs6xjb,"Right well I think that you may have missed a lot of the subtleties of Kubrick’s version. I’m not sure “flow” is the quality Kubrick desired and of course as a writer of pop thrillers, King's style is going to rely heavily on a sense of “flow” to keep you turning the pages. Kubrick was interested in crafting a world that expressed his artistic vision, and I’d say in this case that “flow” may have actually been antithetical to his vision in some sense. 

I wonder if when you watched Full Metal Jacket for example, if you really got the themes that Kubrick was exploring. Tbh I didn’t really get a lot of this stuff when I first watched his films, it was actually explained to me by one YouTube film critic in particular but he’s made most of his reviews private now sadly. Any way, Full Metal Jacket is apparently mainly an indictment of the mainstream media’s depiction of war. Similarly Kubrick’s take on The Shining has been said to be mainly a depiction of how our militarist-imperialist culture fosters a culture of toxic masculinity. So yeah I can see how to Reddit fanboys of Stephen King-style potboiler thrillers, tackling subjects such as imperialism and toxic masculinity might seem a bit icky.",viborg,2020-03-31T07:01:43Z,The Shining,COMMENT

1qjgjw,">But Dr. Sleep kinda bored me. 

I can see that, but I actually found Doctor Sleep to be more disturbing than The Shining was.  Partly because of issues like substance abuse, solitary people trying to form relationships, how to form relationships in a situation where they're not 'appropriate' (Danny has very real and understandable objections to getting involved with a young girl), and especially about how old people live (and die), once society is 'done' with them.  I think the fact that [Spoiler](/s ""the bathtub woman from room 217 is so easily overcome is a sign that 'horror' isn't what he's going for."") 

I don't really see it as a 'horror' novel- the villains are a bit silly (though the whole driving around in RVs is great), there is no real exterior conflict or tension, and it feels more to me like King really wanted to explore what happened to Danny, than that he had any real interest in scaring people.  I haven't read Joyland, but after reading Under the Dome, 11/22/63, and Doctor Sleep, it feels more like he's gravitating away from horror as the object, and more into exploring characters, which (at least to me) is always what he's done best.

You can read the sequel, *Doctor Sleep*, where Danny is grown up and still struggling with his demons. Not as good or scary as the first, but a very decent sequel (that SK wrote many years later).

Some of my SK favourites that I definitely recommend:

* IT
* Duma Key
* Pet Sematary
* Carrie
* Misery
* 11/22/63
* Bag of Bones

lpfgtt,"The Langoliers is a story in Four Past Midnight. Had a SciFi (pre-SyFy) TV movie that’s a pretty accurate adaptation. 

Pet Semetary has one of the bleakest endings of any book ever. Not sure either movie really captured it well. 

I like The Regulators. That’s one of the Bachman books. It’s companion novel Desperation has been made into a movie a couple times. But I prefer The Regulators and would love to see that as a movie. 

The Running Man. +10 for don’t let the book affect the movie in your mind. 

It. Holy crap. If you don’t know what happens in the end absolutely do not look it up. Both adaptations have their merits although It Chapter 2 was quite the mess. 

The Stand I think was considered King’s magnum opus pre-Dark Tower. The original mini series was okay. I hear the new one isn’t but I haven’t seen it yet. 

The Dark Tower series is a prime example of its a marathon and not a sprint. Although if you trucked through The Shining in two days I’m sure you’ll be fine. Don’t waste your time on the movie. 

Eyes of the Dragon aka King does fantasy. My first King book when I was 10. Has connective tissue to the Dark Tower universe but a good standalone story. 

Salem’s Lot. Movie and book. Huge fan!

Christine. Movie and book. Huge fan!

Carrie. Movie and book. Huge fan!

The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both depression-era prison stories that aren’t really horror but both have incredible movie adaptations (Shawshank arguably the best King adaptation ever). 

And lastly, if you ever wanted to know what doing cocaine in a heat wave would be like, go watch Maximum Overdrive. It’s based off a very short story (I think only 6 pages) that you don’t need to read but King directing a King movie is just great.",,2021-02-22T05:05:19Z,The Shining,COMMENT

6j3c09,"I just finished reading The Shining a week or so ago. Also my first King book. I'm busy reading The Stand at the moment.

I loved The Shining, the characters were interesting and well portrayed. Jack was likeable but flawed; reprehensible in some ways, sympathetic in others. His slow descent into madness was terrifyingly captivating.

King's portrayal of Danny is great as well, naive but also wise beyond his years as a result of his gift. He also nailed the feeling one gets as a child where a certain word or phrase uttered by a parent in passing, innocuously, becomes a memory that really sticks with you, and surfaces time and time again from your subconscious.

The length of the build up was one the best things about the book, in my opinion. You really get an opportunity to get to know the characters, as the tension continues to mount, making it that much more impactful when things really start to fall apart.

The Stand has been a lot like that so far as well, a lot of time is spent exploring characters while tension mounts and events spiral slowly out of control, very entertaining stuff!",PrimateLegend,2017-06-23T20:33:09Z,The Shining,COMMENT
6j3c09,"As a huge fan of the Kubrick film, having watched the film in excess of ten times, I had to force myself to forget the film before sitting down to read Stephen King's novel. 

I really enjoyed the novel and getting to know the characters. One thing I have always enjoyed about Stephen King's writing is how idiomatic it is. I found it interesting how the story is told from several points of view and how each person's own personal way of speaking comes out through their interior dialogues.

One thing that took me by surprise was the final scene in the last chapter with Danny sitting on the dock talking with Mr Halloran. That scene was so incredibly touching and tender that I found myself tearing up from it. 

I'm presently reading **Doctor Sleep**, King's 2013 sequel where Danny is now an adult. I have to say it's kept me up on more than one night of reading.

For what it's worth, I am a big fan of the Stanley Kubrick movie as well. The book delves so much more into the history of the hotel, so many more ghosts appear than what is in the movie, the hotel itself is an entity, and there is a lot of background on Jack Torrence that would have been helpful to know in the movie as well. I have since read several Stephen King books; some are good, some I didn't really care for, but The Shining is truly a terrifying read and I would highly recommend it. Enjoy.

The book and the movie are so different its almost hard to compare them. The movie hits some of King's scarier scenes but leaves out a lot of little scary and awesome details. If you ever saw the 90s remake of The Shining its more like that version but much better.

Calling him a piece of shit because he was an alcoholic with alcoholic tendencies is a misreading of the character. King criticized Kubrick's film adaption for this reason; the film establishes Jack as the antagonist in the first 10 minutes. Like I said before, Jack was depicted as a flawed alcoholic father and husband. This was done to mirror King's own personal struggles with alcoholism. Viewed in this light, Jack finding the strength to fight off the possession at the end to save Danny IS redemptive.

The institute takes place in same universe as Carrie and Firestarter, and likely The shining as well, since all the kids are using the Shine to do the Institutes dirty deeds.

Which makes me wonder if Revival is In the shining universe or the Dark Tower one.  Even though they're all connected in one way or another honestly.

Some stories like Black House and Talisman are likely in same universe as Fairy Tale it seems they have a world jumping story base where the other world is smaller than our own.  But if you're talking second worlds then might as well throw Roae Madder into that mix as well, since she enters a different world through a painting. 

Then you have the alien books like Dreamcatcher and Under the Dome, with also possibility of Revival being thrown in the mix as well. 

IT, NEEDFUL THINGS, AND THE OUTSIDER  are all similar creatures feeding off different things, just taking different forms.

I don't remember references to any other King novels in those books, although they do sort of hint at the same mental powers as in The Shining.

And Fairy Tale goes to another world that has some hint of Midworld about it, but doesn't seem quite the same. I think his books may take place across three or four worlds in all.

du2r65,"King has said that Kubrick did not believe in the supernatural and did not understand King's concept of the hotel as a kind of storage battery for ""evil."" King also said that Kubrick never understood what King meant by ""evil"" as a sort of objective, external force absent human actions.  So Kubrick made the movie about alcoholism, isolation and insanity instead. I think Kubrick improved it and the movie is inarguably effective as a horror movie. It's probably one of the top ten horror movies ever made and one of the scariest. I kind of wish Kubrick had done more straight horror movies. I am old enough to have seen *The Shining* in its original theatrical run. I was probably 13 or 14. My parents took me. They were Stephen King fans from early on. I don't think I've ever been more scared in a movie theater. The naked old lady scene scared the living shit out of me. Imagine seeing the movie without knowing anything about it or what's going to happen. That's probably impossible now, but I didn't know that woman was going to turn into an old lady. The dude getting blown by a bear was extremely WTF to me, even though it wasn't all that scary exactly. The ""Here's Johnny"" line actually got a big laugh in my theater. It wasn't a cliche yet. It caught us by surprise.

I think the movie is better than the book in this case too. It happens. There are several other Stephen King books which I would like to see get better movie treatments than what they got, though, for example, *The Running Man*, which is  great, tense little thriller which is nothing like the cheesy, WWE style Arnold Schwarzeneggar spectacle the movie turned it into.

*Salem's Lot* should be remade too. All it's ever gotten is a lame. 1970's TV miniseries starring David Soul. It's a really good book. Classic King, but it's always been kind of under the radar.

Over the week while I read the book I felt like I could really relate to Jack. I started getting withdrawn from the group and even started getting paranoid. I was scared to death of the building we were in, especially at night when I would have to walk down a dark hallway in an unoccupied part of the house. 

That was about two years ago. I still think about the book a lot and I've never come close to finding something that has a similar effect.

3. Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie 9/10 The only reason I can't give this a 10 is that I felt the writing was at times difficult for me to understand. I know it's hard to write what Leckie did in general but the hard scifi themes mixed with Breq's constantly shifting perspective was occasionally confusing. The story was phenomenal and the writing was very refreshing despite my nitpicking. Am having trouble with the sequel though, about half way through and it's hard for me to care about the conflict as much.


4. How to Know a Person by David Brookes 5/10 This was my first dip into a book like this and I liked it to a degree. Finishing it didn't make me feel like I just finished a great novel, but the psychology and statistics he discussed was very interesting. Some of the chapters were a tad boring.


5. The Shining by Stephen King 10/10 The book is excellent. The last third of it was 11/10, it was probably the best written suspense I have ever read. Really enjoyed it. 


I guess I have been on a good roll since 3 out of the 5 I thought were phenomenal books lol.",Eggsor,2024-02-23T05:16:18Z,The Shining,COMMENT
vtapzh,"I think your interpretation of the book is entirely valid. I'm hard pressed to see how anyone can read the end of *The Shining* and not know it's the hotel in charge of Jack—there are many instances when King makes it quite clear.

There are a few issues at play here: one is that many people conflate the book with Kubrick's film, where Jack is unhinged and stereotyped from the first scene; secondly, there are a swathe of readers who aren't experienced enough, or even inclined, to recognise subtext in a 'trashy horror novel', so they don't, or won't, see it. You seem to be more empathetic than your friends in this regard, and maybe shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

Jack's background in the novel is of classic abused-turned-abuser. None of that takes away that he is, and has been, a decent husband and father, if flawed. It's just that at the point at which he's most vulnerable, he rocks up at the Overlook Hotel, and it gets its claws into him. This is clearly King's view too, as he quite deliberately gives Jack a scene of redemption at the end when he >!comes to his senses for a moment and lets Danny escape!<.",HugoNebula,2022-07-07T10:03:53Z,The Shining,COMMENT

* The novel is about the Shining, the hotel, and Dany's battle with supernatural forces
* The movie is about Jack Torrance (Dany's father played by Jack Nicholson) going crazy.

The character and focus of the two are totally different. The Shining is one of my favorite books and The Shining is one of my favorite movies. Really both great. I think it's a fantastic adaptation because the movie did things the book couldn't.

The best ones focus on character, not the threat/monster. That's where a lot of the live-action versions of his stories fall down. King makes you care about the cast so that *any* threat, no matter how far-fetched, is scary.

I'll probably be in the minority on this, but I'd also recommend hunting down the TV mini-series of The Shining. The cast isn't as good, of course, but it's competent. The FX are dated (CGI was still being polished), but the longer format gives you more of a sense of the story unfolding, more background, etc. It also features an injury with a polo mallet that's one of the more effective cringe-inducing blows I've seen as it falls into the ""less is more"" category. The blow is to the midsection, there's no blood, but the staging conveys the punch and the actors carry off the delivery of severe internal injuries quite well.

It’s not supposed to be like The Shining. It’s the product of DECADES of King mulling over the question of: what happens to Danny when he grows up? He develops that nice little contained horror novel into a world where those horrors exist outside of the mental breakdown of an alcoholic father and a kid with vaguely alluded to supernatural abilities. What’s wrong with developing that into something a bit different?

If your thing is early King, with contained psychological plots like Misery and The Shining, then maybe it’s just not for you. But I personally love both books, while recognizing that they are not the same genre. One is psychological horror, the other is more supernatural adventure. And it’s fun!

Two things to answer your question:

* Scare-for-scare, there is more content in Doctor Sleep. Fans of the original book or the movie may think there's more in The Shining, but there's not. King brings out the first ""ghost"" in Doctor Sleep within five pages. He doesn't bring out the first ""ghost"" in The Shining until about page one-fifty.

* There are a lot of reference in Doctor Sleep that draw from the original book. You'll be fine if you skip directly to Doctor Sleep, but you may appreciate it more if you read The Shining first. Many of the famous movie scenes never show up in the book (the twins, the ax, the bloody elevator). 

And one final point: the King of today is much improved from the King of thirty years ago. I'm like you, I just started down the path of King and going back to his early material has been a hard trip to travel. His writing has vastly improved over the years. He may not be as intoxicating as his drunken writing days, but I'll take that trade-off for a cleaner writing style.

I also agree that Doctor Sleep is better than The Shining. I liked both, but The Shining had this... I dunno... blandness maybe? It didn't feel the way King's writing usually does for me. I didn't get as invested in the characters, and didn't feel the same connection to the themes of the story that I do in most of his other work. Doctor Sleep had more of those qualities for me.

He's a weak, recovering alcoholic, and the evil spirits in the hotel take advantage of this and more or less take him over. He's not evil to start out.

wvy7sv,"I agree with the ""different mediums"" answer to this question, but only to an extent. To illustrate, there are some great books which could not be turned into great films or shows which are the ""same"" as the book: As I Lay Dying, Moby Dick, and The Brothers Karamozov present particular dilemmas to the filmwriter. 

In the same vein, there are many great films which would be difficult to rewrite as books. Great action/psychological films and  like Mad Max: Fury Road, 2001 A Space Odessy, and Blue Velvet would be almost impossible, with how they use visual movement and music/noise to affect the audience.

Also, there have been many great books which have become great shows/films. Look at the LOTR trilogy, Blade Runner, and The Shining. The filmmakers took artistic liberties, but the reason the films were good is because the effects they were attempting to make on the reader were similar to the effects elicited by the original novels, characters, settings, worlds, etc.

TLDR, oftentimes when filmwriters attempt to change a text to make it more ""cinematic"", they end up changing something fundamental to the works, resulting in completely different stories, characters, themes, etc, which makes the film succeed or fail on its own merit. See Gawain and the Green Knight, vs Mary Poppins.

wvy7sv,"Comparing books to their other representations or reimagining in other media to me is kind of like comparing apples to oranges.  They aren't the same thing and as such, they cannot be judged on the same criteria.  The subject matter may be identical but the media in which it is being presented is wholly unique unto itself and warrants a completely different approach to presenting the material than is required in black and white text with (occasional) 2D illustrations.  We should not be judging film or tv book adaptations based upon how perfectly they are able to mimic the writing, but rather by how the acting was done, how the characters were presented, whether or not we enjoyed the audio, the background of the world, the music, the cinematography, and the story-telling.  Some film and tv adaptations of literature is just not that good, but others are amazing!  (Like you said with The Shining, The Princess Bride, and Jurassic Park)  An example of this is that my favorite book of all time is the Odyssey.  It has been written and rewritten dozens if not hundreds of times and reimagined in film and tv also dozens if not hundreds of times.  Some of the book adaptations are hot garbage and so are the films, but some of the book rewrites are deep and emotional and engaging as are some of their film and tv counterparts.

No one can deny that the movie The Shining was extremely entertaining to the point that most of us can instantly identify even the teeniest portion of a scene as having come from that movie. But we have to admit that the movie was so entertaining because it was more sensationalistic. It that sense, it really delivered. But the movie dropped any bit of nuance relating to Jack & his inner demons, all of which was explored in the book. That brings us back full circle to which was better -- a movie that dazzled with good actors and effective scare effects, or a book which also delivered in the scare department, but spent a lot of time with back story & psychological detail on the main character.",BixaorellanaIsDot,2022-08-24T02:25:19Z,The Shining,COMMENT

5h1hik,"As a ""constant reader"" of King who is otherwise completely unqualified to assess the quality of literary works, I believe there are basically 3 eras of King literature. 

The Early Years (early and mid seventies) where King was a hungry young author trying to catch a break. This era is best represented by *The Shining*. His stories in this period were new, shocking, and visceral, but perhaps a bit unpolished. 

The Cocaine Years (late seventies to late eighties) where King was a serious alcoholic and drug addict at the height of his powers. Everything he wrote in this era is absolute dynamite IMHO, but if I had to pick one to be the defining work of this period, it would be *The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger* 

The Serious Years (early nineties to present) where King becomes conscious of his role in literature and begins to produce more sophisticated, cerebral, and subtle works. And while no less dark and horrifying, something is missing when I compare it to his work in the 80's. I can't put my finger on it, but I know it is there. None of his work in this period is bad, but nothing in this era has left me breathless like *The Stand* or *It*.

*The Stand* was what I would consider his first book from the cocaine years. He still had all the passion of the hungry young artist, but had really hit his stride. It was a story told many times, but he told it best. I read it 20 years ago, and I can still name virtually every character and recount the plot.  ",chad303,2016-12-08T02:20:26Z,The Shining,COMMENT

So after reading it, I branched out to The Shining because I'd always liked the film. That was an incredibly intense read, too.

The troubles of addiction and the trauma it causes seeps through the generations.  The Overlook hotel can be seen in the larger sense as the psychopathic society that we live in - racist, addicted, loaded with unmet or unrepentant horrors to the native americans, blacks who were enslaved and so on...Jack comes to the Overlook in recovery from his alcohol addiction - in abstaining from drinking - but the psychopathic hotel pulls him into drinking...The Shining in this sense is our very under utilized, somewhat washed out abilities to be prescient, to have gut feelings, to ""know"" the future, to relate to others in non-verbals or without words...In order to access this ""talent"" we must turn off the TV - and involve ourselves in creative processes - open up our right brain which our psychopathic society severely undervalues - especially in school and early development....To me these are some of the messages that I glean from the book - less so the movie...If you look at the comments you made - my frame can be superimposed and seen as a way Jack is slipping into the demon of drink...The movie is Kubrik's so its loaded with his statements and artistic impressions.",,2015-01-26T03:17:44Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I think his sympathy for Jack in *The Shining* is what makes that novel so disturbing and troubling and beautiful. In many of his other works, the writer is a hero, but in that he explores what happens when evil wins. 

The other thing that he hints at here, but explores further when he writes as Bachman, is that oftentimes the dark, terrible ending is the truer one and the better one.

shlv5,"Honestly, of all the Stephen King movies that have been made, I'd have to say that The Shining is, IMHO, one of the best. 

You are correct, in that it differs quite a bit from the book, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing; King tells his stories from a perspective really tied to a character and the way they think, their mood, and what is going through their heads, all of which can be REALLY difficult to portray in film, where it can be difficult to convey a narrative of the characters thoughts.

I think Kubrick knew this, and instead of trying to (potentially poorly) portray the book exactly as it was, he left out some of elements that are more suited for literature (much of the actual ""shining"" Danny has, a lot of the internal struggle Jack has etc.) and instead used techniques that build the same feel and atmosphere of the book through film; things like long slow shots, use of steady cam, and interesting angles (all things that don't apply to literature).

Personally, I *love* King, and the way he writes, but sometimes some of his best written material makes for REALLY poor movies (the ending of the It miniseries comes to mind).",NickGe,2012-04-19T14:17:45Z,The Shining,COMMENT

2tn7gv,"In order to get the big picture, watch the documentary about The Shining, Room 237.  Kubrick only used the novel as a vehicle for his own artistic themes, as he did with all his movies. He bought the rights to all the books and then proceeded to gut them and maintain plot points only as a way of threading his own narrative.  If you watch The Shining with this in mind, you start to not only see differences, but you start to realize it's not even a horror story in the traditional sense.  It is a story about the past.  Not just any past.  The Past.  How the past impinges on the present.  How it is only those that ""shine""  who can navigate their way through history's labyrinth and release themselves from The Overlook.  There are many, many themes interwoven into the story:  native American genocide (those Calumet cans, Jack throwing the tennis ball ritualistically against the wall mimicking the call of Native spirits), the holocaust (that Nazi typewriter, black and white outdoor scenes with snow falling like ashes from the Nazi crematoriums), the moon landing question (room 237, have to watch the movie for this one), the manager's office where Jack is interviewed for the job showered with sunlight in a room completely enclosed by the hotel, the tv Wendy and Danny are watching doesn't have a power cord, dozens of things that are ""off"" when everyone knows Kubrick was an absolute perfectionist who never made accidental continuity errors. There are literally thousands of things you will notice.  And that is the point, he is creating art conveyed through countless subliminal devices.  Read Mastermind's critique of the movie on the net for the best source of interpretations.  It is exacting and exhausting.   One more thing:  Stephen King did hate the movie because it was his brainchild and he totally missed what Kubrick was doing.  He was essentially banned from any participation after he initially was consulted and objected vociferously to Kubrick having the audacity to change the VW going up the mountain (that's the Going to the Sun road in Montana) from red to yellow.  Kubrick delivered a not so subtle message to King later in the movie.  Remember when the cook is returning to the hotel in that snow blizzard and he passes an accident?  A semi has completely smashed a vehicle.  Guess what it is?  A red VW. That was Kubrick letting King directly know what he thought of his novel.

26qqbz,"Just my opinion, but as far as I understand, both the novel and the film of 2001 were created and released at the same time, and designed to be enjoyed at the same time. So I think it doesn't really matter which order you consume those in, so long as they're both done reasonably close to each other. The book and the film are a package-deal, and they both offer different things to the same story. The book is a little more detailed, but the film has undeniably impressive visuals. I'd see the film first, then read the book immediately after.

However with The Shining, I'd personally recommend reading the book first. Even though the adaptation is okay, (like nearly all film adaptations) it's nowhere near as good as the book. It's not as chilling, as gripping, or as detailed. I also recommend reading the book first for a personal reason - the novel of The Shining contains the one and only scene in a book that scared the hell out of me so much that it made me go turn the lights on. I value the book immensely for being the only book I've ever read to invoke such a reaction in me. It was flawlessly written. I won't tell you what it is, but said scene is absent from the film. I kind of hope that when you read it you'll find the same scene and have the same reaction, and you'll get to realise what a fantastic horror the novel of The Shining is before your perception is ruined by the (in my opinion) inferior film version.

Oh and if you do read The Shining first, the first chapter is horribly boring. Just keep reading. It gets better.",DustnFluff,2014-05-29T01:05:01Z,The Shining,COMMENT

I love how some other authors try to be edgy and do some psycho shit in a weak attempt to scare us. Stephen King shows that real fear comes from you being scared along with the characters, whom you get to know so well.",Interleukine-2,2014-11-11T21:36:48Z,The Shining,COMMENT

hundreds? oh wow. did the free zone section get bigger? was the harold/nadine story line the same as in the original? what was the original ending? 

i really need to read the original now. 

I liked the kid, i mean as a fictional character obviously, not somebody i want to meet like ever. liked even better what ultimately happened to him, it was so satisfying. king is so good at writing bullies that it can be triggering sometimes (had to DNF The Shining cuz it was too much). but the kid was so ridiculous and over the top that i just could not be triggered by him.

16ygwf3,"Yes, more technical people ended up in Las Vegas.  I think that was a part of the commentary on complexity of good and evil.  I think we were supposed to get the idea that Flagg was using technology to attract certain people.  Las Vegas was up and running quicker than Boulder.  I doubt all those were ""bad"" people, they just were attracted to the order and amenities offered by Flagg.

Flagg didn't want the Kid, because he offered nothing and the Trashcan Man was the important one.  So wolves got him.  Flagg didn't want Harold, because he had already gotten what he needed from him and Nadine was the important one.

Nick chose Tom when he left Julie in the town, he didn't like when she convinced Tom not to take the medicine, it was a part of him realizing her immaturity.  

I'm sure there are more examples of abusive, mean main characters that King wrote, but one I can think of is Jack Torrance from ""The Shining"".   There may be moments were I could sympathize with him, and it's obvious that the Hotel has an affect on his behavior, he does some horrible things.

I don't like that you're taking such a beating with the downvotes, I applaud you for trying to make sense of things like this.  Even though Harold is one of my least favorite characters, I think King does a good job of showing you the moments where he could have turned away from Flagg, and could have grown as a character.  Harold isn't black and white, his life improves in Boulder but he still wants what Flagg promises.",cephalopod_surprise,2023-10-04T04:19:26Z,The Shining,COMMENT
16ygwf3,"dana and tom both liked the people in las vegas, and up until dana was exposed, the people of vegas seemed to like them too. tom was readily accepted as part of the community there despite being a supposed exile from the free zone. 

on the flip side of the coin, the free zone had its share of malcontents and troublemakers. so it's not clear to me what determined which dream one got, vegas or boulder.

""I'm sure there are more examples of abusive, mean main characters that King wrote, but one I can think of is Jack Torrance from ""The Shining"".""

larry ranting and physically assaulting rita over an innocent mistake over shoes reminds me of scenes from the movie where jack is terrorizing/abusing the shelley duvall character. i didn't mention it though because i didn't actually read that book (too scary) so I didn't think it would be fair. 

and so here's the thing i'm having a mental block with if you will. in the shining, jack was no hero. he was a terrifying monster. a monster with a sad backstory, but as far as his wife and the viewer was concerned, a monster no less. 

and yet in the stand, larry has his crazy/abusive moment with rita, and then does a complete 180 to be the savior hero. It is hard to swallow. 

for the record, i actually went back to review the shoe episode because all the push back got me wondering if i had somehow misremembered or exaggerated larry's behavior. and it turned out to be actually worse than i thought because he not only cursed her out, he also physically assaulted her. 

i'm okay with down votes. i think there's a fundamental disagreement between myself and this sub over the severity of how larry treated rita, and the role he played in her death. rita died a miserable disrespectful death largely because of larry, and imo, she would have been better off without him.",quantcompandthings,2023-10-04T20:42:54Z,The Shining,COMMENT

joxygl,"I think you're mistaking your experience for something more universal. For most of King's career, *The Stand* has been one of the novels most synonymous with his name, perhaps 2nd only to *The Shining*. 

For example, you compare it unfavorably in terms of zeitgeist to *Pet Semetary*, likely because of the recent *Semetary* reboot. But the 90s *Stand* mini was a ratings smash, while *Semetary* had middling reception. Nielsen reports are just shy of 20 million households watching *The Stand* in its original broadcast. Sales numbers for King books are hard to find, but Wikipedia's article on *The Stand* suggests it has sold more than 4.5 million copies.

joxygl,I’m rereading it now in anticipation of the new mini series.

joxygl,"Right- I'm just speaking from my experience and posted this to see if people have had other experiences or views, which they do. Usually the people I see who are aware of or have even read King haven't touched ""The Stand.""  


I know that at the time the miniseries broke records and was well received, but my point is, where is it now? The book is getting a new adaptation and hopefully that gets good buzz, but I don't think the original miniseries can really be dubbed as culturally lasting.   


You're also right that finding numbers are tricky, but I would guess that ""Pet Semetary"" and ""It"" are close. I could be wrong, but those are my guesses. I think it's possible those two books (and ""The Shining"") have also sold more copies but necessarily been read- owing largely to movie fans buying the books and then not always reading them. Those are kind of the metrics I was measuring against, as you said, since I hoped they would seem a bit more universal than just my observations.

It’s a very relevant book with some really strong characters and there’s a whole chapter early on where king describes the virus transferring person to person, which tbh should be required reading right now.

joxygl,"This. I've read The Stand. I'm not sure where it falls in my favorite books, I might reread it now, might not. King is extremely famous in the US too. I think you be hard pressed to find a bookstore that doesn't place a new release of his on a table in the front of the building. There is almost no reason to recommend it (unless you really want to read it in the midst of a pandemic). It's also a big book. I don't want to recommend such a large book to a friend most times.

That said, I'm not a horror fan. At all. I've watched the Shining. I think I've watched a few of his other movies, but never went searching. It's just not my cup of tea. I think there are plenty of people like me that have searched his name though, and The Stand is going to be near the top of the list 90% of the time. I enjoyed 11/23/63 and Under the Dome quite a lot, though my favorite book of his is The Gunslinger. I'm a sci fi and fantasy reader. 

A lot of the books I've read also seem to fall flat. I think OP wants book clubs, college professors, high school teachers to use King. The Stand is almost too long of a book to dissect and the other books I've read....well....they just end. His writing may be fantastic, but sometimes the full story leaves something to be desided. The Gunslinger is one of my favorite books, but I wish I hadn't touched the rest of the series. 

King is a fantastic author, but I don't think his books are great for literary analysis, atleast not in their full form.",,2020-11-06T06:16:55Z,The Shining,COMMENT

With that said, I'll also out myself and confess that King is probably my favorite author. However, that doesn't mean I don't know when he's writing hot garbage, which is a lot of the time. I will also say that I've read a LOT of non King books, so I do have a bit of reference.

 I appreciate you giving him credit, whereas a lot of people don't. And, honestly, if you wanted to have a long talk about King's literary shortcuts and failings, I'm totally game. In the Stephen King sub I'm in, criticizing him at all is met with either no feedback or people who disagree- it's hard to really dig in and get to why he fails. Your view on him is one of the more unique/interesting I've come across, as most who dislike him disparage him relentlessly. 

Do you think any of his other books like ""Gerald's Game"" or ""The Shining"" hold merit, or ""The Green Mile"" or ""Shawshank?""

I think it has that standing in some respects but not universally. Again, comparing it to ""The Shining"" or something it isn't widely recognized, even considering the miniseries and its comic adaptations. 

If you disagree that's totally ok and I wouldn't say you're wrong, I think we're just measuring its ""success"" in different ways.",UnusualRonaldo,2020-11-06T19:25:45Z,The Shining,COMMENT
joxygl,">My point is that I don't think ""The Stand"" is one of King's ""most well known books"" to the general public. Others have pointed out King's readership IS the general public, and I sort of agree, but that's mostly irrelevant here and kind of a different topic. It seems like we're discussing different groups of who this book is well known to. It will usually be listed in top ten best SK lists and such, sure, but the book (specifically, the characters/figures in it) are not cultural icons. There is no collective memory surrounding this book for the general public or movie going audience or most casual readers, though a few people have disagreed with me and pointed to completely valid counter examples.

What exactly are you basing this on? The book has more than 600k ratings on Goodreads, which is an obscene amount - and is actually the second most rated King book on that website after The Shining. Goodreads is pretty representative of the general public.

The 80s miniseries was also extremely popular, and there's another miniseries coming out soon. It came in at #53 on BBC's The Big Read poll, which counted almost a million votes from general readers in the UK to see the nation's most loved books. It actually came in *above* other King novels like It and The Green Mile.

You can make a case that It and The Shining are slightly more popular - they did have very well-known movies - but calling The Stand underrated, having no collective memory of it etc. is false.",fabrar,2020-11-06T22:03:36Z,The Shining,COMMENT
joxygl,"Sure, I can see how that would factor in on a few levels. Usually if the general public reads something, they'll try something like King. I mentioned that in a comment somewhere, owing it mostly to his adaptations and movie tie in re releases. But within that group I would still posit that books those people are reading are things like ""It"" or ""The Shining,"" which are more well known (at least, obviously, that I view as well known) compared to ""The Stand,"" which, my original point being, has not broken through on quite the same level, despite being popular among his fans and horror fans and avid readers.

Yeah, that's a common complaint. I don't mind Lovecraft's prose personally, but it can take some getting used to. Once you do get used to it it really helps to build the creepy, oppressive atmosphere. Lovecraft was the guy who took horro and dragged it into the atomic age, giving it a cosmic, almost sci-fi bent. He seemed to realize that dialogue wasn't his forte, so he opted for large blocks of descriptive prose. 

The first Lovecraft I read was a ""best of"" type of collection, I forget the title, but it had most of his famous stories: The Call of Cthulhu, The Rats in the Walls, The Colour out of Space, The Dunwich Horror, and a bunch of others. There's a large hardcover edition of his works, complete with annotations, that I've seen in the local bookstores.

5nrg60,"Had a feeling is was coming soon, surprised he lived through 2016. One of the very best authors who ever lived. His work was just as funny as it was chilling, as witty as it was emotional, and as grounded as it was full of fantasy.

If you've never read Blatty, do yourself a favor and ready every single word the man wrote, for starters. He is astonishingly good. As good as any other author who ever wrote.

If you've never read The Exorcist, start there. The first thing that is going to surprise you is how funny and full of empathy it is. Absolutely nothing like the movie. Then it becomes chilling and haunting, but never loses it's human touch.

After that, ready the next part of his trilogy of faith, The Ninth Configuration. A work of Christian Apologetics disguised as a theological comedy-mystery. His crowning achievement as an author.

Then read Crazy, a ghost story dripping in nostalgia. Then move onto the final book in the trilogy of faith, Legion, and you'll recognize that this trilogy might just be the best trilogy ever written.

After that, check out Demon's Five, Exorcists Nothing, a satirical look at the making of the Exorcist and Blatty's experiences in the industry.

Then maybe take a side trip and watch A Shot in the Dark, the best of the original Pink Panther movies that Blatty wrote. Incredible.

Blatty's prose in The Exorcist is striking. His prose in Legion is very navel-gazey and just uninteresting. There's no immediate threat for Kinderman to directly confront, no Regan-type whose life hangs in the balance of the story.

It still had quite a bit of shock factor even though I had seen the movie before.

It does *not* shy away from being absolutely brutal to Regan. I'm not a parent myself and have no particular bond with children but I felt so awful for her throughout the story and wanted her to get out of the situation she was in so badly. I lost sleep over a book for the first time in maybe a decade after reading Regan's contortion act on the stairs right before I went to bed.

Not that it makes it bad, but it definitely takes away from the horror. 

For example, the exorcist is actually a crime/ thriller novel. And I was okay with that, I'm fine with books having other agendas but the way it comes across in Rosemary's baby just seems to be utter stupidity. 

I won't spoil it for you if you wish to read it but:
They make it out that she has no say in anything, but she genuinely does, and would notice if she actually paid attention.

""It's strange you see it as misogynistic to say it was a female author.""

female authors can be misogynist and sexist as well, imo. 

theo and ellen might as well be 2 boarding school girls fighting over the boy, who's worse than useless. also, I guess i'm just tired of stories where the woman dies at the end because the man chose the other girl. 

in her short stories, Jackson seems to really have her knife out for women who chose career over family. they are portrayed as miserable, pitiful, vile, conniving and in denial about their lives. Her married women are downtrodden or stupid, but I feel there's less malice in those characters than the single ones.


I feel like Jackson didn't see much possibility for women. Her portrayals of little girls (and children in general) are positive and enchanting, but like zero positive adult characters. Maybe she just hated adults in general.

Interesting to read that about Rosemary's Baby. I've always just assumed it's a run of the mill I'm-prego-with-the-devil's baby story. it'll probably go on my list right behind the Exorcist (which I can't really recommend because this'll be the third time I'll be trying to get past the first fifty pages lol).

b6dito,"""I thought it was implied that Theo was a lesbian? And merely got Luke onto her side just to spite Eleanor. ""

hmm, that's an interesting reading of it. it would certainly change my thinking on Jackson if theo were lesbian. I might need to read the book again.

as it is, i'm quite pessimistic about Jackson, and from having read her short stories, I have a difficult time imagining her writing a lesbian character as socially acceptable and physically attractive as Theo lol. Of all that I read by Jackson, Theo's probably the least negative of her female characters.

I liked Theo as the story began. It seemed as though she really cared about Eleanor, trying to bring her out of her shell so to speak. But towards the latter half of the book, it seemed that Theo thought Eleanor was a nuisance, and suddenly seemed to consider her competition for attention. I didn't really understand why the sudden change... Unless it was that Theo never had much feelings for Eleanor to begin with, and was simply nice/warm/friendly to her at first because Theo is an extrovert who's like that with everyone. And when Eleanor got attached to her, Theo became annoyed and tried to throw her off. As much as I disliked Theo at the end, I can certainly understand why she wouldn't want a neurotic like Eleanor to come home with her, lesbian or not lol. 

""Is it that she writes them that way so the story will work?""

do you mean Jackson? i'm not sure why her characters are so vile. it seems to me like she was obsessed with horrible women to the exclusion of all other types of women.

""I can recommend the exorcist.""

Awesome! This gives me motivation to power through. I thought the writing was weird, and was very put off by it. I don't remember how much help Chris had around the house, but I thought she was working on a movie? I don't think I read far enough to know what kind of company she keeps lol.

b6dito,"As I said, I think it was just bad writing, she needed to further the story to make Eleanor the way she is, and rather than go back to add little subtleties in, she just made the characters do a 180 in terms of their attitude towards her. 

I thought she was a lesbian in the way it's said that she has a ""companion"" at home. It might say friend once or twice but I'm sure it used the word companion more. Maybe Jackson couldn't bring herself to actually say lesbian?

And what you may think as socially acceptable and attractive might be different to Jackson. I can see Theo as that, but also her trying to be something more than what she is, putting on airs as it were, if that's the right saying, and being generally obnoxious/ over the top. 

As for the exorcist, just stick with it. Get past the drag of the first part, and as soon as the plot starts to pick up, it picks up fast into a cascade of events happening. But yeah, the mother is not likeable at all. I won't spoil it, but she's an actress, finishes a movie and then gives up a job to direct a film to look after her kid. But in the entirety of a book, she reads a film script maybe twice. And talks about films maybe three times, there's also an astronaut at a dinner party. Didn't get that bit either.  Sounds like the start of a bad joke. An actor, a politician and an astronaut are talking at a dinner party...
