17q9ttb,Peeta Mellark and the Hunger Games,"I was in middle school during the peak Hunger Games craze. I loved them and my little middle school heart was so in love with Peeta. I recently reread the books to fully appreciate The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. During this read I realized I still, over a decade later, have a book crush on Peeta. I hadn't had this happen reading a YA book in years and it got me really examining the character. And then it dawned on me - - Peeta is a truly flawless character. He's selfless, entirely. He has the patience of a saint. He's smart and kind and always chooses the moral path. He's handsome and strong. I cannot think of a single character flaw. He's unrealistic. And I'll accept it because I like that Peeta exists, if only in a book üòÇ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/17q9ttb/peeta_mellark_and_the_hunger_games/,2023-11-08T01:03:29Z,114,589,books,The Hunger Games,POST

13x4ss0,"Reread ""The Hunger Games"" and it really impressed me","As the title says, I was rereading The Hunger Games on a whim and was really struck by how nuanced it is. The dystopian commentary feels pretty interesting, the farcical nature of the Capitol is really well realized, and the idea of constant surveillance was explored impressively. The juxtaposition between the barbarism of the Games and the entertainment/drama the spectators get from it is a really complex dynamic for YA fiction, and I think Katniss appealing to sponsors while also trying to survive was really compelling.

Also, I really liked that the romance aspect of the book was intrinsically tied to the nature of the constant surveillance and necessity for presentation. While I don't have a problem with teen romance, it's often a somewhat shallow topic by nature, and the book did a fantastic job of really deepening the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. The way they 'take turns' strategizing about how best to use their love as a tool to win support while the other is in the dark, the way it juxtaposes with their true feelings, and the contrast between the intensity of the Games and the knowledge that they're constantly being watched all are extremely well-executed and impressive concepts for a YA book.

Overall, I think this book does a fantastic job of melding traditional YA themes with complex dystopian concepts. The reread really made me appreciate the depth that the book offers, and I came away feeling like the book absolutely deserved to have the appreciation and impact that it received. Anyone else feel like the series is miles ahead of other YA dystopian novels in its exploration of deeper themes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/13x4ss0/reread_the_hunger_games_and_it_really_impressed_me/,2023-06-01T01:41:55Z,187,893,books,The Hunger Games,POST
14ozjzl,Thoughts on The Hunger Games Trilogy as a whole?,"I read the books for the first time and finished Mockingjay today. I know the series was popular, but I'm not sure how acclaimed it was here. I enjoyed the books and found them to be very well-written for a YA series. Katniss's grief and trauma, especially for her sister Prim, was thoroughly explored and it was never dismissed which I think is refreshing to see in the YA Dystopia genre. I liked how they displayed that Katniss was always a pawn in the war, and even before that- the moment she joined the Hunger Games- she never really had a choice. I also loved Gale, Finnick and Johanna's characters in particular. Each of them showed different ways of dealing with their anger and frustrations, and the ending gave a nice climax to each character (even with Gale & Katniss's- I felt overall, their disagreements on certain things became too much of a strain on their relationship, and the bomb was just the final blow ) and it feels appropriate to how they would deal with the aftermaths of the war.

However, I felt there were some flaws with the series as well. I liked the action in the first two books with the hunger games, but for the third book, it was almost a little bland. I enjoyed Peeta and Katniss's relationship, but in terms of Peeta himself he was rather..simple? He was just too perfect and didn't actually contain any flaws. I also hated how they killed off Finnick. Whereas for the other deaths I could kind of understand the narrative explanation, but for Finnick, it felt like simply a way to shock the viewer, especially with how happy Annie and Finnick were together. 

So, what are your own thoughts on the series?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14ozjzl/thoughts_on_the_hunger_games_trilogy_as_a_whole/,2023-07-02T21:18:07Z,245,315,books,The Hunger Games,POST

11z9zcj,Appreciating the Hunger Games,"This might seem a little silly, but I‚Äôm a bit frustrated at the reception of the Hunger Games in this subreddit. There‚Äôs so much blind judgement and an unwillingness to critically think due to preconceived notion about the series and stories in general. Yes it‚Äôs YA, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs badly written. It‚Äôs written well for its target audience and it explores themes and ideas, particularly trauma in many different forms and responses, quite well. So many people comment or think about the series like it‚Äôs a romance (I put some blame on. Movie marketing ) or reduce it to some other YA tm trope, but it‚Äôs just not accurate. It‚Äôs not as gory or dark(I have so thoughts about these kinds of descriptions) as other books, but that doesn‚Äôt make it worse. Again, it has a target audience and stories don‚Äôt need to include gore and ‚Äúmature‚Äù (read explicit) concepts to be dark. I don‚Äôt think this is this is the deepest book to ever exist, but there is noticeable and deliberate depth. I really do think this book was made to explore ideas through the world and characters rather than making a world or characters first or using the rule of cool. It has so much to offer, but I feel like it‚Äôs been unfairly written off. I‚Äôm saying all of this as someone who doesn‚Äôt really read YA.

z5n97n,Rereading The Hunger Games,"I‚Äôve been rereading THG, the last time I read it having been in middle school not too long after it came out. I‚Äôve rewatched the movies since then but not the books, the further I get into the series the more I realize: there was never really a love triangle at all.

I say this because it quickly becomes apparent towards the end of the hunger games that Katniss has feelings for Peeta and only feels platonically for Gale. She makes comments in Catching Fire about how people might‚Äôve thought her and Gale to marry someday, whether she thought about it or not.. I think the feelings we read that people view as love are platonic love mixed with feeling like she SHOULD love Gale. She‚Äôs under tons of pressure at all times, she feels unloveable to Peeta- so she cuts him off.

It‚Äôs just funny returning to a book series from an older point of view and realizing how Katniss‚Äôs feelings were a lot more complicated.

18s5vcl,I‚Äôm sort of rereading The Hunger Games series and I‚Äôm completely hooked.,"I say ‚Äúsort of rereading‚Äù because I read them in middle school (I‚Äôm in my early twenties now) but I don‚Äôt feel like I really absorbed them. Now I‚Äôm reading them for the first time with fully open ears and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away by the brilliance of this series. I just finished Catching Fire and am almost hesitant to start Mockingjay because I want to prolong the experience‚Ä¶ always a good sign, that a book or series is really meaningful to a reader. 

For one, I love Katniss. I remember not liking her too much when I was younger, maybe because my dad also read the series and he didn‚Äôt much like her narration, and he probably rubbed off on me. But now I‚Äôm definitely fond of her. She‚Äôs stubborn, snarky, grumpy, irritable, and socially somewhat clueless, but also has an incredibly resilient spirit and quiet strength, and man, I just want to be friends with her. She also seems so young, as she should seem to the reader. I think the older you are reading the series, the clearer her youth is. Which just makes it all harder to stomach. Overall, Collins did an amazing job building her character. 

Which leads me to the other characters ‚Äî I love each and every one of them (almost), especially Peeta, Haymitch, Effie, Finnick, and Johanna. Even President Snow is a great character in his own right, which makes me excited to read the prequel later. I‚Äôm not too fond of Gale or Prim, just because they feel so underdeveloped (especially Prim), but since they are part of this world that I‚Äôm so strongly attached to now, I like them in my own way, too.

189rnkf,Reading Journey: The Hunger Games Chapters 1&2 - Initial Thoughts,"What's up everyone! I hope you're all having a fantastic day. (SORRY FOR THE VERY LONG MESSAGE!!!)

So, I started reading Hunger Games just two days ago. For some reasons, I can only manage to read/listen one chapter a day, which I do every night before sleep. I made a post here in this subreddit a while back!

Anyways, I don't know why, but I really want to share this with someone, and these are the notes I took from ch.1&2 as I found them interesting and might have some questions/observations!



***Notes from Chapter 1:***

**1. ‚ÄúMy father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run.‚Äù**

It's tragic, and I feel for her. Interesting to know that happened to her! I believe this is where the fun begins.

**2. ‚ÄúDistrict Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,‚Äù**

Why does this series remind me so much of Final Fantasy VII?!

**3. ‚ÄúI try to forgive her for my father‚Äôs sake. But to be honest, I‚Äôm not the forgiving type.‚Äù**

Wait, what happened? What did the mom do? It doesn't explain in it but maybe later on?

**4. ‚ÄúMeat is meat. ‚ÄúOnce it‚Äôs in the soup, I‚Äôll call it beef,‚Äù**

As someone who loves cooking, this is a masterpiece!!

**5. ‚ÄúYou become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven times. That‚Äôs true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem.‚Äù**

I forgot the author's name, but damn, she's a great writer and a intellectual one!

**6. ‚ÄúIt is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,‚Äù intones the mayor. Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventyfour years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He‚Äôs drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he‚Äôs confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off.‚Äù‚Äù**

This guy Haymitch saw some things in his time, and now I guess he acts like this, but most importantly, only 2 won the Hunger Games from the 12th after 74 years? Who's the first one? I don't know why, but that's bugging me, and I hope it's explained in the future!




**Notes from Chapter 2:**

**7. Then something unexpected happens. At least, I don‚Äôt expect it because I don‚Äôt think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prim‚Äôs place, and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love. Now I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me.**

Only in Chapter 2 and the Writing Amazed me! The 3 fingers thingy and basically Katniss getting recognition or loved is just great and I have a feeling this won't be the last time I'll be hearing Haymitch name but I may not hear about Gale anymore...



**8. ‚ÄúMore than you!‚Äù he shouts, pointing directly into a camera. Is he addressing the audience, or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol?**

This guy is the GOAT! After what Katniss told about the Capitol and him saying these words are just great! Haha,

**9. ‚ÄúPeeta Mellark.‚Äù**

First time name mentioned just like Effie Trinket and Hunger Games.


**10. I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could well be dead by then. Starvation‚Äôs not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who hasn‚Äôt seen the victims? Older people who can‚Äôt work. Children from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the mines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the Meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the cause of death officially. It‚Äôs always the flu, or exposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one.**

(The More I read this story, the more I get details on how life is in the 12th and how people view/struggle and do their dailys, the more I read the more I want to live there ‚Üê(what a stupid thing to say!) And honestly it's just 2 chapters in)



**11. I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us...**

The more I read, the more details I get on life in the 12th and how people view/struggle and do their daily activities. The more I read, the more I want to live there ‚Üê(what a stupid thing to say!) And honestly, it's just 2 chapters in!

I'm doing a Reading while Listening to the Audiobook, and it's been amazing, and the voice actor is fantastic! Almost sounds like Jennifer Lawrence. The main thing is... I really want to create a story like this... Like now I really want to become an author or a writer and write stories like this! Why???

I may never know!

**12. The first dandelion of the year. And the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed.**

(These dandelions are somehow connected to this story... Maybe I'm thinking too much, but it still feels like it to be true!

End of Chapter 2)

So yeah, sorry for my rant, but I just had to get it out, and man, I wish my exams were this close when I started reading/listening to this book together! I now wonder why I haven't read this until yesterday, but then again, I have only read 3 books, and this will be my fourth!

13l2r6s,Throne of Glass is one of the worst books I‚Äôve ever read,"With the most unrealistic and unbelievable main character I‚Äôve ever encountered. She is an 18 year old assassin who startles at every sound, swoons over the crown prince (who she hated), eats candy to the point her teeth are stained, begs for a puppy, *sasses* everyone she can, and complains when she is woken up too early. 

There is no plot. There is no tension. The worldbuilding is boiler plate European fantasy. The love triangle is saccharine and predictable from the first page. 

What do people see in this book? I understand not every book needs to be *East of Eden*, but even the most egregious YA (*Hunger Games, Harry Potter*) were filled with breakneck pacing or charming creativity. 

Throne of Glass is insipid to the point of secondhand embarrassment. I‚Äôve never been so frustrated reading a fantasy book. Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone.

Edit: The word ‚Äúegregious‚Äù has triggered a lot of people when describing Hunger Games and HP. I only meant it in the sense that both HG and HP lean heavily on the tropes and storytelling conventions of YA genre fiction despite ostensibly having such wide appeal across demographics.

11zv4jv,"The ""Hunger Games"" as classical example of a dystopia","Heres my little rant about the ""Hunger Games"" and their classification as a classic example of  a dystopia. Im apologizing in advance for my english and my, presumably many, grammatical errors. Im an 18-year old student from germany and english is not my strongest subject, so please be kind.

The dystopian aspect of a dystopian novel is entirely dependant on the defeat of the protagonist, because when he doesn't lose, it undermines the power of the government or system over the individual. The whole point of a dystopian novel is to examine a dystopian society, draw parallelles to the current state of society and to recognize them and to abolish them. An important  point is the extermination of people as individuals  and the relationships, between them, like in ""Brave new World"", where ""everyone belongs to anybody"" and where something like a personal relationship, being married or being someones mother, is ostracized by society, or in ""1984"", where the family isn't abolished, but something as an intimate sexual relationship or desire is seen as abnormal and where children get indoctrinatet to spy on their parents and to denounce them to the thought-police. We see these systems as evil, because we have the perspective of an outsider and have another understanding of a functioning and stable society, so we experience it through a protagonist or a narrator. Through this comparison between our understanding of resistance and the actions, considered by the respective government as resisting are so different, that it is a perfect example of the control, that is exercised by the government. Through detailed examples and insights of the narrator, we fundamentally understand, how that system works and how the people are controlled, but especially, how the goverment maintains the power, that it has. When the protagonist forms their ideas and thinks about other cultures, the past, good and evil and all the things, that are wrong in its current situation, the reader relates to them to truly understand, why it is so important to abolish this government. But the protagonist loses every time, because they are destined to. A truly dystopian society can't be destabilized, because it was designed to remain and to maintain their stability, even when an individual may break out, he gets brainwashed or exiled to be reintegrated in society and to not be an indivual, but to be one of a system, that doesnt care about the individual, but remains their social structure as a machine, in which every gear is indistinguishable from another. The feeling, that one individual is able to destabilize a system, which entire purpose is to maintain and stabilize itself, is therefore a fallacy in itself and the protagonist adds, through their loss, another feeling, that is more important, than the fallacy itself. The protagonist is helpless and has to life in these system, not regarding their efforts. The whole requierment to get active and to prohibit these future is, not entirely, but remaining as an important part of it, the necessity to do something now, or either way it won't be possible to prevent that dystopian future from happening. The possibility of not being able to do something, to not even think anything other than what we are told to think, entirely made possible by a reflecting and memorizing reader is more terrifying than anything else, every physical torture, because we weren't in a similiar place, but the thought of our individuality being stripped away from us is terrifying, because we have been shown the difference. 

""The Hunger Games"", considered a good dystopia, therefore completely fails the point of a dystopian society. The indivual is free to think and the loss of the capitol, even in the first book by not letting Peeta and Katniss kill themselves with the berries. I understand, that it was a necessity to let them live to have a winner, but the argument still stands, that not just by thinking about action, but also attempting to act and to not be mercilessly stopped by the capitol undermines their authority and power and therefore completely the attempt to create that feeling of necessity to act by helplessness. One might say, that the violence of the capitol is enough to control them, but as seen in the books, the violence and poverty of the people only leads to a revolution and they have to be indoctrinated, because the districts are part of the capitol, not as the same social class or geographically, by supplying them with necessary goods to live. To be part of the economic part of society, they need to love the society so much, that they work for others unconditionally and that they are happy with it, like the lower cats in ""Brave New World"". I still think, that they are good YA-books and that their success is not unrightfully attained, they are still not my favourite book, but, as we read it in school this year in english, I think it should be replacedas the example of a dystopian novel by something like ""Animal Farm"", which is shorter to read, which boosts motivation,and focusses more on the dystopian part of the book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11zv4jv/the_hunger_games_as_classical_example_of_a/,2023-03-23T19:48:32Z,8,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST
kj2ey8,"Is the Hunger Games valuable literature, or tropey YA fiction?","TITLE SHOULD REALLY BE: Does the hunger games have value beyond its entertainment value?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I feel like a lot of people lump the Hunger Games in with lots of other YA dystopian fiction (especially divergent), saying it's shallow and tropey and cliche, and reading comparisons of THG and Divergent online has made me so frustrated with how little of the merit of the Hunger Games series people seem to recognise. I just finished the hunger games for the 4th time. I am an 18 year-old privileged American girl, and I read the book for the first time when I was 11/12ish. Everytime i read these book I am newly blown away by how good they are. this time the writing seemed a bit more juvenile than I remember, but the way the themes develop in the last two books made me fall in love with these books all over again. I'd love to hear why you love the Hunger Game to make me stop feeling frustrated with humanity's ability to understand literature the way I understand it (hahahahahah), but I'd also love to hear rebuttals, why do you totally disagree with me? is Divergent better than Hunger Games? Is Hunger games shallow and stupid?

Here is what i love about the Hunger Games:

* its meta - its about the way privileged people respond to a horrible game. that's what draws real readers in, this horrible game, but that's not what the series is about. Its about media, its about revolution, its about how entertainment makes us content (panem et circuses). By being meta -showing the characters fabricating the story, we can recognise ourselves as the capitol and understand the way real media distorts our view of the world and stops us from interfering with injustice. it also shows the capital (and us) as real people who do deserve happiness, but not as people that have no culpability for our complacency.
* in connection to the point above, some people complain about the second two books. They arent exciting enough, etc. I think that the first book was just to draw people in and set up the story. The second two books ARE the story. Maybe the reason that Hunger Games is seen as a stupid YA book is the first book, and many people who want a shallow dystopian ya book love the first book but dislike the second two and the people who would enjoy the second two write off the whole series as shallow YA
* the love triangle- I don't like romance. It's fine every once in awhile, but so many books make it the most important thing. Katniss is CLEARLY against a relationship. she does not want kids. she does not want a boyfriend. She is so much more relatable (to me) than 99% of other female leads. This whole stupid love triangle that is hated on by so many is a very realistic outcome from being the center of the media's attention. She is victim to the media. She is victim to other self-centered teenagers who DO want a relationship and dont understand that she doesn't. She is indecisive. I've seen this as portrayed as a negative quality, but I think this makes Katniss that much more of a well rounded and realistic teenager in her circumstances. No teenager knows what they want. Not all teenagers want a relationship at all, and it especially makes sense seeing what katniss has been through. This is not a subplot with no importance, this love triangle is not about katniss it is about media and heteronormativity (not that they mention LGBTQ stuff, but just that they expect her to want and be in a relationship with a man with no other option). By mockingjay, it is kind of about what katniss wants, but it is still used to discuss other things. Here it is about just war and all that. I do dislike the epilogue, that puts too much emphasis on the love triangle and >!Katniss as a mother for my taste!<, but the majority of the love triangle is done well I think.
* its so realistic and relevant. This could be our world. This IS our world. These books arent ""oooooo, what crazy circumstances can we put teenagers in to get other teenagers to want to read?!?!"" its, ""wow, lets put a twist on our world and show readers how horrible it is outside their little ""panem et circuses"" bubbles"" The Capitol is just a little bit more exaggerated than middle class america. the hunger Games themselves are just a little bit more exaggerated than real life entertainment and war(I'll get to this later). The problems in the world seem to be exactly what humanity will face if we all push the earth and each other a little bit more. This world was not created in a vacuum. I see this world today. Even The Giver, which i really enjoyed, seems so far removed from our world that I can't really see how to apply the lessons to today. So many other YA books are basically privileged people rebelling because they ""discover how horrible the world is"" but I don't think that's realistic. it is the underprivileged, the forgotten that need change and make change. the middle class is pacified.
* It shows the way the media interacts with violence and politics. Collins has said that she had the idea while watching TV and seeing reality TV and Iraq war footage. I used to think that she was just like ""lets combine them and make the hunger games!"" and show how americans don't care about human rights. I think this may be part of it, but this read through has made me realize that its much more than that. All the way through the third book Katniss keeps saying ""im still in the game Im still in the game."" When Katniss is in the hunger games she is in a reality tv show that depends on viewers opinions to keep running and to effect the outcome (sponsors, viewers ratings). When Katniss is in real war but still a figure on TV (in propos) she has not left the games because the outcome of the war depends on what the viewers think of the propos. It depends on the opinions people have from viewing media. This is true in real wars today. Wars need support, protests need support, riots need support. its all a big reality TV show, both in the ways war is waged but also in the reactions that people have to it.
* the way it ends with >!katniss killing president coin!< shows how politics is about so much more than policy. Its about power. The hunger games is about power. even in democratic republics, power is what drives the government. I didn't understand this when I first read the series, but I love it now. It is not a simple bad guys being obliterated, now the world is good. Its not ""this government is bad, lets get a new one."" Its ""this government has done horrible things. we don't want this to happen again but knowing humanity, it probably will.""
* its treatment of violent vs nonviolent protest/ just vs ""non-just"" war. I've heard this series accused of being too ""non-violence is the only way"" and too ""violence is the only way."" I do not think that this book in any way is too violent. I think the rebellion is 10000% justified. I also don't think this book comes down too hard against Gales idea of an eye for an eye. I think that this book advocates for thinking about everyone as people. It advocates for owning your actions and doing bad things for a good cause and deciding for yourself whether they are justified. Katniss doesn't ever even decide that gale is wrong. >!she just can't forgive him for killing prim. !<She makes a personal decision, and allows readers to think about what they believe.
* also I just love the characters. peeta and haymitch and katniss and finnick and johanna and coin and cinna and others all feel so realistic to me.

there's probably more that i could say and that i have thought about, but that's it for now. Overall I think this book is a quality piece of children literature. It's not Shakespeare, or Morrison, or Fitzgerald or Faulkner or any other famous artistic adult literature author, but I think it's one of the best children's/YA books written and has a value far beyond most other popular YA books.

TLDR: THG is relevent, realistic and has valuable themes. It has much more value than most other YA books it is compared to. Why do you like the Hunger Games? Why do you dislike the Hunger games? Why do you disagree with me? why do you agree with me?

17vdx4,Am I the only person who dislikes the Hunger Games series and finds it poorly written? ,"I don't want to offend any fans but I'm really wondering because EVERYONE seems to love the Hunger Games and I just...don't get it. I find the series very poorly written. Collins is a good storyteller (first book only) but a bad writer, IMHO. Her writing reads more like a script than a novel.

The first book was quite thrilling but the second book just declined (I mean, Hunger Games again? How creative!) and the third book was a boring mess. Now, I've been combing the internet for negative review for Mockingjay (because I don't want to feel that my opinion is totally crazy) and most people seem to hate if because ""Gale and Katniss don't end up together!"" and it's ""sooo depressing"" and the ""Hunger Games war is more horrible than most wars I've heard about"" (not kidding; an actual quote on goodreads). Off topic, but that quote just reeks of American teenagers who don't really know much about the real world. But I digress.

Personally, I feel Mockingjay is the worst out of the three because the poor writing really shines through there. I don't like ""purple-prose"" but Collins' writing is SO simplified. There's almost no description and information is mostly communicated in rapid sentences spoken one after another. Tons of stuff isn't elaborated on well, at all; for example, when I first read the book I couldn't figure out what happened to Gale. I was never a Gale and Katniss shipper, btw, so Gale's disappearance didn't bother me in any way; it just seemed like bad writing.  

In fact, the whole love triangle really bothered me. Is a love triangle a must for EVERY YA novel these days? Also, Katniss is an annoying character and...well, I just don't know why this book gets so much praise.

Again, if you're a fan of the Hunger Games, I'm not trying to bash you or your opinion. In fact, good for you! You're normal, haha. I'm a weirdo who wants to find some like-minded people. So, anyone out there agree?

11sy2kj,"The Hunger Games REALLY is a rip-off of a Battle Royale, and a bad one at that.","SPOILERS AHEAD!

I've read both, more than once.

People usually dismiss the ""bad rip-off"" theory by saying that the concept of kids killing each other or participating in a death match until only one was left standing is not an original one and was dealt with in novels like Lord of the Flies or The Long Walk and could be traced back to the Minotaur myth. So basically if THG is a ripoff of BR then BR is a ripoff of those literary/fiction pieces.

Problem is, these people conveniently skip over the fact that the similarities between THG and BR don't just stop there. It's not just about the generic concept which indeed isn't new.

Let me recap the plot of the book:

In an alternate history timeline, a dystopian fascist-like government sets out a periodical ""event"" where a group of teenagers (randomly drawn out of a lottery) is kidnapped and brought to a secret location where they are forced to battle against each other until only one is left alive. The reason for this is to instill fear and distrust in the populace and prevent rebellion against the tyrannical government who has been in power for 75 years. The kids are supplied with a random sets of weapon, their position is monitored by the organizers at all times and they are also incentivised to move and bump into each other through various tricks such as making certain areas of the playing fields inaccessible or extremely dangerous. Bets are also placed by external 

The protagonists are a boy and a girl, and one of them acts as the main POV throughout the novel. They are helped out by a previous survivor who has developed intense anger against the government. The secondary protagonist has been secretly in love with the primary protagonist for quite some time, while the primary protagonist is unsure of their feelings towards the secondary protagonist and actually has a bit of a crush on someone else but ultimately develops a sort-of-crush towards the secondary protagonist that never quite fully develops into open love. At one point, the secondary protagonist gets seriously hurt in the leg, which is the basis for a subplot involving the need to find antibiotics quickly. Also the primary protagonist meets another character who helps them in the game and together they devise a method of communicating through fires and bird calls (although this secondary character gets killed soon after). The main antagonists are also a boy and a girl; the girl is described as a bit of a bitch and a slut, while the boy is a sort of invincible war machine that will die last in the game after a long bloody battle. In the end, the protagonists will both survive in a history-first by tricking the rules of the game - however, in doing so they will deeply upset the government and will end up getting tracked down and classified as dangerous rebels.

Now, if I asked you which specific book I'm talking about, would you be able to answer? If not, I hope you'll get my point.

If you still don't, then imagine this - someone like Tarantino or HBO wants to make a high-budget American remake of Battle Royale. Do you seriously believe no one would claim that it is ""just a lazy ripoff of Hunger Games""? Well...duh.

There's even the bit in the BR movie where the whole game is televised and treated as an actual TV show that is broadcast once a year as a punishment against rebellious teens. It's honestly impossible that Suzanne Collins wasn't aware of it when she started writing the book - at the very least, she googled something like ""kids killing kids in a dystopian fantasy"", and BR must have come out at some point. And it wouldn't even have been so bad if she actually owned it, as Takami himself did by acknowledging his inspirations (e.g., Shiroiwa is a literal translation of ""Castle Rock"" which is the fictional mountain where Lord of the Flies takes place). Instead, she tried to stick with this lazy story of how she got inspired by videogames and the Iraq War and how THG was ""more about rebellion than survival"", even though BR deals with rebellion quite a lot and actually in a much more realistic, mature way.

In short: anyone who really believes that Suzanne Collins didn't rip off BR didn't really read the book, or is in denial.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11sy2kj/the_hunger_games_really_is_a_ripoff_of_a_battle/,2023-03-16T15:58:55Z,19,3,books,The Hunger Games,POST
sg6jg9,"There have been no ""mega-hit"" series in the last decade","Hi reddit, first off sorry for the clickbait title-I promise I'm not some asshole trying to judge things. Recently I've been on a nostalgic reading streak and re-reading some books that were really popular when I was younger (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the Hunger Games, etc). Then I realized something-I don't think I've seen any book series that became super sensational in at least the past decade. The last 'recently published sensation' I remember was the Emerald Atlas series, and mayyybe the 50 shades of Grey franchise if we go into more adult books territory. But I'm not sure if I've seen any books, be it a standalone or series, gain THAT much popularity in the later 2010s. Back then I think there were at least one or two books (or authors) that were extremely anticipated, but now I'm lost. I guess my bar is pretty high since my definition of a ""mega-hit"" falls somewhere between Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. Or maybe I'm out of the loop since I don't live in the States anymore. What're some books that have been extremely popular in recent years?

8hm1ei,Why I dislike the Hunger Games series.,"This is something that's been on my mind for years and I wanted to get out. I just want to preface I've got nothing against people who do like the book(Some of those people are my best friends) this is just my personal opinion. Now please note while I have read the first book, I haven't read Catching FIre and Mockingjay just summaries of them so if I get some facts wrong I apologize.

You wanna know why I don't like it? Because nothing good ever happens in the series. Every single moment where human kindness and decency is shown it's stomped out by death after death. I have no reason to care about any of these characters because nothing good happens to them. Especially in Mockingjay where it seems like nothing can go right. And just watching Katniss's life get destroyed and her humanity crushed all is just unpleasant to read about. In my opinion this isn't the story of a girl who rises to the challenge against an oppressive capital after finding herself in an unexpected situation this is the story of a girl who's life is ruined slowly all because she happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and we're forced to watch.

It doesn't help that I'm not a fan of dystopia future fiction. Most of these types of stories always have some sort of element that is destined to make me depressed. Hunger Games is no exception with the constant ""Rich are jerks to the poor"" thing the story has going on. Yeah I think Batman would like a word with the capitol

To make matters INFINITELY worse you know what my main ""berserk button"" as Tv tropes would put it is? Child Cruelty ESPECIALLY kids getting killed. With Hunger Games half of the premise is child cruelty and kids getting murdered. The first book was so rampant on how cruel the games and the people who run it are, it put me in a depression for the whole day. 

So I have a serious question for all you people who DO like Hunger Games. WHy do YOU like it? What do you see in it that I don't? I'm not trying to argue or be a jerk or anything I'm genuinely curious to know why people like this series given how depressing it is.

p4z1e7,I'm amazed how many knock offs of The Hunger Games there are,"I think we can all remember *The Hunger Games* and its many, many rip-offs. Young Adult dystopian novels all about teenagers overthrowing some sort of evil totalitarian government while getting in love triangles. These inundated the market for years, and they still make them sometimes.

If you want to kill an hour, check out the [Dystopian YA Novel](https://twitter.com/DystopianYA) twitter account, it‚Äôs inactive now, but still really funny.

I read a bunch of these when I was younger, and I‚Äôll admit that quarantine made me bored enough to read some more. After spending so much time on these over the years, I‚Äôve decided to compile my thoughts on them all and put them out there for Reddit‚Ä¶ Because clearly, we‚Äôre all in the target audience. 

#Tier 1: Kind of decent to good

- The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins): The inspiration for the entire dystopian YA genre. Popularity doesn‚Äôt always equal quality, but in this case it does. This is a dark, depressing story about what it‚Äôs like for a normal person to live under the thumb of a totalitarian regime and go through a war. There‚Äôs also some intelligent commentary on things like American obsession with violent media and the nature of celebrity worship. Katniss is a solid protagonist who, while she‚Äôs an accomplished archer and does some badass things, never feels like an action hero who could win the war by herself, she‚Äôs just as swept up in world events as everyone else. It‚Äôs a pity most of the copycats only took the aesthetics of this series without understanding what made it work, because this is a very solid read. If you haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet, I‚Äôd recommend checking it out.

- Legend (Marie Lu): This one is, obviously, also about overthrowing an authoritarian regime, but at least it has a twist. This one has two main characters, June, who works for the evil government and Day, who is a famous criminal. Watching June chase down Day and slowly realize that the system she‚Äôs been working for isn‚Äôt worth protecting is satisfying, if a bit predictable, and the way that the evil government gets brought down is more unique than a simple ‚Äúshoot all the bad guys‚Äù story. That said, there‚Äôs a lot of dumb stuff ranging from a character with a ‚Äúbum leg‚Äù still doing parkour like a circus acrobat to the city of Denver being covered by a giant dome. If you‚Äôre a fan of this genre then this one might interest you, if you‚Äôre not it won‚Äôt change your mind.


- Enclave (Ann Aguirre): I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm a sucker for this one since its setup reminds me of *Metro 2033*. Generations after some sort of war destroyed the surface world, a bunch of tribes survive in metro tunnels, fighting off some sort of mutated creatures called Freaks. And due to various issues with nutrition and illness, most everyone in these tribes dies in their early 20‚Äôs, so there‚Äôs an explanation for why teenagers do everything. There‚Äôs not a lot to say about this one, I just enjoyed the action scenes, horror elements, and the main romance. Hardly a literary masterpiece, but a lot of fun.

- The Maze Runner (James Dashner): A bunch of kids with no memory crammed into a maze and they have to find their way out. If that interests you, you should at least check this one out. The storyline is stupid and doesn‚Äôt make much sense, but the characters, action, and fast pace kept me from caring too much. This one feels almost like a prequel to all these other dystopias, where we get to watch the world fall apart in preparation for the evil government to rise. Not a smart series, but I enjoyed it.

#Tier 2: Mediocre to bad

- Matched (Ally Condie): In a world where all marriages are arranged, one brave girl dares to buck the trend and go after he boy she truly loves. If you‚Äôre groaning already, I don‚Äôt blame you. This series does everything you would expect it to based on the premise. The main character whose name I can‚Äôt be bothered to look up has a little personality, which is more than some, but she‚Äôs still defined by her romantic exploits and is still important to the rebellion just because the author says so. The most I can say is that this isn‚Äôt offensively bad in any regard.

- Breathe (Sarah Crossan): In *this* dystopia, everyone lives in a giant domed city because there's no oxygen outside and those inside have to pay for the privilege of breathing. At first, I thought it was refreshing to see a dystopia that was actually commenting on society rather than just saying ""totalitarianism is bad."" That quickly fell apart though. The reasons for the world being oxygen-less are extremely stupid, to put it mildly. It's told in a 1st-person POV from 3 different characters (Bea, Quinn, and Alina), all of whom have identical narration, none of whom are very likable or interesting. Bea in particular was very annoying, she spent the whole 1st book complaining about unrequited love. All the secondary characters are just plot devices that are intended to move things along or make the MC's look cool. It's only in tier 2 because I like the setup so much.

- Article 5 (Kristen Simmons): This one is more ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù than ‚Äúbad,‚Äù though it‚Äôs still bad. Rather than being in a fictional country after a vague apocalypse, it‚Äôs in the United States after a major religious movement has led to a borderline theocratic dictatorship where being a religious minority or a woman means you have no rights. Ember is a girl who gets separated from her mom and brought to a ‚Äúreeducation facility‚Äù to turn her into a proper woman. The first book is about her escaping and trying to meet her mother which, while it has issues, is a focused story that has nothing to do with any sort of generic rebellion, and the worldbuilding has more effort put into it than other crappy dystopias. But then the 2nd and 3rd books fall back into that same overdone storyline, only slightly worse than average. Why is Ember important to the rebellion? Because the author says so, she isn‚Äôt an action hero or a leader or even a propaganda mouthpiece, she‚Äôs just a normal person caught up in all this and instead of utilizing that, the story pretends she‚Äôs something else.

- Configured (Jennetta Penner): Apocalypse, new society with everyone split into different levels of intellect, eugenics is bad, blah blah blah. This one starts off strongly, with the main character already resentful of the things her government has done to her while still thinking that it‚Äôs the best way to run things and the 1st book does a good job of exploring that inner conflict. After that, the core mystery isn‚Äôt very good, and the rebellion plotline has nothing new to offer. Truth be told, I hardly remember any of it.

#Tier 3: Utter Trash

- The Testing (Joelle Charbonneau): The world has ended. Now the only kids who can have the chance to attend college and escape poverty are the ones who can pass some sort of test that kills some of them. Makes perfect sense. This one feels like someone wrote out the series described in the Dystopian YA Novel twitter account completely unironically. I don‚Äôt even have anything else to add.

- Divergent (Veronica Roth): This one is definitely the most popular *Hunger Games* rip-off, big enough that Lionsgate tried to split the 3rd book into 2 movies only to fall flat on their face. It sounds neat, if stupid, at first: In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, society is split into 5 factions that all have to work together. Then the main character girl joins Dauntless, the brave faction who does all of the fighting. Then evil dudes take over the government and they have to fight them. Then there‚Äôs other forces outside Chicago. The story? A mess with no real stakes. The cast? Blander than toast, I don‚Äôt remember a single one. The setting? Incomprehensible. Stay far away from this one.

- Delirium (Lauren Oliver): In a world where love is considered a mental illness, one brave girl dares to fall in love with a boy who's in hiding from the government. The prose of this is laughable, at one point the narrator says that someone's eyes are ""literally dancing with light"" and it only goes downhill from there. The two leads are the same thing we've seen a million times, the ordinary, plain girl and the brooding emo boy who tries not to fall for her, but still does. Why is this trash tier? Because the author clearly ran out of ideas halfway through the 3rd book and so she spends half the book on the MC leading the obligatory rebellion and the other half with her slightly-more-annoying friend who's stuck in a shitty marriage. Barf.

- Save the Pearls (Victoria Foyt): Okay, you‚Äôre going to think I‚Äôm making this up, but it‚Äôs real. This takes place in a world where radiation is cooking the Earth, forcing humanity to live underground. This also means that people with darker skin, being more resistant to solar radiation, are given higher status in society and lighter skinned people are lower in the hierarchy. White people are called ‚Äúpearls‚Äù and black people are called ‚Äúcoals.‚Äù Yeah. This one tries so hard to be anti-racist that it circles back to being extremely racist. Reading this will burn your eyes.

- Glitch (Heather Anastasiu): Nope.

- The Treemakers (Christina L. Rozelle): Kill it with fire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p4z1e7/im_amazed_how_many_knock_offs_of_the_hunger_games/,2021-08-15T18:35:34Z,21,17,books,The Hunger Games,POST

1b4due9,"If each main character in the I Survived series got chucked into the Hunger Games, who do you think would be in first, second, and last place? How do you think your favorite would do?","For those out of the loop, the Hunger Games is what you get when you throw twenty-four kids into the wilderness and tell them to kill each other until there's only one left standing. 

My bets are on Jackson, Thomas, and Josh. 

Jackson (Alaska earthquake) grew up almost entirely off the grid in harsh Alaskan wilderness, and it's made very obvious very early on that he's as tough as his environment. He'd have been taught, both from books and experience, what's edible and what's not, how to start a fire, build a shelter, track prey, find nests to pilfer eggs, etc. His downfall, though, might be some of the other kids catching onto how well he's doing, and then banding together to plunder all his food and supplies.

Thomas (Battle of Gettysburg) seems to be pretty good at finding food on his own. He can even hunt small prey (like squirrels) without tools. He'd probably also have learned from the School of Hard Knocks which plants are edible and which aren't. 

Josh (California wildfires) is a pampered rich kid from the suburbs. He'd be screwed if he was home alone for any extended period of time, never mind being dumped into the Hunger Games. 

Marcus (Pompeii) would likely know what plants are edible and what aren't and where to find the edible ones, but I don't think he'd have any practical experience in the matter whatsoever. He almost certainly wouldn't be able to hunt for anything, and even if he did manage to catch something, he strikes me as a soft-hearted animal-lover who wouldn't be able to bring himself to butcher it (Unless he was r e a l l y hungry).",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1b4due9/if_each_main_character_in_the_i_survived_series/,2024-03-02T03:03:41Z,0,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST

122smm8,Red Rising the series. Wow.,"What an amazing sci-fi collection, Pierce Brown really brings a universe to life, mixing past Roman ideology to a future where a breed of enhanced humans calling themselves golds have terraformed all planets in the solar system and have created a ""utopia"" which they call The Society. Organising different job components of what they believe to be an ideal society to a pyramid of colours i.e. gold as the peak of humanity, silvers the business managers, white as religious overseers, black as warrior giants, yellows as doctors, greens as technology experts, orange as mechanics, etc. A red working in the Mars mines finds out his gold leaders have been lying to his entire red brethren about the supposed inhabitability of Mars, forcing them to live out their days working for them underground promising that one day they will be able to inhabit the surface. After much turmoil and tragedy he makes it to the surface and joins an uprising against his gold masters.

Not for the faint of heart (definitely think the books has some sensitive subjects for adult-processing only) but a real page turner. I have just finished the 4th book in the series and I am kinda sad that there is only 1 more after lol.

bif3f0,The Hunger Games Series Revisited After However Many Years It's been,"Greetings, book lovers. I read the Hunger Games books initially when they first became popular, a little over 10(!) years ago, and came away feeling that they were mostly cheesy YA-typical stuff: In other words, not an especially forceful opinion one way or the other. Recently I re-read the trilogy on a whim, more or less, and was wholly unprepared for what I was getting myself into. The quality of the books overall, though the prose is fairly basic, took me by surprise. I was wholly sucked in and invested for the first two, and then the third book, Mockingjay, tore me to shreds. The shift in tone from the first two-thirds of the series to the final book is shocking to me, in a way. The first two books were bleak, but they don't touch a candle to Mockingjay. Unrelenting is the word that I'd use. I was also very surprised by how affecting I found the conclusion. I was seriously struck dumb for about an hour after finishing the last page of Mockingjay.

&#x200B;

Anyways, forgive the rambling. I'd like to hear thoughts of other people on the subject, especially other folks who have read the books more recently, since no one I've talked to has read the books more recently than when they initially became popular.

mpg5f,The Hunger Games series - Is this recommended on /r/books?,"I ask because several of my friends (and I'm 24) have raved that it's a great series, but upon a cursory glance, I find that it's:

1) A young adult series, which, however, doesn't exclude it from my reading list as I think there are plenty of young adult books that also offer perspective for adults.

2) The plot seems... well, it reminds me of a Japanese graphic novel called ""Battle Royale,"" which had a somewhat similar premise. According to Wikipedia, the brief summary reads, ""As punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol, every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by lottery and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised event in which the participants, or ""tributes,"" must fight to the death in a dangerous, outdoor arena, controlled by the Capitol, until only one remains. ""

I wasn't a fan of Battle Royale (although the medium it was told through is very different), but the Wikipedia entry makes them seem similar to one another.

I can't judge a book by its cover, though, so I was looking for some input. Does the book carry itself maturely and pose difficult questions? Or is it just a one-off romp?

ccrned,There's something really interesting about The Hunger Games trilogy that nobody ever mentions.,"So, sorry for a bit of a clickbaity title, but the first thing that stuck out to me about The Hunger Games when I first read it in high school was that it was written in present tense. It seems like every book I have ever read, with the aforementioned exception, is written in past tense, so whether in first or third person, the story you are reading has already happened and you are just hearing an account of it.

In The Hunger Games, Katniss's story is happening live as you read it. This doesn't really affect the narrative at all, but it does make the story feel more immersive, I feel, because you're reading it as it's happening to her. I think it gives the story a bit more intensity because you get the impression that nobody knows what is going to happen next, as opposed to everything already having happened and you're just hearing about it.

So as a young adult series, I think it's interesting to show young readers a different writing style, maybe one that got them interested in writing or reading more themselves. It definitely stuck out to me.

So my question is, are there any other books you have read that have interesting writing styles? Maybe one that's written in future tense, or, however it would work, in the second person?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ccrned/theres_something_really_interesting_about_the/,2019-07-13T17:05:00Z,18,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST

18eyf2a,Coming back to Percy Jackson as an adult and realizing how juvenile the writing style is,"edit: for anyone who thinks this post is calling the series bad, reread it again. i was just merely surprised at how easy it is, nobody was complaining

When I was in 3rd grade I read the first series of Percy Jackson. I had read Harry Potter a couple of times by then and the following year I had read The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Maze Runner. Throughout my life I‚Äôve come back to all of those books except for Percy Jackson, which I am doing so now in preparation of the new TV show. 

I‚Äôve read Harry Potter 10 times across my life and have never felt like I was reading a juvenile book each time I‚Äôve read it, in fact there‚Äôs way more details to analyze in the first few books as you reread. And I guess I‚Äôm shocked with how easy the reading level is for The Lightning Thief. I really thought Percy Jackson would be one of those series‚Äô that could be reread with more analysis as you get older (and I know this rings true for Heroes of Olympus, just merely talking about the first 5 books) but I‚Äôm shocked with how much easier TLT is to read than Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone is. 

I‚Äôm enjoying it for sure, but I think it‚Äôs starting to become clear why I never revisited Percy Jackson the same way I did other books and that‚Äôs because I was able to easily comprehend them on first read through and that made it easier to feel like I didn‚Äôt have to go back and reread to see if I missed anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18eyf2a/coming_back_to_percy_jackson_as_an_adult_and/,2023-12-10T07:42:17Z,390,1722,books,The Hunger Games,POST

vnt0gn,"Today I [26 M] began to re-read the Hunger Games Trilogy, starting w/first book in series. I am usually an avid reader of non-fiction, but, having read this book for just over 30 minutes, I am remembering myself at the age of 16 when I read it and it is bringing back pieces of my soul...","Yeah, so like the title says, normally I read quite a bit of non-fiction literature such as self-help books, philosophy, financial books, books about achieving success, etc. etc. -- You get the picture...

Well, after finding a set of The Hunger Games Trilogy books at a thrift shop a while back and then just deciding I would begin to read the first book again today (I have read the series once, actually, when I was 16 and it was one of the only books I read out of my own freewill back in High School and as I stated, I'm now 26 years old and I also feel as if I have lost a good chunk of both my soul as well as my abilities to vividly imagine in a creative or empathic way, I feel as if I often cannot put myself in other people's shoes and I find it hard to feel deep enough levels of emotion....)

Yeah, so I read non-fiction mainly and I find it entertaining/captivating but I never feel it touches any part of my soul...  However, today after just a few minutes of me re-reading the first book in the series, I have felt myself reconnect with the person I was 10 years ago on a soulful level and I also realized that fiction has a much stronger ability than non-fiction to touch and also to enhance, improve and broaden the depth and characteristics of our spirits and our souls, metaphorically and/or literally...

So I'm grateful for this and I decided I'd share it with any of you who are reading this here to possibly allow for you to consider switching (at least in part) to fiction if you have any troubles about yourself and your soul... I believe the relatability and the depth of the lives of characters in decent-good fiction has the power and capacity to help a person become a better and more empathic person and so I'm hopeful and looking forward to adding fiction to my future book reading...

dap85i,A little rant abut Battle Royale and The Hunger Games (TLDR AT END),"I think everyone who likes Battle Royale is frustrated that it isn't as discussed or as well-known as it should be, and a lot of people talk about it in comparison to The Hunger Games because both of them have very similar concepts. 

People who like Battle Royale often comment on how much better it is than The Hunger Games and people who like The Hunger Games often don't acknowledge (or know about) Battle Royale. And the majority of people don't know where the phrase Battle Royale came from for its modern use, despite it being a relatively common phrase.

Like most people who have read both, I prefer Battle Royale, but I think to discredit The Hunger Games just isn't fair. I believe that The Hunger Games had a huge impact on the way that young people see and interact with the world. 

The millennials and Gen Z who grew up with a world that screws them over in every possible way really connected with Katniss and how she started this rebellion in order to end the oppression of the districts. If I were to explain both these books to someone who had never heard of either before, and I wanted them to understand both concepts equally, it would take far longer to explain Battle Royale than The Hunger Games. That's not bashing the book, it's just a lot more specific because it's not an entirely new world; the author has to specify what is the same and what has changed. The Hunger Games is both brilliant within itself and works as a stepping stone to Battle Royale and The Lord of the Flies.

I also think it's weird that some people feel like BR's more intense gore contributes to it being better. The gore is supposed to be horrifying. And in HG the gore wasn't the most intense, but Suzanne Collins was pushed to focus more on it rather than the political stuff in the first two books, which proved the point *both* books were trying to make.

Both books have a theme of the rich and powerful taking advantage of someone and forcing them to turn on their own as a way to force them to survive. 

You're supposed to look at Cato and Kiriyama and see them as the villains, but you forget that Cato also has a tracker in his arm and Kiriyama has a collar around his neck. You're supposed to look at Enobaria's sharpened teeth and Mitsuko's bloody sickle so you forget how Enobaria was tortured along with Peeta and how Mitsuko was abused her whole life.

It's natural to discuss which one was better because they're so similar, but if that *all* the discussion about them, then the point of the books was missed.

When people put these books against each other, they do exactly what these books told us not to do, taking two things what should be allies, and making them rivals against each other. And only one can be good and the other one has to be complete trash because only one can survive.

TLDR: Hunger Games is good too. You miss the point of the books when you make them rivals instead of allies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dap85i/a_little_rant_abut_battle_royale_and_the_hunger/,2019-09-29T02:07:55Z,7,16,books,The Hunger Games,POST

gxskjg,The ballad of songbirds and snakes! A hunger games prequel. Any thoughts? SPOILERS IN COMMENTS!,"So i read this book cover to cover in about a week. I loved it and now i want to talk about it. I started to like Coriolanus Snow, didnt seem that bad as from how he really is in the original series.

*I was actually rooting for this guy!*

And then the end happened...

The betrayal he did on his 'best friend' Sejanus and Sejanus following execution was particulary shocking to me as Sejanus wouldnt harm a fly. He was just very confused and messed up, but didnt want to harm anyone.

And what about that end in the forest by the lake (Snow has to blame himself for that because he spoke about that 'third' murder he comitted to Lucy Gray), presumably killing Lucy Gray because of anger and selfishness, whilst he should have left te gun and should have talked to her honestly about everything. But i think Lucy Gray fled because she knew who was the cause of Sejanus death after that conversation she had with Snow. The guns they found was the last straw.

So, give me your thoughts about the book! I personally loved it, it was well written and despite we all knew where snow would end his long life, his ending of this book was pretty surprising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gxskjg/the_ballad_of_songbirds_and_snakes_a_hunger_games/,2020-06-06T15:04:15Z,6,10,books,The Hunger Games,POST

ayxsl0,I just finished rereading and rewatching The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins as an adult. Possible Spoilers if you haven‚Äôt read or watched.,"On mobile, tl;dr at end. 

I‚Äôm not very good at conveying thoughts into words, I‚Äôm just looking to discuss with other people and hear their thoughts. 

The books came out when I was in middle school and I loved them. They were every aspect of a dystopian novel I could get lost in instead of doing my algebra homework. Like many other things, I didn‚Äôt quite understand all the themes and emotions the books were trying to convey. I do now. As a preteen and teenager, these characters were my age and older. I didn‚Äôt quite grasp just how young everyone was because I was that young. I also see that now. These books are so horrifying and emotional despite some parts coming across as slow and dragging, the books overall idea is well conveyed. Sending literal children to gladiator warfare for entertainment and to control is an idea that is so horrifying and sickening and close to home. Children fight in wars overseas, children fought during the world wars, (older)children volunteer to fight in wars now. 

When the final movie came out, I was a freshmen in college, the same age as Katniss. I still didn‚Äôt quite understand everything that was happening. Why some of her reactions were just so ugh. I didn‚Äôt understand because I didn‚Äôt understand why my reactions to things were so ugh. 

It wasn‚Äôt until my rewatching the final movie did that bombing scene in the capital really hit home. The scene was absolutely gut wrenching from start to finish. I don‚Äôt remember being so upset reading/watching those the first time but something about that scene killed me. Babies and children. It takes my words even now, the simple idea that war is capable of such things. 

They are children. Babies in be grand scheme of things. I had to remind myself that every overreaction and emotional breakdown and stubborn moment that Katniss has during the books and movies, she‚Äôs just a teenager. When I was a teenager, I got angry because we didn‚Äôt have milk and I wanted cereal. I couldn‚Äôt and, still can‚Äôt, comprehend going to war at that young age simply because of a lottery type system. 

And the villain in the third book. Coin. Absolutely astonishing. It sums up so much the whole series tried to convey. Remember who the real enemies are because we might become distracted with who we believe they are and who actually is. The third book did a really good idea of showing/describing this. 

Tl;dr: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins deserve a second reread in adulthood to fully understand and grasp the gut-wrenching realities the author tried to convey.

ra90b,"Why The Hunger Games are, contrary to popular belief, not a Battle Royale ripoff.","Since the movies are rampant now, drawing attention to the books, thought I need to share this writeup

Yes, they both have the same basic premise - a deathmatch. Yes, there are similar elements - the dystopian government that forces them to fight, people who want to fight and people who don't, temporary alliances that lead to betrayal, but how does it matter? Time travel stories feature time machines and time paradoxes, future selves and butterfly effects, doesn't mean they all rip each other off. It's just when you use a certain setting, some problems avaliable for exploration are immediately obvious to any author.

They both choose to feature kids (although only the first HG book features kids only), because that's more horrifying, kids are supposed to be innocent and it's scary to see them kill and die. Not the first book that uses the ""kids in a cage"" idea either - there's the Long Walk, Lord of the Flies, etc.

And that's where the similarities end, because the themes are completely, utterly different.

The Hunger Games is mostly about ""war is evil"" and ""governments are evil"". It also talks about what you want to do vs what you have to do (Kaitniss's love triangle with Peeta and Gale respectively), how scary it is to be lonely at the top, how important the family is, what can the masses do when pushed too hard and rallied, and so on, and so forth.

Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a parody, people tend to not notice that. Shinji? A Hollywood action hero, a good kid, innocent, does awesome stuff, everyone hopes he'll save him. Dies horribly. Mizuho Inada? A (make-believe) mahou shoujo heroine, assumes she's some sort of a magical warrior. Dies horribly. Mitsuko Souma? A fallen angel, bent-on-revenge girl from exploitation movies like I Spit On Your Grave. Is also a despicable bloodthirsty murderer with nothing human left inside. Dies horribly. Kazuo? The main deconstruction of the book. Hollywood antihero, think Steven Seagal. Absurdly badass, awesome at everything, kicks the shit out of his enemies, only thing missing are the witty one-liners. Is also a despicable bloodthirsty murderer with nothing human left inside, the only reason such a person even exists is because he has brain damage. Oh, and he also dies horribly.

Battle Royale makes a huge point out of basically taking protagonists from different types of media, equally western and eastern media, pitting them against each other, and then making a point out of how they all actually suck at being realistic human beings. The main point of the book is that modern fiction sucks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ra90b/why_the_hunger_games_are_contrary_to_popular/,2012-03-23T17:47:29Z,23,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST

jwsp3,The Hunger Games- What has happened to young adult fiction? (Possible spoilers),"Alright, I need to rant about this. Stephenie Meyer and her poorly-written novels have already been the bane of my literary existence for long enough. Now I'm midway through the ""Hunger Games"" series (middle of book 2) by Suzanne Collins. WARNING: Possible spoilers. A quick plot summary: A dystopian future, set in the country of Panem, formerly North America. 12 Districts are ruled over by a Captiol with cruelty and mockery. Each year, all 12 Districts must send one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18 to an all-out battle to the death where only one can emerge victorious.

I am BAFFLED by how the quality of fiction has slipped. This woman has so much promise in her planning and her vivid imagery, but she's dragged down by clunky grammar, poor character development, and predictability. I find myself in disbelief at her plot twists and wonder how she could possibly fail to be merely unoriginal.

Her love story is so damn cliche at this point I want to scream. Her main character, while retaining MANY excellent and distinct features, including intelligence, cunning, compassion, self-preservation and the ability to fight, STILL maintains such a blindness to her own feelings and does quite a lot of whining for someone who has such a fiery heart.

I am simultaneously drawn to the story and yet annoyed by the writer's insistence of mucking up her own flow.

Anyone else have an opinion on this book series or just the plight of modern YA fiction in general? I'm a future English teacher and if anyone on is teaching English I'd love to get some suggestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jwsp3/the_hunger_games_what_has_happened_to_young_adult/,2011-08-28T05:33:46Z,19,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST

jcvug,"Thinking about reading ""The Hunger Games"", not sure if it's a good idea?","A lot of people I know (mostly girls, and I am a guy) really love it. I really like post apocalyptic, sci-fi adventure tales but I'm worried that THG will be too unoriginal. It seems a lot like Battle Royale from what I've heard, and similar to some stuff Stephen King has done as well (under Bachman). I like Ender's Game series, Lord of the Rings, Stephen King (The Long Walk especially, which seems pretty similar), and other related things.

I guess my main fear is that The Hunger Games will be too targeted towards young readers and unoriginal.

My grandma grow up during the second worldwar, at the border to germany, with the permanent fear of a invade. Luckily we weren't invaded. But the years after the war, and with it her youth, were a hard time. She and my granddad live on their farm. It's now run by my uncle. But they are still active and help when they can. Like most of farmers around here they have an old fashion world view, are voting more right wing politcs. But still she is very smart and a fun person. She does what people expect her to do.

gkjox,Book Review: The Hunger Games Trilogy,"Heya!  How are reviews received hereabouts?

The Hunger Games Trilogy is science fiction in the same sense that 1984 or Fahrenheit 451 are science fiction - they're set in a dystopian future (in this case, a post-apocalyptic future) where a criminal centralized government has lost sight of humanity and treats people like resources - or worse, like slaves. Speculative fiction might be a better term for these types of books, or maybe social fiction, to contrast with science fiction's typical focus on advanced technology? You won't find any rocket ships or laser guns here, though hovercrafts and force fields and guided genetic mutation do make a showing.

The books follow the coming of age of Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who doesn't fit into the society she's born into - and how could she? Everyone in her district is a slave, forced to work the coal mines for a pittance, always on the verge of starvation, threatened with whippings or death for so much as catching a turkey that flies over the electrified fence imprisoning them. When her sister is amonth the tributes chosen by lottery to participate in the ""Hunger Games"" - deadly gladiatorial games meant to show the districts just how subjugated they are - Katniss volunteers in her place and is thrust into a love story and political rebellion she never wanted.

**The Good** - The story is advertised as YA, but that doesn't mean it's suitable only for young adults. The characters are deep, the story compelling and while not exactly unprecedented, there are enough twists and intrigue and good, old-fashioned drama to keep a mature reader hooked. The love story is strong and doesn't feel forced; like any classic the heroine is bounced between the affections of several men (alright, YOUNG men), neither of whom is perfect, but neither of whom is an outright villain, either. Though this amoric ping-pong match continues through all three books, at no point does it feel drawn out for the sake of the story - it all feels natural. There is enough action to balance out the emotion, and plenty of introspection and political intrigue to keep the story from being pigeon-holed.

**The Bad** - I've read a few reviews that complained that the story is written in first-person present, but that's only very occasionally a bother. A couple of times I was put off by info-dump style summaries where it felt like the author needed to tidy up a point or two and couldn't fit it in dramatically, but these felt in character with the narrator. Each of the books felt wrapped up a little abruptly (even if book 2, Catching Fire, does have an Empire Strikes Back-style ending), as if they were nearing a word count limit, but by that time the emotional investment I had made me eager to forgive such small transgressions. Some people may be put off by a bit of the violence. Occasionally the descriptions become gory.

**The Takeaway** - These are the kind of books that are likely to turn over in your head for several days after you finish them, which is generally a very good sign. I don't think they'll be life-changing or insightful for anyone who has already read any of the other dystopian books mentioned above, but the character arcs make them worth the read anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gkjox/book_review_the_hunger_games_trilogy/,2011-04-07T06:28:47Z,1,2,books,The Hunger Games,POST

1qt6h2,The Hunger Games and the Influence of the Screenplay on the Novel,"I was assigned to read The Hunger Games in a Writing About Literature course. Putting aside the quality of its prose and whether the books deserves any attention at all in a college course, I tried to mine what value I could.

The most interesting thing I discovered was that it read very much like a screenplay. The present tense and the focus on imagery and action reminded me of the days I studied film. I thought the author must have been influenced by screenwriting and sure enough, Suzanne Collins wrote for television before becoming a novelist, most notably as a writer for early 90s Nickelodeon shows such as ""Clarissa Explains It All.""

I found this style appealing (though not well executed), as I read a lot of screenplays in the years I developed my taste for literature. It really propelled the story quickly.

pakgl,holy carp was the ending to the 1st hunger games book ever anticlimatic...,"started reading HG after having accidentally purchased it for my kindle (had intended to only a send a sample, but figured why not after the deed was done), and got through the whole thing in just under a week. it had been a long while since i read something so commercial and figured i'd give it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining and fast-paced its narrative was, all the way up until the Games are drawing to a close.

it may be an issue of not me not having read the next two books, but i was really looking for some kind of character development on the part of katniss to warrant continuing. i couldn't believe, after everything she had been through, that she was still essentially the same by the end. Collins should have at least tried to vary her narrative voice toward the end, though i realize i may be asking too much of what is a book written in the Young Adult genre.

don't want to delve too head-long into spoilers, but... i was also expecting way more of an 'epic' finish than what i got; a much stronger twist than TO BE CONTINUED! would've helped as well.

not sure if i would recommend this book to a teenager... probably not.

also: at times, the text clearly reads more like a movie treatment than a novel.

rjthm,"Hunger Games #3 : Mockingjay, changing the end.  [WARNING SPOILERS]","I just finished Mockingjay and really enjoyed it, except the end, the very end.   

> But there are much worse games to play.

**I felt something more should go here.  So, Alternative Ending #1**

But there are much worse games to play.  There sitting on the fence, on the far side of the meadow lands a Mockingjay; very rare, I haven't seen one in many years outside the woods.  The war had made them almost extinct now.  I point it out to my children, showing them the bird that I was nicknamed after.  I press my hand to my chest where I always wear my Mockingjay pin; but something isn't right, it feels, sharp.  I know that warm sticky feeling running down my hand, I don't look down, but over my shoulder at Peeta, his eyes, huge black saucers and my hunting knife in his hands.

*Why did I feel it should end like this?  Simple, she talks about how tormented Peeta was and how he would never be the same.  Better, yes, but never the same.  She mentioned so many times how he was recovering one memory at a time; but it also, to me, seemed that there could be other, deep hidden commands that had never been seen yet.  This, of course, being one of them.*

**Alternative Ending #2**

But there are much worse games to play.

Life did get better, Peeta and I found our happiness in the end.  We spent many days just walking, holding hands, watching our children and grand children grow.  At the age of 74, strolling through the meadow with my love next to me, I can actually feel my heart stop as I drop to the ground, I know, this is my end.  I stare into Peeta's eyes, being the last thing I want to see.  He is crying, wailing, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I couldn't do it."".  I wonder why he is sorry and what he couldn't do, he brought me so much happiness.  I see myself lying in the meadow, Peeta crying over me as I float away.  I hear a cannon boom in the distance, and hear ""Congratulations Peeta Mellark, Winner of the 74th Hunger Games!""

*This idea came to me.  What if Peeta didn't really plan on swallowing the berries at the end of the first hunger games?  What if he just pretended and let Kat die?  Thus books 2 and 3 are all being played out, in Kat's mind, of what she had hoped would have happened; but in this case, didn't.*

Anyone have any other thoughts, opinions or alternatives?  Again this is for fun, I really did enjoy the books.  :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rjthm/hunger_games_3_mockingjay_changing_the_end/,2012-03-29T20:48:18Z,2,0,books,The Hunger Games,POST

So you guys have probably heard of ""The Hunger Games"" (if you have not, go read it now). I was thinking if it would get a movie and a game, like popular books always do and about how crappy book/movie games are most of the time. I already felt sad for the hunger games.
but then i came up with an awesome idea for a the hunger games game:
- action/adventure/rpg (really complex) were you are a tribute, so not following the book, just the general idea of the hunger games and the world of panem
- Huge (random generated) areas with different themes
- Weildable/usable items scattered around the cucornoporinia/ send by sponsors
- Lots of statistics like friendship with other tributes, hunger and fatigue, sponsor attractiveness
- Choose your district, districts have special powers:
1. high strength stats, low friendship, but starts with near-max friendship with 2 and 4 (career pack)
3. Extra smart and uses technology
4. Extra skill using fishing tools (tridents/fishing for food)
7. (or whatever lumber is) like pop up screens identifying dangerous plants and extra skills using axes

sffvh,Don't mean to be confrontational but did I miss something in The Hunger Games?,"Briefly, what's so great about the series?

Overwhelmed by the gloominess of Klaus Mann's *Mephisto*, I decided to do some lighter reading and picked up *The Hunger Games* books. While the writing was okay (but no Rowling) and the plot non-trivial, I found some parts to be completely transparent and others -poorly motivated. I felt little connection to most of the supporting characters and certain dramatic scenes felt over the top as a result. 

To check that I'm not indeed emotionally stunted, I read my first John Green book today, *The Fault in Our Stars* and was truly and completely moved. I mean, I must have a heart then, right?

I know I'm not exactly the target audience of YA fiction but there is such a huge gap between TFIOS and THG that to me they shouldn't even be in the same genre.

The movie Catching fire immediately caught my attention when the game master said the word ""wrinkle"". It's not very often I hear that word and it almost always makes me think of ""A Wrinkle In Time"", the book, which I read as a child. Now hear me out here. The arena in Catching Fire was a clock. The ""wrinkle"" the game master was talking about was bringing back players from previous games for one epic battle. So quite literally it was a wrinkle in time. That was the entire plot of Catching Fire. Was that not a huge tribute to her favorite childhood book?? I tried to google this concept and I couldn't find a single reference to this connection?

The Hunger Games were once again brutal. Even more so with the some of the mentors indifference to the lives of their tributes.

mprzio,I just finished Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton for the first time and oh boy I have a lot to say,"To give some context: I have watched every Jurassic Park movie in the franchise, and have played the Lego game (super fun) a few times through. The first time I saw Jurassic Park was on VHS.

I have never read any of Michael Crichton's work, so I can't compare how Jurassic Park is to any of his other works. 

My thoughts: I completely understand that a book and its movie are always different. This is more about: why did they make Hammond's character so much more likeable, friendly, and gave him ""sweet grandpa"" vibes in the movie? Why were *certain characters* kept alive during the movie? Why didn't we see more dinosaurs in the movie? 

And a praise for Michael Crichton: I just came from reading Jeff Vandermeer's Area X trilogy. Vandermeer has a way of slowing down reading with heavy diction and over explainations (not disparaging though, I do really like his work). I was expecting a science based novel like Jurassic Park to be the same way, but it was in fact a breath of fresh air. I so often caught myself 50 pages farther than I had anticipated reading. Crichton organized his chapters based on location or character. A chapter called 'Control' will show us paragraphs about each person in the Control room. A chapter called 'Tim' will only show us everything Tim is experiencing and feeling. This structure lets us as readers get a full perspective of what is going on. I could picture the entire park while reading. Crichton also doesn't patronize his readers. He includes scientific information through a character explaining, or one easy to read paragraph. There is no bore-ya-to-death textbook writing. 

I read 9 books last year, and unfortunately, due to life circumstances, this is the first one I've finished this year. I think this one will stay with me for a little while, as I prepare to read Lord of the Rings for the first time as well.

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the comments, recommendations, and thoughts! I think I will try Andromeda Strain OR Lost World next, based on which one I can get my hands on. Some more thoughts I had: I can't, for the life of me, remember if book Tim or book Lex was the older child. Lex, after her trauma with the T-Rex, reverts to behaviors of a 5-6 year old. Book Lex doesn't know anything about computers! Book Lex says 'aminals'! Book Tim is very.. level headed. Intelligent. Calm in a crisis. Additionally, having seen the movie first, I pictured all the actors in their book roles. Jeff Goldblum for Ian Malcolm was PERFECT. Lex is a completely different character, so doesn't fit. Movie Hammond did a great job, but wouldn't be the right fit for Book Hammond.

ybsznb,"I just reread Jurassic Park for the first time since the 90's, and I was taken aback by how much Ian Malcolm sucks.","Most you have either watched the movie or read the book, but briefly, the character of Ian Malcolm is a mathematician specializing in a branch of mathematics called ""Chaos Theory,"" which analyzes the impact of uncertainties and randomness on deterministic models. In the book he seems to be used as Crichton's mouthpiece, criticizing the arrogance of those that believe they can harness and control nature because of its inherent unpredictability.

In monologue after monologue after monologue.

Now, I want to state at this moment that Jurassic Park is otherwise a very enjoyable read - it's a hell of an idea for a story and even though the characters are fairly one-dimensional, Crichton paces it well and I had a hard time putting it down (even though I read it already, albeit almost 30 years ago).

Ian Malcolm, though... hoo boy. He's a one-dimensional mouthpiece for Crichton, who spends pages ranting through Malcolm about scientists' conceit. I get it - mankind's hubris makes for a great theme, and concerns about genetic technology are an interesting theme to mine.

The thing is, though, Crichton undermines his own argument. That argument basically boils down to ""scientists are young and lack the experience and wisdom that decades of scratching and clawing to the top brings with it in other careers."" But then what does Crichton go do? He makes 76-year-old John Hammond the primary antagonist - a guy that spent his life clawing his way to the top but, like a petulant child, refuses to listen to every else around him. The primary scientist (Henry Wu), suggests they ""start over"" with the dinosaurs before the park opens so that they can make changes and improvements, but Hammond refuses to listen because ""it's what people expect to see.""

So despite Malcolm's bloviating, the real villain in the film is not science, but capitalism. The scientist wanted to slow it down. The businessman wanted to speed it up, damn the risks. Thus, it's not scientists' hubris - who just want to study things - but the greed of the park owners and creators that need to turn a profit and do it quickly without concern for the ramifications.

The rest of the book is pretty rad, but I had to get that off my chest. Fuck Ian Malcolm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ybsznb/i_just_reread_jurassic_park_for_the_first_time/,2022-10-23T21:07:18Z,666,4111,books,Jurassic Park,POST

7ua0t2,"Just read Jurassic Park (1990) by Michael Crichton. The character ""Lex"" is very different from the movie adaptation. Also, a note on AI.","*Note: Slight spoilers for a 25 year old film/book*

The young girl, [Lex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Lex_Murphy) who in the book is described as a 7-8 year old is horrible. She's very whiney, mean and often put the others in danger during their adventure. She's written in a way that a writer would portray a child who is set to be killed half-way through the story. Trying to make her so unlikeable that the readership won't mind her passing. 

In the movie adaptation, Lex is age-swapped with her brother and made into a more dependable and actually helpful character. From what I've read, this was a decision made in order to have more strong female roles in the story. Good move. 

On a different note, Jurassic Park could be viewed as an allegory for the work that's being done today to research and create artificial intelligence. One of my favorite books from last year was Nick Bostrom's [""Superintelligence""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence). In it, he describes what is known as [""The control problem""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem), something that the characters in Jurassic Park has been struggling with as well. In the book, the characters are arrogant and prideful, which leads to their downfall. This could be taken as a lesson for us as a society going forward. I highly recommend ""Superintelligence"" for anyone who's interested in AI. 

---

*EDIT: Wow, what great discussion. Thanks for all your opinions and stories. Something that emerged in all this is the idea that Lex actually might be regressing as a result of shock. She starts to refer to the dinosaurs as ""aminals"" and as I mentioned below, actually acts more like a three-year old than an eight-year old.

11yqman,What I like best about book Jurassic Park and villain John Hammond is that all of his wounds are self-inflicted and can directly be traced back to him trying to save a penny,"Just reread the book for the first time in years, and it really struck me how everything is basically John Hammond‚Äôs own fault for trying to save a penny. I‚Äôm not talking about his God-complex or inability to recognize that anything bad could possibly happen (although both are major contributors to JP‚Äôs downfall). I‚Äôm specifically talking about his cost-cutting. The line ‚ÄúWe spared no expense‚Äù is so iconic that it appears in both the book and the movie, and yet everything that happens at the park is a direct result of John Hammond ‚Äúsparing the expense.‚Äù   
  
1 - It‚Äôs mentioned that the staff on the island wanted to install a new dock that would have offered ships greater protection from storms. When a storm comes, the ship is forced to leave early before all their supplies are offloaded because John didn‚Äôt want to pay for the more expensive weather-proof dock.   
  
2 - Scientist Henry Wu is nervous because the dinosaurs are too real (too fast, too deadly, etc) and wants to scrap them all in favor of slower, ‚Äúsafer‚Äù dinosaurs more in line with visitors expectations. John rejects this out of hand, citing both authenticity and cost.   
  
3 - Game Warden Robert Muldoon warns repeatedly that they need more / heavier arms against the dinosaurs. John refuses and only reluctantly agrees to keep one launcher. When the dinosaurs escape, they are left defenseless due to the only launcher on the island being lost. In the same vein, they only have two gas-powered vehicles on the island and are left without transportation with Nedry taking one and the other already out in the field.   
  
4 - The entire reason the phones are jammed is because of John. John had refused Dennis Nedry‚Äôs request of allowing his associates on-site so Nedry was forced to transfer the data back to the mainland via the phone lines. John also denied Nedry‚Äôs request of more personnel on the mainland, meaning the lines were down for an even longer period of time.   
  
5 - Speaking of Nedry. The entire reason Dodgson chose him as his inside man was because of how dissatisfied Nedry was with John Hammond. John had Nedry working longer hours than agreed upon, refused his requests for additional resources, and then stuffed him on the overtime. This resulted in a disgruntled employee ripe for exploitation.   
  
Just step by step, John Hammond‚Äôs penny pinching directly led to every major negative event that happened at Jurassic Park.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11yqman/what_i_like_best_about_book_jurassic_park_and/,2023-03-22T17:45:42Z,728,10441,books,Jurassic Park,POST
18gjgx0,Jurassic Park First Thoughts,"I knew the Jurassic Park movie was based on the novel of the same name, and I knew there were a BUNCH of Dinosaurs in it which I loved a lot more than the few shown in the movie. I picked the book a few years ago but never got to it, until today. I binge-read from chapter 1 all the way to chapter 8 in 2 days, 56 pages and there‚Äôs A LOT TO UNPACK. So I‚Äôll go chapter by chapter and display my thoughts. This is a spoiler post so don‚Äôt read if you plan to read it or read it if you don‚Äôt care:

Thoughts- I love how right off the start, we get to see a Dinosaur attack. Also the addition of Ed Regis (someone NOT in the movies) was interesting. The first 7 chapters were completely new material for me, and none of the characters we know and love from the movies were in there 7 chapters at all. Instead, it was a small subplot of smaller Dinosaurs running off the island, particularly Procomsognathus: a small foot tall Dinosaur which was green with brown stripes. What‚Äôs interesting to me is:

1. This is a completely new Dinosaur to me.
2. A distant relative of this Dinosaur, Compsognathus, doesn‚Äôt appear until the second movie.
3. The second chapter details one of the the Procompies biting a little girl, which is something later adapted into the second movie.

There were also more disturbing bits of the Novel that NEVER made it into the movie. There‚Äôs a scene of this newborn baby in a crib being guarded by Elena Morales, the woman who tended to the mother. >!She kept heard chirping and eventually she found THREE PROCOMPIES EATING THE BABY‚ÄôS FACE!!!!< Anyway, I feel like this novel will be a LOT more interesting than the movie!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18gjgx0/jurassic_park_first_thoughts/,2023-12-12T11:05:38Z,38,20,books,Jurassic Park,POST

ynkgxd,Jurassic Park: mixed feelings,"I originally intended to write a post about how disappointed I was with this book, and how the movie exceeds the book in every way, but by the end of the book, I sort of loved it.

I still prefer the movie to the book, though, for the following reasons:

1. Characters
The characters in the book seem like mouthpieces for Crichton‚Äôs philosophies. Quite one dimensional and flat. For example, Lex, who is insufferable, has basically two character traits, being hungry and hating dinosaurs. Crichton tries to give the characters more depth by weaving in conversations about divorce and family, but it feels awkward and forced.

On the other hand, in the film, the characters have natural depth. Grant‚Äôs repulsion of children (original to the film), and his eventual accepting and almost fatherly role of the children, gives him a character arc that is emotional and satisfying. This is the case with pretty much every other character.

2. Prose
While Crichton is an intelligent and knowledgeable man, his prose severely lacks. I found myself mentally editing prose throughout the book, erasing commas, removing passive voice, adding stronger verbs. At times, his writing was so juvenile that the dinosaurs felt cartoonish. 

3. Plot
Overall, I enjoyed the plot of the film more than that of the book. While they are pretty similar, the movie just ties everything together better.

I will say I enjoyed Malcom‚Äôs longer speeches in the book!

So, anyone agree with me? Disagree? Have an opinion of your own?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ynkgxd/jurassic_park_mixed_feelings/,2022-11-06T08:17:11Z,79,21,books,Jurassic Park,POST
1372uv2,Just finished the Jurassic Park Book for the first time,"I'd gotten into a Jurrasic Park mood so I decided to finally give this one a try. I thought the book was solid enough but just kinda sputtered in its final hour (listened to an audiobook). It does a good job really establishing the ins and outs of the how the park works while also showing how everything is set up to go so wrong. The characters and events of the book are different enough from the movie that I also thought I was actually gaining something from reading it. The themes of man foolishly tampering with things he doesn't understand and trying to control it and how capitalistic motivations soiled both the park and the science behind it were well done and still rather timely. 

The deaths in the book were also impactful. Nedry's death was definitely more brutal than the movie. The Juvenile T-rex kill was also really unnerving with the way it sated it's curiousity with Regis before it finally sated it's hunger. Also that baby raptor dying was probably the saddest and most fucked up death in the book. The suspense and action scenes were solid as well. The T-rex breaking the paddock wasn't as good as the movie but was still enjoyable in it's own right, as was the kitchen scene. I enjoyed that Trex and this was a lot like the Spino in JP3 with how relentless it was. 

The characters were serviceable enough but most of them didn't knock my socks off. I liked their movie counterparts more for the main trio and the kids, though I did like how well written the sibling dynamic and actual childlike behavior of the children was. Gennaro is a way more interesting character  than in the movie and the movie actually does him a little dirty, as does the last hour of the book.

Once the lounge and visitor centers are secured I think the book falters really badly. I know Gennaro wasn't the toughest guy but I feel like the last hour did him dirty. They make it seem like he's been some feckless coward that's been shirking his responsibility while he has actually gone out of his to try and help on more than one occasion. He went with Muldoon on multiple occasions out into the park and only didn't want to go after his experience with the T-Rex. He also tried to turn the power back on and had to deal with a raptor. Sure, he could have turned the power back on but the guy had just gotten dragged away by an injured raptor so I can understand why he would be cowering with a shit ton of dinosaurs around. He was also continuously seeing if the park was actually safe and tried to get Malcolm medical help. I don't like the way the book treats him in it's last hour and that is only one of many issues it has. 

So I get that Grant wanted to count the eggs to check how many had hatched and account for that but then they just...don't count and follow the raptors who now have left the nest open to being counted. And then they get picked up by the Costa Rican military and now the whole purpose of going to the cave was made moot and we could have just seen them being rescued and then they could have seen the raptors on the shore from the helicopters. Just a weird and unnecessary detour. 

Malcom also dies in the last hour but apparently not because he's in the next one! The dude just keels over after making me listen to way too many speeches from his morphine dosed ass. 

Oh and speaking of unsatisfying deaths! HAMMOND! His grandchildren are still allowed at the control room for some reason and like a cartoon or sitcom he gets freaked out by their fake t-rex noises and flees only to fall down a hill. I was fully expecting the Juvenile to eat him at this point especially with how much he was shit talking his own grand children but instead it was the compies. Don't get me wrong, that is a good choice for his comeuppance because of the damage they caused at the beginning of the book. But then it's revealed that their poison puts you into a peaceful state and while Hammond does get eaten alive by dozens of dinosaurs, he does so while in a state of uncare about what is happening. His subordinates got way worse deaths but the guy honestly responsible for everything gets the 'peaceful' death. Where he doesn't have to die scared or in agony. Very unfair.

Overall, I think Jurassic Park is worth a read but man is the last hour or so incredibly weak. What did you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1372uv2/just_finished_the_jurassic_park_book_for_the/,2023-05-03T23:14:17Z,80,132,books,Jurassic Park,POST

One standout difference between the movie and the book is that in the movie, Grant is portrayed as hating kids. In the book, he loves kids. I will say Lex is more annoying in the book - when she coughs and wakes the damn TRex?! The added background information in the book gives the movie even more value.

In Jurassic Park, the tyrannosaur is unable to see Dr. Grant standing still due to the dinosaur DNA being combined with frog DNA to fill in the gaps. However, in the second novel the narrative includes the tyrannosaurs actually having excellent vision, and George Basleton gets ripped apart because he was misinformed that they couldn‚Äôt see objects that didn‚Äôt move. Wouldn‚Äôt the tyrannosaurs on Sorna also have had the frog DNA? Is this just a weird inconsistency?

15y1oj8,Jurassic Park foreshadowing AI,"I have read JP for the first time and how Michael Crichton explains about science being old now and at it's end reminded me of AI very much. He describes that science builds on the shoulders of others meaning things that should not be done are done.  The correlation to AI now seems spooky.

MC understood IT well ahead of its time. Not the Dinosaur DNA but the concepts of system failure, of under investment for Corporate greed, how multiple small errors lead to huge disasters.

Hammond the Richard Attenborough character in the film is much more of a thoughtless and selfish person in the book. He wants legacy and cares not how of affects anyone else. 

Malcolm, Jeff Goldblum, explains the reasons for failure through mathematics brilliantly. It's clear and simple to understand. The parallels to AI now are right there. The secrecy of Hammond and the other Bio firm who pay Nedry to get them the DNalA because Hammond under pays Nedry and exploits him.

Greed is every where in the novel. Dinosaur and human alike. Scientists create things to achieve their own personal goals without thinking of larger consequences. 

It's a fascinating novel. Very easy to read. It's popular fiction BUT it is excellent. Superior to the film as a tale of warning to humans about our behaviour and how we are a nothing in the history of time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15y1oj8/jurassic_park_foreshadowing_ai/,2023-08-22T10:24:19Z,7,0,books,Jurassic Park,POST

8hhvq7,Came across this passage in The Lost World: Jurassic Park that seemed to be about 20 years ahead of its time.,">Mass media swamps diversity.  It makes every place the same.  Bangkok or Tokyo or London; there's a McDonald's on one corner, a Benetton another, a Gap across the street. Regional differences vanished. All differences vanish. In a mass media world, there's less of everything except the top 10 books, records, movies, ideas. People worry about losing species diversity in the rainforest. But what about our intellectual diversity, our most necessary resource? That's disappearing faster than trees but we haven't figured that out so now we're planning to put 5 billion people together in cyberspace. And it'll freeze the entire species. Everything was stopped dead in his tracks. Everyone will think the same thing at the same time. Global uniformity.    

What do you think?  I feel like everyone from big cities complains about said city losing its soul and its uniqueness.  Michael Crichton wrote The Lost World in '96 I believe, right at the beginning of the ""cyberspace"" era.  And I think he has a point here.    

Heck I hiked some Mayan ruins in Tulum Mexico and there was a fully functioning Subway sandwich restaurant next to the bazaar.  I see his point that if we put all of humanitys collective thought on ""cyberspace"" then our ideas and values become more and more homogenous until you find yourself travelling thousands of miles from LA to Tokyo only to arrive and grab some McDonalds and Starbucks while listening to Bruno Mars on the radio.  

Thoughts?

bgybab,Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton,"Wow. Just...wow. The very first time I heard that there were books (I know, I know, it's a real sin to the fandom to not know that the movies came from books and compared to the outstanding writing of Michael Crichton, the movies were abhorrent) I went out and checked out a copy at the library. 

&#x200B;

First chapter; I got sucked in. So I went and bought both of the books and let me tell you; that's almost all of what I did for the entire week I had it. I am almost finished with it and it gives depth where the movie seriously lacked.

&#x200B;

I am no movie critic, but honestly? I think I could get into book critiquing. And what would I have to say about Jurassic Park, the novel?

&#x200B;

There's not a single thing I'd change about it. Sure, some of the science in it is questionable but here's the thing; we're reading about dinosaurs being brought back to life. That in itself is physically impossible but it's a great idea for the imagination. 

&#x200B;

It's witty, it paints a very clear and beautifully made picture of what every animal looked like. We can see the scenes, smell what the characters are smelling, feel their emotions (especially fear!), see through their eyes just by the way that Crichton has written them. The book sucks everyone into it, we feel like we're actually in the book with the characters.

&#x200B;

It's brilliant, it's engaging, everything that I would want in a thriller about long since extinct animals and exactly what I would imagine it'd be like if humans and dinosaurs were ever in the same era with one another.

&#x200B;

So if you see it at a bookstore or a library, I'd say pick it up. You'll go through one hell of an adventure and come out wanting more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bgybab/jurassic_park_by_michael_crichton/,2019-04-24T18:42:29Z,68,54,books,Jurassic Park,POST
ndq9xw,Jurassic Park- Holy Bananas (All the Spoilers),"A short while ago, another user posted on here about Jurassic Park and that Lex was annoying.  Not a strong recommendation, but it did remind me that I had the Audible version downloaded a while ago, and I thought, why not? I love the movie.

Well...  The book was so much better.  (Common occurrence, I know, but bare with me; I was 6 when the movie came out). I love the science discussions and the personifications in characters.  I love that Sattler was not together with Grant.  I love that John Hammond was so so HATEABLE and the Donald Genero was actually a really decent protagonist. I am an attorney and we get so much hate in film.  I love that even if he was late to the party, he was in the right and did the right things.

I loved, and was shocked, that Ian Malcom died! Yes, I know he comes back which I think is a disservice to this book.  His death was especially poignant because he was in the right the whole time.  It was a beautiful and necessary tragedy that a protagonist had to die.

A final note on Lex- she was 8 and in this impossible scenario.  She doesn't really understand death at that point, but I don't think was a completely worthless character.  I think she was a reminder of the innocence at stake.  Tim was on the cusp of maturity forced even higher because of his home circumstances, but Lex was still really pure.  Are 8 year olds annoying? You bet, but to me she was sympathetic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ndq9xw/jurassic_park_holy_bananas_all_the_spoilers/,2021-05-16T15:06:23Z,34,106,books,Jurassic Park,POST

This is one of the very few books that actually enhances the movie experience and though the movie and book are very different it was very fascinating comparing them, instead of hating on one or the other.  

I have never read a Michael Crichton book before this and wasn't really planning to until it was picked for my book club. I am so glad that we decided to read this. The language and science Crichton uses are so freaking realistic not only the time the book came out, but for today as well. He made it seem as if what happened on the island was actually possible. It was so realistic that me and a friend got into an argument about the security system until I made a comment on how he thought the sensor system was dumb and unrealistic but dinosaurs were perfectly normal. We had a good laugh at that.  

One of the main things I appreciate about this book is that you end up focusing and thinking about all the ethics, morals, science, law, and aspects of society and get so invested into the research of animal behaviour, you forget about the fact that this a book about dinosaurs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8eivyw/just_finished_jurassic_park_by_michael_crichton/,2018-04-24T08:29:19Z,56,112,books,Jurassic Park,POST

l0re56,Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton,"Hey guys. Today I will be talking about Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. You probably guessed it already, but yeah, this book is the basis for the famous Steven Spielberg film. Here we go.  


Review: This novel is an all around well-crafted book. First of all, I must commend the scientific and technical aspect of the novel. Crichton is extremely well educated in science (he went to Harvard) and clearly, his scientific prowess reflects in his novel. He is able to combine together many complex scientific subjects (genetics, paleontology, and chaos theory). These are so flawlessly melded together, and it actually makes sense. I admire Malcolm's lectures on chaos theory, and I just love how he breaks it down. It made sense to me how it all tied into the park. The pacing is very well done. It starts out a bit slow, but slowly builds up and eventually it becomes complete mayhem when the dinosaurs starts breeding. The description was very vivid, to say the least (let's just say you'll have some idea what it's like getting attacked by a dinosaur) and the action was breathtaking. It was very fast and for me and very page-turning for me. Finally, the themes and morals are also important. I kind of like to think of this as a modernized/dinosaur version of Frankenstein because in both books, humanity creates things without actually pausing and thinking about what they are doing. Thus, there is going to be a lot of mayhem, chaos, yada yada yada, and yeah, you know the drill. I liked it, and I think that this is Crichton's best novel. I am not a fan of his characterization though, but I can understand, as Crichton is a pop novelist (and a good one at that).

1136kwy,"The Similarities of ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" and ""Jurassic Park""", \[Spoilers\] The Grand Theme of Both books is Ethological Science. In both  Novels Sience went to far in proving that something that is  theoretically possible should not be put into practice. Humanity is  playing god just for the sake of doing so. In Moreau you have a  character you have a man who is driven not from knowledge or a result  that can lead to a benefit for humanity but just personal glory and the  knowledge that he was right all along. Instead of theorizing his idea  and concluding that it is in fact possible he conduct these cruel  experiments just to prove a point and not because it would have a  meaningful result. Jurassic Park is about applying questionable science  without thinking through the possible risks. The Park exists for profit  but the consequences arent thought through enough to justify it. What  could happen is being put in the background. When an accident happened  they didnt shut it down in order to make it as safe as absolutely  possible but seen it as a normal work accident. They havent perfected  the formula but still strive for even more progress despite having proof  that the basis of it is lacking or if it was even a good idea in the  first place.

thb1u3,Read Jurassic Park for the first time. It was terrible.,"I don't know if it was because I saw the film first, years ago, when I was a young kid. But this book was really bad. This is not a hate post or anything.

What I found good - the beginning. The prologue and the part till they reach the park. It was quite good. Got me hooked after all. But after that, it went completely downhill.

The reasons:

1. Writing - Even for a less literary novel, the writing was very poor. Suddenly some character would go into long paragraphs talking about ethics, science etc. It's like Michael Crichton is speaking directly to us. Takes one away from the immersion. Then the problem of not describing or setting up a scene properly. No proper description of who all are in a scene. Characters went from one place to other just like that. One moment they'll be talking through the radio. The next moment, they'll be in the same room with the guy they talked to. At one point Dr. Grant asks something to Ellie and the next sentence is something like ""she replied one day later"". So much passage of time in just one sentence? The workers in the park became NPCs once all the main characters came to the park. No mention of what they all were doing when the shit hit the fan. Just casual mentions of them walking around, doing something or the other. But one can still forgive the writing.
2. The scientific descriptions with diagrams - Why was that even necessary? A diagram with a long list of codes seen in the computer. A diagram showing power supplies in the park. Just why? The only diagram useful was the one where they search for the species using the computer and it comes up with more number of species. Maybe Crichton was trying to show off with these diagrams or something?
3. Some characters - namely Malcolm and Lex. Malcolm is almost like the mouthpiece of Crichton. Always keeps saying the park will fail. Doesn't go into details much. Just some vague reference to chaos theory and all. Doesn't get into specifics in that park. Whenever Crichton feels like talking directly to the readers, Malcom would come in. And Lex. Who would even write a character like that? A small kid sees big dinosaurs attacking them, people dying etc. And she wants to have ice cream after all of that? How is she so calm after all that? Why does she talk so much and annoy the hell out of everyone?
4. The last part - Was Crichton in a hurry to finish the book? The last part was comically bad. They're all in the control room contacting the shipping boat. Why let the kid Tim talk to the captain in the first place? Things get worse from that point. They go to some opening in the ground to find out about dinosaur nests? Seriously? After all that happened they're going to do that? And the guard officer Muldoon even threatens the Gennero guy, the businessman, to go into the nest? That's one really weird part in the whole book. Why do that when they know the force is going to bomb the whole place?

Steven Spielberg deserves even more praise for turning this really bad book into an iconic movie. Not just the CGI and all, even the dialogues were made iconic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/thb1u3/read_jurassic_park_for_the_first_time_it_was/,2022-03-18T18:16:03Z,25,3,books,Jurassic Park,POST
1avfgrc,"In Jurassic Park by Michael Chrichton - John Hammond's faith was for me - the worst imaginable nightmare, but it taught me something.","I regret not reading more earlier, especially sci-fi titles with imaginable technology or environment (take for example Invincible by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or famous New brave world by Aldous Huxley), they show for example that humans are fragile even with technology or effects of eliminating discomfort (like sadness or anger). In Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton the vision focuses on something like Invincible, but add to it ""making money"" and ""altering the environment"".   
John Hammond is old and crazy man, yet in still good condition for his old years. He creates the park to purely profit and I think the talk with Dr. Henry Wu proofs it - ""the original genetic engineering companies, like Genentech and Cetus, were all started to make pharmaceuticals. New drugs for mankind. Noble, noble purpose. Unfortunately, drugs face all kinds of barriers. FDA testing alone takes five to eight years-if you're lucky. Even worse, there are forces at work in the marketplace. Suppose you make a miracle drug for cancer or heart disease-as Genentech did. Suppose you now want to charge a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars a dose. You might imagine that is your privilege. After all, you invented the drug, you paid to develop and test it; you should be able to charge whatever you wish. But do you really think that the government will let you do that? No, Henry, they will not. Sick people aren't going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication-they won't be grateful, they'll be outraged. Blue Cross isn't going to pay it. They'll scream highway robbery. So something will happen. Your patent application will be denied. Your permits will be delayed. Something will force you to see reason-and to sell your drug at a lower cost. From a business standpoint, that makes helping mankind a very risky business. Personally, I would never help mankind.‚Äù But also funds a dinosaur cloning, never listens what Dr. Ian Malcom (the person who was against creating park with dinosaurs from the beginning) has to say, even better - He despites him for hating the technology and abominations that Ingen and Biosyn made (These dinosaurs weren't even pure at first place). After most staff meets his end in the park including the one who cloned the dinosaurs - Dr. Henry Wu - ""Wu was yanked bodily out the door, and Muldoon heard Ellie screaming. Muldoon got to the door and looked out and saw that Wu was lying on his back, his body already torn open by the big claw, and the raptor was jerking its head, tugging at Wu's intestines even though Wu was still alive"" time has come to the original creator of the park. After accidentally spraying his ankle, he meets a few procompsognathus, dinos with special saliva that paralises the weak prey, but not kills. ""Hammond turned away, and started to climb the hill once more. Holding branches in both hands, he hopped on his left leg, feeling the ache in his thigh. He had not gone more than ten feet when one of the compys jumped onto his back. He flung his arms wildly, knocking the animal away, but lost his balance and slid back down the hillside. As he came to a stop, a second compy sprang forward, and took a tiny nip from his hand. He looked with horror, seeing the blood flow over his fingers. He turned and began to scramble up the hillside again.  
Another compy lumped onto his shoulder, and he felt a brief pain as it bit the back of his neck. He shrieked and smacked the animal away. He turned to face the animals, breathing hard, and they stood all around him, hopping up and down and cocking their heads, watching him. From the bite on his neck, he felt warmth flow through his shoulders, down his spine.  
Lying on his back on the hillside, he began to feel strangely relaxed, detached from himself. But he realized that nothing was wrong. No error had been made. Malcolm was quite incorrect in his analysis. Hammond lay very still, as still as a child in its crib, and he felt wonderfully peaceful. When the next compy came up and bit his ankle, he made only a halfhearted effort to kick it away. The little animals edged closer. Soon they were chattering all around him, like excited birds. He raised his head as another compy jumped onto his chest, the animal surprisingly light and delicate. Hammond felt only a slight pain, very slight, as the compy bent to chew his neck."" As you can read - He's still aware what happening and even feels pain. Not being able to do anything, but watching how chicken sized creatures eat you slowly minute after minute gave me nightmares yesterday after reading this. I was once in sleep paralysis, I remember the feeling of being awake, yet not being able to move and then your own dog shows it's teeth, the death was his own fault for creating the creatures that we know about so little, but not only his fault - Dennis Nedry hacked the system in order to turn power off then abolish the security and steal the embryos worth big money. He endangered the lives of everyone from Lex to Hammond, but at least met his end in dilophosaurus' jaws. The idea of Jurassic Park was good, but it got into wrong hands (Even Wu wasn't aware what he created and thanks to him adding the frog DNA dinosaurs bred like crazy), in the park we met a lot of harmless creatures like hypsies (hypsilophodon), hadrosaurs and apatosaurs, they could never be pure, but could be good start to understand biology of ancient creatures, also we could start reviving other animals like hawaiian birds, thylacines or passenger pigeons (Animals that lost their existence thanks to homo sapiens).

7pkhp6,I just read Jurassic Park and it was good.,"I recently read a thread about how crappy of a movie Jurassic world was. There were many comments about how different the Jurassic Park book was to the original movie. The thread in reference was how little the characters learned from their mistakes and we're still shown as hero's. (Jurassic World)

The book was a really engaging read, my first by Crichton, and had a really good pace. I wasn't disappointed by the length but was also surprised by how 'short' the book seemed. 

Really it played like game of thrones where many people that I grew attached to died, whom did not in the movie. (HBO still kills everyone)

The difference of character interactions and portrayal from the movie was very Stark. Hammond seemed a stupid man and Malcom a character who is ignored and proved correct at every turn. The kids different, seemed they took the boy and split him into both characters in the movie. Dr. Grant was an unassuming hero who scraped by with his wits and luck. I could go on but the comparisons have been done before.



Overall this was a solid read over a week of evening readings. The story was compelling and still held up to scientific light. The technology was still appropriate and held muster. So while not timeless it was not like watching a movie where a cell phone would have solved everything.

I really enjoyed this book and would recommend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7pkhp6/i_just_read_jurassic_park_and_it_was_good/,2018-01-11T01:19:31Z,49,105,books,Jurassic Park,POST

vst7jf,Jurassic Park novels canonicity question [SPOILERS for both books],"So I've been a big fan of the Jurassic World books for a long long time. I re-read them every year or two. But something has always bugged me (massive spoilers for the books):

The big ""secret"" of Lost World is that the island is NOT a good case study for dinosaur behavior (and how it connects to extinction). The raptors, like other highly intelligent animals, rely on the previous generation to teach them social norms and how to function. Since they were grown in a lab, they never got that. (Imagine a human baby just dropped in the wilderness with no parents or support.) So they behave like savage beasts, coordinating in only the most rudimentary of ways for hunting purposes. They don't properly care for their young, their nests, or their packmates, etc, etc. This makes the current raptors a poor example of their ""true"" nature and behavior, which has now been lost to pre-history.

But the first book, Jurassic Park, shows that the raptors DO behave like an organized pack, especially in the final chapter. The nesting site shows clear hierarchical layout, the adults care for their young properly, and so on. How did they get that way, without a previous generation to teach them?

It's bothered me for a long time that there appears to be a major discrepancy there. Why are the raptors on Isla Nublar organized and well-behaved, while the raptors on Isla Sorna are savage and broken?

But I had a thought. *Lost World the book, is in fact a sequel to Jurassic Park the movie, NOT Jurassic Park the book.*

The raptors in the first Jurassic Park movie behave more like you would expect from savage, untrained killers. They even kill each other to the point that by the time the movie begins, there are only three left on the island. There is a natural progression and connection between the raptors of the first film and of the second novel. In addition to that, when Ed James (the spy) is reporting to Dodgson about the people involved in the original Jurassic Park incident, he mentions everyone's current status. He DOESN'T mentioned Ed Regis at all, despite him being there in the first novel. And he lists Gennaro as having died, despite the fact that he survives the book. Both of those seem to line up with the movie events, not the book events. (The exception to this appears to be Hammond, who reads more like his novel version).

I always assumed there were two canons, the novels and the movies:

* Jurassic Park (novel, 1990) -> Lost World (novel, 1995)
* Jurassic Park (movie, 1993) -> Lost World (movie, 1997) -> ...rest of the movies

It seems like there are actually three Jurassic Park canons:

* Jurassic Park (novel, 1990)
* Jurassic Park (movie, 1993) -> Lost World (novel, 1995)
* Jurassic Park (movie, 1993) -> Lost World (movie, 1997) -> ...rest of the movies

sik1lz,So I Read the Jurassic Park Duology Recently,"So recently I decided to read both books of Jurassic Park. I read the first one from my college library and the second I bought online. And overall here's what I thought of both:

Jurassic Park: 7.5/10. Very cinematic, the characters were decent (except for two), I love all of the extra plot points that got left out of the film series (the aviary chapter, the entire raft ride, the subplot with the raptors breeding, etc.), and Hammond honestly works better as a villain. However the constant scientific monologue annoyed the hell out of me and... do I even have to say what hasn't been said about Lex? Also I didn't like Ian all that much.

The Lost World: 2/10. Bruh I couldn't even finish this one. It was just so slow and goddamn boring. Levine is worse than Lex and I wish he died lol. Also this is a bit nitpicky but... I felt that Alan was a more appropriate character to make a protagonist than Ian.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/sik1lz/so_i_read_the_jurassic_park_duology_recently/,2022-02-02T09:00:49Z,10,5,books,Jurassic Park,POST
dnzw1d,Thoughts about Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park,"So I recently finished reading Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park, and I really liked it! 

I was reading it in French though, so I can't really tell anything about the writing style in particular, but at first I disliked the translation, finding it a bit dull, repetitive etc. 

So at first I wasn't really excited about the story, it being quite descriptive for some time. But then arrives a moment, can't exactly recall when, where it just changed. I think it was the action adding up little by little, to then arriving at a point around the fourth iteration, where the story becomes so good, I just couldn't stop reading, and it is not everytime that that happens to me during the reading of a book! 

I wouldn't say that Crichton has an incredible writing style (from what I could see from the translation), but oh my, has he an incredible talent for storytelling! 
When you re read the novel, you just come to notice the subtle hints that Crichton drops to show what is going to go wrong in the future of the story (the poisonous plant near the swimming pool announces that the park isn't well organised, adding then to that the computers that counts the dinos, the movement detectors that are placed everywhere except at the river etc.), and then you see that all these catastrophic events during the novel were all predictable. The action is really great, and reading the novel, it felt just like as I was in a movie, with sometimes my heart beat going significantly up at scenes with huge amount of suspense (like the classic T-Rex escape scene).

I also really liked how Crichton succeeds to give importance to almost every character of the novel, with every iteration putting a another character in front of the scene, and those are just not some forgotten characters in the background. 
Also, although it  was clear that for some characters that were completely assholes since page one (for example Nedry or Hammond), I also liked that there were some other characters that you are unsure of about their intentions in the beginning, like Genarro who starts of as kinda a prick, but ends up helping the rest. 
I would say maybe that well, the characters aren't that original, but they're still really great. 

On a side note, I never saw the movie, but from what I know, and from what people told me, they really really did softened up the novel in that adaption, otherwise you would have a lot of gruesome deaths in it lol. 
I was also told that they kinda ruined Hammond's character by making him kinda a sweet old grandpa, but correct me if I'm mistaken. 

Anyway, to sum up, I would say that I've read books with more thoughts and philosophy behind it, assuredly Jurassic Park isn't one of those, but that didn't kept me from really liking this book, unable to control myself in reading a lot of chapters in a row. It was a really fun adventure, and definitely give this book a solid 8!

m69r7w,"Opinions on Michael Crichton? Wowed by Jurassic Park, bored by The Lost World.","Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone, I have some opinions on the works of Crichton and would love to hear some thoughts from others. Currently I am about 3/4 of the way through Pirate Latitudes, which I was surprised to be enjoying immensely. Jurassic Park is my favourite novel but I found reading The Lost World painfully underwhelming and dry and have tried many times to finish that book but I just can't, though I would like to. I have also read Dragon Teeth, I found the story itself very interesting but the writing had the same problems I had with The Lost World, I found the dialogue somewhat dry and often found myself needing to reread pages. I know Crichton has been compared to King and I feel like a bit of the formulaic way of writing makes the comparison accurate. 

&#x200B;

After reading the majority of Pirate Latitudes in a day I found it incredibly interesting and hard to put down, it is very exciting in my opinion and paints a very good picture, I'm just wondering if any other Crichton novels bring that same intensity and excitement and I just haven't found them yet, my friends and family found me a big stack of his novels when I expressed how much I love Jurassic Park and I have been avoiding going through them in case any of them are hard to finish or grasp like I felt with Lost World. Just wanted to know your thoughts and if any of his novels live up to the excitement for you. Sorry for the long and rambling post, hope everybody is well & in good health in these times, cheers. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/m69r7w/opinions_on_michael_crichton_wowed_by_jurassic/,2021-03-16T14:03:00Z,34,14,books,Jurassic Park,POST
6mtkqm,Anyone Read Jurassic Park? Mixed Feelings [Spoiler],"Overall I liked the book, but there were some issues that took away from that enjoyment. The two main issues were 1 - The amount of mistakes and errors in the actual text of the book, and 2 - The plot holes.

This book had by far the most editing errors of any book I have ever read. There were so many misspellings and switched words (at least three times they used ""men"" instead of ""then""), and it really distracted from the book. At one point Ellie's name was spelled wrong. At one point they switched back to Alexis instead of Lex. This really brought me out of the book and reminded me that I was reading.

The plot holes are something I hate to dwell on. I don't read or watch a movie to find plot holes so that I enjoy it less, so I try to be very forgiving. But this one had enough to distract me. One was how the T. Rex was so full after eating other dinosaurs that she was in a food coma, deep enough that they could inflate the raft within sight of the Rex, yet when it finally wakes up it is more than happy to chase them through the lake, then sneak around the dome to try and trap them there, then sneak ahead to the waterfall. And throughout the book, the Velociraptors are so aggressively predatory, except when they crash into their nest, then they completely ignore the people. And once Grant gets the kids to survive their whole trip through the park, does he stay put and get out of dodge asap? No, he decides to go track down the nests to count eggs (as if it was reasonable that they could actually figure out how many dinosaurs had been born, or be able to tell whether they were eaten in the park or made it to the mainland). Again, I hate to dwell on plot holes like these, but there were enough big ones in this book to distract me and take away from my enjoyment of it. I am sure there are tons of other plot holes, but again, I don't try to enjoy a book less by seeking them out (paleontology, genetics, etc.), but certain plot holes are distracting.

Anyone else read it have any thoughts?

Edit: I forgot about how Malcolm and everyone helping him just sit around under the skylight while the raptors work to get in, yet once the power is on and the raptors are driven away, then they quickly move Malcolm to a different room.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6mtkqm/anyone_read_jurassic_park_mixed_feelings_spoiler/,2017-07-12T12:23:39Z,39,15,books,Jurassic Park,POST

I really liked the film adaptation, in retrospect. Seeing all the scenes in the books they adapted into the 3 movies was really cool. 

As for the book, I really liked the ""mystery detective thriller"" in the first 50 or so pages. I was a little disappointed that it so abruptly ended when the ""reveal"" happened in an anticlimatic way, but it was still a really good way to get into the book.

I didn't get why they had to count all the eggs at the end though, considering you can't exactly count dead bodies once everything's been firebombed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ornah/so_i_read_jurassic_park_yesterday/,2014-12-09T16:40:49Z,37,34,books,Jurassic Park,POST
bigyt1,My favorite passage from Jurassic Park,"


>    ""Fractals are a kind of geometry, associated with a man named Mandelbrot. Unlike ordinary Euclidean geometry that everybody learns in school-squares and cubes and spheres-fractal geometry appears to describe real objects in the natural world. Mountains and clouds are fractal shapes. So fractals are probably related to reality. Somehow. Well, Mandelbrot found a remarkable thing with his geometric tools. He found that things looked almost identical at different scales."" 

>    ""At different scales?"" Grant said. 

>    ""For example,"" Malcolm said, ""a big mountain, seen from far away, has a certain rugged mountain shape. If you get closer, and examine a small peak of the big mountain, it will have the same mountain shape. In fact, you can go all the way down the scale to a tiny speck of rock, seen under a microscope-it will have the same basic fractal shape as the big mountain. It's a way of looking at things, Mandelbrot found a sameness from the smallest to the largest. And this sameness of scale also occurs for events."" 

>    ""Events?"" 

>    ""Consider cotton prices,"" Malcolm said. ""There are good records of cotton prices going back more than a hundred years. When you study fluctuations in cotton prices, you find that the graph of price fluctuations in the course of a day looks basically like the graph for a week, which looks basically like the graph for a year, or for ten years. And that's how things are. A day is like a whole life. You start out doing one thing, but end up doing something else, plan to run an errand, but never get there. . . . And at the end of your life, your whole existence has that same haphazard quality, too. Your whole life has the same shape as a single day."" 

 
>    ""I guess it's one way to look at things,"" Grant said. 

>    ""No,"" Malcolm said. ""It's the only way to look at things. At least, the only way that is true to reality. You see, the fractal idea of sameness carries within it an aspect of recursion, a kind of doubling back on itself, which means that events are unpredictable. That they can change suddenly, and without warning."" 

>    ""Okay . . ."" 

>    ""But we have soothed ourselves into imagining sudden change as something that happens outside the normal order of things. An accident, like a car crash. Or beyond our control, like a fatal illness. We do not conceive of sudden, radical, irrational change as built into the very fabric of existence. Yet it is. And chaos theory teaches us,"" Malcolm said, ""that straight linearity, which we have come to take for granted in everything from physics to fiction, simply does not exist. Linearity is an artificial way of viewing the world. Real life isn't a series of interconnected events occurring one after another like beads strung on a necklace. Life is actually a series of encounters in which one event may change those that follow in a wholly unpredictable, even devastating way."" Malcolm sat back in his seat, looking toward the other Land Cruiser, a few yards ahead. ""That's a deep truth about the structure of our universe. But, for some reason, we insist on behaving as if it were not true."" 

>    At that moment, the cars jolted to a stop, ""What's happened?"" Grant said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bigyt1/my_favorite_passage_from_jurassic_park/,2019-04-28T22:33:01Z,15,44,books,Jurassic Park,POST
8n2em7,"[Spoilers] Jurassic Park, and the power of nostalgia","If I can indulge my nostalgia for a bit, I have an interesting (at least to me) history with this novel. For starters, Jurassic Park is one of the first films I remember ever seeing as a kid, and it remains so today. I had the toys, the sticker books, the posters, everything. Then, come the summer of 1997, The Lost World came out in theaters and blew my 7 year old mind. That summer, my cousin from out of state came to visit, and as we were both huge Jurassic Park fans, it was the constant topic of conversation. The whole visit, she was reading Jurassic Park and subsequently The Lost World, and I remember being fascinated, listening to stories of how they differed from the movie, how they were better in some ways, etc. I was slightly too young and had too little of an attention span to read a big adult novel, so the bits of info I would get from my cousin here and there created such a cool image of what the story was in my imagination. 

As time went on, I never returned to the novels. As I got more seriously into reading, I frequently heard Crichton disparaged as airport novels, good for popcorn entertainment but totally lacking in any substance. Being that I was more pretentious in my taste, I shunned the novels and thought ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôve seen the movies countless times, why waste time reading bad novels‚Äù. 

But I‚Äôve come full circle. Who cares if something is popcorn entertainment? If it‚Äôs good and fun, that‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm so glad I read the book after 20 years, and finally seeing those bits and pieces of info that I‚Äôd stored in my mind as a kid realized was a cool way of almost reflecting on my childhood as an adult. I felt like I was reading it as 27 year old me and 7 year old me. It took me back to a time where my imagination could keep me up wondering what could exist in that book. 

I loved how much more cynical and dark the book was compared to the film‚Äôs more Spielbergian light hearted and awe-filled first half. I also loved how the backgrounds of InGen, Biosyn, and the other workers were expanded throughout the book, and it gave it a more grounded, realistic feel. The last 150 pages basically being a giant action scene was so exciting and Crichton wrote in such a way that I felt like I was there in the Park, and I felt like I had a really great idea of where everything was and what it looked/smelled/felt like. 

There are a couple of issues I had with it, although they‚Äôre rather minor in the scheme of things. The ending felt super rushed, and it basically wraps up in 4 pages and a brief epilogue, which was a let down. Ian Malcolm comes across as a much bigger tool than in the film, and his ill informed ramblings almost come off as a Crichton insert for the story to stop and give a soliloquy on why Science is bad. Ellie is barely a character in the story, and I think Spielberg made the right choice by making her such a cornerstone of the film. Finally, there are a few instances where it feels like Crichton describes the characters as if he‚Äôs writing a treatment of a screenplay (which I guess he kind of was), describing what they wear and their look in a very general way, I guess so casting agents could know what to look for. 

I‚Äôm moving on to The Lost World, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it turns out compared to the film, and I‚Äôll probably continue on to other Crichtons after that. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience where they finally read something they wanted to read at a much younger age and had a cool experience doing so?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8n2em7/spoilers_jurassic_park_and_the_power_of_nostalgia/,2018-05-29T20:28:08Z,22,22,books,Jurassic Park,POST

The characters were wholly unlikable. Grant was arrogant and abrasive, the kids were annoying and stereotyped, Ellie was okay but everyone else was incredibly one dimensional. Especially Hammond, who is the most boring kind of corporate villain. Ironically enough, Gennaro was probably my favourite character, because he was the only one that felt like a real person.  
  
I have no problem enjoying light novels, but I don't understand how anyone can rate this book so highly. It felt like it had no depth to it at all.

I am absolutely blown away! I knew the novel was supposed to be different but I had no idea just how different it would be. It was like seeing a longer, alternate reality version of my favorite movie. It was thought-provoking, morbid, frightening, hilarious and at times, even badass (looking at you Muldoon). 

Immediately after reading the last page I rushed to look up discussion forums on the novel.

I just can't even. How much processing power is really saved by doing one extra iteration of the check. Maybe every 10 checks, you do one extra iteration. Maybe even 100 or every freaking 1000. Did Nedry not know the purpose of this counter when he made it? You'd think he would have added that one once he realized its purpose. That is the only way I could see this slipping by. If he didn't know what it was for when he made it and then completely forgot about it after development of the dinosaurs and further development of the park.

That said, I'm enjoying the book quite a bit. I love the tone and the mysterious unfolding of the plot.

edit: O my lord, we got mister condescending here at the top of the comments accusing me of never coding. Actually, friend, I have done some coding. If I had read this before coding I would have never thought this was such a simple error.

A lot of people are addressing the fact that it was a half\-assed operation and that it was a message about the dangers of reckless scientific advancement. I originally had a much longer post addressing most of these points but I deleted a lot for conciseness. I could write a damn book about this book, but I tried to narrow it down. I had a problem with the convenience of some of these half\-assed oversights forsure, and I also know he was the one programmer. I just wish the genetics team, who spent so much time and money ensuring the animals couldn't breed, would have been like ""hey let's do a software check for the correct number as well"". I'm sure the higher ups were at least capable of knowing logic and reasoning, probably have had to do coding in their 8 years of schooling and researching.

Please don't take too seriously my questioning of the iterations. They never explained the logic behind it exactly so I was just broadstroaking",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8h1h94/reading_jurassic_park_enjoying_despite_some_issues/,2018-05-04T18:31:19Z,19,8,books,Jurassic Park,POST
o4pexk,Just reread both Jurassic Park and The Lost World for the first time in 15 years. A rant.,"And boy did I hate them. In Jurassic Park you are constantly given ‚Äúinsight‚Äù into characters‚Äô back stories, only for a dinosaur to attack from the left. (Literally it‚Äôs always the left.) The book hobbles along dealing with the myriad of problems occurring because of a treacherous IT worker and a storm. All the while the character of Ian Malcolm expounds why he‚Äôs always right in the most sanctimonious way possible. Then after he‚Äôs hurt he just sort of rambles, thank god it takes forever. The character Grant is left stranded in the park with two children and is some of the more interesting parts of the book but even then it drags. And the whole while Grant is fretting about getting back to the main building because there are dinosaurs on a boat headed to the mainland. Meanwhile Malcolm knows all about the dinosaurs on the boat it would rather repeatedly say I told you so. Thankfully most of the irritating characters die, Mr. Arnold an engineer who not only barely knows computers but doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs running the park on auxiliary power for 12 or so hours, Dr. Wu who is seemingly a computer wunderkind on top of being a geneticist, and Malcom whose many faults I‚Äôve already outlined. The island eventually gets bombed back to the stone age by the Costa Rican government to stop the spread of the dinosaurs and everyone has a nice sigh of relief. 

Then the sequel comes around. Malcom, previously pronounced dead must‚Äôve been moved to a better hospital because how‚Äôs status was upgraded to alive, is now working with an annoying paleontologist to find a ‚Äúlost world‚Äù untouched by evolution to study the effects of extinction. But the first 1/3 of the book is Malcom and a few others trying to figure out where this island might be. Forgetting I assume that Malcom was on an island previously that had tons of dinosaurs, and that he new the name of said island and by his own admission was convinced that Jurassic Park *had* to have a second island to grow the dinosaurs because the first book left a lot of holes. *yet* he can‚Äôt look at the large map in his office say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the old island, let‚Äôs look at one of the other islands near it‚Äù no it‚Äôs treated like a shitty mystery. The entire book felt rushed and cobbled together. Even the use of a surname of one of only two female characters is reused from the first book with only a throw away line that the two characters might be related. The entire book really started to be aggravating, then it just sort of ends. as if Crichton‚Äôs printer ran out of paper and he said ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù then mailed it to his publisher whilst holding out his hand like Mona Lisa Saperstein waiting for her father to indulge her and give her unearned money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o4pexk/just_reread_both_jurassic_park_and_the_lost_world/,2021-06-21T07:09:09Z,21,5,books,Jurassic Park,POST
dsgs8n,Jurassic Park is such an insightful book into the man-science vs nature [Possible Spoiler],"I just started reading Jurassic Park and I think that the book is extremely insightful into science and man. I wonder how much research went into making such a wonderful book. But what really had my attention is the thinking behind the concept. The fact that we can already see early on the way that science is approached is that typical ""In the name of science"" but the motivation is always money. 

Technology and science is such a dominant factor of our everyday lives that we forget about the nature aspect. 

This book I believe was way ahead of it's time and should definitely be on the list of books to read such as Animal Farm and 1984.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dsgs8n/jurassic_park_is_such_an_insightful_book_into_the/,2019-11-06T14:07:55Z,19,35,books,Jurassic Park,POST
88n3ue,Finished Jurassic Park - Spielberg's Sanitization (Spoilers),"As of two days ago, I finished my first book that I've read for pleasure in quite a while. Thanks to college  and the instant gratification of the internet for ripping any passion I had for reading books out of my soul.

I bought a Kindle Paperwhite (lighter and more wieldy than any book while reading in bed, been researching e-readers for a while) with the goal of reading on my own again. I actually picked up *Jurassic Park* on recommendation from a post in this subreddit, from a user in the same mental block as I was. It seemed like the source material for the original film would be an excellent experience on its own, and in only 400 pages?

Holy shit.

The scope, the character interactions, Malcom's delightful rambling (as a math major at a liberal arts college haha), the lurid descriptions, the political, philosophical, moral, and biological turmoil carrying a steady current under those characters, so many raptors, the Puerto Ricans *blowing up* Isla Nublar! 

I know detail is always lost when filtered into a camera. Budget and all that. But I really missed imagination carrying on and forming what the river segments looked like, how terrified (and fucking annoying as shit!!) Lex was, Hammond's descent into shifting blame, how the attacks at the beginning (that add so much more weight to the story) affected the families and mothers of the affected villages, what the raptor nest looks like, and just the grand scope of the story that couldn't possibly have been all put to screen.

Even with all that, I will say that Jurassic Park is one of those in the *very* short list of books that have equally great film adaptations, but in this case, for different reasons. I feel like the book and the film were created for completely different audiences. I wanted to watch the film directly afterwards, and I have thoughts on how Spielberg sanitized *Jurassic Park* for a younger audience.

The book, with focus on the morality of cloning and rapidly advancing technology, is for the philosophers and scientists, and anyone who wants a good adventure with damn dinosaurs. 

The film, ironically enough, seems directed at the kids that Hammond himself was trying to draw in, and as we see the franchise today... yeah. And for anyone who wants a good adventure with damn dinosaurs.

But I believe that Spielberg lost out on so much narrative weight by removing the deaths of Malcom, Hammond, and the island, among others. Nedry's death was still great, but having him be found afterwards? Actual closure on his role in the story and recovering the embryos? That was even more cathartic, when he was left in the mud and rain with the Compys. The film didn't dwell on how the survivors at that point would react to his death and status as traitor.

Malcom's death was appropriate. He actually got to *be smart*, talk about his intellectual specialties in full rather than in passing, and warn the cast about the moral and mathematical problems of the island. Then when the danger was past and the problems had come true, he didn't need to be present anymore. As the voice of reason, there is no narrative significance for him to have lived past the island, since everyone has now learned what he was trying to teach them. Spielberg, why did you make the philosopher into a one-liner wonder, and why did he live? I know that Goldblum is a pretty man, but come on.

Hammond was a fucking asshole in the book and I loved it. Like how he helps himself to the alcohol in Grant's trailer in the film, but explicitly applied to real people and their talents. He's entitled to their dedication to him, and damn if he isn't going to make a shitton of money. And when the park is failing, he blames every single person in the operation but himself. He even curses out his fucking grandkids. He has so much *vision* that no one else has, apparently, that he cannot see the failings of his grand scheme. He... actually feels much like a narcissist. Hence, when he slipped down that hillside, sprained his ankle, curses everyone on the island but himself, and dies by his own dinos, I cheered. Spielberg made him into a concerned grandfather unwilling to give up his dream except for when those he cares about are in danger. Crichton wrote one of the most human, most shortsighted, most driven villains I've been in the head of. Spielberg wanted kids to love Hammond for bringing dinos to life (hah), while Crichton makes you whoop for joy when Hammond dies with Isla Nublar. It carried significance.

And Isla Nublar. The image of Grant watching each group of, or individual dinosaur, be blown apart as the helicopter takes the survivors away, is genuinely haunting and provides finality. Hammond dies with his dream. Even the innocent, ""natural"" dinosaurs die alongside the lab babies. It's heartbreaking to read the descriptions of the blast, and the image of a single spot of white and yellow flame on the Pacific Ocean. That image was simultaneously cathartic and depressing, and the film just doesn't capture that. Everyone's happy, flying off into the sun, a little worse for wear but alive, and tired. The small group that escapes in the book is mentally scarred, exhausted, ready to forget the whole thing. Until *Lost World* (which I do plan on reading)!

I'm thankful that I read *Jurassic Park*, and I think I'm in a better mental place to read for pleasure again. The amount of content Spielberg cut or sanitized to fit in a film length for a general audience makes it an inferior experience to the book, naturally. But they are both great pieces of media, just for different audiences, and I might fit the book's audience now that I'm a bit more mature.

Thanks for reading my rambling; only one of my friends I've talked to has also read the book and I'm hankering to talk about it with anyone, haha!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/88n3ue/finished_jurassic_park_spielbergs_sanitization/,2018-04-01T00:49:17Z,10,19,books,Jurassic Park,POST
8rmy1t,"Jurassic Park, by Michael Crichton: discussion points, plotholes and clarifications","This post is not intended for overall overview of the book, and is instead intended for discussion of smaller points. For example, below I'll provide some possible plotholes and doubts, and I hope people will come to add to this post or help me with clarifications of my points.

**PLOTHOLES**

**1. [MAJOR] Malcolm also knew about raptors in the ship and didn't warn anyone.**

Malcolm witnessed the discovery of the young raptors in the back of the ship bound to the continent, along with Grant, Ed Regis and the kids. An essential arch of the story revolves around Grant and the kids making haste to the control center in order to make the ship turn around and go back to the island. Malcolm was rescued by Muldoon and Gennaro and carried to the lodge immediately after the T-rex attack. Why didn't he say anything to anyone regarding the ship?

**2. They just sit waiting for the raptors to break into the lodge**

While the survivors are inside the lodge and the raptors are about to break in through the skylight, they seem to be helplessly waiting for them to come in. But after Tim turns on the electric current and the raptors die, they moved Malcolm to another bedroom. So... I can imagine the lodge is a place with many doors to hide in. The only solution to this that came to my mind is that the door leaving a room leads immediately outside (to an outside hallway), instead of a inner hallway. If this is the case, less points for Crichton for making this unclear.

**3. They follow a young raptor to the nests through the whole island in under one hour.**

In the end, Grant, Ellie, Muldoon and Gennaro go after the raptors nest in order to count how many were born. In order to find the nests, they put a tracker on a young raptor that Grant had captured earlier. Then, right outside the visitor center, they make the raptor flee into the jungle and then they proceed to follow it through the island, from north to south, to the volcanic fields (from what I read, I feel these are many miles south). There are two things that come in conflict here: 1. Even before they started this mission, while at the control room, Muldoon had said to Grant that they had *nearly one hour of sunlight*. 2. A young raptor traversing through an entire island in direction of its nest already sounds unbelievable to me, and if you consider its speed, even in a straight line to the nest, the young raptor would take hours to get there. But in this ""one hour of sunlight"", the characters were able to: Grant argue with Gennaro in the control room, prepare the young raptor with the tracker, release it, follow it to the nest, the people go into the hole, observe the nests, then go to the beach, get to da choppa and finally see the napalm explosions along with the sunset. Did I miss anything? This would only make sense if the nests were near the visitor center, but the book makes it look like they went as far as the beaches to the south.


**Minor doubts:**

A. *At least, not after he'd shot the leg off one, when the nosy bastard came too close to the pipe.*

Did Muldoon just use a rocket launcher from inside the pipe he was hiding in from the raptors or was it a different gun? I don't remember any other gun with him at the time, and he says he hit the leg of one of the raptors. How could he shoot a rocket from inside a pipe that he was wedged in?

B. I couldn't really believe the kids' behaviour, especially Lex. After the initial T-rex attack (and the witnessing of Ed Regis demise) they should be traumatized for good, but they keep behaving as they are in a leisure trip until the end. Maybe Crichton just couldn't express the tone of their dialogues properly?

C. Why bother searching for the raptor nests in the end?

I didn't quite understand the whole point of Grant telling Gennaro to take responsibility for the situation and making him go together with them after the nests. Why count how many raptors were born? Dinosaurs were all loose in the island, and they were happily safe at the lodge. Why take such a risk crossing the island right when they are about to be rescued?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8rmy1t/jurassic_park_by_michael_crichton_discussion/,2018-06-16T22:53:34Z,14,16,books,Jurassic Park,POST

2nvrdw,Blown away by Micheal Crichton's Jurassic Park (Possible Spoilers),"First a little background if I may. I grew up watching and re-watching the movie for most of my young life at my Grandparents since they generally couldn't afford Cable. They always had movies going through out the day and being a little poor, there would be a lot of repeating the same movie. Jurassic Park was a favorite next to George of the Jungle.

Well I felt inspired after reading a comment here on Reddit about what books to read. So I went and picked up the book to get me through Turkey day. Just Wow. I'm just flabbergasted that they even allowed that movie and it's series to be created. The characters in the book were almost nothing like they were portrayed as in the movie, they had more life to them in the book, more flaws. First off Lex was a child not a teenage! She was horribly annoying in the book, I honestly wanted her brother to smack her a few times over. Grant wasn't as brave (at least at first) as the movie Grant was. Hammond wasn't friendly and an all around good guy for the rich or poor, he was a Snob and a brat. Always having to have his way and I could go on and on about the cast of this book. Oh but Malcolm was by far my favorite out the whole book (Bummer too =C) thought I was going to hate him at first but his rants were just delicious to read. 

I wanted to see how everyone else felt about this book and if there are any other book to movies that would just trash the movie to hell and back.

a4xc7d,I just read Jurassic Park... And it was pretty good! (( Spoilers )),"This post is going to contain spoilers for the book Jurassic Park by Micheal Crichton. So I guess I'll start off with the thing that I liked about it. I think the best part about Jurassic Park is the action. Michael Crichton knows how to write a scene that is full of suspense, tension, and excitement. His scenes are full of moments that had me going, ""Oh shit!"" a lot. There's a bit more of a mystery aspect to the book which is something that I also like. In the movie, some parts are directly told to you.  >!For example, in the book, you don't know that Nedry is going to steal the embryos.!< You kind of have to figure things out in the book, >!while the movie straight up told you Nedry was going to steal the embryos. !<

I also really need to point this out... Muldoon is my favorite character in the book hands down. Muldoon, in my opinion, is a million times better in the book than he is in the movie. He's just so funny, and he has a lot more of a proactive role in the book. >!The scene where he hides in the pipe away from the raptors is hilarious. ""Stuffed in a bloody pipe and I'm very popular at the moment!"" !<I also thought the dialogue was pretty good for the most part. In the book, you get a lot more of Ian Malcolm's philosophical talk. So if you liked Ian Malcolm getting in-depth about science and whatnot, then this is the book for you. There were also a couple scenes that were not in the movie but were freaking awesome. The part where >!Muldoon tries to hit the T-rex with a tranquilizing rocket launcher was great and was also another funny Muldoon moment.!<

With that being said, I have a lot of issues with the book. Sometimes it gets way too wordy, especially with Ian Malcolm. There will be a scene where raptors are trying to break into a building, and then all the sudden Ian will go on a big rant about the dangers of science. Why? THERE ARE RAPTORS TRYING TO EAT YOU! LECTURE LATER! The book can take a while to really get going, but it's worth it near the end when things really start escalating. Also, Ellie does not have as much of a proactive role in the book.

There are just a lot of characters, and one of the things I like about that movie is that it combines characters. Combining characters I think helped the movie overall and I'll get into that more later. Anyways! >!There is this entire part near the end where Alan Grant for reason feels the need to find a raptor nest to count the eggs. Again. Why? Gennaro even explains to Alan that the military is going to blow up the island anyway, and that's what happens. But Alan be like: NO! WE NEED TO COUNT THE RAPTOR EGGS! The entire part with the raptor nest just feels out of place to me, and the story comes to a screeching halt.!<

If you wanted to ask me if I liked the book better or the movie, then I would have to say the movie. Another problem I had with the book is that no one really had that much of arch, or character growth. I feel like Alan Grant was pretty much the same character at the beginning of the book than he was by the end of the book( Like most of the characters in the book in my opinion.). Unlike in the movie where he starts to connect a bit more with Tim and Lex. While in the book, he was already tolerant of kids. Even Hammond had a bit of an arch by becoming a better person. In the book, Hammond is just sort of an asshole. >!He also gets eaten by compys.!< Overall, the movie trimmed a lot of the fat of the book while also enhancing the story.

I think that if I continue this post, then it's just going to go on and on. Overall I really enjoyed it, and I'm going to be reading The Lost World very soon. What do you guys think of the book? Is it any good? Is it better than the movie?

3fdmvh,Lost World Logic (Michael Crichton's sequel to Jurassic Park),"Before the four movies there were two books. Jurassic Park is a lovely blend of Action Thriller and Science Fiction, with a dash of ethics questioning. Lost World is not. 

There are several instances of flawed logic that (at first) appear to be intelligent reasonings, before you realize that they actually cause inconsistencies with the first book and aren't correct logic anyway. 

For instance, Lewis Dodgson (the shady guy Dennis was supposed to meet in the first book/movie) comes to Isla Sorna to capture eggs. It makes sense that he would plan ahead with equipment to bring (a jeep, several insulated boxes for storage, and a ""black box"" that emits intense sound to scare away wary parents), as well as doing research beforehand, where he finds out about studies by several people proposing that T-rex could only see by movement. It makes sense that errors could happen with the black box, it makes sense that said information could be inaccurate to the point where Ian Malcolm sees the problem well before it happens. It makes sense that the parents would chase after the captors of an infant that is stolen, and that they destroy the camper in the vicinity of where they found it.

It was at this point I realized that the T-Rex in the first book never had amphibian DNA, and therefore couldn't reproduce. Also, Dr. Grant was saved by the whole ""T-Rex can't see you if you don't move"" thing. And that it should be blatantly obvious that the camper isn't alive. And that such a device like the black box would require ear protection while wearing it, and that current similar equipment used by riot control police need to be fitted on the back of a truck, not in your hand.

Furthermore, it tries to force-feed us the ideas that: Power is still running in the unmaitnenced geothermal generator, there are cameras set up (by chance) right next to the T-rex nest, raptors were never taught the proper nesting behavior (you know, the one from the first book that was directly observed by Dr. Grant) and therefore can't raise young ones, that apatosaurs never raise their heads (like they do in the first book every time you run into one), and so on every chapter.

Does anyone else feel that this completely ruins the experience?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3fdmvh/lost_world_logic_michael_crichtons_sequel_to/,2015-08-01T05:07:40Z,7,0,books,Jurassic Park,POST
1k6n7i,Questions about an idea in Jurassic Park,"So after finally finishing the book (which was fantastic), I'm still confused about an idea brought up by Ian Malcolm's character towards the end.

2rczfq,So I just finished Jurassic Park... (spoilers below),"And that child Lex would test the patience of a saint! 

Reading the book for the first time after seeing one of my favourite childhood movies I find it's interesting to compare the two. Characters, sub-plots and the general story arc were either amalgamated or tossed out the window in the Spielberg iteration for more stereotypical movie tropes some of which make it a better story and some of which take away from the overarching narrative that was running through the book, namely the theme of control.

For example, the slime ball lawyer in the movie is actually a stand up guy in the books. Dr. Grant hates kids and is in a relationship with Dr. Sattler in the movie but this is the opposite in the book and of course Hammond is exceedingly different from the genial grandfather in the movie, he is a rather curmudgeonly narrow minded man obsessed with his legacy in the book. Finally, far from being an eye-gouglingly irritating character in the books, Lex is quite accomplished in the movies and it's she who has the knack for computers (they were much younger in the books 8 and 12 I think)

Ian Malcom would tie up there with Lex for most annoying character with his patronizing riddles and long winded smug rants that start off seemingly about the fundamental unpredictability of the universe all the way to his (admittedly morphine induced) diatribe about how science is the bane of the modern world and it's epilogue is drawing near. You feel like Crichton is trying to hammer a lesson into his audience with the delicacy of a mallet.

To be honest, I felt Spielberg is a better story-teller and better at drawing 3D characters  than Crichton whose talent lies in big ideas and a lot of his dialogue, character development and suspense sort of falls flat. In particular Dr. Grant feels rather whitewashed. Would the sequel be recommended??

1xpwny,Jurassic Park readers - was anybody else disappointed by the second half of the book?,"As a reader who typically sticks to classic novels (Dickens, Steinbeck, Faulkner etc.), I stepped out of my boundaries recently and picked up 'Jurassic Park' by Michael Crichton on a whim.

I was instantly impressed by the writing style and the fact that the novel went in depth into mathematics, biology and biocomputational theory while still being understandable to an average reader and compelling as a novel. I was at work stealing glances at it while waiting for something to load or download on my computer.

Suddenly though, half way through the book I felt as though I was in an over-budgeted Hollywood film. Everything became predictable, with cheap thrills and cheesy lines. It almost felt like a different book.

3kjom5,A question regarding character development between Jurassic Park and the Lost World (Spoilers will be inside),"In case you have read the first part of my title and skipped the spoiler warning, do yourself a favor and go read Jurassic Park if you have not.

I have a question regarding peoples thoughts on Malcolm's character between Jurassic Park and the Lost World. In the first book he obviously gets bitten and nearly dies, in the second book there is only very, very minor references to his experiences in JP.

I found it extremely odd that a man who had been to and survived JP would not draw on any of the experiences. or even tell anyone how he got his injuries. It could not have been him sworn to secrecy as he mentioned Jurassic Park in the lost world. 


I just found it odd, almost like Michael Crichton was trying to make a book someone could pick up without having read Jurassic Park. it just had next to no continuity between existing characters and the second book, and even his attitude was far less overbearing (which was his defining feature in the first book) when comparing the two.

qhq6a4,I'm really sad that I've missed out on all the Ready Player One hate threads.,"I saw a bunch of people raving about this book in a book suggestion thread so I got the audio book from my library. 

My God.... it's like Eric Cartman dropped out freshman year, pounded out an incel manifesto and drowned it in Deus ex machina.

How is every female character a manic pixie dream girl? Every female character only exists for tension. He actually refers to women as females. 

Why would the entire world be obsessed with John Hughes movies in 2045? Wouldn't maybe trying to figure out the famine crises be a better use of time? A main plot point in the book is about major corporations producing new media and entertainment so its definitely not a universe where things stopped being made in the 80's. So why not just have a small group of folks in a club be into this stuff? Why does it have to be the whole planet? Damn y'all, move on. 

Japanese culture fetish. Yeah just complete that circle. 

In halfway through it. This book just came to life too day ""oh you like the Clash? Name every song that hit the US charts in the order they were released in the UK."" Then it called me a slut.

And I know this is an audiobook issue not the material but there really should have been a producer or someone who could correct Wil Wheatons pronunciations of certain words. He's mispronounced things like Aspergers (aspejers) and library (liberry).

gil64c,Ready Player One - one of the worst books I've read in a while,"Read this one out of curiosity - I had watched the movie and thought it was dumb, mindless fun and I always like comparing adaptations with their source material. 

But man, this book is dumb. I'm not going to talk too much about any literary value because there isn't any. The prose is wooden and amateurish, and there is zero character development to speak of. The main character is clearly a self-insert (the online avatar version anyway), and the rest of the characters are stock types. It's weirdly sexist with a cringey romance (I found [this poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/justneckbeardthings/comments/6pfmim/this_incredible_poem_by_ready_player_one_author/) by the author which is fucking hilarious - you have to read it to believe it).

But really, my biggest problem with this book is that the story, or whatever passes for it, is literally just...references. One fucking reference after another. 80s references at that. Not only is it a shitty equivalent of having an actual narrative, it makes no damn sense. Why are people decades in the future so obsessed with 80s references? It makes zero sense. The entire plot of this book is like the author screaming HEY REMEMBER THIS NERDY THING FROM THE 80S?!

Like there's no narrative tension, no sense of a story being told, no deeper themes, no character insights, no nothing. It's like a dude making a list of pop culture shit he likes. It's like Twilight for middle-aged nerds. There's not even any commentary or anything insightful about a future world where everyone is addicted to virtual reality. It's a premise ripe for exploration and absolutely nothing is done with it.

And this is coming from a major geek himself. This book did nothing for me and *I actually love most of the shit he referenced*.

6rti7o,So I finally finished Ready Player One...,"I had heard about this book for a while. I knew it existed, and I knew it was relatively popular, so I knew at some point that I wanted to read it. I found myself at a Barns and Noble and, since I'd heard they were making a movie of it, I decided to pick it up. So this is what I thought of the book, for anyone who's interested in hearing. This whole review is going to be full of spoilers, so reader beware.

Overall, I enjoyed the book. I don't think it was perfect, but I found myself picking it up again not long after I put it down after reading a few chapters. I thought the world was interesting, for what it was, with essentially the world having gone through a societal breakdown, mostly due to the use of our fossil fuels, and everybody using OASIS to escape it. Part of me feels like they could've explored this further, like how this dystopia has affected other countries. But the other part of me knows that the state of the world isn't really the main focus of the book or it's conflicts, at least not directly.

One thing at the beginning of the book that caught my attention was the monologue of Wade saying how he wished he had been told the truth about how the world is in a shitty state and how life has evolved over the course of millions of years and how the universe is infinite, and so on. I had actually forgotten he said this until I thought back to the beginning of the book, and it seems out of place now that I think about it. The themes from this monologue are never brought up again, other than a few times where he makes notice of how everything he does in the OASIS isn't actually real. During this monologue he mentions how he consciously makes the effort when he sees the sun to think about how it's a star, just like the billions of other in the galaxy. Never does he do this again nor does this idea or any themes from this monologue show up throughout the book, at least as I saw it. Maybe it was just meant to establish his character, but never again does he act or behave like the truth-seeking vigilante that he sets himself up to be in this monologue. Also, Wade seems to angry that he was fed so many lies and how he had to discover the truth on his own, but never in the book is it mentioned that the truth of the world is hidden from the public, or anything like that. Like, it‚Äôs not a secret that there‚Äôs an energy crisis or that the universe and humanity came about through science, right? I wouldn‚Äôt know, this book never tells me. This monologue makes it seem so, but nowhere else does it throughout the entity of the book. It‚Äôs just a short monologue, and maybe my interpretation of it is off, but having finished the book, it just seems out of place given how it‚Äôs unlike any other part of the book.

Another thing I'll say about the beginning of the book is that my copy of it looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/qqTpwg0.png), with the Stacks prominently featured. The stacks were an interesting building design, I guess, with a large pile of mobile homes stacked on top of each other. With how prominently they're displayed on the cover, and the time Cline spends to describe what they looked like, I wish we spent more time there. They're a cool idea, and I feel like he could've done more with them. Instead, we first meet Wade when he wakes up in his Aunt's mobile home at the top of the stack, and then he immediately leaves and we never go back. He does go back to the stack a couple times, but we're always told about it after the fact. As it stands, the Stacks could be changed with just regular buildings and nothing would change. Maybe that's not fair criticism, because we don't really lose anything by having the Stacks not amount the anything, but we don't gain anything either when I feel we could have.

What I do think is fair criticism though is how we never got to know anybody in the Stacks before it exploded. I wasn't expecting the Stacks to actually explode, and it was a nice way to show how high the stakes are. But for as many people died in the explosion, I found myself not caring for anyone. We barely see Wade's aunt, and we barely spend any time with Mrs. Gilmore, who Wade mentions a few times throughout the book as just a sweet old lady, so we're supposed to be mad that she died at the hands of Sorrento, but we only see her once. I know Wade has a history with her, but we the readers don't. If she's supposed to be the nice old lady who we feel bad for having died, maybe during the times Wade goes back and forth from his hideout to the stacks, instead of telling us after the fact, we could maybe see Wade afraid of his aunt's boyfriend, and Mrs. Gilmore notices this so she lets Wade sleep there. Or we see Wade climbing down and he mentions how his aunt used his government food voucher, so Mrs. Gilmore won't let him leave until he eats something. Or maybe Wade agrees to visit the Holy Land in the OASIS with her. We get more attached to Mrs. Gilmore and we get to spend more time in the Stacks. Furthermore, I think it would have been cool to spend time with the three other families that are evidently living in Wade's aunt's mobile home. With so many people living there, it would have been nice to meet them. If we got to meet them all, then I would have felt way worse about the Stacks falling and everyone dying, but as it stands, I didn't really care because I didn't know anyone. Wade, for that matter, didn't seem that upset either. He did at first, but then he quickly got over it. Granted, other than Mrs. Gilmore, he didn't really care for anyone in there, nor did he consider it his home, but still, he seemed to get over it pretty quickly, but I digress.

Speaking of other characters, I thought the chemistry between Wade and Aech was pretty good. It was obvious that they had known each other for a while, and their dialogue sounded pretty similar to how my friends and I might talk. Like when Wade mentions how he knows Aech's real name begins with an ""H"", so every time he sees him, he calls him by a different name that starts with ""H"" until he gets the right one. That's totally something I could see myself doing. Some of the dialogue seemed out of place, to me at least, like the over-abundance of ""asshead"", something I'm not sure I've ever said, but that's neither here nor there. The point is that I thought the chemistry between Aech and Wade was pretty good, and I found myself attached to him, and surprised to find out his true identity later in the book. One character I will say was forgettable was i-r0k. I get that he had to be there to kind of get the plot rolling by letting the Sixers know that Wade went to school on Ludus, thereby attaining his real identity, but he only existed for that one part and then is never mentioned again. Maybe he didn't need to be, but I feel like he could have. Maybe he sees Parzival at the last battle and apologizes for what he did and admits that Parzival is a true gunter, and he and Wade fight side by side for a bit. It doesn't necessarily have to be that, but I feel like he could have been incorporated again before the book ended. As it stands he's there just to be a dick, then we never hear about him again.

I thought the chemistry between Wade, Daito, and Shoto was pretty good. Since Daito and Shoto are essentially the only characters that both Wade and the reader had never heard of before we meet them, I thought their chemistry developed naturally over time, and by the end of the book I was pretty attached to Shoto, and even though we didn't get to know Daito much, I felt bad for his death because of the impact on Shoto. By the end of the book, Shoto was part of the team and I was rooting for him right alongside Parzival, Aech, and Art3mis.

Speaking of Art3mis, I feel like she's the weakest character. Well, not necessarily the weakest character, but I found her and Wade having the weakest chemistry amongst the team. It certainly came as a surprise when they first met at in the dungeon at the copper key. I thought they started off with fairly decent chemistry, and I think all was going okay up until one part. So Wade meets Art3mis, he likes her, they stay friends, then the Stacks explode, then there's a meeting amongst the High Five in the Basement, and this is around the time Wade moves to Columbus.  After this meeting, Wade talks about how he and Art3mis weakly keep in touch, writing each other about once a week, but slowly start to write more and eventually talk and meet up and he says they essentially spend every day together and start to get more intimate. Here's the problem, though. We never actually *see* any of this. Pretty much the entire development of Wade and Art3mis' chemistry is told after the fact in about two pages. So it goes from the meeting to Morrow's birthday party months later, with nothing shown in between. I get that Wade has grown attached to Art3mis, but I, the reader, have not. We got a chapter of Wade meeting Shoto to console him on Daito's death, so why not add a chapter or two of Wade and Art3mis hanging out in the Basement or going on some quests together? Maybe he goes with her on a quest and she gets those flying Chuck Taylors that Wade uses at the end of the book as a reward. As it stands, we miss out on the months of chemistry that evidently made him infatuated with her. Then we go to Morrow's birthday party in the next chapter where he says he's in love with her, and then she just leaves and that's the last time he talks to her until after he escapes IOI. I personally found myself not really caring about their relationship because of this. Furthermore, I get that Wade was in love with Art3mis, but I really didn't get the feeling that she loved him back, in any way. She's shy about how he looks, so Wade calls her beautiful in the message he sent her after he escaped, and he calls her beautiful a few more times and says how much he wants to be with her, but I never got the feeling that Art3mis felt the same way. Maybe I'm just terrible at reading girls, but it just felt out of place how Art3mis never showed any interest in seeing Wade until after the battle, and how she quit talking to Wade for a large portion of the book, but then at the very end he goes to her and they hold hands together and the book ends happily ever after. I know he loved her, but I never got the sense that she loved him back. Maybe if we got to see how intimate they got during those months that Cline just skipped over I would care more about them, but as it stands, we didn't, and I found myself not caring about how Wade and Art3mis would turn out.

I know I'm skipping over a lot of the book, but I feel like a lot of reviews are of people praising this book because of all of the 80s fun and the story, but I feel like they're skipping over or dismissing the characters, which I feel are often not as developed as they could be or don't have they chemistry they could have. But speaking on they 80s fun, I did have a fun time with this book's myriad pop culture references and love for classic video games. I'm glad I discovered the Angry Video Game Nerd all those years ago, because if I hadn't, most of this book's video game history probably would have been lost on me (I'm only nineteen). One thing I do have to say, though, is that some of the book's terminology seemed really out of place. I can believe that they egg hunter would be called Gunters, and that they IOI corporate drones would be called Sixers, but the derogatory term for the Sixers being the Sux0rz? And the name of the illegal black market site where Wade gets his fake identity is the L33T HAX0RZ WAREZHAUS? This book was published in 2011, and given that I'm only nineteen, I wasn't using the internet as religiously when I was in seventh grade as I am now, so maybe at the time it was more poplar to write like that. But reading it in 2017, it seems pretty out of place because I'm not sure if I have seen anyone unironically write like that in the four years I've been using Reddit. But the use of it is few and far between, and hey, maybe in 2044 writing like that will make a comeback.

Overall, as I said I enjoyed the book, given what I consider to be its shortcomings. Sorrento was a pretty one-dimensional bad guy, and I think it's pretty convenient that, after Wade escaped the IOI headquarters and heads to the post office, he only has to type in a passcode to retrieve his package when essentially every other security protocol in the future requires you to scan your finger and retinal. If this post office had that, he would have been identified as the wanted fugitive Bryce Lynch, but instead he only had to input a passcode and didn't have to worry . 

But despite minor things like these and what I mentioned earlier, I still had fun with this book. As I said, I was quickly picking up the book again not long after I had put it down. I'm excited to see the movie, particularly because I want to see all they were actually able to license. Out of ten stars, I would probably give it a seven. I wish Goodreads' scale went to ten, but instead it only goes to five, so I gave this book four. I've heard Cline's second book isn't as good as this one, but I've also heard that he's making a sequel to this book, so I'll definitely find myself reading that one once it comes out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6rti7o/so_i_finally_finished_ready_player_one/,2017-08-05T18:50:11Z,285,867,books,Ready Player One,POST

oq5zqd,I've never quit a book but Ready Player One made me do it. (Mild Spoilers),"For the first time in my life I'm going to quit a book. Ready Player One is lazy, derivative, nostalgic garbage. I'm only 6 chapters in and already it's got scenes like:

>""OOOOOHHHH"" *and then everyone clapped*

And the main character is just soooo poor and soooo gross and soooo acne-riddled virgin, and it's like ""alright dude I fuckin get it, he jerks it to VR women, the kid's a nerd."" This dip-ass is the hero? He lobs mom-jokes and then mutes people before they can respond? Goddamn.

The writing itself is boring, and I find myself zoning out all the time. So far he's spent more time jerking his nostalgia boner and explaining what XP is than actually making me care about this caricature of a dweeb.

So it's 2045 and everyone is playing Atari games looking for a hint to the $250B left by a dead videogame genius. Alright whatever. Explain to me how there isn't an AI that can solve this shit in 3 days. It's 34 years in the future (book came out in 2011). Fuck man. This isn't a plot.

Oh and to prove the one guy is an asshole he calls another guy ""twink"" and ""f*g"" and it's like what the fuck, that's pure shitty and frankly insulting writing. It's been 34 years, there's no way there aren't cool new insults, don't put slurs in what is essentially a fuckin kids book for adults.

The women reading it get to feel like they are still 20-something and pretty with a grand future ahead. The book's popularity can be attributed to the legion of lonely women and aging moms who need some excitement in their lives. The simple vocabulary utilized throughout the book also contribute to its mass-market appeal.

ftfneg,"If VR were more mainstream, today's world in quarantine would be very similar to Ready Player One.","In light of recent events, I've had plenty of free time to reread some old favorites. I was really struck by parallels between the world in Ready Player One and how people have been adapting to the mandatory quarantins. People are staying home spending tons of time watching TV, scrolling through social media, and shopping online. Meetings are virtual through video chat. Kids are transitioned to taking classes online. The biggest difference between our current state and the book is the adoption of VR technology. If VR were more advanced, there would be very little separating our current quarantine situation from the life painted in the story. It sort of makes me wonder - when this is all over, will people be able to unplug? Or will learning and working remotely become the new normal for the average person?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ftfneg/if_vr_were_more_mainstream_todays_world_in/,2020-04-02T04:11:37Z,177,2128,books,Ready Player One,POST
4207ca,Why the hate for Ready Player One?,"I feel like there has been so much internet hate towards RPO recently. I had so much fun reading it, despite not being a child of the 80s.  Cline wrote something new and fresh...no harm done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4207ca/why_the_hate_for_ready_player_one/,2016-01-21T14:34:32Z,380,296,books,Ready Player One,POST
5q3l4p,Finished Ready Player One. Was disappointed.,"**SPOILERS BELOW**. 

I really hate criticizing fellow authors, but I just don't have much good to say about this book. There are a lot of fun 1980s reference, but beyond that the book has very little going for it. I struggled to finish, and only did so out of an obligation of completeness. 

The plot is bland and predictable: an unexpected boy is the one to find the first ""key"" to The OASIS puzzle. The characters are one-dimensional and have no real development. The protagonist eases his way through the book without any real strife, succeeding in a never-ending series of deus-ex-machina style skills:

* ""To get the first key you had to beat the Skeleton King at the game Joust. Fortunately, I'm the best in the world at it and win on the first try!""
* ""To complete the first gate I had to reenact the entire War Games movie. Fortunately, I've watched it a billion times and know all the lines by heart!""
* ""To get the one-up coin I had to play a perfect game of Pac-Man, something only 5 people have ever done in history! Even though I'm rusty at my Pac-Man skills, I become the 6th person after just a few hours.""
* ""To get the second key I had to beat the game Zork. Fortunately, I know the game by heart!""
* ""To pass through the second gate I had to reenact the movie Blade Runner. Fortunately, I know the movie by heart!""

It's that sort of thing, repeated over and over. There's never any struggle, strife, or hardship, beyond the first ten pages of the book where the protagonist's living quarters are described (which stops being an issue a few pages later when he's suddenly famous and rich). 

Plot issues aside, the writing disappointed me. It's extremely ""telly"" (as opposed to showy). The pacing is strange and frustrating: Cline will spend pages and pages describing something unimportant, like the posters on the wall of their chat room. Then, when we reach an important part of the story (such as reaching the Dungeon where the first key resides) he'll skip past all of the action with a single ""I completed the dungeon and reached the final room,"" type sentence. It's maddening. 

Overall, the simplicity of the story and the quality of the writing make this book feel like a Middle Grade book masquerading as adult fiction. I think it will do much better as a movie (which is due out in 2018), but as for the book, you can get the same experience merely by reading a list of 1980s movies and videogames from wikipedia. 

I don't know what I expected with this book, but it's certainly not what I got. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5q3l4p/finished_ready_player_one_was_disappointed/,2017-01-25T14:55:36Z,224,369,books,Ready Player One,POST
iwcqjw,I just read Ready Player One and it's pretty bad but I oddly enjoyed it,"Ready Player One is the kind of bad that's like touching a hot stove: it hurts a lot up front but the real pain comes as the pain sits and throbs with you. It's the kind of book that gets worse the longer you think about it but I didn't hate it.

This book is a 13 year old geek's ultimate escapist fantasy. It's a world where your encyclopedic knowledge of nerd culture gains you clout, a world where the hot popular girls do give you a chance to show them what a ""nice guy you are"" and it's a world where corporations are so nakedly evil that they actually kill people but can be dismantled overnight through a ragtag team of idyllic youths. Any of these alone is pretty eye-roll worthy but all of them in conjuction with our edgy atheist, L33t hacker gentle-sir protag Wade Watts taking the helm shows a disturbing lack of self-awarness from the writer.

When talking about this book, you can't run away from talking about the pop culture references and as someone who was not born in the 80s, most of it was completely unintelligible gibberish. There was this kind of manipulative vibe I got from the book where there was an involuntary flash of excitement when I did recognize something but when there was something I knew, it became quickly apparent there was probably very little rhyme or reason to their inclusion. With such a wealth of great material the author pulls from, Papa Ernest never really has much of interesting to say about any of it, proudly displaying something to the audience and then quickly moving onto the next reference.

Despite all that, there were moments where I was able to turn off my brain and appreciate some of the good stuff this book had to offer. I'd imagine that the movie adaptation is probably more fun than this if for nothing else to see the visual spectacle of what this VR world would look like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iwcqjw/i_just_read_ready_player_one_and_its_pretty_bad/,2020-09-20T12:10:39Z,274,554,books,Ready Player One,POST

86i7ce,Ready Player One sucks.,"Having first seen the trailer for the movie directed by one of my favorite directors of all time: I was pumped to find out that it was based off a book! Put it on hold, picked it up a week after and braced myself for the journey of a lifetime. 

Took about 3 days to finish it. I was completely and utterly disappointed. This book is filled to the brim with pop culture references from the 80's that really don't move the story. The world and the setup is interesting AF, however, it is never explored and taken advantage of. I want to learn more about this dystopian future. I want to learn about this VR culture. But noooooooo... let's get back into role playing a famous movie from the 80's to get past a video game level. Personally, I enjoyed the whole video game aspect of it, but the content truly bored me inside out. 
The characters are bland as hell. There is literally nothing unique about the characters. 

Thing is, even though the book is just truly awful, the movie can be a true wonder because of all the elements it has to work with. I hope Spielberg takes this thing to a whole new level.

i7u6al,Just finished reading Ready Player One,"Hello, hope you are all well today.

Just wanted to start off saying that I came across the movie on Netflix, really enjoy it. Found out it was a book and I just had to read it!

I had seen the criticism that they were nothing alike, while this is somewhat true, they each represented pop culture.

Had the movie been like the book, there would‚Äôve been too many obscure references that regular audiences wouldn‚Äôt get.

So, yeah, the movie holds its pop culture closer to what would be recognizable to the average human with little knowledge of the 80s.

I came into the book honestly not knowing what to expect because of the bad reviews. I‚Äôm glad I read it, it turned out to be a great book.

I can see why a lot of the book‚Äôs content didn‚Äôt make it into the movie, but it was really fun to see how the movie used the book. There was a lot of stuff mentioned in the book that I was familiar with, I guess I know more about the 80s than I thought! However, I could see how some of the references in book would be lost to the average person in the film. 

I like both equally for what they are.

The book was fun to read. I kept finding myself excited to see how the story would play out. I even enjoyed Wade in the book too. Even the other characters from the High Five were better. More rich,  better storylines. I was glad to see that the book was really progressive thinking, challenging modern ideology and culture.

After finishing the book, it made me love the movie all over again. They compliment each other so well, imo.

Some of the book was a bit wordy, but nothing unbearable, if I had to make a complaint.

Just wanted to hear other‚Äôs thoughts in the comment section :)

Have a good rest of your week, thanks for reading!

Edit: just putting this here so y‚Äôall can behave; just because you do not like something does not mean you have the right to bully others for it.

It's sent me searching for movies, games and other references to the setting which is really cool to me!

I'm not sure if it's the mindset I'm in while reading this book or why I've never experienced this before. I'm assuming Ready Player Two will have similar references. I've read mostly Fantasy and Sci-Fi that don't splash into the real world in a way that made me question things like this.

111iev7,Ready Player One Tomb of Horrors discovery,"My wife is just now reading this book and she asked me a question which I thought was interesting. Wade mentions how he wasn't the only one to find the clue about the Tomb of Horrors, but the book implies that other than Artemis, he was the first to scan Ludus (or any of the school worlds) to find it. The amount of effort it took to scan Ludus didn't seem overly difficult. If other Gunters knew they were looking for a Tomb of Horrors entrance (skull-like landscape), why didn't they scan all planets until they got a match?

My answer was that it would take too long to scan every planet, but it's hard to really quantify that. The books universe is made up of 27 sectors all 10 ly cubes (rubiks cube style), but I still haven't gotten a good idea of how many planets roughly are in each sector. The way the book describes the variety it sounds like a very very large number of planets, but again... I don't know how large.

With the recent release of the movie adaptation of *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline there's been renewed interest in the original novel and we've seen an uptick on threads about the novel here.  In order to better promote discussion of *Ready Player One* as well as giving other threads an opportunity we've decided to create this mega-thread for you to post your thoughts, reviews, articles, and anything else you'd like to comment about the novel.

6pmdyv,Why the polarizing opinions on Ready Player One?,"Now that the movie's coming out, I was hoping to spark a bit of discussion on the interwebs. 

I got Ready Player One through my son's Lootcrate subscription.  It sat on our coffee table for over a year collecting dust.  No one read it.  I had a serious neck injury last year that left me paralyzed on the right side and stuck on the couch for a month and a half so I did a ton of reading to get my mind off things.  Picked up the book and absolutely fell in love with it.  (All better now by the way, just got done running a couple miles and lifting a bunch of heavy crap at the gym)

Mind you, I had never heard of the author, the book, or seen any kind of anything resembling an opinion about either.  I honestly think it's the book I've enjoyed the most out of all the titles I've read in my life.  It was absolute candy for me.  So I went on Goodreads, added it to my favorites shelf, and saw a bunch of negative reviews on it.  I browsed some forums, came across some discussions, and was shocked to learn there are people out there who genuinely hate this book.

My wife read it, and although she didn't love it as much as I did, she did say that she really enjoyed it and understands why I love it so much.  I think that's a big reason why she liked it, because she understood my feelings towards it.  But she's not a fan of the genre at all and still thought it was a good time.

So, r/books, can y'all explain to me why this book caused some people to say it made them mad and that they hated it so much they didn't finish it? 

EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you so very much for all your comments! I'm really enjoying all the discussion.  I get it now.  A lot of people were bothered that the book's not very complex in terms of plot or English lol.  I guess I don't really consciously critique a book like that unless the prose is so bad that it gets in the way of me visualizing the story.  That's actually the only reason why I can't read Dean Koontz books haha.  Said this in a few comment replies, but I guess I failed to mention that I do a ton of pretty boring reading already for work and that probably creates a bit of a preference towards literary candy.  Sorry if this RPO post was a redundant in r/books.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6pmdyv/why_the_polarizing_opinions_on_ready_player_one/,2017-07-26T07:04:18Z,130,16,books,Ready Player One,POST
g7iggi,Sigh...Ready Player One,"So I just got around to reading RPO and haven‚Äôt seen the movie. I liked the premise and enjoyed the 80‚Äôs references at first. But as the book progressed, it seemed very self congratulatory with all the references and got old quick for me. It also repulsed me that there was some transphobic rhetoric sprinkled in. 

I really wanted to like this story but the writing was getting on my nerves with all the ‚ÄúI looked at this‚Äù, ‚ÄúI knew immediately when I saw this‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI did this‚Äù every other sentence. The descriptions of things were over the top and the toxic gamer culture was lame to see glorified. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the dialogue at the end chapters of the book. üòë

57prlo,Does *Ready Player One* get better?,"I received a recommendation for *Ready Player One* from a friend who doesn't actually read very much, but we have similar taste in movies so I decided to give it a whirl.

Does it get any better? I'm only a few chapters in, but so far it's incredibly cringey. The writing itself is mediocre, at best; the author has been incredibly heavy-handed about preaching about both climate change and also his political stances, pretty much the whole time; and worst of all, the protagonist is unlikable.

Right now, it just feels like a soapbox with a bunch of ham-fisted nostalgia just shoved in for flavor. I'm not saying I won't finish it either way, but I want to know if I have anything to actually look forward to in this story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/57prlo/does_ready_player_one_get_better/,2016-10-16T03:42:58Z,95,46,books,Ready Player One,POST

9jqoiv,"Why all the hate for ""Ready Player One""?","I recently finished reading the book for the first time, and while it was by no means a master piece, it seemed like a pretty decent YA dystopian novel. 

The main criticisms I saw reading through a few reviews was the repeated use of obscure pop culture/video game references from the 80s. But doesn't that fit perfectly within the world established by the author? 

The book is about a contest created by the ultimate sterotypical 'uber-geek', obsessed with pop culture and video games. He created the contest to force people to care about things he cared about, and winning the contest would make anyone the richest person on the planet and head of the largest company in existence.

Doesn't it follow that people would then take up learning about all that old pop culture because it's all necessary to win the contest? 

If a book was about a person trying to win jeopardy, would people be upset about the inclusion of random historical facts that the protagonist needs to know in order to win?  

You can certainly argue that the world Cline created was stupid or inconsequential, but It seems like the writing fits pretty well into the SoC first person view of the protagonist existing within the world setup at the beginning of the book.

6brc6i,Ready Player One,"I just finished reading Ready Player One and my immediate reaction is that I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It was just a fun read considering I'm usually enveloping myself in dense history books. I loved the constant references to everything 80's entertainment (even though I was born in '91) and the concept of OASIS and video games and the immersion within virtual reality. It really hit a feeling that resonated inside of me considering I spent a majority of my teenage years inside my room constantly playing video games. I've read a couple reviews of people who knocked Ready Player One and I understand they're criticisms. But the novel synced up with aspects of my past that allowed the novel to connect with me.

Sometimes I have a hard time imagining scenes or coming up with designs of scenes based upon writing but that was hardly a problem with this book. I was able to visualize most scenes in my head as it was playing out and the fact my imagination was allowed to flourish enhanced my appreciation for it.

I'm also excited the movie is coming out next year for it because I think it has a lot of potential. Hopefully it will be a better cinematic feature than Ender's Game. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6brc6i/ready_player_one/,2017-05-17T20:26:28Z,44,49,books,Ready Player One,POST
9ku1gj,Really disappointed in Ready Player One,I was really excited about this book because the plot sounded fascinating. I think a story about virtual reality taking over our lives because we are unable to deal with climate change and other horrors could be a fascinating book. Instead the book was about saving the world by playing video games and watching movies. And not just any video games or movies; video games and movies that the VR world loved. Also the other characters were absolutely awful and the main character was a total Gary Stu. I am only half way though the book and am ready to toss it aside. Am I missing something? How did this book become so popular when it has such a nothing story? Like it could have explored this idea that being overly nostalgic itself is a type of dystopia or had the guy who created this world be the real villain. What did you think of the book? Did anyone else here hate it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9ku1gj/really_disappointed_in_ready_player_one/,2018-10-02T19:59:06Z,53,38,books,Ready Player One,POST

qqzoe0,Ready Player One: Why A Sequel?,"I finished Ready Player One a few days ago and it wasn't half bad. The references in it are easy to understand (some I didn't get but it's bound to happen) and the way it's written and how they incorporated like greedy companies is very good.

Before reading this, I did commit a book sin - in my rules - by watching the film before the book and there are differences on a **BIG** scale! Still good.

In 2020 there was a sequel released with companies like Roblox getting in on the marketing. Roblox can get in on it, cool - but a sequel. I don't there is any reason for a sequel because the ending of the book was satisfying and I thought like any reader: *Welp! That's a new book done.* I put in on the shelf and on the list. Just to add, the last paragraph was: 'It occurred to me then that for the first time in as long as I could remember, I had absolutely no desire to log back on to the OASIS.'

I might get the sequel and see how it is. So I'll have a look at it and I'll write a part 2 to this post.

85qova,Should ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù be considered a good book?,"I read it about a month ago and besides having a lot of 80s nostalgia boners there wasn‚Äôt really anything of substance to the writing. There was hope with the premise but the whole story strikes me more as a fan-fiction than a real story. The fantasy that the niche 80‚Äôs knowledge will actually be useful one day. 

Honestly my biggest peeve with the book is his reliance on the idea that ‚ÄúI already memorized/knew/was an expert at that.‚Äù He uses it with his knowledge of the 80‚Äôs and his computer hacking skills. I‚Äôm pretty sure in the 5 years the competition has been going there wouldn‚Äôt be enough time for him to have memorized all he said he had or mastered everything he said he did. Ignoring that using ‚Äúluckily I was already good‚Äù just strikes me as lazy writing.

7mkf17,Ready Player One Hype?,"Just finished listening to Ready Player One read by Will Wheaton. I had heard a lot of hype which is why I broke down and bought it. For me, it did not live up to the hype. The writing seemed very juvenile. The sentence structure was very repetitive. ""I did this, and then I did this"". The 80s references hit me over the head with material that did little to actually move the plot along. The description of the future tech did much the same. Most of the conflict was watered down. Too many times Wade had the resolution simply given to him. The character growth from poverty to celebrity came seemingly without a price.

A well written, fun, and fast read but i forgot how dark, depressing, and brutal it also was.  
First Wade's father was killed trying to steal food to feed his family and his mother died of a drug overdose. Not exactly 'Family Ties'  
The 'Sixers' reminded me of 'Storm Troopers' and Sorrento was 'Kylo Ren' a ruthless soulless killer. Sorrento set off a bomb killing Wade's aunt, Mrs. Gilmore, and many of the residents of the 'Stacks'.  
Sorrento also assassinated Shoto one of the high fivers and ordered the assassination of the other four. Not to mention Earth was a depressing, hopeless, lawless wasteland. No wonder everyone lived in OASIS.

Every guy I've recommended the book to has read it and liked it (well, it's totally just two) but I've never met a girl who's read it and I'm really curious as to what you would think of the book.


Here's some questions I had in mind. All of these are regarding the book, the movie was alright but it wasn't even close to level of detail and immersion the book provided, in my opinion:


Did you like the book? 


Do you play video games, or, would you describe yourself as nerdy? (I feel like RPO would have a greater appeal to someone in either, or both these groups)


What do you think of Art3mis? Is her character truly feminine, or was she created to appeal to a male audience? 


What did you think of the romantic subplot between Arty and Wade? 


Did you like the OASIS? Would you want it or an equally immersive VR game to exist irl?

81qisi,I just finished Ready Player One,"When I found out that the movie was coming out I rushed to get a copy and read it first. Ultimately, I may have ruined the movie for myself, having read the book and then gone back and watched the trailers again, but that's beside the point.

This book is absolutely thrilling. It's rare that I find a book these days that I literally cannot put down, and desperately rush back to on my breaks at work. I'm a huge fan of video games and have been playing them all my life, and Ready Player One is everything I could have dreamed of in a book about video games. The characters are charming, the right balance of predictable and not so much so, the dialogue is clever and humorous in the right places, and lacking humor where it doesn't need to be (Which is a plus, at least for me).

The story...I could go on and on. I don't know how long it took the author to put this thing together, it goes so far beyond complex that I don't even know how to describe it. The minute amount of detail strung around the entire world he's built is absolutely insane. And my copy says that it's the author's first novel, which is even more impressive. If you are debating on reading the book before seeing the movie, absolutely read the book first. I hope the movie lives up to it.

3fqvr1,Just finished Ready Player One - I'm upset.,"It could be the book had been hyped too much, but I was so letdown by the missed opportunity Cline wasted that I wrote a review.
- - - 
Nostalgic references are heavily relied on to prop this unsatisfactory attempt at paying homage to the unfortunately neglected era of the late ‚Äò70s and ‚Äò80s computer games, movies, and music.

The forced juvenile dialogue to demonstrate conflict and camaraderie is only worsened by Cline‚Äôs inability to avoid breaking the ‚Äúshow ‚Äì don‚Äôt tell‚Äù rule. The amount of effort put into cramming in an unnecessary amount of pop-culture references is also evident in the lack of narrative constraint, many needless words and phrases bungling the flow in an attempt to be witty. 

Credit is deserved for painting the vivid landscapes Cline is so fond of. However, admiration overpowers his self-control and the reader is frequently exposed to a shoehorned laundry list of retro mentions, leaving them wondering not ‚Äúwhatever happened to those things?‚Äù, but ‚Äúwhat happened to the editor?‚Äù

Perhaps what disappointed me most at this worship of ‚Äò80s video games was that I share as much appreciation and nostalgia for this era as Cline. It was King‚Äôs Quest III, a type-command based computer game, that helped me learn how to read and write. 

Ironically, I forced myself to finish this book to understand and participate in the cultural conversation Ready Player One has found itself.

(I‚Äôm agnostic but self-righteous atheists really grind my gears. I think it‚Äôs the hypocrisy of complaining about religious people pushing their beliefs on others and then turning around and doing the same thing)

**EDIT** 

Again, I'm not religious (grew up in a family of scientists) and this is the first time I've paused when reading a book due to this kind of thing. It's never happened to me before which is why I bothered to make this post. 

The anti-religious tones in the first chapter are not particularly subtle:

**""That story you heard? About how we were all created by a super-powerful dude named God who lives up in the sky? Total bullshit. The whole God thing is actually an ancient fairy tale that people have been telling one another for thousands of years. We made it all up. Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.""**

and a bit later:

**""What happens when you die? Well, we're not completely sure. [...] Those stories you heard? About going to a wonderful place called 'heaven' where there is no more pain and you live forever in a state of perpetual happiness? Also total bullshit. Just like all that God stuff. There's no evidence of a heaven and there never was. We made that up too. Wishful thinking.""**

Looking back it's not as though a majority of the chapter was devoted to this. But I still found the tone rather annoying. It's the kind of thing I would expect to see in the comments of a religious video on youtube, not in a light sci-fi novel about vr and the metaverse. 

But since most of you say that this kind of ranting isn't what the book is about, I'll keep at it. Thanks for the feedback!

**EDIT 2**

I know no one will probably read this, but just in case... I finished readying the book. The writing isn't always the best, but overall it's a great story. Definitely recommend it for some casual reading. It is apparent that the author uses the story to share some things which are important to him, but it didn't end up being a problem. It's only in the first chapter that he seems to push heavier topics so blatantly. In the rest, his personal views are mostly reserved for sharing the 80s era music, games, movies, etc that he felt were important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gnedun/is_ready_player_one_filled_with_antireligious/,2020-05-20T16:19:51Z,27,9,books,Ready Player One,POST

cdmayu,Finished Ready Player One last night,"Might have some spoilers here and in comments of anyone wants to discuss

I picked up this book after watching the movie 2wks ago.  I watched it because my wife finished reading it

Well, I'd have to say I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I liked the 80s references it made (I know I missed a lot or just didn't fully get them) and I feel it was well paced and well written

What I really loved was the movie completely did it's own thing.  The whole game was changed to be more action packed for a movie audiance.  I actually thought the movie was done decently

I can see why they changed a lot for the movie.  The book is a little more nerdy and the challenges aren't really action

Because of that I only knew the major plot line, so reading the book was like I'd never seen the movie.  I didn't know what the challenges were.  I actually liked the challenges that Parzival goes through in the book

Spoilers:

Holy crap so Wade starts in Oklahoma and doesn't even go to Cincinnati until literally halfway through the book

Aech has no shop that he does repairs in

Daito gets killed?!  Geez.  Well, this makes sense in my next paragraph

So the biggest surprise was Wade gets himself caught by IOI only to infiltrate the organization.  I had to go back to reread the chapter so I fully understood this.   He finds that IOI knows everything about the High 5  (which is a common phrase in the last half of the book but only appears on a sign at the end of the movie) and their real names and where they live

I like that Og ties in before the last battle rather than just appearing at the very end

The ending battle is pretty cool

The ending was kind of a cool thing where Z gets Halliday's God Mode powers and money where the movie he just gets money

And second to last page he actually meets Art3mis (and met Shoto a little earlier and Aech a few chapters before)

There are a few other little details that are in movie and book, but they're done differently

It was a quick read.  I poked along the first half because I only got a chapter here and there, but finished off the last half yesterday

I am prob going to make this my ""I got time to kill"" book.  I really enjoyed it and would love reading it again.  I'd say this is prob my fav book I've read in a while (which isn't saying much as I haven't read much the last few yrs)

mp38sl,"Ready Player One is arguably the GREATEST book ever about living on ""The Spectrum""","Well, this was meant to be a simple post about a book that makes me happy. And some thoughts off the top of my head as I was re-reading. But I can see that it's just upsetting people, so I'll probably end up removing it a little later.

I'll just enjoy it in private. lol.  


\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  


I hadn't re-read this book in years. But I recently discovered that April is ""autism awareness spectrum month"" or something like that. So I decided to fire up the audiobook for old time sake.Now mind you, I read quite a bit of the many diatribes against this book around the time the Spielberg movie came out.So I was prepared to find that some of the passages I loved years ago might be a little cringe in today's climate.

But that's not what I'm experiencing. Every interaction, every reference, all of the main characters' lifestyles describes perfectly what life as a person with so-called high functioning Asperger's syndrome  can be like.

And I think that explains the harsh reaction from so-called ""normal"" people to this book. No one behaves ""normally"". None of them understand the social cues from other people well, and they're all pretty damned clumsy about interacting with each other, and others.

The annoyance and hostility that this book has received  is the same treatment that many people on The Spectrum have lived with their entire lives.

Ernest Cline tried to fix some of those ""flaws"" in Ready Player Two. But his good natured, well meaning attempts to make his characters fit into ""normal"" behavior patterns was pretty awkward.

Sound familiar?

EDIT: I hear what everyone is saying. And my intent was not to say that all criticism against this book was invalid. Hey, I'm a Black man, and the idea that one of the main characters was ashamed of their race, gender and sexual orientation just made me roll my eyes.

The unspoken part of my comment that I alluded to at the end, is that I get why Cline's attempts to make his work more inclusive comes off as  pretty awkward. I believe it's the same social awkwardness that many geeks have in dealing with the world.

Either way, my main point is that this book really hit home with me when I read it a decade ago. I didn't expect it to still resonate in the same way, and I'm glad it does.I'm definitely not implying that everyone who didn't enjoy it as much is somehow bad.

We all have our own taste. But it does make me a little sad that no one else here seems to love it as much as I do.

48i76x,Just finished Ready Player One. I don't understand the hype; this is just the nerd's 50 Shades of Grey.,"I am very surprised this book was so well received. It read like Young Adult fiction, except it had about 3 naughty words, and wouldn't appeal to that audience since it's chock full of pandering 80's nerd references. The dialogue was atrocious, and instantly pulled me out of the world whenever the main characters began to interact. The plot was recycled in waves (really? You're going to do another play-through of an 80's movie in the Final few scenes??) and there were no twists (like how about Halliday wasn't actually dead? Or Og turned out to be the bad guy? A book this flimsy really called for something interesting to happen at the end). I literally felt dirty being pandered to with the constant references (""...and of course, Kevin Smith"") like I was reading the nerd version of 50 Shades of Grey. I'll give Cline two positives: Pretty good premise and fairly effective world-building, especially the chapter where Parzival retreats into his OASIS-only apartment. That all being said, this will likely make for a really fun movie.

Edit: I read it on a Hawaiian vacation, and yes, it was a quick and somewhat fun read. I found myself annoyed, frustrated, or feeling a little used too often to say I enjoyed it, though.

5234jn,Should I continue reading Ready Player One?,"I just got to Chapter 5 of Ready Player One  (approximately 1/5th of the way through) and I'm not convinced I want to continue with it.  I finding it rather memetic, and whilst it does have some interesting ideas with the OASIS, it seems to be more focused on geeking out over lists of 80s popular culture.  Right now it seems more Fantasy than Science Fiction, and I'm not a huge fan as I am more interested in deeper explorations of technology and society.

Does it ever move past this?  Is it fundamentally a whodunnit where I am required to remember endless minute details that came before?  Or does it ever explore the OASIS in a wider context?

32ody9,"Ready Player One, The Martian - Poor character development","I've recently been on a Sci-Fi binge. I've been reading a number of recent books that come highly recommended. RP1 and The Martian being 2 that have received a lot of recent acclaim.

I enjoyed both books immensely, but I couldn't help notice that both really struggled in the area of character development.

If you've read either of these did you feel the same way?

In terms of character and story development Ready Player One felt like it was at the level of good fan fiction. There was never any real tension and the main character seemed to breeze from one success to another. It was a fun read, it's just that having received such high praise from across the web I really expected a very solid story. Instead I got a fun, but ultimately forgettable popcorn story.

The Martian has also received high praise from across the web. I am an armchair astronomer, so I really enjoyed the hard science aspects of the story. The character development on the other hand was dismal. I felt the author utterly squandered their opportunity to explore the protagonist's despair and loneliness. Instead what we got was a lot of semi-technical detail about habitat patching. I really enjoyed the technical aspects but it just felt like such a missed opportunity to explore the astronaut's inner turmoil (there didn't seem to be any!).

eogwd5,Ready Player One-Leveling system,"The Ready Player One leveling system makes NO sense at all. In the book, when Wade meets Art3mis for the first time, he is at level 10 and Art3mis is at level 50 or so. Later in the book, Wade says that Art3mis and Aech made the ""grind to 99"", meaning that Art3mis gained 50 levels in A COUPLE OF MONTHS. Before Wade met her, she was probably still in the OASIS for a long time;  many years, as she had been blogging ever since Halliday's death, which was 5 years ago. Art3mis gets 50 levels in <5 years, and gets 50 more in a couple of months, right after the copper key has been found! Knowing leveling systems in most video games, leveling up gets progressively harder as your levels get higher (more XP needed to level up).

7ugfcw,[Review] Ready Player One [No Spoilers],"What a wild adventure this story takes you on. While this book isn't a difficult read by any means, it is pure, thrilling entertainment. It's a great book for the pop-culture obsessed, reader or non, and an excellent quick read for the avid book-lover. 

It may have it's quirks, one to note being the over explaining of certain references throughout the story. I found myself skipping a paragraph or two during my read because I was already familiar with several of the concepts being explained. I do understand that those explanations are most likely there for those who aren't as immersed in the culture this book covers, though.

This novel is separated into three parts: Levels 1, 2, & 3. Level 1 spent a good amount of time world-building and, by the time it was done, I could perfectly imagine life inside and outside the OASIS. Level 2 really got things moving with the thrill of the hunt as well as some unexpected plot shifts. While I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book, I would have to say it wasn't until I hit Level 3 that I literally couldn't stop reading. This was my favorite part, by far. It was so gripping and exhilarating that I tore through it non-stop until I had turned the last page.

I would highly recommend this book and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation later this year.

bln4bk,"Is ""Ready Player One"" a different genre in disguise?","I just graduated from college, where the thought of reading for pleasure on top of school reading was anything but pleasurable sounding, and I am finally checking some books off my to-read list from the past few years.  

To kick things off, I went out, bought an e-reader, and downloaded a copy ""Ready Player One"" from our local library.  As an overlapping kid of the 80's and 90s, I had to give it a go, and although I have mixed feelings about portions of the book, I generally enjoyed the story - finding myself fairly attached towards the end.

Early on in the story though there is the a dialog between SPOILER >!""Aech and Parzival, where Aech insults Ladyhawke by saying, ""...it's chick flick disguised as a sword-and-sorcery picture...""  The second I read that line I knew this had to be forshaddowing that this book, much like Ladyhawke, was at its core going to be more of a tail of romance than one of action - one masked in pop-iconoculture, video games and science fiction - but deep down a ""chick flick.""!<  

>!Intentional or not, they also mention that Wade's avitar name is spelled ""Parzival"" instead of the ""Percival"" from the 1979 anime, ""King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,"" because the prefered spelling was already taken by another player.  However, this spelling coincidently puts it in alignment with the original spelling used in the medieval German romance poem that also revolves more around love and less around adventure.""!<

I could be way off, but does anybody else see this line as foreshadowing that the author wanted Ready Player One to be more of a futuristic romance novel, and less of nostalgic action-adventure trip?

Unrelated side note - I am so happy to be reading for the fun of it again.  Thank you books for being so great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bln4bk/is_ready_player_one_a_different_genre_in_disguise/,2019-05-07T06:03:52Z,23,0,books,Ready Player One,POST
k3lwib,Ready Player One & Copyright (A weird thought),"(Sorry for the broken English in advance, I just need to get this out of my brain as fast as possible)

A weird thought just popped into my head, but I'm not sure about it & need some feedback:

Ernest Cline definitely didn't intend for this to happen, but Ready Player One is, in a weird way, an analysis between our modern copyright system, and how the inability for existing materials to enter the public domain has stymied new ideas to be created & commercialized, mostly likely due to fear of being sued for copyright infringement.

In really broad strokes, culture within the world of R.P.O. has effectively stopped evolving/growing, & is deeply entrenched in nostalgia (or pseudo-nostalgia, not sure about this). Working backwards from this, the only reason why culture growth would be stopped is if copyrights/trademarks were given the authority to shut down any works that are even partially derivative from them.

And yes, while this theory does stand in contrast to the new & (at least partially) original media being created independently by small & new creators, I find it easy (& sad) to believe that in an attempt to preserve their hold on their IPs, the big media companies would lobby to extend copyright law to allow for takedowns of non-commercial partially derivative works, even if it was unintentional.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/k3lwib/ready_player_one_copyright_a_weird_thought/,2020-11-30T01:26:02Z,7,16,books,Ready Player One,POST

5vidkn,To everyone on this subreddit who recommended The Ferryman Institute by Colin Gigl last year... Thank you. I just finished it.

h917ip,"I just finished Ready Player One, and it was fantastic","When RPO had been suggested as a next goal for our local book club, I was wary at first. I saw the film at the time of its release, and I remember leaving the cinema with a thought, ""If this were released when I was 13, it'd be an instant all-time favourite of mine"", but that impression was born out of pure joy of recognizing a number of background characters and the overall gaming atmosphere. So, I expected the book to be something similar - light-hearted, casual, maybe even aimed at kids, and full of tributes to modern and recent media. Well, what do you know - never in my life have I felt that a movie does a book such a massive disservice.

The first thing that immediately clicked with me was the numerous mentions and huge respect for the classic 80s and 90s videogames. I'm an avid gamer myself, and although I wasn't alive back when Atari, Turbografx, Amiga, Spectrum and the arcades were in their prime, I still took time to familiarise myself with their catalogues, because there's nothing quite like retrogames out there on the market, be it PC or console, and while those older games might not be as pretty or intuitive as the modern ones, they are perfectly capable of supplying you with tons of visceral fun, and a lot of features and gameplay ideas presented in the oldies have not seen an equivalent or continuation ever since. Hell, the entire genres died out by now, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a recently made text adventure of Zork's scale with a flexible parser that wasn't made by an enthusiast for strictly non-commerical purposes.

Discovering a couple of new cool rock&roll bands was a huge and welcome surprise, too - as a massive *AC/DC* fan, I couldn't have fallen in love with *Rush* any quicker, and chances are, I would've never learnt about the band on my own without RPO.

Referenced movies deserve another special mention - while the book certainly couldnt've encompassed the entirety of film classics and there were some unfortunate omissions, the inclusion of *Hard Boiled*, Kevin Smith's works, and the *Matrix* trilogy in its entirety (considered to be one of the ""big"" trilogies by the character of Halliday's caliber, which has got to be worth something!) genuinely warmed my heart. In my experience, discussions around the Matrix usually boil down to ""the good original vs the shitty sequels"", so RPO gave me, a massive fan of Matrix: Reloaded, a bit of validation in that regard.

But the meat of the book is, of course, not the incessant movie- or videogame references, but the virtual reality itself, the OASIS. The idea of advanced civilizations facing a crisis and isolating themselves in perfectly modelled virtual worlds has been something on the mind of both the classic sci-fi authors and scientists for a long time now - just thnk back to *Summa Technologiae* by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or *The Lion of Comarre* by Arthur C. Clarke. But while the books that I read before mostly explored this possibility as an apocalyptic scenario, RPO took a shot at depicting it from the point of view of a regular player. And the reason I fell in love with RPO almost immediately was because it does such a great job at picturing this player.

Back in the day, I used to spend a lot of time in MMOs and competitive multiplayer games. It is through them that I met most of my closest, life-long friends. I'm generally familiar with the type of crowd that plays MMOs, and it takes all kinds - there are people who want to escape reality for an evening, people who find solace in social interaction while doing something fun together, people who just want to turn their minds off and grind monsters for an hour or two... And then there's a special category - complete social outcasts obsessed with a singular idea. More often than not, their social disengagement is caused by external factors - at least among those whom I met myself. The reason behind their social circumstances can be anything: for instance, fucked up, disfunctional families (criminal records among parents, divorces, scandals and arguments, drug abuse, death of beloved relatives, etc.). Or deeply-rooted physical and psychological issues that are hard/impossible to correct even with the help of medical professionals. Ultimately, though, what matters is that this particular group of people takes videogame immersion to a new level. Their sheer dedication to a cause, relentless ability to grind, level up, improve, learn mechanics and stand out among their peers is nothing short of a miracle. Now, I don't know about you, but if I play the same game for 8 hours straight, every day for 5 years, I tend to get tired and bored of it. These people? Not so much! They might not have many other prospects in life aside from their chosen MMO, but when they get into gear, they do it better than anyone else. And it's this particular form of implacable zeal that I see personified in Wade, RPO's protagonist.

He's willing to give up everything, including his own life, to achieve a dream that, at first glance, seems unattainable. What are the chances that a school kid with no money, reputation, or connections could win a single multi-billion dollar prize in the most popular contest in the world? This kind of success story is akin to the experience of competitive e-sports players who, despite the entire world's expectations, tradition, and common sense suggesting to do otherwise, take the plunge, drop out of school, leave their part-time job, break off friendships, forget about everything else, and focus on a singular most important thing in the world - becoming the best there ever was. They know their chance of success is minimal, they know that kids all over the world try to do exactly the same, and yet it's never a reason to stop. If this isn't the most inspirational example to follow your dreams, and circumstances be damned, then I don't know what is. This is the kind of image that I keep in my mind when I want to become better at my own job or acquire a new skill. Except that I have it much easier - I have a safety net to fall back to, a supportive family, a savings account - while people like Wade and his real-life counterparts have nothing except a bunch of griefs and an idea of a better life. And just thinking about that makes me shiver in awe.

The tone of the book and its dystopian world fit the narrative perfectly - the movie's pale attempt at depicting the catastrophic state that the world found itself in is a far cry from the book's atmosphere of absolute depravity. You know things are bad when you have to take an armoured bus complete with a set of armed security guards to make it to another city alive. When reading these short ""real-world"" snippets in-between the virtual action, the choice to spend life in OASIS loses its ambiguity and becomes a sensible thing to do. Considering the advancements of VR technology, the constant fighting for material resources, the heated political atmosphere between nations, today it's easier than ever to put yourself in Wade's shoes and imagine his reality as your own.

In the end, the only thing that left me disappointed was the fact that in finale both Wade and Halliday admitted defeat in the ""digital vs real world"" dilemma and voiced preference for real life. For both, the cause was love, and both were eventually disillusioned in their choice of virtual reality vs the tangible one. I think the book would've sent a more powerful message without that moral lesson, although I do appreciate its inclusion to end the story on a positive note. But a lot of people whom I personally met - the virtual-bound geeks and nerds who spend their lives gaming - simply don't have a choice like that, for one reason or another, and it would've been interesting to see Wade give up his real-life identity for good after winning the contest.

And that pretty much wraps it up. If you made it all the way to the end, thank you for reading my ramblings. I can't believe that I've been sleeping on this book for so long, and I wish I read it much sooner. This experience is not something I'm going to forget any time soon, and rarely have I felt such a profound connection with a book and the characters depicted within.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/h917ip/i_just_finished_ready_player_one_and_it_was/,2020-06-14T20:35:09Z,13,12,books,Ready Player One,POST

dmc34a,Ready Player One Vs Epic," I've noticed that its not an unpopular opinion to be let down by Ready Player One for one reason or another. I was wondering who has read Epic by Conor Kostick, and what your thoughts between the two are. The books have a similar motif of a future with a Virtual Reality game central to society. It seems that Ready Player one often lets down in world building and that the OASIS is more or less just there and doesn't move past its concept of its an oasis from real life. Epic on the other hand the game is a form of conflict resolution and resource allocation for the book's society.

72miu7,Ready Player One - Ernest Cline - Review #2,"Ready Player One

Distiller: Ernest Cline

Age: 6 years

Price: $7.48 Amazon


Eye: The paperback version has a nice thicker cover with a decent binding and an image of stacked motorhomes and trailers. It prominently proclaims this is soon to be a movie by Steven Spielberg. 


Nose: At first, this book smells of something that could be an very interesting and timely topic. What happens to society and people in a techology driven world of VR dependency? The cover description gave me the impression this would be discussed, but unfortunately the first whiff of a sociology deep dive was just a whiff of hope that quickly evaporated. 


Palate: I got a strong taste that the author wanted me to love the 80's references, but there were so many so often that it quickly lost it's effect. This felt like a typical techie indigo child bildungsroman novel, but propped up on a weak pity that the reader is supposed to feel towards the main character. I felt compelled to keep reading it, but it was the same motivation that would keep me watching a daytime soap opera drama to see if Billy ends up getting back with Linda. Occasionally the book feels a bit exciting, but our kid hero is never placed in a situation that is unsolvable. This gave me a candy shop fuzzy vibe to a world that is supposed to be a dark alley in a third world town with high percentaged of organ harvesting. The first 150 pages felt like a massive first person brain dump to world build, but even after all this time I don't feel I really know any of the characters motivations or personalities very well. 


Finish: The ending is exciting from a video game perspective, but as said before the likelihood of failure felt so remote that I didn't have much of a buy in. There is moment right before a major battle where some people come together (being intentionally cryptic so as not to spoil) that felt rushed and was a serious let down for me. The final moments did not do anything to resolve the bubble gum identities of the characters and plot. 


Overall: I was told by several people that ""since I love reading scifi I would LOVE RPO."" This may have been part of the downfall of my experience. This book hints at it's ability to have a deeper meaning, but resorts to laughs, scary near misses, and your nostolgia button to keep you motivated to continue reading. I didn't feel like I was reading scifi at all. I would have enjoyed this as a graphic novel, (which someone should do!), but not as a 500+ page book. I burned through it in about a week just to get it over with and get back to my own preferred brand of scifi that has a little more substance.

n7f24g,Ready Player One is easily the best book I‚Äôve ever read... how do I choose what to read next because I know it won‚Äôt compare,"After seeing so many people on different Reddit pages, I decided to get Ready Player One from my local library. By far the best choice I‚Äôve made in choosing a book. It is easily my new number one favorite book that I‚Äôve read. This book was one of the best written that I‚Äôve read and had so many amazing qualities about, listen to the music, watch the movies and tv shows, and play the games that were mentioned in the book. I love solving puzzles and this really just turned the cogs in my mind on trying to solve these puzzles. I love vintage but also futuristic things and video games as well, so it kept me really intrigued and was right up my alley. The anticipation from the get-go just kept driving me to read faster and faster, even though you know the outcome from the very beginning of the book. I normally read books fairly quickly, but there was something about this book that gratefully prevented me from doing so. This has thrown me into a book hangover now to give me time to process everything because it was so in depth and amazingly put together. I don‚Äôt even know what to read next because I know that whatever it is won‚Äôt compare and that makes me feel quite lost. It‚Äôs going to be hard to find a book that can hold up to Ready Player One. Needless to say, I‚Äôm excited to read Ready Player Two and watch the movie based on the first book. I am definitely going to be buying this book and adding it to my collection as one of my most prized books.

gypn06,Just realized this about Ready Player One (minor spoiler),"So a lot of you might have figured this out really early on specially if you are a fan of Greek mythology. I on the other hand just recently caught the reference and think it's pretty cool. Art3mis says she named herself after the Greek goddess but what I didn't know is that Hercules hunts her. And though Wade doesn't name himself after Hercules I still find it interesting that he more of less hunts for her through the book. Now I don't give Cline that much credit but I like to think that's what he tried to do. Do y'all agree?

It's a quick and easy read like most YA books. Initially I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. 

Unpopular opinion time. The protagonist is a major neckbeard. I was cringing throughout most of the book. I felt like the whole story was predictable and relied too heavily on pop culture references. I cringed so hard when one of the main characters turned out to be a girl, who is african american, and also a lesbian. The diversity! Applaud as the main character accepts her for who she is!

After seeing the trailer for the movie I was excited for it, but then I kept hearing about how much more realistic VR is becoming, and how total immersion may become a reality.

It's so hard to wrap my head around, but it makes sense at the same time if that is makes sense. 

The 80s nostalgia is a godsend, and his writing just keeps me entertained. It seems increasingly relevant and I recommend it to anyone who wants to be immediately taken to a world where anything in the OASIS is possible.

j4f48s,Book Comparisons: Ready Player One vs Escapist Dream,"As a big fan of virtual reality stories, I‚Äôve always wanted to compare these two books from my shelf because of how similar they are. *Ready Player One* and *Escapist Dream* both tell the story of geeks in virtual reality, with a ton of nerdy pop culture references. While I love both books, I just can‚Äôt help putting them against each other side-by-side.

*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline was released in 2011 and focuses on the story of Wade Watts inside a Virtual Reality MMORPG called the OASIS (but you probably already know that). Escapist Dream follows a similar premise about a virtual reality world that allows geeks to use the powers of their favorite fictional characters from comics, games, anime, movies etc, to fight each other. It first appeared (IIRC) as a blog in 2016 but disappeared before reappearing as an ebook and paperback in 2020.

Both have similar premises but which one is better? After reading them again, this is the analysis I could formulate.

**Story**

Both stories take place in virtual reality worlds for geeks, but their plot points are vastly different. RPO is a typical GameLit story with video game-like mechanics and competition. Hence why it is written like one big tournament. It‚Äôs filled with a lot of puzzles, tactics, adrenaline and strategies. ED is different since it focuses on hard drama and emotions. It starts off wacky at first but gradually becomes more emotional as you learn more about the characters. There were also a couple of plot twists and had a beautiful Chechov‚Äôs gun moment at the end.

Stakes in the story are also different. The stakes of RPO come from its competition since it takes place in an MMORPG. Sure, the competition became more lethal with the arrival of the antagonist, but the main goal was always the same: Win The Game. ED on the other hand didn‚Äôt have any competition. ED‚Äôs mechanics are more complicated to explain, but think of it as like Minecraft where everyone can do whatever they want, limited only by their imagination. But it then turns into a survival story as viruses start infecting the place and turn a few people nuts.

When it came to their stories, both were interesting. Escapist Dream was more unique but Ready Player One‚Äôs story was pretty good too.

**Characters**

Let‚Äôs go with RPO first, especially with Wade Watts whom I have a love-hate relationship with. He‚Äôs a pretty cool and smart nerd but there were times where I just got pissed at him. It was fun reading about how he completed a puzzle or a quest, but I loathe how he can sometimes sound like a braggart. Like dude, I know you‚Äôre smart already, no need to be an ass about it (especially when it comes to your nerdy obsession, ex or about religion). He‚Äôs also kind of a hypocrite. Like he criticizes his rivals when they use teamwork to complete a task, but it‚Äôs okay when he‚Äôs the one who needs assistance. The other character, James Holliday, was a well-written character who I pity as his childhood and personal failures were unraveled. RPO‚Äôs minor characters on the other hand were meh. Aech‚Äôs pretty cool, Art3mis is a jerk, and the two Japanese geeks are written off as cringey Japanese stereotypes that they made me laugh.

ED had two main characters: a geeky teenager named Charlie and a programmer named Jim. The first character, Charlie, is the complete opposite of Wade Watts. He‚Äôs so sweet and humble that he just makes you want to hug him like a little brother. The other main character, Jim, is pretty much like a satire of most LitRPG characters. He‚Äôs so powerful and uber-talented but also so damaged and vain that you seriously do not want to be him even with all his talents. The minor characters in the story were equally interesting, although I wish the author gave them more time to shine like Andy and The Wiz.

In my opinion, ED had better written and relatable characters. You can see in the writing how interpersonal the story is and how it makes you sympathize with the characters. It takes its time to introduce each of them in the first two chapters, and it does make the book start slow. But it was worth it since before the mid half, you pretty much knew and established a relationship with them. I ended up caring about them and all they had to go through until the end.

**Worldbuilding**

Cline, though sometimes a bad writer (Nerd Porn!), knows how to use his descriptive words well. The guy is talented in stringing complex words and nerdy trivia to describe what OASIS looked and how it operated. He also did a great job when writing about rules on magic and science, and let‚Äôs not forget how he managed to describe a game of *Tempest* in prose form. Even the funny and cringey writings were written well (like the hilarious part about how evolution, masterbation, and geeks are all intertwined).

ED's author Louis Bulaong is a good writer and I can see how he doesn‚Äôt shy from using transitional words to create flow in his writing. But I just think he could have done more in expanding his novel‚Äôs rules and environment. The writing is simple, game mechanics were hard to understand, and there were also some parts of the book that made me scratch my head. For example, ED takes place in the near future, to the point where a virtual reality machine can fit inside a teenager‚Äôs room. But how come laptops and phones still exist?

**Pop Culture References**

Both books are famous for their nerdy trivias and all sorts of references. RPO focused more on 1980s geek culture while ED had a more modern set of pop culture references. Which one of them is better? Probably neither since Warren Ellis did a better job in *Planetary*. But even so, *Escapist Dream‚Äôs* pop culture references are, in my opinion, more tolerable than *Ready Player One*.

Ernest Cline has a habit of mashing his references to the point of making a hodge-podge mess. He even combines references that are different, like combining a Delorean with Ghostbusters (and the way he described it in prose was laughable too). At least in ED, the references are better integrated and tied to the characters and setting, rather than just throwing them at every paragraph. For example, if the character is an otaku, or the story takes place in an anime-like setting, then expect anime-related references, nothing more and nothing less.

**Final Verdict**

It‚Äôs hard to decide which book is better, but if you‚Äôre looking for a straight up adventure GameLit and LitRPG then *Ready Player One* is the better choice. The world building is better, the game mechanics was better, and it was a fun ride even with all of its flaws and character ego. While both have typos or grammar errors, *Ready Player One* is more polished in my opinion compared to its self-published counterpart.

But I admit I had a much more emotional experience when it came to the *Escapist Dream*, because of its slightly superior story, better use of references, and way better characters. It made me sympathize with all the horrible things the main characters had to go through in the story. It had wacky scenes, but when things got serious, it really did get serious. It was definitely a more interesting read.

For those who have read the two books, what do you think of my comparison? Which one do you think is superior?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j4f48s/book_comparisons_ready_player_one_vs_escapist/,2020-10-03T13:36:34Z,2,6,books,Ready Player One,POST

It was a bit nostalgic for me but seeing as I was really too young to be able to fully embrace a lot of the vintage games and such but not so much that I didn't at least get some of the nods.  It was definitely more of a hardcore 80s nerd book and not so much for the 80s pop culture although it still had some of that.  Overall, I quite enjoyed it.  I think I may read The Martian next.

4lz6lx,Am I the only one who didn't like Ready Player One?,"Everyone on the internet seems to love this book. Steven Spielberg is even adapting it. And I was ready to love it.


But after reading it, it felt just like a bad YA book with some 80s references slapped on to trick older readers. The main character was pretty insufferable insert character. (if you need any proof, at one point he shames a bully by knowing more 80s trivia) The 80s references actually worked really well when they were influenceing the plot, but a lot of times the author just rambles about things he likes. 


Overall I did really like the ending, and the easter egg hunt was fun. I didn't think it was a terrible book, but I can't say that I loved it either. I do look forward to the Spielberg adaption because I think there's a good story here, its just buried.

7j4hfn,I Can't For the Life of Me Figure Out if I Like Ready Player One.,"On the one hand, I'm a sucker for cyberpunk, sci-fi, lit RPG books.  I love the Sword Art Online series (specifically the books, never was a big fan of the anime) and although not directly a book series, .hack as well.  I'm a gamer first and foremost as well, so books that capture the love I have for games written by an author that seems to understand games is something that I'm always eager for.  So you'd think Ready Player One is a perfect match for me right?

I don't know if other people have had this problems with books, or entertainment media in general, but there's a constant ""something about this isn't right"" with RPO for me.  Like it has all the elements of something you like, but the whole doesn't come together like you wanted it to.  Having just watched the new trailer for the movie, all these feelings came back to me and I wanted to write them somewhere, I didn't want to go to r/readyplayerone since I wanted discussion a little more impartial so here I am.  If this isn't the appropriate place for it, please let me know where is!  I don't venture outside of a few gaming related subreddits so I'm never sure where the right place for my thoughts are.  

I think my two main problems is the reference material and the design of OASIS itself.  I was born in 91, I missed the 80's by a hair.  So while I'm aware of a lot of things from the 80's, it doesn't resonate with me like it would for someone that was born in say, 81 and grew up through the 80's.  If this book was a love letter to the 90's instead I might feel differently.  Alongside that, I feel like that era of gaming is the low hanging fruit of references, like gaming has never evolved past the arcade era of ""get the high score!""  I'm going to avoid spoilers for this, but if I may reference a few references, of COURSE they reference Adventure, of COURSE there's something special about getting to the kill screen in Pac-Man.  There were a few deep cuts that surprised me, like Zork, but for everyone of those there's an obvious one that feels like it's just there to illicit the gif of Captain America from the first Avengers going ""Hey, I got that reference!""  

I can admit that maybe this book wasn't written for what I'm nostalgic for.  I'm not really a big of fan being super good at arcade games to the point where I could compete in something like this.  Not to mention that 80's pop culture outside of video games is over my head.  I'll admit, I've never seen WarGames, I had to stop reading and Google what the hell that movie was about.  (Honestly I might watch it sometime, but I digress).  I just feel like by the end of it, it sounds like it's trying to justify itself on some subreddit looking for validation rather then using it to service the story.  

My other issue is I feel like OASIS would be an awful product if actually released.  Much like the design of the book, it's a hodgepodge of tasteless references, except a lot of it is user generated, which means an even more exponential rate of crap to actual quality content.  It's not even so much a game as it is a weird Second Life life sim game, which to be fair does service the plot, but it's rare for me to find a book of this style where the actual game seems like it'd be a fun game on it's own.  And for it to be so casual widespread, it has an absolutely, Dark Souls level brutal punishment for death.  I like that it raises the stakes in the story, as in game death can be almost just as bad as getting killed IRL, but it's questionable game design.  (I won't say bad, since some people eat that up)  

And yet, despite writing paragraphs on things I don't like about this book...  The thrill of the hunt and the likable characters had me hooked to where I finished the book in just a couple of nights.  It's well written, and to someone that maybe grew up in the 80's and hasn't really kept up with gaming since the arcade/Atari days, I can see this being an awesome book that my nitpicks wouldn't even surface in their mind.  But I just...  Everytime I think about this book it's this weird clash of ""Oh, I liked that...  But boy were there a lot of things I DIDN'T like about it.""

So there we go, sorry for the extremely long post.  Feel free to post your thoughts on the book as well, I know it's popular but I'm not sure if I'm the only one that's had these problems with the storytelling and structure of the content.  And if there's a better place to have this discussion, let me know!  I wanted the best neutral ground for this as possible, so here's where I initially ended up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7j4hfn/i_cant_for_the_life_of_me_figure_out_if_i_like/,2017-12-11T19:17:20Z,29,6,books,Ready Player One,POST

hphvt6,Why was Ernest Cline able to profit off other intellectual property with Ready Player One?,"Don't mean this in an accusatory way or anything. Just genuinely curious.

I'm assuming he did not acquire the rights to all of the intellectual property in his book, as that would be a staggering amount of money for an up and coming author. So how was he able to create a story with all of these trademarked things, go to print with it, and profit from it?

It's not like you can just print fanfiction from established universes and profit off of it, so how did he do it? Or am I completely mistaken and he did in fact acquire certain rights ahead of time? I've been researching but haven't found anything other than the movie acquiring rights.

**Edit:** People are saying it's fine to reference things in an original story, but some of the scenes in the book are not merely references. Full, verbatim recreations of movies like WarGames and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Is that the loophole for publishing fanfiction, that's it's just a ""simulation""?

78vtlw,Decided to bow to the spam and try Ready Player One...,"The book is interesting, if poorly hacked together.  There are some very obvious places where pieces of the story don't really fit in the details.  I'm not reviewing the book here, but anyone who read the book will know what I mean.

Then I started noticing the tremendous number of links between the book and Sword Art Online (the short stories from ASCII Media Works published in 2009, not the anime series spawned by them.)

Seriously?  Has nobody else noticed that?  The movie deal came ridiculously shortly after a massive ad campaign promoting the published book.  Nobody, and I do mean *nobody* who publishes their first book gets this kind of response until they get famous... he gets it immediately?

He's also a massive manga and anime fan, has been known to read these publications for years before he gets RPO published, and looks like a total neckbeard.

I'm calling it, this is a blatant attempt to steal someone else's ideas to avoid paying royalties or making a book deal with the publisher.

I did a little googling and sure enough, all the cheap sell-our-souls-for-money publications like gizmodo, medium, illpromoteyouformoney.com etc... are running smoke-screen pieces to obfuscate the obvious rip-off.

4ryc86,Just read Ready Player One and this is why I really liked it,"Deadpool. This book is the Deadpool of books for me. My two favorite superhero movies are The Dark Knight and Deadpool. The Dark Knight was so praised because of things like character development and meanings that go deeper than what is just put on the screen. The dark tone and storyline of the whole movie kind of set the standard for how to make superhero movies ""great"" as opposed to just ""entertaining.""  If I had read more science fiction-fantasy novels, I'd be better suited to name its equivalent in book form. But since I haven't read that much, I'll leave that up to you guys. Deadpool, however, has no character development or deeper meaning. The storyline is VERY linear like Ready Player One. The villains aren't really all that complex as much as they are an object to direct the hero's anger/revenge.

7d0s2h,"Ready Player One is a must-read now more than ever, especially pertaining to the EA debacle.","For those gamers among the book-reading crowd that are not keeping up with the times, EA recently destroyed their good PR with a [disappointing remark](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?sh=80f05230&st=J9XTO4QJ) that ended up being the most downvoted comment on Reddit to date. The subject matter was deeply rooted in extreme displeasure against the normalization of rampant microtransaction implementation in the majority of modern big-budget games.

This turn of events reminded me of Ernest Cline's Retro-fueled Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel: Ready Player One. More specifically, it reminded me of the main villain of the story.

Without giving too much away, the villainous company Innovative Online Industries (IOI) run by the ruthless Nolan Sorrento is very much akin to the EA we have today. While it's obvious that he stuck with 80's pop culture, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Mr. Cline was inspired by EA's business practices during the writing process.

In the book, the ultimate goal of both IOI and Sorrento is to obtain full ownership of the MMO universe known as the OASIS in order to implement microtransactions for nearly every important aspect of the game. This is a huge motivation tool for the main protagonists' fight against the establishment. Implementing these fee's is seen as a perversion of the game itself and a ploy to allow the highest bidder to win against others. It structures this anti-corporate message as a fight against capitalistic evil.

This is something that's already begun in modern gaming. It doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon, either.

Also, Spielberg's film adaptation of the book will be arriving next year. It will be interesting to see more people make the same correlation when things become clear.

7k9dzl,I just finished Ready Player One in 5 days and here's what I think...,"I was really excited to read this book. I'd heard about it when it came out and the hype around the book didn't really interest me at the time, but when the trailers started for the movie adaptation I began to itch to want to know what the book was all about. It looked fantastical in a way I definitely became interested. So I got the book and read it in 5 days. It was a pretty quick read and I was hooked right off the bat. Of course the book isn't perfect by any means. It reads very much like a young adult book and reminded me of reading Hunger Games in my need to want to finish it. With that being said I felt it was fun but kind of lacked in a lot of the development I would prefer in a really great story. 

If you haven't read this book yet then you're going to want to stop reading this review now. I'm going to spoil a few things if you haven't! 

My overall feel is this is a story about the OASIS that highly relies on nostalgia to hook the reader. While I appreciate this I think it's kind of a played out theme and the story itself can't really stand on it's own if you strip all of the references out of it. For me it was class in learning about some old games and tv shows I didn't have intimate knowledge about. That was fun, but those expositions were huge chunks of the book that I felt should have been supplemented with explanations of the actual world we are reading about itself. I would have loved to seen the idea of everyone's obsessiveness with this 80's nostalgia explored a little more and how that is problematic for the society they live in alongside these long explanations. To me I love that as an idea because our society works that way. Younger generations get obsessed with something from the 80's or 90's and attach some new meaning to it. People who are older look at them with disdain for not having been there when it happened and not understanding why it was so impactful. It creates a disconnect in my opinion. Something that could have been explored more in the book if we had a secondary perspective other than Wade's. But I guess this story is solely told from his perspective so it's already a bit tainted. Like a recollection from his memory of the events that may or may not have played out the way he tells it. 

The character development was just enough to make me interested but not enough to make me cry. Basically I hold relationships and character development very high in my opinion on whether I think a book is beyond great. We know Wade the most and we get glimpses of the others he interacts with. That's all well and good, but his obsessiveness to certain aspects in the story, like his creepy stalking love for Art3mis, are somewhat inconsistent in my opinion. There love affair was not full explored and honestly took away from what I wanted to read, which was his adventure through the contest. The whole first act developed so naturally to me that I had a hard time putting the book down until I got the Act 2. From there everything seemed to be told quickly like it was a race to get to the end of the story. So he gets dumped by his obsession, spirals into a depression, then decides to focus again and gets fit in a couple of months. It just felt like an unnecessary side-step and too much was being crammed in without enough time to breathe. I really loved the first act of the book but once it got past there it got a bit redundant and boring, I was skimming through to find a place that I was interested in reading about. Then the rest of it just seemed to fly by. So much more time could have been spent developing certain relationships instead of conveniently moving things along. I would have loved to get a little more into how he acquired the IOI codes and his planning process of breaking into their system. Reading about him plotting as it was happening instead of an afterthought would have been much more impactful to me. 

All in all though the book is a fun read. The world is cool, I just wish it would have been explored a little more. I did read the book in five days every chance I could so I'm not knocking it whatsoever. I was just more interested in the world of the OASIS and the contest itself and not so much the relationships between Wade any his group. Maybe a little more focus on how that has effected humanity as a theme, which is very real to us today, would have been more interesting than just touching on it and moving on. But that's just my opinion and I still cannot wait to see this movie! I hope they don't change too much and I really hope they keep the Pac-Man sequence in it. It was one of my favorite pieces to read in this book and the pay off at the end was great! 

I give it a 4 out of 5 and definitely think everyone should read it! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7k9dzl/i_just_finished_ready_player_one_in_5_days_and/,2017-12-16T20:40:49Z,13,9,books,Ready Player One,POST
3arjwa,"A question about ""Ready Player One"" plot (Spoiler!)","Maybe I'm being thick here, but I can't quite figure out why the Sixers bothered pursuing Daito and Shoto when they were getting the Second Key ... and why they bothered to kill Daito IRL.

1. There were hundreds of other instances of the Second Key. Why waste resources on trying to off 2 avatars that weren't even in the lead? (Especially after Daito used the artifact that started to annihilate them). It would've seemed wise for the Sixers to simply retreat once they realized that they were outmanned.

2. When Daito was killed in IRL, his avatar was just about to die anyway. There was literally no point to killing him IRL. It woudl've been a better move to kill Shoto who actually had the Second Key, and hence posed a bigger threat than Daito. 

Was I the only one who thought that Daito's death was pointless from the IOI's perspective? Maybe I'm missing something here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3arjwa/a_question_about_ready_player_one_plot_spoiler/,2015-06-22T22:52:44Z,9,0,books,Ready Player One,POST
4tbm1r,"The real Ready Player One is a scathing critique of nostalgia, escapism, and capitalism","James ""Anorak"" Halliday, creator of virtual reality OASIS and the central hero-worship character for the story, is a captivating villain. Pity that author Ernest Cline never seemed to realize it. 

An entire generation has their childhood stolen. Halliday capitalizes on the desperation of the day to re-live vicariously through billions of hopeless people. Countless people have apparently memorized every detail of the 1980s so that not only the story's heroes but also the off-stage masses have no problem reciting every line from arbitrary 80s films on their first try to pass Halliday's challenges. And make no mistake, Halliday gets filthy rich too. His video game is free to play (""buy to play"" actually for $0.25) but he still amasses untold wealth, no surprise considering the game's currency which he controls becomes the most stable in the world. 

The world is in dire straits. Halliday and OASIS are uniquely positioned to influence the world, we're even told of the political potential of the virtual reality at least once during the story. Instead of giving people a real hope for change, Halliday becomes the best warrior the status quo could ever ask for (if not a retrograde, which would fit well with the books nostalgia). He opiates the masses when the world needs their direct action. Energy is so scarce people can't afford cars or travel and are barely fed, but the entire world is funding a worldwide VR gaming system and all the labor it takes to support it. 

Wade ""Parzival"" Watts, the book's protagonist, makes this callous disregard much more explicit. His greatest aspiration is to acquire Halliday's fortune so that he can create a self-sustaining generation ship to flee Earth along with the world's elites. He mocks his love interest ""Art3mis"" for aspiring to use the fortune to help save Earth. Apparently the self-sustaining generation ship Vonnegut is so very different from a self-sustaining generation ship Earth. 

We're told Halliday has Asperger's or autism and Watts is agoraphobic but much more fundamentally each is anti-social and happy to let the world burn. I won't pretend to know their Dungeons & Dragons character alignment. Maybe not ""true evil"" but they each obstinately refuse to do the slightest good.  

Really the only shred of character growth is that Watts, having beaten the video game, says he's not eager to log in at the end. He has somehwat escaped the shared delusion of the game (don't ask him to use the right pronouns for his best friend though, she was a dude in-game) and his life has improved. He becomes the new Halliday, passing up his opportunities to help others to similar improvement. He's handed the Red Button to destroy the OASIS/opiate, but this is a throwaway detail that readers and Watts both disregard. There's no mention of bettering the world, he just doesn't have to game anymore because he acquired the fortune, prestige, and girl. That's real life, just another race to acquire, and the in-game race was a tool to that end. Relationships bear this out most disturbingly. Watts pursues Art3mis just as obsessively and posessively as everyone who obsessively memorized the entire 1980s. 

If the antagonists, the IOI Sixers had won, they would have monetized the video game. The world is dying but Cline chooses video game subscrptions as the real Game Over. The game already has huge costs in labor, time lost, maintenance and energy, (without counting the billions of devotees studying it for no reason). The costs are just heavily externalized and a subscription would end some of those externalities. Perhaps the world would have improved. It seems that dwindling, finite resources can maintain either the OASIS or the Earth, but not both. Instead we're to put all our hopes in generation ship Vonnegut and our true saviors, the anti-social crew who earned their spot by memorizing every Matthew Broderick line without ever knowing they needed to.

38xodn,"Am I the only one that found ""Ready Player One"" and ""The Martian"" incredibly boring?","For real though why got those two books so popular? I've read both, and for me ""Ready Player One"" was just lazy written and to cover that up filled with obscure or less obscure '80 references and boyhood fantasies and basically just a slimmed down version of ""The Otherland"", it felt like watching ""I love the 80's"" on a VHS. It felt more like a book aimed specifically towards those people who are 30y or older and maybe that's why I didn't really had that feeling I was reading a good book.    
   
The same with ""The Martian"" it was incredible booooring to read for me, it read like someone tried to write a book but then just said ""Ok fuck it, I researched all that stuff, let's write a book about just all those facts instead and for the sake of god hopefully we can keep it to one character. Mhh how to do it best."" I felt no connection to the main character or any of the other characters ever, if any of them had died I would not have dropped one tear. Wait, did he die in the Martian? Damn I don't even remember because I think I never finished that book, I couldn't even remember if I had finished it or not so boringly dry it was. Seriously it was ""Oh shit a Problem! It's Impossible to solve!"" <-> ""Oh wait I can solve it by XYZ"" Oh and the author of course wrote the character to be overly sarcastic and edgy with flat jokes every now and then so reddit dry-humped him and reading the passages of him hating on the stuff his crewmates brought with them just read like a teenager hating on hiphop because he loves some obscure underground metal.
    
**TL;DR: Books felt like ""50 Shades of Grey"" aimed and written specifically for a group of people, and despite being incredible bland and boring got praised to hell and back to heaven.** Never felt any connection to the characters in either of the books, I feel like a guy not understanding the appeal of ""50 shades of grey"" so many people seem to have. It felt like a Twillight for nerds, with really poorly written story and characters and that they only got popular because of the subject matter. Basically the same as 50 Shades of Grey.

3afrlf,"Just Finished ""Ready Player One"" and Have Very Mixed Feelings. Anyone Want to Discuss?","I finished READY PLAYER ONE in just three days, sneaking in chapters in between breaks and on my commute. It's undeniably a fun book, yet I find myself cringing as I read some of the stuff in it.

I think the OASIS is simply the best thing about the book. The concept is definitely not new (hey, Snow Crash!), but I thought the detail that Cline put into the different worlds, sectors, zones, etc. was incredibly fun. Who can resist a cyberpunk Blade Runner world?

The plot was fun and suspensful. Cline really kept the hits coming when the players approached the third level of the game. That's pretty impressive right there, especially the little ""surprise"" that the Sixers had.

Here's where I fun in a few problems:

1. To be honest, I felt zero emotional authencity in this book. Of course, I know I can't expect soul-searching from a YA book about virtual reality games, but .... I dunno, did anyone else feel like Wade, Aech, Art3mis, Daito, and Shoto were flatter than paper? When they were faced with the possibility of real death--as in IRL--they remained more concerned aobut the game. Of course, this could just be a reflection of how invested they were in OASIS, but still.

2. After a certain point, the number of dei ex machinas became RIDICULOUS. Wade just happens to have a maintenance suit, just in case, and a tidbit of knowledge about Halliday that nobody could've had guessed, etc. 

3. Ok, this is a total petty point, but the use of ""obviously..."" and ""it was obvious that..."" really started to piss me off after a while. Did anyone else notice how often Wade repeats this? And felt a bit patronized? 

Overall, I thought it was definitely a fun book with some serious flaws. Any other thoughts/ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3afrlf/just_finished_ready_player_one_and_have_very/,2015-06-19T19:49:02Z,15,1,books,Ready Player One,POST

331y4s,"Ready Player One is the most disappointing book I've read, not because its bad but because its so close to being amazing.","Hi guys. I recently finished this book after hearing a lot of good things about it. The book had a lot going for it and in my opinion is on the cusp of being a pop culture classic, it just had one too many missteps. I loved the worlds it created, both the shantytowns with the stacked trailers and the virtual utopia many of the characters considered home. I have no nostalgia for the 80's, but I could totally see a contest similar to the one in the book causing a complete culture shift. I am excited to see the movie take on this universe, but I can't quite bring myself to recommend the book to friends for a couple of reasons.

1) Pacing. The first fifth of the book is a nice slow burn that sets up the world. It is immaculate and creates and very believable universe explaining the motivations for nearly every character. The beginning was very deliberate and engrossing. After the first key was found, it was a whirlwind to the slow as molasses middle and then another whirlwind to the finish line. 

2) Terrible foreshadowing (or the complete absence of it). I feel that the author had a lot of (admittedly) cool ideas but didn't know how to present them in an organic way. Either you got a random two pages about the history of an artifact (such as the Catalyst bomb) or there would me a couple of a paragraphs of exposition mid-action to explain what is going on.

3) The god-awful romance. I almost threw the book out the window a la Silver Linings Playbook it was so horribly handled. There was no reason for it, just an internet crush and the protagonist's stilted declarations of love.  It was the most generic, stilted romance I've read and the book really suffered for it.

All in all, I don't feel like I wasted my time. I'm just upset that a truly entertaining concept didn't reach its full potential. Your opinions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/331y4s/ready_player_one_is_the_most_disappointing_book/,2015-04-18T19:04:27Z,27,21,books,Ready Player One,POST
3m3g6s,"Cline should Write a Sequel to ""Ready Player One"" from Aech's POV (spoilers!)","I just finished reading *Ready Player One* and was absolutely taken by surprise by Aech near the end of the novel. But I also felt like it was a missed opportunity. Aech ends up having this elaborate backstory.

3cgt0t,How do you justify these two statements in Ready Player One? [SPOILERS],"I definitely love this book, but I only love it for the story. I don't think the writing is very good, but I keep reminding myself that it's an 18/19 year old narrating it. Here's the most recent section that made me question the book (this is the time period where Wade allows himself to become indentured):  
**From page 288** (paperback edition):  
I didn't test the IOI passwords until the second night of my indenturement. I was understandably anxious, because if it turned out I'd been sold bogus data and none of the passwords worked, I would have sold myself into lifelong slavery.  
**From page 294**:  
Before my arrest, I'd set up a timed funds transfer that would deposit enough money in my IOI credit account to pay off my entire debt, forcing IOI to release me from indenturement.  
  
Am I missing something? Also, this is where I stopped reading so please don't spoil anything further. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3cgt0t/how_do_you_justify_these_two_statements_in_ready/,2015-07-07T20:12:31Z,8,1,books,Ready Player One,POST
6wv7ky,After finishing 1Q84 I have a better understanding of those who don't like Ready Player One,"One of the complaints about Ready Player One is that for those who didn't like the pop culture references, they were distracting from the story. I felt exactly the same way while reading 1Q84. The constant literary and musical references were distracting and broke up the story for me. It got to the point where I would cringe a little every time a new book/author/piece of music was referenced, even when, upon reflection, the reference was useful to the story. Just too many of them.

4z2qcb,If you were kid or early adult in the 80's...this is a must read: Ready Player One,"I just finished this book over the weekend....and it was a great read.  

If you grew up in the 1980's...and played video games, D&D....or even just watched TV and movies....this book will be a nice revisit to the decade that brought us a lot of good memories.

The story takes place in 2044, and the Earth and its population are in bad shape.  Climate change and war have taken their toll and most people live an awful life.  Their one saving grace is they can ""escape"" reality in a virtual world called The Oasis.  Everyone now uses The Oasis and b/c it's become so popular, that virtual money is now even more valuable than the dollar.  

The designer and founder of The Oasis has just died and he is the richest man in the world, but has no one to leave his wealth or company to.  So he devises a contest, based in The Oasis, and whomever wins the contest....gains control of his wealth and The Oasis.  

The founder was enamored with the 1980's.....his teen years.  So the entire contest is centered around that decade.....from movies, music, video games and just about everything else.  

Since there is a ton of power and wealth on the line.....almost everyone, including evil companies have gone into the business of winning the contest...and they will do ANYTHING to make sure they come out on top.

Ready Player One is a fast read......very exciting with tons of 80's references.  Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4z2qcb/if_you_were_kid_or_early_adult_in_the_80sthis_is/,2016-08-22T20:54:45Z,16,0,books,Ready Player One,POST

61jwy4,"I just listened to ""Ready Player One"" and I've had a lot of thoughts about it.","I finished it a few days ago and I'm still thinking about it. I don't think it was great literature, but it gave me a lot to think about. 

Specific thoughts:

There's a fair bit in there about the nature of relationships, about whether you can have a relationship or friendship with someone you've not met in real life. I notice that the book doesn't say whether online relationships are good or bad. It also doesn't conclusively say whether technology connects or separates us from people around us. On the one hand, it connects people with similar interests who would not otherwise meet, but meeting virtually is not a substitute for meeting people in reality.

The descriptions of the school in the Oasis sounded interesting. The visuals that teachers were able to use would be amazing in reality. I've been thinking about what else you could do with VR technology in a school. Imagine the classes you could have with no materials fees. Sculpting with marble, glass blowing, large-scale industrial welding. Imagine a drama program where anyone could play any part by adjusting their avatar (like in the flicksyncs). If there aren't enough students at one school with interest in a particular obscure subject (Dutch, entomology, etc.) you could join students from multiple schools in a custom chat room. 

Wil Wheaton does a great job reading. I wish he did more audiobooks. I wonder what thoughts went through his mind when he had to read out loud that he and Cory Doctrow were the presidents of Oasis. 

I think my favorite scene was where Wade and H meet in real life. When she was nervous and he gives her a hug and tells her he doesn't care who she is, she's his best friend. I thought that was a very sweet scene. 

I wonder how much fun the Oasis will be for Wade now that he has godlike powers. There can't be much challenge in the games with his current stats. Maybe he can temporarily lower his stats for challenges. At least Anorak had his hobby of game making to fall back on. 

A story about immersive video games and 80s references and not a single reference to Tron? I thought the final challenge was going to be on light cycles or something. I was very disappointed.

Flicksyncs sound like a lot of fun. I'd love to do that with a group of friends. 

The focus on 80s lol culture is an interesting one. Some people are embarrassed by the 80s, but you can't deny that it had very distinctive culture. Also broad. You had New Wave music as well as thrash and glam metal. John Hughes movies as well as sword and sorcery and dystopian. It made me think of how influential the pop culture of our childhoods is on us.

However, all the pro/con seems to be either the geek culture, the deus ex machina the overblown 80's references. Why do none of you mention the OASIS? I mean, the idea of a video game which encompasses life like that was just mindblowing for me.

6cexju,"Just finished Ready Player One. Although it shows its age a bit, and has a few flaws, I absolutely adore this book.","Let me start off by saying what I didn't enjoy about this book. Although I initially thought these flaws were fairly major, they were minimized and put out of mind in the third act.     
     
My first problem I have is the audience for this book and thus my confusion over some things, is muddled. Is it for people in their 40s who grew up in the 80s? Struggling to identify with their children now having video games they absolutely enjoy but get too engrossed in? Is it for millenias? Unable to understand parent and finding this unique spin on their video game culture enticing yet easier to understand? Is it for absolute nerds who love any and everything before the year 2000? The answer is all of these and none of these, and in the first act it really feels a little ""How do you do, fellow kids."" to me. And although the audience shouldn't be a factor in my reading enjoyment, it was still a thought that pulled me away from the book.    
     
Second, the book shows its age poorly. It mentions 2012 as the year this came out, and the book was 2011, so this should be obvious. Things such as IOI spying on everyone was somewhat prophetic, although it turned out to be the government. Another little thing to tip me out of the experience.    
    
Third, and finally, although I understand it's meant to be a reflection of specifically 80s and 90s culture, Halladay is represented as someone who loves almost all forms of nerd stuff, and video games. But there is almost no mention of anything beyond 2000, which involves most 3d gaming and many iconic consoles. This feeds back into the ""Book for 40 year olds"" bit. Hell for something supposedly as ingrained as Nintendo is for gaming it barely gets a mention, along with maybe one or two for the PS and Xbox. Nothing of their influence. Just atari and arcade cabinets. Really I think if James Holladay was going to go into gaming he would've included more things related to gaming in his trials. I know it's mentioned he got nostalgic later in life for the 80s but it just doesn't seem fair for someone to write about video game culture as its main motif (along with nerd culture) and then throw away a decade and a half of some of gaming best. Hell, when he's in a giant room full of every video game consoles does he bother to elaborate the Xbox, 360, etc? No. Why does this bother me? Because he mentions about 20 obscure video game systems, and yet neglects mentioning any of the major pillars of gaming. He says Playstations and Xboxs. I realized it might have dated it but at least some mentions would've been nice.     
     
Yet despite all that, I can't help but love this book. The third act really kicks it into overdrive. It's like The Avengers. When  Gog shows up, you start getting hyped, and it doesn't end. Because you know shits going down and it's gonna be great. Idk man maybe I'm just tired but I thought I'd get my thoughts out there before I can't write them down anymore. Tell me what y'all think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6cexju/just_finished_ready_player_one_although_it_shows/,2017-05-21T05:11:00Z,10,0,books,Ready Player One,POST

k8rs7p,Ready Player Two Bad," I waited 9 years for this? Wow! i thought 2020 couldn't get worse. I was wrong.  


Ready Player One was a fun romp. Comfort food and a pitcher of beer with friends reminiscing about the good ole days.  
Ready Player Two was a reheated cheeseburger and fries with yesterdays half empty Coke. Day old Coke gives me diarrhea. TMI? Not good.  


Let me give three reasons why this book sucked.  


A. The characters didn't evolve. Wade turned into Howard Hughes. I didn't root for him.  
2. Weak dialogue with endless description of the surroundings.  
D. The John Hughes movie montage challenge and the Prince challenge were dull and dumb.  


This just wasn't fun. The interaction between the main characters was forced. There was nothing fresh or original about the story.

James Johnson woke up suddenly as ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua blasted on his Gateway speakers, which were covered in holographic power ranger stickers.  As he checked his avatar's stats in his MIRAGE account he warmed up some SpaghettiOs and fed his virtual tamagotchi. He loved his limited edition tamagotchi, which he named ""The Fresh Prince,"" after his favorite favorite show just higher than Daria, Zoboomafoo, and Tiny Toons. As James began eating his Push Pop dessert a familiar voice chimed in. 
""Hey Al, good morning- no need to say Hi! Just say make a wish and then POOF whatdayawant? POOF whatdayawant?"" It was Genie from Aladdin, but in AI form- James had programmed the witty Robin Williams animated character to be his companion and keep him company in his one bedroom apartment. 

""WHAAAAZZZZUUUP???"" James retorted, his tongue protruding out of his mouth much like the poster of the movie Scream. He has been perfecting this greeting just in case it would be tested in the competition. 
What was the competition? Well it was one part GUTS, one part Double Dare, and one part Where In the World is Carmen Sandiego?. You'd had to know everything from the 90s era in order to win the grand prize- that meant memorizing every level of Crash Bandicoot, every flavor of Warheads, every Pokemon and their evolution, and every Backstreet Boy song (though James was more fond of NSYNC and LFO personally). 
James put on his MIRAGE visor and said his password """"Come on and slam and welcome to the Jam"".

1e9m9q,"Finished Ready Player One, loved it so much. (Sorry, I'm sure you're sick of this thread).","I loved this book. I don't read much but of everything I've read, nothing else has kept me this hooked. And the crazy thing is, I'm not even a guy that understands all of the 80s references (and the entire book is full of them). I can't imagine how much more I would have enjoyed this if I was a child of the 80s. But Cline's view of the world in 50 years, scarily accurate by the way, kept me hooked throughout. Plus the descriptive, futuristic, MMO world that is the focus of most of the book, was a fantastic vision of gaming that is both realistic and incredibly entertaining. The other great thing about this book is it wasn't overly long. There weren't the typical extraneous characters that most books have, and it got to the main point quickly (with a few exceptions).

Only downside is the very end didn't keep me hooked for some reason. I have theories why but I won't spoil anything.

9ocop7,Dune by Frank Herbert was AMAZING,"I finally have power again after 4 days of a dark house due to Hurricane Michael. For three of those days I sat on my porch and read Dune until it got dark and then I lay in bed with a flashlight on my chest reading away. Dune is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Paul having to go through all that after his father's death and realizing his part in this prophecy that has to come true was just astounding. The Fremen are the coolest sci-fi people ever, the way most of Arrakis underestimates them and how they survive on that awful planet is so cool. I really thought it was funny that the Atreides came from Caladan this planet with such an abundance of water to a desert planet where water is the most precious resource you can obtain. The Stillsuits are the coolest thing ever too. The way everyone analyzes eachother in italics is a really cool way to write. The major importance of spice and its impact on the universe is wild. The politics, betrayals, and the enemies' pov's were so interesting. My only real let down was the ending, dont get me wrong the big assault on the Emperor's ship was awesome but the way the book just says Paul's son is dead and not showing us and how he gets the Emperor's Court to come to the old Atreides palace just to kill Feyd-Rautha and demand the Princess Irulan, I just thought the book could of had more there. Another thing that let me down was Paul in the end becoming almost a monster and nothing like the way his father ruled, his own mother was afraid of him and she was a badass; also Gurney not getting to kill a Harkonnen was a bit unsatisfying. All these things made the book all the more interesting and I loved them but they were still a little disappointing. This book and all the interesting aspects, like still suits, Mentats, the Bene Gesserit, the Makers, will always be apart of my mind. I'm now going to move onto Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and I have no clue what I'm getting into.

o3inkb,Dune reignited my love for reading,"A little over a month ago, I was with some friends and we visited a book store on Main Street that had just opened. I didn't necessarily wanna go there, but I went in with them regardless. I didn't see anything too interesting, which had been the case since high school, which is when I felt my passion for reading dwindle off until it eventually died. But I did notice something in there, promotional area for the series of Dune. I had heard of it, especially since they are making a movie about it, but I had no idea what it was about. I looked it up, saw it was a science fiction series from the 1960s and thought ""Might as well"" in regards to trying it out. A month and 600 pages later, the passion is back. I now find myself making a list of books I want to read, which I haven't done since middle school.

18odk2x,Dune. Oh my god.,"I have not finished the book. I'm in the middle of the chapter where Jessica and Paul are in the stilltent (just after the death of someone very important)

Just... oh my god. I should not impulsively post this for the dopamine it will provide me but I shall do so anyhow - and let my reptilian primitive mind anxiously wait for the pulsing desire for a rush of pleasure as I open Reddit and see the red color on the notification bell.

The awakening to your brainwashing. Your whole life prepared, the mix of dogmas, conditionings, and indoctrinations all mixed to make the perfect cookie recipe - a recipe of such perfect measures of ingredients that once your tongue tastes it, you are forever bound to its chains.

Poor Paul. And ironically, are we not all in the same boat as him? Prepared our entire lives since birth, bashed in by school, entertainment, TV, Youtube, parents, doctrines, our own impulses, our traumas and heartbreaks, conditionings - the myriad of conditionings - all of them a hammer, hitting the anvil of poor baby innocence to shape the clay of whatever it is we become.

''*I'm a monster*, he thought. *A freak*!''

This book was amazing since the first sentence, but there was so much to take in the first 100-150 pages. Now, however, I am completely hooked. Perhaps this book will be to me what Pauls Bene Gesserit training was to him?

ph712h,I just finished Frank Herbert's Dune and need to talk about it,"So I found an old copy of Dune in a used bookstore a while ago, picked it up for the low price of ‚Ç¨2,50 because I was curious after hearing so much about it and seeing the trailers for the upcoming movie.

My my, what a ride this novel is. I must admit that I am not the biggest literature guy. I haven't seriously read a book since Lord of the Rings when I was 15. It's been about a decade and I've never been a fast reader, but Dune was a page turner. The first few chapters are a bit of a drag to get through, throwing around words that had no meaning and talking philosophy over a needle and a box. But even that fascinate me with some of the ideas and worldbuilding being done. Frank Herbert manages to proof in only a few sentences that you don't need to show or explain things, just a quick mention of a past event can provide all the needed reasoning as to why the world is how it is.

Speaking of the world: Arrakis is one hell of a place. You know Herbert was serious about making Arrakis feel like a real place when there is an appendix detailing the planet's ecology. The scarcity of water on Arrakis is a harsh contrast to the protagonist's home world and the danger of the sandworms is described beautifully. 

The political scheming was also done beautifully by Herbert. The story constantly shifting perspective really allows this to shine as we get to see characters scheming and reacting to schemes from their own perspectives. 

On the downside: Dune is very much a product of its time and there are terms used in here that would never fly today. The general attitude towards women by the world is an at times off putting trend. Many of them are stuck as say concubines or otherwise subservient roles and aren't exactly in a position of independence. And yet an order of women is one of the major powers pulling strings around the known universe. The Islamic influences in the culture of Arrakis would also never fly in the western world and I fully expect the movie to leave out the term ""jihad"" and instead refer to it as a ""crusade"" or something else entirely. 

&#x200B;

Final verdict: I had a good time reading Dune, I see why it is still this beloved to this very day. I would dare and say that Dune is for sci-fi what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy (the amount of times I found myself seeing works like Star Wars and Warhammer 40.000 borrowing elements from Dune while reading was quite high). I will be looking to pick up the sequel: Dune Messiah soon. (Is it as good as the first book? In any way similar?) And I really hope Denis Villeneuve's movie adaptation does well and has more people pick up this book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ph712h/i_just_finished_frank_herberts_dune_and_need_to/,2021-09-03T15:08:03Z,957,4277,books,Dune,POST
hkztym,"Started reading Dune, by Frank Herbert. Wow is it some amazing world building.","I've been meaning to read Dune and the whole series for many years as it seems a classic of the scifi genre and right up my alley.

I feel like this book deserves a reread down the road but for now I just need to take some time to think over the epic story I just read.

iwz6ol,Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune and Lovecraft‚Äôs stories have given me more appreciation for the differences between books and audiobooks.,"Normally I don‚Äôt have a preference between book or audiobook - I just borrow the format that‚Äôs available in my library.¬†


So last year, I read The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories which is a collection of Lovecraft‚Äôs most famous short stories. And that book took me almost two months to read because it was a difficult read, linguistically. Lovecraft‚Äôs style of writing is very complex and his range of vocabulary is insane. As much as I enjoyed some of the stories in the book, I constantly had to take breaks and read something else because this book was exhausting to read.¬†

But a couple of months after reading that book I found a podcast of a guy reading Shadow Over Innsmouth; it was basically an audiobook. And I had next to no difficulty understanding the text. Guessing the meaning of words and understanding complex sentences were so much easier when they‚Äôre being read properly. Maybe this sounds a bit obvious, but the difference was so stark that I just need to mention it. 

On the flip side, there‚Äôs Dune. These days I only borrow digitally through Libby and my library only has the audiobook for Dune and not the ebook. I tried listening to the audiobook on two different occasions and I gave up after a couple of dozen pages both times. I thought this book was impossible to follow. So many characters, so many expositions, and so many made-up words were just dropped on the audience. And barely anything happened in the first two hundred or so pages that the audiobook just felt unengaging. 

But after the Dune trailer dropped recently, I went and bought myself a physical copy. A week later and now I‚Äôm officially a Dune fan. With a book this dense, it was paramount that I read at my own pace and take a moment to swallow all the info. 

TL;DR: If you have difficulty understanding a book at a linguistic level, try the audiobook. Meanwhile, if a book is just so dense with info, read the ebook/physical copy. The difference is way bigger than you think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/iwz6ol/frank_herberts_dune_and_lovecrafts_stories_have/,2020-09-21T12:11:16Z,602,7611,books,Dune,POST

uo1cmv,Dune was just okay.,"I had been meaning to read Dune by Frank Herbert for a while now (many of my favorite authors cited it as a classic) and when the movie came out, I decided I would read the book before watching.

Don't get me wrong. It was not bad, but it was a struggle to finish.

I loved the premise of the world of Arrakis, but I found the character of Paul completely non-compelling. He is highlighted as a 'chosen one' from the very beginning and from the chapter intros you know that he is in no danger of dying by the end of the book. It dampens every dire moment for Paul because you know he won't suffer from the battle. In addition, it seems like every conflict he enters, he suddenly thinks: ""Luckily I was trained for this,"" or ""I saw this in a dream,"" or ""I saw the future.""

My other gripe is the dense worldbuilding. Again, I love worldbuilding, and I know this is part of a greater series, but I kept getting distracted because the author kept throwing out words that I had no prior reference to. Paul is a Duke, but also Kwisatz Hadarach? and Lisan al-Gaib? and Usul? and Muad'Dib? And what is the spacing guild? And the Bene Gesserit?

I knew there was an appendix at the end of the book that could explain, but I didn't want to read anything that might ruin the rest of the story for me. There was obviously a lot of worldbuilding going on, but I was dropped in the middle of it and I had to do inductive research to figure it out.

For a quick comparison, LOTR involved a crazy amount of worldbuilding, but Tolkien didn't have to explain what an elf, a dragon, a dwarf, a Dark Lord, or a wraith was.

My biggest gripe was that the story had so much momentum in the last quarter of the book. At that point, I understood what was going on, the stakes, and I actually needed to know what was going to happen. BUT, it took that long to get me to feel that way. I was not hooked in the beginning, and it took willpower to find the location of the book that I actually enjoyed.

Final Disclaimer: This book was written well. The full series is probably great. I just did not enjoy/get most of it, and these are my opinions on why.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments! Probably going to give the series another go in the future. (I also want to add that the LOTR comparison was not to make any better/worse claims, it was just to illustrate one point that I had trouble with.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uo1cmv/dune_was_just_okay/,2022-05-12T13:40:23Z,216,257,books,Dune,POST

I was intimidated by it's length so i put it off for 2 years when i got it but 2 weeks ago i decided i would buckle down and read it and honestly it's one of the most engaging novels i've ever read. i made sure to read it in short bursts to not burn myself out on it but reaching the end was satisfying, i think it was the largest novel i've read but it wasn't oppressively long, the story was interesting and watching the 2021 movie first kinda helped cause it made me familiar with some of the concepts of the book as opposed to going in blind and not understanding all the unfamiliar words thrown at me. I have the sequel, Dune Messiah, on my shelf and i've started it, about 16 pages in and i'm loving it already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/135boux/just_finished_the_first_dune_book/,2023-05-02T04:58:02Z,88,391,books,Dune,POST
tj0ev1,Reading the Dune series with my Son,"Well, he's reading the books and I am listening to the audiobook version on Audible.

When the new Dune movie was announced last year, my 16 y/o son said he was interested in reading the books. I have them all and have read the 11 book series (6 originals, 3 prequels, 2 postquels) a number of times, so I said I would redo the series on audio since I have a 2 hour commute each day while he read the books.

We are both on Chapterhouse Dune now and although he stalled a bit in Children of Dune, he's loving the new characters and arcs introduced in Heretics and afterwards.

Every day when I get home from work, we will walk the dogs and talk about where we are in the books. He is a little ahead of me since he is a fast reader and he ends up with a bit more time to read than I have of a drive. I love that he comes up with theories about what is coming and we talk about how if Frank Herbert were still alive, how he might've handled the arcs of the prequels/postquels.

I couldn't be more proud so I just wanted to share.

EDIT: Thanks for all the upvotes, awards, and great comments! I told my son and after he was done mocking my ""shamefully low karma"", he asked what series we should do next. Any suggestions? He's a sci-fi kind of kid...he might venture into fantasy but sci-fi is his jam.

My perception of Dune was god of all Sci Books, the dream to adapt well, and a thick book. I for some reason had the VAST misconception that this book might be too dense for me based on some reviews.

I am so glad I bought this book! I have not been this hungry to read-day dream about it at work-read in all your spare time in SO LONG.

This books kicks major ass. I'm a third of the way through and I keep thinking to myself ""this might be in my top 10 of all time.""

y4zzsn,I made it to book 6 of the original Dune series and I tapped out. I just can't take any more of Frank Herbert's writing style.,"I really tried to make it through the original Dune series as it's considered to be a classic, must read by many. To be fair, the original Dune book is very good and I really enjoyed it a lot. God Emperor of Dune was also very interesting. And Miles Teg is a bad ass in Heretics, he's possibly my favorite character in the entire series.

But the writing style (the sequels in particular, the first book isn't quite as bad for some reason) is just so hard to digest! I've never encountered books that are this difficult to read. And I don't mean they're boring, I enjoy Frank's concepts, the setting, the atmosphere, etc...

But I often times found I'd get through a couple pages and only have a very vague understanding of what the hell was going on. Last night I just hit a brick wall early into Chapterhouse and decided to switch to a new book from a different author and the difference was night and day.

I immediately was engrossed in the new book and thoroughly enjoying my ability to easily comprehend what the hell was going on. As of now, I have zero interest in finishing Frank's final Dune book.

In summary: The original Dune books are clearly groundbreaking in many ways. They introduced many unique concepts to science fiction that are still heavily drawn upon today. And I can really appreciate them for that.

zho7t0,I hurt my neck reading Dune,"I‚Äôve just recently gotten into science fiction, I was intrigued by the story but hesitant about the length. When I was gifted the book for my birthday, my whole family mocked me for its length and after 2,5 months of reading, I finally finished it. 

I loved the plot and really enjoyed the complexity of the world and the incredible attention to detail. In spite of many comments I received, I don‚Äôt consider it to be a hard book to read. The politics were never too overwhelming, the dialogue was just right. The uneventfulness is what made Dune a very comforting read; only 2-3 times throughout did I find myself restlessly continuing on to a new chapter, wishing to know what is to occur. Sure, as far as science fiction goes, it is the most static book you could possibly imagine. And precisely that is what makes it all the more human. 

Now onto the neck thing. About two weeks ago, I reached the middle of the book. Wanting to finish it by the end of the year, I decided to isolate myself for the whole weekend, brushing the rest of the world aside to read. I did that, and then I did that the whole following week, and finally finished the next Saturday. 

Then consequences came to bite me in the ass. It has been a week since Dune was done and dusted, a week with a pinched nerve in my neck causing intensely irritating pain, a week of sleeping in a pillow-less bed hoping to anything holy that it might get better next morning. I guess I now know a fraction of the discomfort the Fremen learned to live with in the desert.

tul6c6,Dune!!!!!!,"TLDR: Dune!!!!! If Wheaties tasted like Sweeties

Real talk:
The Dune primary series, 8 books started by Frank Herbert and finished by his son Brian along with Kevin Anderson, are some of the best books I have ever read. 

I think I am more grateful for these books than any others I‚Äôve read, not because they have the best answers, but because they ask some of the best and most honestly selfless questions I‚Äôve ever seen. Both directly and indirectly. While proposing potential answers and solutions. The scale of these questions and their potential impact makes these books some of the most audacious writing I‚Äôve ever seen.

Presenting it as well written, thoughtfully developed, and universally well received science fiction, so distanced in fictional location and time from our factual present, makes it that much more impressive. 

The fact that Frank Herbert published the first book in the 1960‚Äôs honestly makes me wonder if he had some of the prescience he wrote about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tul6c6/dune/,2022-04-02T15:15:57Z,79,114,books,Dune,POST

8pyjt8,[Spoilers]Haven't read a book in years. Just finished Dune and it was a journey.,"I'm not much of a reader. I used to read often in elementary school but my interest in reading waned through highschool and into adulthood. The last book I actually finished prior to this one was Foundation and Empire back in 2013. I had started a few books since, but none of them had kept my interest long enough for me to actually finish them. My attention span is really limited for these kinds of things now since I find it hard to sit down and read when normally I'd rather be watching a movie/show or playing a game. Reading always seemed like a sort of ""active"" sitting activity, in that it required me to pay closer attention to what I was doing whereas movies/shows/games felt a lot more ""passive"" for me. I'm also a fairly slow reader since I tend to read at a pace that I'd expect a narrator to narrate what I'm reading, as I find it more enjoyable to read and easier to retain information like that than just blowing through it all.

But I started Dune a few months ago and man that was a hell of a journey. It was so damn engrossing and kept my attention all the way through. The pacing in the first arc was just slow enough for me to feel the passage of time and the events unfold naturally but not too slow to feel like a drag. It had this slow burn through the first arc, introducing all the characters and the setting and letting you live through the day to day motions of these characters as they made plans within plans within plans to try to protect themselves from the antagonists, which evolved into this incredible tale of the main character's journey through this desolate desert planet and his rise to become a legendary, religious figure. The only issue I have is that it felt like it went a bit too quickly through the events in the second half of the book, I'd rather have had the pace of the first half be maintained throughout, but it's not really a big deal and the book was still fantastic in my eyes. I haven't felt this enamored by a book since elementary school. I think this book might have reinvigorated my desire to read that I lost in elementary school. I can't wait to read the next entry in the series, although I am really tempted to just reread Dune again before I move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8pyjt8/spoilershavent_read_a_book_in_years_just_finished/,2018-06-10T04:30:56Z,249,1281,books,Dune,POST
c6zpgw,So I just finished Dune yesterday. What a trip.,"It reads like a fantasy novel set in the future. That‚Äôs kind of how most old sci-fi reads now, but Frank Herbert went the extra mile with the details.

What I liked:

-	The politics. Dear God, the political climate of Arrakis was perfect. Having to say the exact right thing, dance around your words and not let your tone or face betray you was brilliant. 
-	The Fremen culture. I got a genuine culture shock as I learned more and more about them, especially how they treat the dead. I kept having to tell myself that these weren‚Äôt aliens, these were humans!
-	Plans of terraforming. This was only touched upon, but the fact that there‚Äôs actual plans in place to bring plants and oceans to Arrakis sounds realistic. It would take years, decades even for it to begin taking root, not to mention how much spice it would destroy. But they plan it anyway for the betterment of the people living there over the galactic economy. Wow.

What I disliked:

-	So many terms and new words! I had to bookmark the glossary just to understand what the hell the author meant half the time. Context helped for things like ‚Äúsietch‚Äù and ‚Äúcielago,‚Äù but the rest was gibberish without the glossary for context.
-	Maybe this is a result of Hollywood laziness with too many similar plots over the years, but Paul being ‚Äúthe outsider who becomes leader of the natives due to prophecy‚Äù felt overdone. 

Overall, it was a good read. I‚Äôm gonna wait a while before starting the next one though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c6zpgw/so_i_just_finished_dune_yesterday_what_a_trip/,2019-06-29T14:40:42Z,145,717,books,Dune,POST

18swop7,Final Dune book Conjecture,"After the movie, I've been slowly re-reading the Dune books here and there. After concluding them I'm supper bummed Frank Herbert was unable to write the final novel, but feel like I have some idea where he was headed, and can walk away from the series satisfied.

I'm not too sure what the story line was going to be. Obviously the two godlike Face Dancers, and the
Faction hunting the Honored Matres would provide the conflict. There would no doubt be a few hundred pages of political maneuvering and philosophical meandering, concluding rapidly in the action packed last chapters. Why change the formula at this point?

However, it's not so much the story, but seeing how the overall themes resolved, and where the Golden Path was meant to lead mankind that left me pondering the series. The leason Paul and Leto 2 left, was that prescience wasn't the solution. Despite their good intentions, and view into a near infinite possible future, they were still forced to rule through fear and violence. However, at the end of Chapter House, due to selective breeding, genetic manipulation, and the scattering providing greater variability, there are a number or evolved lifeforms as powerful, or more so than Paul, and likely even Leto 2. Many of them share the ability to tap into past memories. The original memory sharers, the Bene Gesserits are even able to pacify and absorb the feral Honored Matres by sharing this ability with them. In Chapter House, the Reverend Mother reflects that many of their past lives are from those strong enough to pass on their genetic line. The victors and victimizers, and it is in reflecting on the past atrocities of their ancestors that partly motivates the Bene Gesserits to better humanity. Other memory sharers are the Bene Tleixlax and Duncan Idaho clones that remember past clone memory, Face Dancers that can absorb memories, and the Atredies decendants, who powers don't seem to even be fully realized yet.
I think the Golden Path was meant to eventually lead to an evolved state of humanity, where an increasing amount of people are able to tap into a form of past or shared memory, and that it is by looking into the past, not the future, and by not being confined by one's owned selfish ego, that humanity would eventually altered by the Golden Path. 

I don't know if Frank Herbert ever partook of psychedelics, but based on the time he lived, and the things he wrote, it doesn't require a huge stretch of the imagination to think he did. At the very least he must have been aware of them as a concept, and the feeling of interconnection, and loss of self felt by those who are involved is such shenanigans, and it must have been a popular concept at the time. I've lived during our own divided times, and can't say personally though. 
Anyways, these ideas have probably been stated better by other in the past, but have given me some closure on one of my favorite books of all time. At least more than Brian Herbert's fan fiction (of which I have admittedly have read very little of) likely ever would.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18swop7/final_dune_book_conjecture/,2023-12-28T15:36:33Z,18,30,books,Dune,POST

13g5vt,I have a question: is Dune by Frank Herbert worth it?,"Probably Final Edit: I want to thank you all for your incredible input. Really. You have said some great things not only about Dune, but about what defines genres of literature and how I should approach reading novels of different varieties. I've been looking for the wrong things in this book, and I shouldn't discount the quality of the book because of that. 

I'm going to finish reading it, and take your advice into account: I'm going to invest myself in this last bit and enjoy the book for what it is. It might not be my favorite book ever, but reading is not just about sitting back and zoning out into a book; sometimes, it's about pushing your comfort zone and forcing yourself to try new things. Heck, maybe I'll end up liking Dune sometime in the future if I reread it. Thanks, /r/books.

_________________

Here's the deal. I'm probably 3/4-4/5 through Dune (just past the start of part 3), and I'm just not feeling interested in the book anymore.

Sure, the setting is unique, the society set up there is reasonable for the situation, and the tale is told as an epic story of grand political schemes and personal character growth, but I'm just not finding the book to be fun to read.

To me, Paul is cool as a character, but I can't connect to him because of just how unusual he is, and after reading 3 books into the Song of Ice and Fire series, with its abundance of strong, complex females, his mother's character seems shallow and trite.

I guess what I'm wondering is: is finishing the book worth it? I'm already so invested in it, but the book hasn't made me care about the story or what happens to the characters.

Feel free to ask such questions as:  

Are the books worth reading? Which of the books are worth reading? Should the books be read before the new adaptation is watched? Should the previous adaptations be watched in preparation for the new movie? What is a good stopping point? Why does everyone love these books? Why does everyone hate these books?

Or, if you have no questions and just wish to voice your opinion on the series as a whole or bring attention to something specific, you can do that too. If it is Dune related, you can talk about it!

xb2n70,Gender Theory and Dune,"I've been rereading the Dune series lately, and I want to ramble about how it handles gender. This is not a rage, nor a hyped up rant. I recognize it was written in the 60s, there are both positive and negative elements\~ I also haven't finished the whole series, ever, so I can only speak for the first 3-4 books. 

I have a theory that Frank Herbert may have been genderqueer in some way, because while his worldbuilding comes from a very cishet basis, major elements of the plot do explore gender as a more complicated thing. In the first book, the two major psychic factions are the all-male Mentats, and the all-female Bene Gesserit. Early on in the book, Paul is revealed to be receiving training in both disciplines, though he is only expected to become a Mentat. This does not go according to plan, as he ends up as something not entirely understood by the two factions. 

Among the Bene Gesserit he is the Kwisatz Haderach, a title I still don't entirely comprehend after 3 readings, and watching both the older adaptations. It frankly seems like he doesn't have any actual ability beyond regular Bene Gesserit powers, but because he's raised Masculine, he can understand some shady part of the human psyche women can't. Supposedly, that gives him a better understanding of people, which feeds into his prescience, but none of the Bene Gesserit actually show significant difficulty understanding people, despite missing this aspect... 

Among the Mentats he is understood slightly better, since they have a prescient sub-faction, the Navigators of the Spacing Guild. The abnormality comes from that Bene Gesserit understanding of People, where Mentats are based on more logical understanding. Navigators work their prescience on the pure math of the galaxy to chart safe courses between systems. Paul is able to use his prescience on the workings of people, predicting the rise and fall of the very galactic empire.

Paul's very power in the world of Dune comes from his mixture of masculine and feminine traits, and this is not lost on him! When he starts recognizing the change, he mourns it, calls himself a freak, which in a very gender-binary world, is a pretty natural reaction! However, these traits are also what make him into the Dune Messiah! 

Segue!\~

Dune Messiah introduced a new psychic faction, the Bene Tleilax, who are physically both Male AND Female. This is not a mixed group, but a homogenous group of intersex people. Mechanically, they are closely related to the Bene Gesserit, with training focused both on control of their bodies, and understanding of other people. However, they turn these tools around, using them in what the text may describe as a 'masculine' use, shapeshifting and deception. Where the Feminine uses psychic powers fore ultrafine control over muscle, nerves, and hormones, as well as the detection of other peoples' intentions, the Genderfluid use it to improve their senses, rebuild dead bodies, and deceive others. 

It is interesting to note that, despite the binary being expanded, Paul is still outside of the established groups. He does not show the chemical control of the Bene Gesserit, and when he tries it in the first book, he is comatose for a long period. He does not show the perfect deception of the Bene Tleilax, as even when believed dead in the third book, half the population suspects his alter ego is actually him. Among the Mentats he is also still unusual for his ability to properly function on Instinct and Emotion, which are generally the weaknesses of the male Mentat faction. 

Children of Dune vaguely introduces the Pre-Born as a psychic faction, but not a gendered one. Only three of the Pre-Born are involved, the titular Children of Dune, Paul's own twin children, and Paul's sister. Children are an apt description of this group, as the Pre-born are marked by their precocious beginning, thrust into awareness before being born, effectively becoming reincarnations of all the memories shared with them. 

This does not seem to affect gender very much, interestingly. Paul's sister, Alia, trains herself for the female Bene Gesserit, and falls to the greatest weakness of the Pre-born, lack of identity, and is possessed, falling into the Abomination faction, a person who is completely overtaken by the genetic memory of another individual. Her possessor is the male villain from the first book, Baron Harkonnen, who in fact may have been Demi-male, since his new existence in a female body does not seem to trouble him overmuch. As a non-psychic, originally, his gender is not explored deeply, so there is room for interpretation. 

This lack of identity is the hallmark of the Pre-Born, and so may be compared to Agender people. Ghanima, the sister of the twins, overcomes this by fabricating an identity for herself through autohypnosis. I am still midway through CoD, but my memory of how Leto handles it is by embracing his identity as a nebulous entity, and learns some tricks favored by the Bene Tleilax because of that. 

I'm running out of steam, but I'm fascinated by the psychic factions and their interactions with gender, and I'm excited to read more of this series through this lens\~",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xb2n70/gender_theory_and_dune/,2022-09-10T23:01:13Z,73,0,books,Dune,POST
1atlh0w,"Just finished Dune, the ending ruined it all for me. (Spoiler discussion for the first book)","**EDIT:  After discussing with some commenters, I have come to learn that many of my issues with** ***Dune,*** **namely Paul never receiving consequences for his actions, are resolved in the second book.  I will read the second book and most likely love both it and the first book much more.  I apologize for the inflammatory nature of this post, and hope I have not offended people too much.  I will leave this post up to provide context for the comments below.**

As the title says, the ending of Frank Herbert's *Dune* thoroughly ruined my enjoyment of the book.  Don't get me wrong, I was deeply enjoying the book for the most part.  Sure, there were some moments that I struggled to get through it, but the worldbuilding and political intrigue were *immaculate.*  I was deeply enamored with the incredibly unique cultures, factions, technologies, etc.  The way that Herbert set up the tense and delicate balance of power between the Emperor, the Landsraad Houses, and the Guild was some of the most interesting political intrigue content I've ever read, and I was deeply curious to see how Paul would game the system for his favor.

Picture this: we are approaching the ending to the book.  The Padishah Emperor (a being who's very name weighs down the conversation in which it is uttered) has arrived to Arrakeen in-person with *five legions* of Sardaukar.  Reminder, it took only three legions to nearly erase House Atreides from the face of Arrakis.  On top of this horrifying military force, the Guild has brought representatives and militaries from *every Landsraad House*, currently hanging in orbit around Arrakis and waiting to be called on by the Emperor.  The odds could not be stacked up more against our Paul.  Therefore, Paul concocts a strategy to invade Arrakeen under the cover of a sandstorm so that the forces in orbit will not be able to see.  This will pit his Fremen against the Emperor's Sardaukar; a glorious battle that will decide not just the fate of this world, but of the entire Imperium.  Truly, this is rearing up to be one of the greatest battles in fiction.

... and then Herbert skips to the end.  Baron Harkonnen is killed by Alia, a character who has no motivation to kill the man (as opposed to Paul, Gurney Halleck, or Thufir Hawat who all deserve revenge against him.)  The Sardaukar are completely and utterly defeated entirely off-screen.  Rabban Harkonnen, governor of Arrakis, is also killed off-screen, which removes the possibility for an epic final battle between him and Halleck.  Then, Paul saunters into the Arrakeen palace, summons the Emperor and his entourage, and proceeds to have an egotistical argument with everyone in the room (friend and foe alike).  His plotline about being a reasonable and kind leader in order to prevent jihad?  Thrown out the window, as he brazenly flexes his superiority and postulates that the offworlders are entirely deserving of suffering and extermination.  Halleck's plotline about dedicating his entire life to get revenge on Harkonnens?  Unimportant, because Paul needs to show off some more and duel Feyd-Rautha.  All of the Emperor's established genius and intimidation?  Reduced to ash to stroke Paul's ego.  I refuse to believe that the Emperor would submit so easily to Paul and give up the throne just like that, but the story needed to end and so a potentially really interesting political battle was just scrapped.

Paul became a full-on Mary Sue at the end of this book.  He knows everything, he can beat everyone in a fight, and his rampant cruelty and egotism are completely forgiven because he's Muad'Dib.  He became the worst possible version of himself, and this is celebrated as a good thing.  He has completely lost the compassion for the common man that his father Leto had (he even goes so far as to encourage the weak townspeople to act as human shields for his soldiers).  He berates his own mother, his mentor Gurney, and his followers.  The only person who he doesn't brazenly disrespect is Chani, yet he still immediately marries a different woman in front of her.

I can see how people would like this ending, as it is a Total Victory for Paul.  Yet, it felt to me like it came way too easy, and that the book deliberately skipped all of the more interesting plotlines just to give Paul an immediate victory over the entirety of the Imperium, Landsraad Houses, and Guild.  This ending felt so cheap to me that it's making me grow contemptuous of the entire book, which I recognize is unfair, but also true.  In my opinion, Herbert fumbled at the finish line here.

And so I write to you all, asking to hear your thoughts.  If you disagree with me, please explain to me how you enjoyed this ending.  I honestly feel like I'm missing something, but I can't imagine what.

I hope this doesn't come across as too whiny.  I am trying to be fair, but I just cannot wrap my head around how this is perceived as a fitting ending to the most legendary Science Fiction book of all time.  As I said, if you disagree with me, please share your thoughts down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1atlh0w/just_finished_dune_the_ending_ruined_it_all_for/,2024-02-18T04:24:47Z,73,0,books,Dune,POST
xjbzd8,Pleasantly surprised with the Dune sequels so far,"I‚Äôm currently on book 5 in the series (Heretics), and I have to say: the sequels are far, far better than this sub told me they‚Äôd be.

Back when I was first thinking of getting into the series, I was told to only read the first book. ‚ÄúThe first book is good,‚Äù many of you said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs a sharp dive in quality after that.‚Äù Some of you were more charitable and said, ‚ÄúWell, books 2-3 are okay, but everything after *that* is atrocious.‚Äù

Well, imagine my surprise when I read Messiah and found that it was not only good, but possibly better than the original novel. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I understand why the first book‚Äôs more popular: it‚Äôs got a more accessible, crowd-pleasing narrative with Paul defying the odds and taking his house from seemingly in ruins to the leaders of the universe. But Messiah takes the time to explore what it actually means to rule in this universe, and make us question whether Paul‚Äôs victory in the first book was even worth rooting for in the first place.

I think Children of Dune was a slight step down, but not by much. It was nice to see Jessica return, and the constant jumps between scheming characters with vastly different goals made the story feel exciting and unpredictable, even though in hindsight Leto II‚Äôs decision seems inevitable. But the thing I really appreciate is how real the passage of time feels in this series: by the time we get to book 3, the planet of Dune has substantially changed; characters from the original book (and the world itself) have evolved naturally over the past \~20 years.

Then I got to God Emperor, which was far and away the best in the series. Emperor Leto is such a fascinating character, pretty much unlike anything I‚Äôve ever read before. You can tell Herbert put a lot of thought into what it‚Äôd be like to have the memories of all your ancestors as well as total control over the entire universe, and managed to present it in a way that was both believable and still relatable. The idea of a giant worm emperor seems so silly on the surface (when I describe the concept to friends, they always seem turned off), but there‚Äôs so much thought-provoking stuff in here as a result.

The idea of only stopping after book 1 seems crazy to me now, because God Emperor struck me as the most important book so far, the one that defines to me what the whole series is about. Herbert seems most interested in exploring the complex moral problems that come with being an effective leader, and this was the book where he really got to dive in deep and let loose with these questions.

I'm only 200 pages into Heretics at the moment, and while I do think it's a step down from the previous book, it's definitely not bad so far either. I also appreciate how the series isn't just repeating itself over and over again in a futile attempt to capture the magic of book 1; each book is completely different, while still building off the previous books.

I'm not sure what these final two books will bring, but for anyone doubting about continuing past book 1 (or 2, or 3, or 4), I can honestly say that I'm happy I didn't listen to the common wisdom. The first Dune book gives only a glimpse of what the series has to offer; seems crazy to me to stop there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xjbzd8/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_dune_sequels_so_far/,2022-09-20T15:33:48Z,62,157,books,Dune,POST

unifzm,Frank Herbert's Dune saga.,"On Christmas of 2021 I had gotten one of the greatest gifts I would receive one of the greatest gifts I would receive: A box set of the first three novels of Frank Herbert's Dune saga!

For the most part I did know about it, but it was mostly of the existence of David Lynch's 1984 film adaptation of the first book (that first book was difficult to translate to film). I didn't know about the actual books until the announcement of the 2021 adaptation of it (the first part of it anyway) by Villineux was announced. And that's when I took notice.

The first thing I put on my wish was the box set of the first three books: Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. Fast forward to Christmas day and I get the set in question! A day later I began reading the landmark first book and was blown away! So many twists and turns!

The story is very engaging as were the two sequels to it (There are more books to this series including those written by Frank's son) and very complex. This series certainly makes me want to watch both the 1984 movie and the recent 2021 film (haven't seen the mini series either). And as a bonus it has also inspired to look at other sci-fi authors that may be of interest to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/unifzm/frank_herberts_dune_saga/,2022-05-11T19:56:34Z,62,61,books,Dune,POST

xk8dqr,God Emperor of Dune has truly awe inspired me,"I want to preface by saying that I am only up to page 195 on GEOD, but I think this is turning out to be my favorite book ever. Hell, I think I'll go as far to say its one of the greatest experiences I have had (including movies, video games, TV shows) being pulled into a world.

What really solidifies this book for me more than the previous entries, or any other story for that matter is just how Leto II is handled. His grotesque metamorphosis into something less and less human, how the subject of prescience is explained, the sheer weight he carries on his shoulders, just everything about this character is so interesting. I dunno, there's just something alluring reading about a 3500 year old omniscient god worm man.

Before reading this book, whenever I saw it brought up as a topic of discussion it seemed like every Dune fan's Marmite - its either their favorite or least favorite in the series. Honestly, I could not understand why anyone could say this is their least favorite. I've heard people say things akin to ""this book is essentially just Leto II spurting philosophical babble in a cave for 400 pages"".

While the book is the most heavy on the philosophical side than the others so far, there is still a cohesive story told in a similar format to the other books. It just seems that more of it is told from Leto's perspective. Personally, I have no problem with this. Leto II is just such an original and tragic character. He projects a very unique form of tyranny due to the nature of this golden path he seems to be forcing on humanity. I would not care if the book was an American Psycho esque take where the book is constantly told from his perspective, that's how much I love this character.

I understand people may not like how Frank Herbert's political and (probably) personal beliefs spill into the themes explored in this book. However, there cannot be any denying just how rich of a universe he created. The book has action in the opening and I feel its paced rather well so far. CoD was a chore compared to this, and I only really enjoyed the last 3rd of that book.

Even while saying that, I honestly think its worth reading the first 3 books just to get to this one. its so thoughtfully written, the language is honestly top-tier. I found myself re-reading passages constantly, because a lot of this ""babble"" genuinely does seem to evoke something within me that wants to find out more about what is actually being said here. I can read some things Frank has written and interpret it 5 different ways sometimes - this book is no exception.

Just wanted to know what other people's thoughts on this book are because I can honestly see myself reading this again",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xk8dqr/god_emperor_of_dune_has_truly_awe_inspired_me/,2022-09-21T15:42:05Z,64,163,books,Dune,POST

1ava3ix,Just finished dune messiah; here are my thoughts,"I really don't understand the hate that this book got from a plot sense. The only negative that comes to mind is how it focuses a bit too much on Paul and not the other characters like chani or Irulan.

One thing that was very noticeable was the drop in quality of the writing. The writing feels as if Frank Herbert wrote a novella but then decided to fill it with bullshit for it to be considered a novel.
Many characters will often say something like: 'a part appears like the whole but it isn't because it has been sifted through the sands of time and faced the maw of one's consciousness. But it is also the whole because of the awareness of oneself'

For lack of a better term, characters just yap throughout the whole book. And these parables that they speak in don‚Äôt add anything to their character. If a character says something along the lines of what I wrote earlier, there is no way of distinguishing who actually said it because the way the sentence was said lacks personality. And it doesn‚Äôt add anything to their character. There was no difference in hayt/duncan‚Äôs proverbs compared to Paul compared to edric and scytale. 

Also did anyone find it wierd that alia is 15 and Duncan is like 30 not counting the years he was dead. Just really creepy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ava3ix/just_finished_dune_messiah_here_are_my_thoughts/,2024-02-20T05:40:54Z,11,10,books,Dune,POST

It seems like it constantly violates the rule of ""show, don't tell"" because it seems like every three paragraphs a character is doing an aside about how they feel about some person or treachery. As a result, the narrative style constantly reminds me of this iconic [Futurama scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE). Obviously it's not poorly written given its stature and acclaim, but I can't help but being taken aback by what seems like a constant violation of the ""show, don't tell"" rule.

The political subterfuge, the vivid descriptions of  the desert and its surroundings. Almost no loose ends left at the end  and a feeling of triumph from the finale.   
Herbert did an excellent  job at portraying the feelings and thoughts of all the important  characters in this classic messianic sci-fi story.  


But what stuck  among others in my mind is that many a-reviews i had read prior to the  book stated or implied that Paul and his men, were the good guys, the  ones being right and fighting the good fight. And i can't understand it.  He is indeed the main character but how is he any good? Except maybe 2  or 3 characters i don't think that anyone in this book can be called  ""good"" in the classical way of ethical, moral, non-psychotic, good  willed human being. It is an excellent story about a justifiable fight  but heroes and good guys? Did not see any and i am not sure Herbert did  either.

First, just to clarify, i watched the movie and only then read the first book. So probably was more easy for me to get through it. Aside from that, i also listened it while i was reading to push it faster.

Now, as for the book content, i liked, but it was so ""meh"" at the ending. I mean, Paul is SO POWERFUL that by the last 100 pages you really can't see anything happening to him. It's just: ""Hey Paul is again bragging about his superpowers and humiliating the GALAXY emperor"" or  ""Hey Paul is gathering forces of course he is winning"". And everything is so predictable. 

Nothing *really* happens that would make us feel: Wow.

So it's more like a good aventure with a boring ending.

Didn't feel motivated enough to start the next book(Messiah). Probably he is going to live more and expand his relationship with Irulan and then something happens in the ending of the book(he gets killed or blind or something). I felt like it would be so boring to be right, that i didn't even start reading it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/137rvu6/finished_dune/,2023-05-04T16:11:49Z,17,0,books,Dune,POST

xho1hh,Giving up the Dune series after starting Children of Dune...,"Dune is one of those series that I've always been fond of, even before reading the books. I've watched all the adaptations (and believe it or not, my favorite was the Sci-Fi mini series from the early 2000s). I read Brian Herbert's books first when I was in high school because they were just an easier read for me. I didn't actually start Frank's books until the last couple of years.

I'm only a few chapters into Children of Dune and it's time for me to accept that I think Frank Herbert is a terrible novelist. I can't stand his prose and his tedious, static storytelling. I got through Dune and took a break before reading Messiah and I only got through the that because it was so short. 

I'm just not interested in continuing the series. I think there are some really cool ideas and obviously Frank Herbert put a lot of thought into it but I just don't enjoy his writing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xho1hh/giving_up_the_dune_series_after_starting_children/,2022-09-18T18:23:08Z,21,0,books,Dune,POST

My favorite part was the internal dialogues of the characters. Their thoughts were consistently revealing, intelligent, and interesting. I'm curious to see how well this type of writing comes across in the upcoming movie.

vzzck4,Why I love Frank Herbert's Dune.,"^(Minor spoilers for the first book)

Frank Herbert's writing is almost completely devoid of descriptions.

At no point in Dune does an omnipotent narrator explain to the reader what an ornithopter looks like.  ~~The reader is never told the color of a crysknife, or how the hilt is decorated~~. Herbert writes about his characters' experiences; usually their internal experiences.  If I recall correctly, Paul's duel with Jamis is written as a stream of consciousness/Paul's internal narration.

For contrast, the Harkonnen invasion of the Atreides stronghold is not directly experienced by any of the main characters (who are fled/captured/killed) and as such receives only the briefest of mentions.  Funny, given it's such a major event in the film adaptations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vzzck4/why_i_love_frank_herberts_dune/,2022-07-15T21:13:36Z,35,82,books,Dune,POST
64cmjj,Opinions of Dune.,"So, I read Dune recently because I've heard that it's one of the best science fiction novels ever written. I though that I'd give it a go and then read the rest of the series. 

I'm not going to lie I think that Dune is overrated. It's not bad by any means. I enjoyed reading it most of the time. The characters were likable and the setting really drew you in.

I did find it to have a slow build up and was annoyed about how abruptly it ended. Especially after how long it took the story to reach the climax. 

I'll probably get downvoted for saying this but I don't mean it as a criticism. Dune felt more like space fantasy as opposed to science fiction in the same way that Star Wars does. It doesn't take away from the novel but it is a mislabel.

After reading Dune I was reminded about when I finally read The Lord of the Rings. I just don't think that it lives up to the hype. I don't think it's bad. I just don't think it's the greates science fiction novel ever written.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/64cmjj/opinions_of_dune/,2017-04-09T11:24:03Z,101,50,books,Dune,POST

After a year, I picked Dune back up and started to read it again from the first cbapter - as I forgot the majority of what had happened. 

I'm now 500 pages into it for a second attempt and am giving up on it yet again. The first part of the book I loved but I feel like when Paul and Jessica become apart of the Freemen I just lose interest completely. I find myself being bored after a page of reading - which is unlike me, so I normally read 20-30 books a year.

12398h2,God Emperor of Dune is annoying,"I really liked Dune, Messiah was a slog to get through, COD was meh but GEOD just left me annoyed.

I've seen posts about how grand and ambitious the plot is, how it spreads over millenia, the philosophical ideas etc etc but I just can't get over the sloppy writing, character development and lack of a plot. 

You often feel out of the loop, as if you're just listening in on some random conversation at a bar. Sometimes just when you feel like two characters are talking about something important one of them abruptly changes the topic or  worse -- the dialogue is just left half finished as if the reader is supposed to infer the rest through..prescience or something. 

This is a typical dialogue

Leto: Moneo, the Bene Gesserit delegation is arriving today. Make sure you only allocate half of their spice quota this year.

Moneo: Yes Lord, but the Ixian's said....

Leto: Moneo, when you have lived like i have, you will see time like pebbles in the sky. Do as I say.

<Moneo's internal monologue>  I need to tread carefully. The worm is OUT FOR BLOOD TODAY!. 

Moneo: As you wish my Lord!. About that Tlelaxiu shipment. If we could only...

Leto: You are now testing my patience Moneo. Send in the Duncan


There are countless examples like this littered throughout the book. I get that Leto's character is complex somewhat by design,  but Herbert uses this a viel for getting away with bad writing imo. I think a lot of praise for this book comes because Herbert is a pioneering science fiction legend. It's like when people pay millions for two intersecting rectangles on a white background because the artist is famous for his other works.

z6ioly,Dune - book & movie,"At the outset, I am not sure whether this belongs in the r/books or r/movies. Having finished dune recently, I just want a space to share my thoughts. So here I go - I saw the movie before reading the book and I absolutely loved it! So i decided to read the book, honestly because I wanted to live in the Dune world for a bit longer.

The thanksgiving weekend came at a perfect time. I was on a road trip and I used all my driving time to finish the audiobook(Also, Dune audiobook is a real piece of work with alot of production value). The movie has done a great justice to the first book. 
The way they set the scene up, adding depth to most characters, even the dialogues were amazing. My fav scenes were the spice collection and the majestic sandworm, just wow!

I would say some aspects had greater gravitas in the book- the desperation for water on Arakis. The book took its sweet time to explain the stillsuits, all the fremen ways to save every drop of water. Brilliantly written!

Overall, I am so excited to start Messiah. I can only imagine it gets better as Paul learns the fremen ways!

P.s - to all who have read all the dune books and seen the movie, do Paul's dreams have any significance to the story?

osbmuz,"Dune Messiah, by Frank Herbert. Better than Dune?","Maybe. Maybe it is better than Dune 1.

I just finished Dune Messiah, the first sequel to Frank Herberts Dune. I made a post here a month or two ago about how I didn't really like Dune 1, mostly due to the characters and plot. 

But Dune Messiah hit most of the notes that I felt the first book missed. 

* Namely, our protagonist now has actual thoughts and opinions now, lamenting his position as a galactic Ghengis Khan, while bemoaning his prescient vision that makes him feel like a puppet on strings. It's striking, how Paul Atriedes spends Dune 1 following his ""terrible purpose"" without any great angst or deviations, only to now have opinions on every facet of Dune, fate, his family and himself. It's fresh and exciting, seeing him express anger. 
* A sense of vulnerability was also introduced quite well to Paul, I think. There's nothing Paul couldn't overcome in Dune 1, whereas in DM, he's the target of a conspiracy to murder, or eternally discredit him. He knows it's going on, he just can't pinpoint the people involved.  
And those few moments where his prescient vision is of utterly no use to him, is also fresh and welcome. It's nice to see him not steamrolling every enemy he comes across, with his merry band of death commandos; Rather, he's now a stagnating universal emperor, and all his death commandos are wasting away in ultra-rich homes, in apathy. Such contrasting weakness is appreciated, universal emperor, with a giant target on his back.
* The conspiracy to kill Paul is interesting. The villains have to do it in a way that ensures that he doesn't die as a martyr, while overcoming Pauls future vision, and discrediting him as a ruler. Those stakes are high, nigh on impossible. It's almost an inversion of the whole heroes mission in Star Wars, only here it's the villains who are the ones trying to ""save the day.""  
* The arc of Duncan Idaho/Hayt was also interesting. It might have been the best part of the book, reviving the man and turning him into a mentat with amnesia... I just think his internal struggle was fresh and interesting, and gave me the same vibes as Dr Yueh from the first book. 
* And that climax? An actual moral dilemma that Paul can't just stab his way through easily? Brilliant! Again, compared to the last book where Paul get absolutely everything he wanted in the end, no questions asked, DM ends with Paul short a wife, eyeless, preciently blind, and lost in the desert. Now, he's just another man, A desert wanderer, immortalized by his people but not revered and deified. 
* It was shorter than Dune 1 too. 

Admittedly, it wasn't perfect. 

* The aforementioned conspiracy was both overly complicated and hilariously simple: The bad guys revived Duncan Idaho, and planned on using him to kill Paul.... Fair enough, until you realize that **they simply expected him to do it**, they forgot to initially add a hypnotic trigger mechanism, or they didn't convince him kill Paul in the first place, they just gave Paul Duncan as a gift, and that was their master plan. They had to come in much later in the story in order to turn Duncan into a manchurian candidate. Whoops.   
* The whole incest subtext between Paul and his sister was odd to say the least. Granted, they also knew it was a messed up plan from the same enemy conspiracy. Still weird though. 
* The statistics of Pauls Jihad doesn't really make sense to me. We get numbers, which I don't remember, but basically, over 12 years, with around a million and a half Freman, Paul lays waste to the universe, killing 60 billion people, destroying 40 religions, and conquering well over 100 planets I believe. The sociopolitical consequences of such ruthlessness are not really explored, in fact, the planet Dune is just bursting with conquered people making a pilgrimage to the Freman's homeworld in religious awe. No talk of the Spacing Guild losing profits from Pauls crazy people, the only resentment in the book is observed by Pauls own soldiers, rather than the conquered people.  Just odd. 
* Bijaz was great. But then they killed him. Introduced, hypnotizes Duncan, dies. What happened to his prescient vision? He was the most interesting antagonist so far, with wit to match ability, he had so much more potential. 
* And there were moments where it felt like Frank Herbert was bored, and didn't want to keep writing, so he just summed things up with a few paragraphs. The discussion between the prisoner Reverend Mother and Queen Irulan are my key example. 

That's what I think.

fkbwyy,Just finished Dune and what the actual frick,"Just recently got into reading (am high school junior) and it was my first book back into the wondrous world of literature. A friend recommended it to me, and I am not disappointed. What absolute perfection in world-building! I couldn‚Äôt believe myself reading the intricacies of politics and religion that a single guy just made through his own knowledge and creativity. 

The thing that stuck with me the most was the repeated reference to missionara protectiva (hopefully correct spelling), and how the whole religion of Fremen and the prophecies to the Lisan al Gaib were fabricated by the Bene Gesserit. It unveiled to me that religion, even the religion we have right now, is primarily a byproduct of holding a person or a group of people ardently in power. It‚Äôs really cool how the book subtly hinted at that and made references to how Paul himself realized he was a sort of biblical figure, with his acts knowingly spread among the Fremen and beyond.

Overall just have to say I‚Äôm amazed, shocked, and sobered. Next I‚Äôm going to read Guns, Germs, and Steel (totally different genre, I know), and use this Coronavirus panic and 3 week break from school to keep on reading.

149iv9v,A Harrowing Requiem for Dune: An Unveiling of Literary Betrayal,"Dear denizens of the intellectual realm that is r/books,_x000D_  
_x000D_  
With a heavy heart and a burdened conscience, I come before you today to lay bare the sordid truth that has plagued my tormented psyche. It is with an almost unbearable aversion that I must embark upon a dissection of the lamentable works that have desecrated the sanctity of Frank Herbert's immortal universe, as if shackled by the shackles of creative impotence itself._x000D_  
_x000D_  
As I pen these words, my soul quivers with disapproval at the sinister collaboration between Brian Herbert, a mere shadow compared to his illustrious progenitor, and Kevin J. Anderson, an opportunistic wordsmith who dares to tread upon hallowed ground. Alas, their unholy alliance has birthed an abomination, an insipid extension of the sacred Dune canon that defies logic, reason, and artistic integrity in its insidious quest for pecuniary gains._x000D_  
_x000D_  
It is as if the very essence of Frank Herbert's meticulous craftsmanship has been ransacked, trampled upon, and replaced with the pale, lifeless imaginings of lesser minds. The intricate web of sociopolitical intrigue that once captivated our collective intellect now lies threadbare, reduced to a caricature of its former grandeur, much like a vibrant tapestry robbed of its vibrant hues._x000D_  
_x000D_  
The erosion of literary depth is a dagger to my soul, piercing through the fragile fabric of artistic brilliance. Brian Herbert, with his audacity and unabashed ignorance, has propelled himself into a realm he can never fathom nor comprehend, attempting to masquerade as a custodian of his father's literary legacy. In reality, he serves as a harbinger of decay, a harbinger of the impurity that seeps into a once-flourishing garden, tarnishing its beauty, and rendering it barren._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Let me not mince words: Brian Herbert is but a profiteer, a vessel of greed, trading on his father's illustrious name to line his own coffers. The very thought of such an affront enrages my spirit, as I bear witness to the gradual dilution of Frank Herbert's unparalleled brilliance, a masterpiece obliterated by the indelicate strokes of mediocrity._x000D_  
_x000D_  
What was once a symphony of unparalleled intellect and philosophical depth has been reduced to a cacophony of insipid platitudes and empty rhetoric. The incisive exploration of power, religion, and humanity's intricate relationship with its environment has been usurped by facile plot devices and superficial characterizations._x000D_  
_x000D_  
Dear fellow scholars, I implore you to reclaim our collective sensibilities and eschew the pandering embrace of these literary deceivers. Let us rekindle the flame of discernment and rally against this egregious travesty, exposing it for the ignominious farce that it truly is._x000D_  
_x000D_  
In the name of the literary giants who have paved the way for our intellectual growth, I beseech you to turn your gaze away from this unholy union of intellectual poverty and monetary opportunism. Rise, my brethren, rise against the discordant hymns that defile our beloved genre, for only through our collective voices can we hope to salvage what remains of the Dune legacy._x000D_  
_x000D_  
May the echoes of our indignant proclamation reverberate through the annals of literary history, serving as a testament to our unwavering commitment to the pursuit of true artistic excellence. Let us join hands, arm in arm, as we march forth into a future where the sanctity of Frank Herbert's magnum opus shall forever remain untainted by the grasping hands of charlatans.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/149iv9v/a_harrowing_requiem_for_dune_an_unveiling_of/,2023-06-14T20:54:49Z,25,0,books,Dune,POST

# My interpreation of DUNE and DUNE: Messiah's ending and character arc for Paul

To me, the story of Paul Atreides is a sort of classic rise and fall story, that doesn't neccessarily have a tragic ending. While Paul eventually does fall from the position of power, it's his own choice. Here is a character who we meet during his early 20s, facing that since the idea of his conception was born, there was a path intended for him to walk on. He struggles to accept walking on his path but circumstances and the need to survive eventually launches him on this path all the same - and he becomes Emperor of all mankind across the galaxy, a sort of demigod who can foresee the future and therefore his rule eternal. I loved the idea that this actually bothers him, and as years and decades pass he suffers more and more from being unable to live his life the way he wants to: to be a loving husband to Chani, and live with the immesurable weight of ruling the entire galaxy thrown off his shoulders so he can be finally free of it, and become a father. Which of course, happens but not entirely as he foresees it, and that is the cataclysmic event in both Messiah as a book and in Paul's life. He expected Chani to give birth to a child, but instead she gave birth to twins - which Paul could not foresee. The emotional weight and beauty of his relief, to me, hit with the strenght of an avalanche. He can be wrong. Intial shock to both Paul and me. He can be wrong. The thought settles in. He can be wrong! As I imagine him smiling with joy as Frank Herbert subtly unfolds the whirl of emotions he goes through, I find myself being just as happy for Paul: he was finally free. He found a true justification to leave everything behind, because if he isn't infallible, if he isn't unerring, then the duty he thought to be his - to use his abilities and power to lead humankind towards it's best possible future - is not his at all. That weight was finally off his shoulders. However, Chani died during childbirth. Suddenly the life he wanted with her was no more, and he found himself void of purpose, and he realized: this is life. Letting go, of control, of influencing the future he foreseen all his life. Would all this had happened, had he not foresee them? By traing to avoid certain events he thought he foreseen, maybe he orchestracted them happening unintentionally? This cannot go on. This must not be allowed to influence and control the future of his children and by extension, mankind itself. In uncertainty lies infinite possibilities. He wanted this freedom and chaos, this lack of control, the natural course of life to return to the galaxy, realizing how wrong he was all this time, fearing the thought of the damages he has caused to humanity in his hubris, ruling with an iron grip. He really believed all his life, that he is doing what's best.

So he chose exile. Without supplies, he wanders out into the desert, alone, blind both literally and figuratively, happy and content, welcoming death, so he can finally rest. It was a beautiful ending for Paul Atreides, in my opinion.

# The friends we made along the way.

I want to put the sidecharacters in contrast of who they are in DUNE and DUNE Messiah, and how DUNE: Children of the Dune made nearly all of them act absolutely unreasonable and against the very core of who they are, and in the center of it all are the children of Paul, the living embodiment of pointlessness (Ghanima) and the author's ludic daydreaming self insertion of thought farts (Leto II). But let's go through in order.

* **Duncan Idaho:** Loyal servant to late duke Leto Atreides and his entire family, a friend and sort of mentor to Paul, he died protecting the young Paul against the overwhelming sardaukar assault that tried to wipe out House Adreides. Resurrected and brainwashed as Hayt, an agent of Ix who's very purpose of existence was to earn the trust of now Emperor Paul, get close and assassinate him. Instead, despite the thorough training and programming, his original personality - soul if you will - breaks through and Duncan Idaho, now also a mentat, truly returns and remains an ever loyal friend and bodyguard. In Children of the Dune, Duncan is banging Paul's sister, Alia. When they grow apart and their relationship gets cold (because Alia's mind was secretly overtaken by baron Harkonnen who's genetic memories live on in her DNA) and ""Alia"" cucks him, he goes to Stilgar, and trashtalks him so hard, so relentlessly and deeply offending him on purpose to get himself killed, that Stilgar eventually kills him. Why? Because Duncan wanted to piss off both ""Alia"" and the fremen, his intention being that the latter will turn their backs on Alia and eventually rise up against ""his"" rule. Because simply explaining the situation... would've worked all the same, but Herbert has a thing for killing Idaho and writing a disappointing ending to all characters in this book.
* **Gurney Halleck:** Another forever loyal servant and friend to both Duke Leto and Paul, another mentor figure to Paul. He always was old and reclusive, but became more so after the events of DUNE and DUNE: Messiah. The loss of Leto and Paul broke him, he became tired of just all of it and travelled back to Caladan...... where he is banging Lady Jessica. Appears so that every trusted old friend of Leto is hellbent on banging either his ""widow"" (technically never married but still...) or his grand daughter. What the hell? Why write highly honorable characters who hold tradition and family, loyality and morals in high regard if they become puppets of the author's questionable age gap justification sex fantasies?
* **Lady Jessica:** Lover of the departed duke Leto, mother of Paul Atreides. So far she is the only reasonable character, spending the first half of the book doing precisely nothing but being terrified of Leto II, because he is as wise and cunning as an old man at 10. I don't quite understand why is it a shock to her, because the exact same thing happened to both herself and her daughter, Alia. Once she discovers that Alia is beyond saving after the baron's corruption, she leaves Arrakis to teach the son of the Padisah Emperor, the heir of the previous dynasty Paul usurped. This was a pretty cool part of the book, and I admit I am at fault for not remembering why she opposed her own grandson's transition to the throne but propably had a good reason (forgive me I've finished this book like 6 months ago)... and even if Leto II was scary as hell to her, why not support Ghanima instead of the sworn enemy of your family?! What makes a raging power hungry vengeful teenager who sold out his own mother at the first chance of getting training and power a better candidate?
* **Ghanima Atreides:** There isn't much to say about Ghanima sadly. She is of course another mixed personality copy of Jessica / Paul / generations of fremen knowledge, with her own personality added to the mix. Which is mostly, being silent and relatively comfortable to be around. The definition of a wasted character. Jessica's role in the first half of the book is being the reader: someone who can Leto keep on his/her toes by secretive nonrevealing monologues that borderline on ""wannabe smug edgelord"" syndrome. Leto has to talk to somebody, who just sits there, does nothing at all, and recieves all he has to say. However, Ghanima's role doesn't go beyond this whatsoever in the entire book. I am dead serious, her entire existence has no reason (other than another incestous fantasy of Herbert being mentioned a couple times), she does nothing, is kept in the dark by everyone, and watches as a bystander. At the end of the book states her role was of paramount importance, because she could not know he was alive. **That's it, her role was not knowing something** so nobody could get the info out of her. That's the significance of Paul's surprise daughter. (slow sarcastic clapping).

# The Preacher / Paul Atreides / Leto Atreides II

Which brings us to this ""trio"" of characters, finally. First of all, I'll say the obvious: bringing Paul back was a huge mistake in my opinion. He simply did not need to return, and his intention to return at all from the desert to interfere with the events goes against everything he left for in the first place. His return feels like a violation of his character by Herbert for another self insertion to preach about various ideologies regarding statehood and religion. We did not need to have Paul's beautifully finished journey and it's ending just... made nonexistent and pointless for that, we could've had another character to be Herbert's voice that opposes Leto II. **For example, Ghanima. So a character so underutilized and such a low hanging fruit for contrast to Leto II.** Their repeatedly emphasized strong bond was something Herbert could've tear apart slowly as Ghanima could've fulfilled the role the Paul did instead.

*And with that, we arrived to Paul and how his ending in Messiah is utterly destroyed, humiliated, desecrated and getting shit on. He admits(!) that he did not leave because of what we were lead to believe in Messiah, but because he was terrified of doing what his son is about to do: become slug Superman. No, not because of the emotional weight of feeling responsible for the future of the human race in the galaxy, or the wear of (several) lifetime's rule, or losing Chani, or not wanting to influence where civilization is headed. No. He was afraid of becoming a slime and slug covered Superman. Because ewwww, nasty.*

Just... why?

WHY?!

Why do this to Paul's ending, to destroy it like this? To be replaced with... being grossed out by the idea of becoming slime covered Superman? He even could've returned as the Preacher and do all of it he does in this book the exact same way, die the exact same way as he did (murdered by the angry mob on the streets during the riots against Alia / Harkonnen's rule, the system he built, the riots he orchestrated, that was actually a good way to say goodbye to Paul, but nowhere near as good and impactful as Messiah ending). Did I mention that Paul did try to talk Leto II out of wanting to become slime Superman? Whatever happened to not influencing what your children want to do with their lives?

His own son calls him a failure for not choosing that path, as Frank Herbert casually destroys the iconic mythology of the sandworms, killing two birds (legendary definitive parts of Dune: Paul and the worms) with one chapter: worms are not worms. They are the combination of thousands of slime slugs (perches if I translate it back from hungarian translated version, but their extensive description is more like slugs) living in symbiosis, creating a connected neural system which Leto intends to be part of, becomes part of, becomes a naked slime covered creature ( this is how I imagine it, except you know, he is 10: [https://hu.pinterest.com/pin/230105862188373572/](https://hu.pinterest.com/pin/230105862188373572/) ), superjumps / flies / runs through half the planet to kick down the door of the throneroom in Arrakeen, throw this several ton heavy door towards the bodyguards of Alia to slice them in two for added dramatic effect, everyone's jaws drops, he cucks the Padisah price into becoming the historian you've seen quotes of, the end. BECAUSE GOLDEN PATH!

Edit: oh and you want to kniw what the Golden Path is? This path, the only path humanity should walk on? Well good luck because you won't find out, unless you buy the next issue! Shameless ""career-writing"", when you have one breakthrough and keep making sequels to sell it with the title only, no matter how much you destroy what made it great before. *Cough* Star Wars Sequel trilogy *cough*

# Dune 4.

Even if it wouldn't jump 4000 years into the future **killing off everyone** who was lucky enough to survive Herbert's humiliatingly out of character murder spree, making Leto II the only character (maybe Ghanima too? Not sure if she lives, I try to avoid spoilers) to continue rehashing and rewording the same religious and state related ideas and criticisms, I'd be still completely, utterly devoid of any interest in this story. I'm sure Frank Herbert would find a way to take another giant stinking pile of shit on the previously beloved, now long gone characters or the very foundation of his universe, spice and worms. I'm... just out.

However, I feel like Frank Herbert does not use the Arabic words the way they are meant to in language. I believe he is changing the meaning of the words for the writing purposes, but is not doing a good job of what he means by the word. The other reason could be that I am failing to get the gist of what he truly means and he is not changing the meaning of those Arabic words.

w76mdv,Dune is kind of eye opening,"Warning: I am slightly stupid and bad at english so if some statements should be clarified or my interpretations are wrong, tell me.  


I have a long relationship if one might say so with this series. It began 5 years ago when I started reading the first book but as I was too young I put it aside. Later, inspired by one of my favourite youtube creators, I decided to read it again. Again, I didn't read the whole thing. Then the film was announced and last shot of lasgun was given. It exploded my mind (sorry). I like this series. While not being smart enough to fully comprehend and absorb all thoughts of Herbert, I do appriciate those that I got.

&#x200B;

The first topic   I want to mention is leadership. It is the main point of Dune and Dune Messiah and was largely inspired by Lawrence of Arabia (mental note: I should finally watch it). This ""hero"" thing is what Dune mostly famous for, aside from setting. Paul uses fremen to achieve his goal making them put faith in him and make him a god of theirs. While the first book of course touches on this theme a lot, in my humble opinion, messiah is better as critique showing Paul confining himself to his visions and painting him not as ideal as he may seemed to be. Herbert wanted to warn people not to believe charismativ leaders. Jihad is also a thing.  It may sound stupid and probably I am wrong though and just recite articles I read on this topic. And I didn't even expected to see Hitler mentioned. Though considering strangness of writing, I shouldn't be surprised.

The second major and overarching theme is information and propaganda.  I like that unlike most of a fantasy I read nobles use fakes to deceive common people. Harkonnens, Leto, Paul himself as a prime example. Carefully desinged prophecy, Leto's ""who's gonna tell them that I am a good and just ruler if not myself"", which made me burst in laught as it is so true, Harkonens wanted to demonize Atreides family. This motif is intertwined with the whole plot and we can see titbits of it everywhere.  It is fresh though I have to say I haven't read a lot of modern fantasy so maybe situation has changed.   


This one is really  strange and I do not consider it as a theme, just an observation of mine. I am not sure why but I think that Bene Gesserit's training using a lot more subtle approach and using information is praised by Herbert or at least not hated and despised and should be taught. Let me explain. I know it sounds strange, obscure and stupid but usually a lot of male heroes are straightforward battle guys with swords or axes. Herbert took another approach and Paul's main weapon is his mind and skills he got from his mother like controlling body. He is still cool and brave but his main advantage is that he combines both masculine and feminine traits. There are male spies but most of them are not as subtle as a typical Bene Gesserit trained to manipulate. Paul can both use people's emotions to manipulate them and being mentat, if I am not mistaken, allows him to analyze a lot of data. I hope it doesn't sound too stupid.   


This manipulations and mind battles are also  the things I like. I didn't like battle scenes but this mind games are something. Those who read it would remember dinner chapter in the first book. It's awesome. One of the finest pieces of writing I've ever seen.

I'd like to say more but this post sound boring already and it is too long probably. As you guessed, I am a fan of the series. A big one. Try it if you haven't already. It maybe hard and slightly confusing but if I made it through you would definetely do it!   


Good luck and books to everyone. Thank you for reading.

l0q7nw,I just finished Dune.,"I absolutely loved it. This has easily become my favorite science fiction novel, but with that being said, I still have some issues with it. 

The most glaring issue in my opinion is the pacing. I think I actually enjoyed the first half more than the second half just because it felt like a well-paced, connected story. I also really enjoyed all of the political discourse, which I‚Äôve seen some people deem boring, so that helped. Towards the end, it seems like Herbert realized how much he still had to pack in and just started throwing things at us. 

My second issue is more of a personal opinion, but I was not a fan of Paul‚Äôs character development. He grew incredibly power hungry towards the end, and I suppose I understand this choice as he was the chosen one and he knew he was the only one that could save humanity or whatnot, but it didn‚Äôt really come off that way at times. It became hard to root for him in the end for me. 

Overall, I found the book to be enthralling from cover to cover, I just had a couple nitpicky issues with it.

tcdop,Is Dune worth it?,"Hi everyone, Just to give you some background knowledge I'm a fifteen year old High School Freshman who loves to read unfortunately I have very limited reading time.  I have a pretty high reading level and read books such as: Fall of Giants, The Forever war, and Old Mans War (just to name a few).  

  The other day I purchased Dune because it came so highly recommended on Reddit and I am also a big science fiction fan.  I started it the other day and am having a hard time with it.  I have to read very slowly otherwise I have no idea what they're talking about and even then I often get lost and have to go back and re-read.  So where as in other books I would be on page 150 I'm only on 50 at the moment.  Now I really want to love this book, so should I just push through these problems and hopefully they will will sort themselves out?  Or should I just put it on the shelf for later?  Any advise would be appreciated and if you can tell me how your read through Dune went that would be awesome, thanks.

v095px,Read Dune for the first time (Spoilers),"First Book i've read in probably close to a decade, I started it back around the time of the new Movie release and had read up to the part of the movie's end before going to see it. It's taken me until this week to finish it, I think choosing such a dense book as a re-introduction to reading may have been a bit of a bad idea as after seeing the movie I struggled to get around to finishing the book because it wasn't really any easy read. 

It's something I'd seen a lot of people say is just amazing and the best sci-fi book they've read, but....I'm not really sure what to think? It has good world-building and characterization and I can see why people like that side of it, but I suppose I just expected it to be building up to something grand as the book went on and was quite surprised to find that, after the point the movie ends, it kind of just rushes plot events. There's more of the Fremen Culture with Paul, but the Harkonenns factor in fairly little until the very end of the book where the Baron is suddenly killed, Paul takes control of Arrakis from the Emperor and it hurries to wrap that part of the story up.

After seeing people praise it so much and enjoying the first half the book quite a bit...I was hoping for more plot twists, big moments of mystery and intrigue and counter-playing each other throughout, like there had been towards the start of the book with the Harkonnen VS Atreides plot? Not just Paul becoming very important to the Fremen and then a sudden move against the Emperor at the shield wall where Paul wins. I do have Messiah as well so i'll read that at some point but at the moment I just don't really have any enthusiasm for it.

Like I said, I've not read anything in years. Other than some Warhammer novels when I was younger, all I can really remember reading is the Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy series, The Hobbit, and The Game of Thrones series, so it's not like i'm comparing it to other sci-fi books.

I have dozens of other sci-fi books to read as I tend to buy them cheap if I have seen them recommended (like when I see them at ¬£1 or so) and am trying to get back into reading properly again, but like...is this really what ""the best"" sci-fi is like?  It's definitely a *good* book and I don't really think negatively towards it, but part of me thinks that if this is considered by many to be ""the best"" in the genre and I feel quite let down by it, am I missing something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v095px/read_dune_for_the_first_time_spoilers/,2022-05-29T11:24:37Z,35,20,books,Dune,POST

m2qsvb,Dune: My very unintellectual review.,"I think it is a brilliant but mixed bag. 

I think it's a great book, The hints at the wider universe and the cultures really enthralled my imagination. It set my mind wandering down thoughts of interstellar empires, space jihads, messiahs etc.

I enjoyed how it made me think about societies, religion, ecology and how they mix, change and meld with the passage of time and meddling without feeling like I was being lectured. I like how even though the characters are pretty much infallible superhumans, they are also powerless, especially Paul. He isn't actually a hero but more a slave of time (past, present, future), self fulfilling prophecy and historic manipulation. 

I didn't mind the omniscient narrator and the old school **storytelling** style (over modern story showing) was refreshing. 

My gripes:

The characters are extremely flat and boring. I am honestly more excited about going down the Dune Wiki rabbit hole than I am about the actual story. 

Another thing I am not so keen on is the ""*X* within *X* within *X*"". It seems like it was *telling me* ""Hey! Listen here. This story deep and profound, you better believe it."" but the plot itself is shallow even if the underlying themes are not. 

**My main gripe**  is petty but it almost made me stop reading. I got frustrated with his writing style. It took me AGES to figure out what it was but... the way he ends sentences really threw me off and made me need to re-read whole sentences. He'd put a comma where *and* should usually go, end the sentence. (Similar to what I did there). This may be an issue with my own reading comprehension, but it jolted me out of the story on a regular basis. 

Overall, I have really enjoyed it, purely for the allusion to the huge universe that obviously existed in great detail inside the authors head - the crumbs I got allowed me to put aside things that would usually make me roll my eyes and stop reading.

9uu3hv,Just finished the Dune series!,"Basically the title. I‚Äôve been chipping away at the Dune series since last year and finally finished Chapterhouse: Dune. I know we at r/books have a lot of Dune circlejerks but I thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts on each book nonetheless!

Dune - Absolutely ate up the first book. Herbert‚Äôs prose was like nothing I‚Äôd ever read before and every part of the story really was brimming with life. Something about the desert setting really set my imagination off, as well. 

Dune: Messiah - I read this one right after the first and loved it just as much. Seeing Paul realize how depraved his role as Messiah really was fascinated me. 

Children of Dune - This one was okay. It seemed a lot slower than the other books and I was a bit disinterested until late in the book when Leto started working towards his Golden Path. 

God-Emperor of Dune - YES. I absolutely adored this book! It was so intricate the lengths that Leto would go to maintain his Golden Path and it was fascinating watching him become so depraved in the name of human survival. 

Heretics of Dune - This one was odd. Am I the only one who thought that Herbert should have just been a little less horny? The Honored Matres‚Äô abilities felt out of place in a series that built itself on prose that is historical and factual. 

Chapterhouse: Dune - This, to me, was a perfect answer to the problems of Heretics of Dune. The Honored Matres‚Äô abilities no longer felt out of place and I loved the deeper look into the Bene Gesserit organization. My only problem with the book was that there wasn‚Äôt another one after it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9uu3hv/just_finished_the_dune_series/,2018-11-07T00:14:59Z,63,87,books,Dune,POST

He also finds a way to essentially demystify some of the best concepts in the original.

xlk3bu,I feel like Dune was too short,"So much was not explained in Dune. Maybe it should have been several smaller books, similar to how they published The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy. 

I found Dune hard to get into, hard to follow, hard to care about. I was interested in how the world worked, but we got more chapters of people arguing than we did explanations. 

I would have liked to see more about Feyd-Rautha. He was in maybe 4 chapters, then all of a sudden he‚Äôs the important guy Paul has to fight at the end? That fight was so low stakes. We all knew Paul was going to win. 

Also, what about Paul‚Äôs son? He was mentioned, we never meet him, and then he dies. 

I feel like we could have got so much more out of it if we just had a few more details.

v2900f,Conflicting feelings on Dune,"I read Dune a while back, and let me tell you, I was HYPED to read it ‚Äì¬†I'd seen tons of people recommend it, and I knew it must be seminal sci-fi for a reason. And having read it, I can definitely see why it's had such a huge influence on the genre, but to be honest, I was pretty disappointed.

Before I get court-martialed, let the record show that I ADORED the first part (pretty much everything up to Paul and Jessica ending up in the desert). The worldbuilding, the political intrigue, the suspense... basically Game of Thrones in space, sign me up! But then I just felt like it went downhill after Paul unlocked his Kwisatz Haderach clairvoyance powers. To me, he became a really boring character, and I really have trouble enjoying a book if I can't empathize with the characters at least a little. I don't need them to be likable, but they've gotta feel human, and Paul's assent to (basically) godhood made him a flat character in my opinion. It seemed like a major case of Chosen One Syndrome, where every decision he made was based on his chosen-one powers and the fact that he'd already seen what he had to do. E.g. I didn't feel any chemistry between him and Chani, it seemed like they only became a couple because he saw her and thought ""ah yes, there's my future wife, obviously we're going to be together now.""

In the same vein, some of the events of the plot seemed like they should've felt significant, but they were only significant because of ‚ú®cosmic destiny‚ú® and not because of the relationships between the characters. Like the fight between Paul and Feyd ‚Äì¬†it's played up as this uber-important predestined showdown, which it definitely is in a symbolic products-of-creepy-Bene-Gesserit-eugenics way, but all I could think of was that these characters have literally NEVER MET. It's a grudge match based on a purely symbolic grudge rather than a personal one. Sure, Feyd was partially involved in murdering Paul's father (thought that was mainly the baron's scheme) and had been oppressing the Fremen, but no personal enmity between these two was ever really established, so the whole thing just felt hollow to me.

All that being said, I still think the elements that I loved initially remain fantastic, I was just left with an overall feeling of disappointment because the characters and plot felt underwhelming post-Atreides downfall. But I've heard others praise the characters and plot specifically, so I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing. I've heard people say that you can't really appreciate the first Dune until you've read some of the sequels ‚Äì¬†those of you who have read more of the series, do you find this to be true? Or do you think the first one holds up as a standalone work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/v2900f/conflicting_feelings_on_dune/,2022-06-01T04:53:34Z,20,7,books,Dune,POST
gkib0a,I just finished Dune by Frank Herbert and...,"WOW that was the slowest moving, and borderline boring book I have read. It did not need to be 794 pages, it could have easily only been ~250 pages long and would have got the point across way quicker. 

Also it‚Äôs perplexing that as far as I noticed Herbert uses the name ‚ÄòDune‚Äô like one time (and that was at the very very end of the book), otherwise the planet is exclusively referred to as Arrakis. This doesn‚Äôt really matter at all but just why not have the title be Arrakis?

2cidaj,Questions about Dune,"I've seen Dune mentioned so many times on Reddit that I finally decided to read it. I'm about halfway through (so far, so good) but I find I'm being distracted by some questions:

1. What is a mentat? 

2. Are some of the characters not actually human? It seems like some people are specifically pointed out as being human, implying that others aren't human. If some aren't human, are they machines? An alien species?

3. What's the significance of the spice? It's a drug, right? But what does it do? Is it like a narcotic? And it's the spice that turns the Arrakin people's eyes blue, right? Or are they not human?

Thanks for any insight you can give! Spoilers are okay with me - I don't mind knowing things ahead of time. Sometimes I like it better that way because it makes what I'm reading easier to understand if I know where it's heading. But not providing spoilers is okay, too. 

Edit: 4.  What does CHOAM stand for?

Edit 2: 5.

w6lby5,Dune Messiah has ruined my interest in reading further.,"The ploat was way too thin. so there was no room for character development that made sense. Alot of it was just being described as this is how x think and feels now after some time. It's so annoying. It felt like a poorly made movie with a great cast but it was a book with holes in it.

Where was Gurney throughout this book? We only get a dwarf tell us about Jessica and her feelings. Honestly there were a lot of characters I found highly unnecessary who got developed. 

Now I don't know think I care about the future of Dune considering how Herbert wrote Paul. He did it take away the  intrigue surrounding our protagonist who he believes has turned antagonist. 

I'm not sure I'd gain anything from reading anymore of these book other than some illumination into the twins. I don't care about melange, or dune or the harkonnens anymore. Herbert made sure of that.

jc8jio,I restored the audio of a 1969 interview with Frank Herbert on the origins of Dune,"I hope this isn't breaking the rules here - I'd just like to share this as people who have read Dune might find it interesting. This isn't my recording, but I should preface by saying the video is on my Youtube channel and I made this restoration of the original audio to remove noise/hum and make the dialogue levels more consistent throughout.  


This interview was recorded by Willis E. Mcnelly with Frank and Beverly Herbert in their home on February 3rd 1969.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhw5vdH3rlo&feature=youtu.be&ab\_channel=Luminist2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhw5vdH3rlo&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Luminist2)  


I recently read Dune for the first time, and afterward came across this really interesting interview where he details some of his thought processes in researching for and writing the book. It's a quite insightful conversation and highly worth listening to if you've read the first book and want to know more. I should mention that Frank Herbert references a pretty significant spoiler for Dune Messiah (2nd book) part way through the interview. He does preface what he's about to say ""...something that happens in the 2nd book.."" but nonetheless if you haven't read Dune Messiah maybe skip a couple minutes ahead at that point.

Some background: the original recording I found of this interview was super noisy and had a bunch of other audio issues, but I found it pretty captivating after reading Dune for the first time and wanting to find out more about its core concepts and why Herbert chose to write them into the novel. So I decided to restore the audio for posterity and for educational purposes.

j6dib5,Dune: Why it's overrated and you can't finish it,"Dune may be the most overrated book I have ever read. I have heard from a lot of people who say they can't even finish it, saying the plot is just too slow or there are just too many concepts and characters. I hear them blaming themselves for not being able to complete it; after all Dune is a classic masterpiece of science fiction that must be amazing, right? 

Well after finally completing this boring slog of a book, I am here to tell you that Dune is exactly what your gut is telling you it is: overrated, boring, and a little racist. Let me start with how it is overrated.

Dune is often applauded for its world-building and story-telling. It led to countless sequels, prequels, and spin-offs in books, movies, and even video games that all take place within the Dune universe. Dune is often credited as the inspiration for later science fiction, i.e. Star Wars.  Surely a work that spawned such a franchise must have some merit, right?

Wrong. The original book itself has no redeeming qualities. There is actually little to no world-building within the first book. The reader is immediately bombarded with an array of silly sounding made-up words, i.e. ""lasgun,"" ""bene gesserit,"" ""still suit,"" ""quizatch haderach,"" etc. There is very little context or exposition for what these terms are supposed to mean. Without any explanation, as a reader I defer to old tropes and ideas gained from other works. Bene gesserit? Just a female jedi. Quizatch haderach? Funky words for the chosen one, i.e. Anakin or Jesus. There are no new concepts, just the same old tropes dressed up in 1960s sci-fi. The story is just Lawrence of Arabia mixed with a light Hamlet sauce served on a sci-fi platter.

That description almost makes it sound like it could be good. However, the storytelling is awful. First, the pacing is terrible. At least half the book is dedicated to Paul's first few months on calladan and arrakis. The second half it seemed like Herbert realized he needed to speed things up, and the pacing just kept getting faster and faster. The ""climax"" of the book is resolved very quickly within the final pages of the last chapter. 

Because of the lack of any new ideas, the reader would expect the book to be very character driven. However, almost none of the characters have any character arc at all. Paul starts off a skilled fighter, and ends up a skilled fighter. He didn't need to overcome anything; everything was basically handed to him on a silver platter because he's the chosen one (some might call Paul a ""Mary Sue"" archetype). Yes, paul becomes more like the fremen, grows more callous, and some of his friends become his worshippers. But before all that, Paul didn't really have a discernable personality. Ask yourself this: could you describe Paul's personality without describing him being the chosen one, or just the son of a Duke? 

Finally, I'll close with probably what will get me the most flak: Dune is kinda racist. Herbert fetishized Arab, specifically bedouin people in this book. Why did he use so many arabic words and cultural terms? Are fremen the descendents of Arabs or something? The book claims that the fremen were forcibly put on arrakis. I thought the book was set 20000 years in the future, why is there a desert planet filled up with Arabs? I feel like Herbert had at best a cursory knowledge of the culture and wanted to write a book about the Arab revolts but didn't know jack shit about the history or culture, so he decided to write a science fiction book and change all the names. Yeah, yeah we all get that spice is oil, the fremen are bedouins, the Empire is the Ottoman (or other colonial stand-in). But guess what- those bedouins created saudi arabia, and are basically the backward but wealthy rednecks of the Arab world. Not all Arab countries have oil; not all Arabs are bedouins. Maybe the later books go into that, but it just seems like Herbert thought Dune was deep and groundbreaking but was actually reductionist and borderline racist.

Anyway, I say all that to say that I really want to like Dune. I love the science fiction genre. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's like The Godfather, and we've derived so much pop culture from it that the original work loses its appeal or novelty. Would love to hear other people's thoughts on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j6dib5/dune_why_its_overrated_and_you_cant_finish_it/,2020-10-06T21:00:19Z,76,9,books,Dune,POST

xzzqcr,"Dune, golden path","Disclaimer: I have only read untile children of Dune. But i thing I understand where the story will go. (3000 year old unbearable worm god ;) )

I like to have a discussion about ""Paul's golden path"". In discission's I mostly have seen the point being made that Leto makes the discission that Paul was unwilling to make. (And therefore is a better less, selfish persoon) To become a god but hybrid being, for stability in the universe.  But most seem to think that there golden path are te same for both, but they made different choice's.

I DISAGREE!. I don't feel Leto and Paul golden path where even closely the same. 

I think Paul golden path is a balance between his own desires vs the cost (He is willing to pay/to humanity). And Leto is only what is best for humanity.

I believe Frank trying to explore (in dune) what happens when someone has ultimate power (know the future, but also know the cost of his action.) What created the tention between personeel goals (and in Paul case infallibly/plot armor vs cost to unknown people/humanity) and what he is willing (humanity) to have to pay for it.

(Try to think of it Like rescuing a cute kitty, but knowing it will kill multiple bird families in it lifetime, and now expand that to a billion living being in a universe. Where the kitten is your child (survival/happiness) and the birds are a billion life's)

As soon as Paul get his superpower we see his first reluctant to take it. And Paul fist goal is to have revanche on the Emperor for what he has done to his father. But he knows he can become the Emperor but after he/it will have to start a universal war. Then we see his delay of having kids because he knows it wil cause the life of his wife. And in messiah we see equilibrium being reached between what Paul wants and is willing to pay. And him surandering to the ineveneable. (So his kids/family/humanity have the future) 

Leto golden path looks to be more what is best voor humanity. But he can only make that choice because he lost his selfishness (because he was never human) and he has a sister to forfill the family dishires. (And is what readers like to think they will choose)

kc94iq,Dune - Frank Herbert,"I didnt exactly love it but I can understand why someone would.

I think my main issue was that I wasn't too invested in the characters and storyline and Arrakis. I thought it started well and about halfway my interest started waning. It seemed like an odd mix of sci fi and fantasy. I didn't like Paul's prescience bits and the whole deal with the spice. I was actually waiting for them to blow it up to see what kind of effects that would have had in the universe. 

I liked the religious aspect of creating a prophet to be used as a safety net for the Bene Gesserit and how Paul and Jessica used the natives and the prophecy for survival and to further their purpose. Politics were interesting as well and I would have liked to see more of the behind the scenes with the Emperor and the Baron instead of Paul and co. running about in the sand. The end just happens so suddenly with all of them above Arrakis. 

I'm still super excited about the movie but I'm not too keen on reading the sequels. Should I? And what did you think? Are there any others who didn't love this critically acclaimed book?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kc94iq/dune_frank_herbert/,2020-12-13T11:31:42Z,34,19,books,Dune,POST
pjurna,Had to stop reading Dune,"I got to page 371. Unlike past novels I had to stop, such as ""All The King's Men,"" it wasn't the writing style or difficulty in comprehension that forced me to put it down, but the absolute piss poor state of the plot in my opinion.

I was put off early in the novel by Paul's seemingly expert levels of perception, but I chalked it up (as the story does) to his Mother's training in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. But then, it was revealed the Bene Gesserit (an all female order) were waiting for the creation of the Kwisatz Haderach, a man, to be their messiah figure. Something about the ultimate aim of a female organization being to have a male messiah to lead them is off-putting. 

I already thought of putting the book down then, but I was flying for 12 hours and didn't have my backup books or enough downloaded netflix content. So I went through and read more. I was able to trudge through, ignoring Paul's seemingly superhuman talents of perception, until the death of Duke Leto.

It was a good scene, but then we cut to Paul learning of the death and being able to suddenly see into the future??????? His mother is immediately powered down it seems to have room for Paul to shine with even greater superhuman abilities of perception and seeing into the future? 

I'm sure the film will be great cinematically, but with just the first 371 pages of the story I can't get past these key issues:

1) a male messiah figure is the ultimate goal of an all-female organization.
2) Paul is, from the outset, given superhuman levels of perception.
3) Jessica is immediately powered down to give room for her son to shine after Duke Leto's death.
4) Paul becomes, seemingly out of the blue, even more powerful and knowledgeable of the world around him, it seems that despite his brief outbursts of rashness (showing his age), nothing bad can happen to him or mistake could be made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pjurna/had_to_stop_reading_dune/,2021-09-07T20:04:00Z,30,0,books,Dune,POST

wukehs,Dune - Hardcover 1965 Chilton Edition,"Sorry, first time posting to Reddit, i think lol
I just was encouraged to check out reddit,  signed up 5 years ago and never did anything. 
So I received for my birthday the book my wife of 10 years this year knew I always wanted. 
We had kids and it was at the half-priced book store in our hometown in Iowa. We lived and met there, got married and had kids. Always loved the Dune series and yes even the ones by his son. I loved them because good or bad, they added to the Dune universe which was amazing created by Frank Herbert. 

Just wanted to share in the joy with hopefully fellow book lovers and some Dune lovers, even those that think the expanded universe is trash. It was just a big impact because while I owned the book series, I had finally seen a first edition at the book shop in our town, just after we had our first daughter. I thought it more important to spend my money as a chef on formula and diapers. 2 more daughters later and moving to be a chef in and around LA just got lost in the bustle of family and raising kids in a crazy expensive state and area of that state. Now i finally opened my chef business coaching other chefs am am focusing on being a good dad and a chef helping other chefs, you really look at the things that still matter to you. 

When my wife got home after going back to visit Iowa and pick up my oldest daughter (step-daughter) she comes home and just hands it to me. 

I was just stunned because she simply said, it's what you've always wanted. It's not crazy flashy or stupid expensive, but impactful. It really meant something especially because we've struggled as we care about us and our family so it's been rough especially being a chef in LA trying to be a dad as well. You tend to forget the simple little things that are really important to you sometimes, like the book you always wanted. Was important because we both decided to work for ourselves to be better parents and are trying to remember even the little things that bring us joy. 

That 1965 Chilton Edition was that for me and she knew it. 
I just thought that thought of a book being something of an impact for someone might resonant with others. 

I just wondered about others who felt sometimes getting a book has a real impact and just wondered what that might be or have been for others. 
Something about a real paper book and holding and the smell the pages. 
I still remember the first Dune book i ever found ""God Emperor of Dune"" on my brothers shelf. Still remember how it smelled from the 80s lol
Just hoped others had those same thoughts about books. 

Then again i might be confused with how reddit works, but just thought it would be a good conversation about others and when they received or bought their most impactful book? Even not a Dune book lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wukehs/dune_hardcover_1965_chilton_edition/,2022-08-22T04:58:19Z,13,13,books,Dune,POST

42crc4,Not really getting into dune - is there something I'm missing?,"Hey /r/books

After seeing it recommended all over Reddit and seemingly almost unanimously praised, I decided to finally give ""Dune"" a shot, after it had been sitting on my bookshelf for ages. I'm reading the original book just called ""Dune"", and it's the first in the series I've read. To give you an idea of where I am in the book, I've literally just finished the excerpt from the ""Manual of Muad'Dib' regarding beginnings being a time to balance, and how students must take care to ensure that you know that Mud'Dib's ""place"" was Arrakis, despite the fact he was born on Caladan. I must say, I'm really not getting into this book like I thought I would be. I will give it a little bit more time, I won't give up on it just yet, but it totally hasn't ""gripped"" me at all, and to be frank I've found the whole thing a little tedious and boring so far. Is there something I'm missing here? What am I ""not getting""? Would I have enjoyed this more had I of read some of the other books first? Would appreciate hearing your opinions.

Just a note, as I'm not quitting yet, please, **NO SPOILERS**.

zqsmxh,I just finished Children of Dune and I have questions.,"As I was reading this book, I was seeing how Leto, Ghanima and Alia were managing with the world Paul left behind. 

The natives, The Fremen, had basically deified him and had spread the religious sickness through planetary colonisation. 

Their culture shifted because certain traditions become harder to uphold when the water which seemed so scarce before can even fall from the sky in the Dune Belt(possibly the driest region in Arrakis). Leto even shakes Stilgar's psyche which tried to hold on to their old ways, to see that his way of thinking did not translate to those born of this new world. This makes total sense because people born after a revolution know a different future when they envision it, unencumbered by the brutality of the past. It seemed like Leto was priming Stil for something. 

Alia not having the same prescience as Paul could not see as far as he did so could not govern like he did. So she ended up relying on Bene Gesserit teaching on ruling through destabilising the political current,  so no one stream would be strong enough to overcome her.

Leto, having his Father's memories, saw how trapped Paul got from following his visions and didn't want to do the same. So he comes up with a plan that manages to resist Lady Jessica's interference, and lands on becoming a God himself too? To rule over the natives of Arrakis for thousands of years? Because that's how humanity will be saved???

I thought the point of Leto at the start was to discredit Mua'dib. To show people he was not the saviour they made him out to be?? To prevent blood shed in the name of the Atreides?

Did I misread something? Seems like he wants to be a dictator. What went wrong?? Or maybe was that the plan all along and Leto was never a progressive?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zqsmxh/i_just_finished_children_of_dune_and_i_have/,2022-12-20T16:23:44Z,15,3,books,Dune,POST

isbeqa,Dune - should I stop?,"A few weeks ago, I read 2 chapters and decided to stop for a few reasons: I was looking forward to Tolkienesque prose but Herbert writes in simple, plain language. There was a lack of description of the immediate environment, which left me wanting more for what they were wearing, what the rooms looked like, etc. I didn't like how the text is interjected with inner thoughts of characters.

Spoiler ahead.

But I decided to try again, so I restarted at page 1 and now I'm 24% in, about 150 pages, hoping things will get better. The prose and descriptions are still plain, but we have the stillsuits and the appearance of a sandworm, which are cool. I like the Duke. The inner thoughts I've come to accept as a fine way for seeing into the characters. Although there is a lot of shrugging. 

Should i soldier on? Do we get a thrilling sequence of running away desperately from sandworms? Immersive desert experience? Do we get to meet the Fremen and learn about their culture? Looking forward to things like that!

(If I stop reading, I will still watch the movie)

Edit: I rarely read sci-fi/action. I normally prefer consuming sci-fi through movies. For LOTR I prefer the books for the immersive, slow prose.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the great responses! For the moment, I think it's most likely that I will wait for the movie (it looks really good! plus, I trust Dennis Villeneuve), although I'm not terribly opposed against picking up where I left off anytime between now and the movie release.

ezjw0,My Thoughts about Dune,"Dune was an awesome book, and definitely deserves its praise. I did have a few problems with it, though.

The world building is amazing, except for the time frame. I'm able to suspend my disbelief, but if I'm not mistaken, the Atreides and the Harkonnens have been feuding for *ten thousand years*. This is twice as long as recorded history. How does one maintain a feud, or a noble line of inheritance, for such a span of time?

The characters are all well developed; my only problem there is that nothing is really evoked by the writing, which is otherwise good. All of the character's thoughts and feelings about each other and the situations they are in are plainly spelled out, as if they are constantly articulating their emotions as they have them (the movie made it even worse by having them all whispering to themselves).

And finally, the book felt a bit uneven; the first two thirds-ish have Paul and his family arriving on Dune, learning about the planet and spice production. Then Baron Harkonnen attacks, Paul and Jessica flee into the desert and meet the Fremen. Then the last third tells of Paul truly coming into his own and taking back the planet, and it all felt a bit rushed.

Otherwise, great book. I'll be reading on in the series, despite advice to the contrary.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ezjw0/my_thoughts_about_dune/,2011-01-10T15:16:49Z,64,48,books,Dune,POST

enc991,Unpopular Opinion: Just finished Dune by Frank Herbert and didn‚Äôt really like it.,"I just finished Dune and I have to say I didn‚Äôt really think it was that great. It‚Äôs been on my list for quite some time given the praise it has received and the general positive sentiment in this community, but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt really get into it. 

I‚Äôm not one for providing commentary but I‚Äôm curious if anyone else is in the same boat because I was really expecting to like it. Thoughts?

Here‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt like it (in no particular order of importance):
1. I think appendices are nice additions to books but in this case I feel like you had to refer to it in order to understand some of the references. 
2. I feel like the character development of Paul happened in step functions rather than a gradual development over the course of the book. There were certain events that happened and his character completely changed. 
3. This is tied to point 1, but some of the references made were so frustrating. I‚Äôm going to compare to the prologue of The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson which included a lot of characters, events, etc. that you didn‚Äôt understand. In that scenario I was enticed and wanted to know more but in Dune I was just confused. An example from Dune, is the ‚Äúsietch‚Äù. It‚Äôs spoken of earlier in the book, and you can kind of determine the meaning from context, but it‚Äôs never really made clear to the reader until after it‚Äôs been used a lot. 
4. Overall, I never got to the point where I was really interested and didn‚Äôt want to put it down. Not every book will provide that but I was ready to be done when I was halfway through. 

Maybe I‚Äôm crazy. Maybe I need to read the rest of the saga? As I said, just curious to get other feedback.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/enc991/unpopular_opinion_just_finished_dune_by_frank/,2020-01-11T19:52:29Z,70,73,books,Dune,POST

also, would love to hear your thoughts on Dune! i found that i loved the first third most, (spoilers ahead!) when it focused more on the power of word choice and tone. it got heavily fantastical in the later stages and i still loved it but i guess it wasn't as easy to relate to.

15uk24y,"Frank Herbert, Dune, and the nature of Truth; what is profound about the realization of the nature of Truth?","
I‚Äôd like to enlist the help of more knowledgable individuals when it comes to the Frank Herbert‚Äôs works. I‚Äôve been having some trouble wrapping my head around a concept introduced in an introductory excerpt at the beginning of a chapter in Dune. I believe it deals with the nature of Truth. By Truth, I mean the abstaining from illusion and adherence to the direct experience/interfacing of your life, unfettered by bias or point of view either objectively or subjectively.

This book seems laden with philosophical overtones, eventually becoming center stage within its narrative. The passage is as follows:


**‚ÄúMy father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. ‚ÄòSomething cannot emerge from nothing,‚Äô he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô can be.‚Äù**


My philosophical background is in non-secular zen and a dabbling in greek philosophy such as cynicism - with that said I‚Äôll try and give it a stab from my pov:

***‚ÄúMy father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality‚Ä¶‚Äù***

‚Äî‚Äî> Here, I believe that the character is stating that regarding the truth with a high degree of value is the groundwork of moral behavior. Notice the ‚Äúall‚Äù though, does this mean that even a morality considered ‚Äúevil‚Äù or malicious, or even one based off of a proclivity towards dishonesty, is heavily based on some form of respect towards a ‚Äútruth‚Äù of some sort? What does that look like?
Secondly, objective or subjective truth? Objectively, I believe that truth is nonexistent in these terms. There is no golden thread to extrapolate from that tells us an inherent truth in any object, living creature, or life and death itself - only the meaning we create in ourselves about such things. Regarding it as a truth is just the projection of this subjective idea in an attempt to derive meaning from our actions in life. 


***‚Äú‚ÄòSomething cannot be created from nothing.‚Äô‚Äù***

‚Äî‚Äî> This is basic Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy. In the context of truth, I believe the character is saying that truth cannot be created by itself in a vacuum, that it is dependent specifically on its origin and cannot be synthesized without.
This points me to believing that they‚Äôre speaking about subjective truth because they‚Äôre speaking about truth being created rather than discovered indicating a manifestation or interdependent creation of a truth based on the factors it originated from.


***‚ÄùThis is profound thinking if you understand how unstable ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô can be.‚Äù***

‚Äî‚Äî> Realizing the aforementioned determination about truth‚Äôs effect as the bedrock for *all* morality, is apparently profound considering the volatility of truth. Again, seemingly pointing towards subjective truth but additionally describing that truth is ultimately unstable and transient. 

My determination about this passage is to mean that by respecting truth‚Äôs role in morality, and especially it‚Äôs nature as a transient and impermanent facet, is a profound insight into how people interact with truth or are led by their morality. How‚Äôd I do? What‚Äôre your opinions and how might I be completely wrong haha? I‚Äôd love to hear it, and if you‚Äôve read this far I sincerely thank you for your time and I hope you‚Äôre having a good day.

c42yef,Just can't do the Dune series anymore,"Okay, the first Dune was amazing. The world building, the characters, and the story was great. 

I also really enjoyed the concept of prescience and pre borns. Dune Messiah and Children of Dune were also very enjoyable. The religion and corruption of said religion. I also thought that Leto becoming a worm was very interesting. 

But I feel like God Emperor of Dune was the logical and best conclusion to the story. The series should've ended there. 

I tried to read Heretics of Dune, but I just don't care about the characters at all. I can't stand all the flashbacks. I don't want to be told what happened I want to see it happen! I could kinda excuse it in God Emperor, because Leto was still around. But none of the original characters are even there (well besides baby Idaho).

Incase any of you tried out Dune on Audible and gave up, buy the actual book and try again, I don't know what the hell they were thinking with the audible version but in my opinion it's pretty jarring to listen too, different voices constantly, strange music etc, I barely made it through the first chapter.

4i8eln,Dune Discussion,"So I just finished this sci-fi classic, and I very much feel the need to discuss it with Dune veterans. There's a lot to say about this book, but I'll try and limit my discourse to prominent points. Major spoilers ahead of course, and pardon me if I ask a lot of questions, as I feel there's still a lot about this story I'm not quite grasping. Since this is so involved, I'll also put a TL:DR at the bottom.

To begin, a lot of that understanding gap comes from Herbet's style as a writer. Discernment in great quantity is left up to the reader, and very little of what one might call 'basic world knowledge' e.g. what a mentat and planetologist are, is explained forthright. You can eventually get a caricature of how these characters function in the world, but I still feel like I don't totally grasp their significance. Appendices might help with this, and I plan on diving into those next. This was one of my biggest issues with the book, the lack of plainly explained concepts and world structures. I understand Herbet's reasoning behind this, and I can respect it; constant analytical explanation would have been jarring and unnatural in the narrative. Generally, when something in the world needs explaining, you have to bring in someone within the story who's also an outsider, like the reader. Herbet did do this to an extent with Paul and his mother amongst the Freman. They were  outsiders to that world, so explanations could be integrated naturally. Still, some aspects I never quite grasped. 

As for the plot, I found it interesting, but also perhaps where I lacked understanding the most. Prophecy obviously plays a huge part within the plot. This comes off as cliche at first, but the way Herbert presents it makes the trope uniquely his own, and a genuinely intriguing plot device. The plot you follow is that of Paul Atreides reclaiming the throne wrongfully taken from him, a deceptively  simple premise altogether. But the true focus of the story is Paul's 'terrible purpose' and the beginning of his 'bloody jihad'. These aspects confused me more than anything else, probably because they were purposefully obscure. I'll relate what I know, and if it's wrong, please correct me. 

Paul is the end result of millennia of genetic breeding for some mysterious purpose of the secretive and highly influential Bene Gesserit. But he's unexpected-his mother disobeyed the Bene Gesserit and had a boy instead of a girl, in an attempt to create through Paul the object of this centuries long plot, the kwisatz haderach, a male with the abilities of the all female Bene Gesserit. In this aspect it reminds me of the Wheel of Time where females can access one half of the magical spectrum and the men access the other. Just why Paul was such a problem for the Bene Gesserit still remains a mystery to me. Possibly because he was unfinished so to speak? The powers should have continued to mature through a maternal line, but Jessica defied that? As well, the gom jabbar test and the contrast between being a human and being something...else, is still an aspect I don't understand. The Freman religion the Bene Gesserit built around Paul as a Messiah was fascinating as well, and makes me wonder if the jihad Paul has seen is a part of their plan, or it was an aspect of that and is now out of control. Some of this might be explained in the sequel, but the premises laid down in the first book were less than satisfying for me, though I'm sure readers who appreciate a challenge will enjoy it quiet a lot. 

Segwaying into characters, Herbet had several instances where he really brought out characters' depths, and made them feel alive. But for much of the time, the characters were alien and transcendent, unrelatable in many ways. Few made a real impression on me. Gurney, Leto, Stilgar, and Vladimir were probably amongst the most memorable. Speaking of the Harkonnens, they seemed almost comically evil at times. Vladimir being a perverted, gluttonous individual, with little real intelligence but more resources than the ill fated Atreides. I suppose this is to make their downfall all the more tragic, the better man losing to the lesser, but it made him difficult to take seriously as a threat, especially early on. The early part of the book was probably my favorite, but strictly as a personal preference. It contained a simpler premise, and thus was easier to invest in than some of the latter parts of the book. The end especially felt a little loose, possibly because it was setting up for the sequel. Paul's (now Muad'dib) final battle seemed to be won almost effortlessly, and felt nearly anticlimactic to me. Again, this could possibly just be lack of understanding on my part, for example, the significance of the atomics and how he used them. (Also, why wasn't there more kinetic weaponry? Blades work, and artillery, but no assault rifles? The lasgun dynamic was interesting as well.) But altogether I felt rather unsatisfied, not enough to ruin the book by any means, but it did cast a mild pall. Again, this might be requtified by viewing the sequel as a direct continuation. 

In Summary/TL:DR;
Dune is like a richly painted landscape. Rarely will you find such a unique and fleshed out world as the one Herbet has created. Full of unique concepts, and, to steal a phrase, 'philosophical vistas', it's a pleasure to explore ('Fear is the mindkiller' has become an almost daily mantra for me now). In these aspects it shows its sci-fi pedigree best. It's plot is complex, and for me, hard to follow, reducing my investment in it, and the characters, while interesting for the most part, generally lack in relatability, and often take on a transcendent nature. All in all a fascinating, if often bewildering journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4i8eln/dune_discussion/,2016-05-07T02:57:58Z,34,56,books,Dune,POST

p9aab0,Yet another Dune post - it really was fantastic though!,"Alright so this ones been on my radar for a while simply because of its legacy in the sci fi world. I hardly ever read sci fi but I do love fantasy and other fiction. But que the epic movie by Villeneuve with a star studded cast and amazing visuals, and I had to read this book.

It was hard to understand in the beginning, being dropped right into that world mid scene with no context and all kinds of bizarre words. I did use my phone at the start to look up the wiki on some words, ‚ÄúBene Gesserit, CHOAM, Gom Jabbar, Kwisatz Haderach etc‚Äù and eventually found myself comprehending much better the further I got. 

What.a.ride. The world building is gorgeous, and I quite enjoyed the GOT-esque feudal house system set in a distance space future, and all the scheming and plotting. Plus you‚Äôve got the big betrayal and downfall of House Atreides that you KNOW is coming, which makes you want to dive deeper. 
I just thought all the political, ecological, religious, eugenics/breeding program elements etc, were all beautifully crafted together into an epic story anyone could find something they enjoyed about it. I can see why Dune is so beloved. 
Also the scarcity for water on Arrakis made me really, really appreciate being on a planet made up of 70% water lol. Like I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to wear a stillsuit. All the water rituals really added to its importance in the book. 

Paul starts off like House Stark in GOT, the good guy House is all but obliterated and you‚Äôre waiting for their comeback after being scattered to the wind. And the payoff is big. I loved seeing Paul expand outward and basically know/experience all possible futures or timelines and how that changed his decisions and overall arc. Shoutout to some of my other faves, Jessica, Chani, Stilgar and Gurney! Not so sure how I feel about him aiming for the throne, and gaining more and more power but I understand it and his wanting to possibly minimize the coming Jihad. I did see less of his humanity in the end but what can you do when you‚Äôre like, the sickest most spiced out time god prophet eugenics baby there ever was? 

Also a side note, I did follow the Dune Club 12 part series on YouTube by Comic Book Girl 19 as I read and that helped immensely, especially because she was so passionate about the Dune universe.

i53qgr,In Awe After Reading Dune for the First Time,"Not sure where to begin, or what of the following has already been mentioned/discussed in this sub. But, I just finished Dune, and it **really** invigorated my week. 

Firstly, I'm perhaps more of a movie person than a book person, so I endeavored to read this book in anticipation for the film's release this December. I'm largely nescient when it comes to fantasy or sci-fi writing. (I think(?) people usually categorize Dune as science fiction, but I would argue Herbert adroitly combines the two genres -- but I'll get back to that). It can sometimes be difficult to will myself to read either of these genres, so I was reticent to start.  

And in that vein, this 800\~ page (my version) tome overwhelmed me slightly. I've read long books, but they usually take me months. Gravity's Rainbow, Infinite Jest, et cetera. They're fun feats to accomplish, but they're just that - feats, monumental efforts that take a better part of year and not without frustration and outside resources guiding my journey. 

I read Dune in 3 days. This is the first book in the **longest** time I just couldn't put down. Yes, it took me a little while to fully engross myself in the Arrakeen narrative, but once I hit a certain point, I was hooked! I couldn't really sleep Tuesday night, so what did I end up doing? I finished Dune at 4 in the morning. 

The way Herbert combines ecology with religion with technology with politics...It felt like such a unique reading experience. And that's where I think this book is equal parts science fiction and fantasy: The governmental aspects of planetary polities as limited by imperial control, influenced by a mining guild and a mystical school of witches? Whew. And maybe other sci-fi authors have included politics into their works in a similar manner, but this is all new to me. The worldbuilding is just so incredible.

Safe to say I was wrong. I got the Dune novel as a gift a few months ago, and this book was much better! The story was scifi, but it read like fantasy, and with the omniscient viewpoint I was able to understand the motivations of all of the characters. Also, what a master class of world building! 

Dune really is the story of human corruption and greed, and the ending did make some implications as to what will happen next.

56hk2t,Loved 'Pride & Prejudice' more than 'Dune' / 'Hitchhiker's Guide' ...now I am troubled !,"Recently I thought to read 'a book a week'. It went like this

**Hitchhiker's Guide...** - **Dune** - **Pride and Prejudice** - **The Passage** - **Sense and Sensibility** - **Fahrenheit 451** will start today ;)

Generally I lean towards Fiction/ SciFi but somehow I really liked PnP much more than HG/Dune (SnS, Passage were so & so). 

I have  gone through almost all top posts/reviews here/there/everywhere & I agree with sentiments expressed that maybe HG was revolutionary at its time & HG/Dune key points may have been repeated so many times now that I might not find those ideas novel anymore.

What I am really troubled/curious about is that I don't know the reason I liked PnP, even though its central theme has been hacked to death in modern novels/movies.

**tl;dr** This ~~is~~ was just a rant ! Thanks

**Edit** In conclusion may be it all boils down to expectations. I started both Dune/HG which are enormously popular but because I was somewhat exposed to their key points though other novels I was disappointed.

Guy seems more like a computer. 

However, the ending felt abit weird to me. I have since read that it was intentionally abrupt but it made Paul's journey feel abit too easy. Almost as if he was ticking boxes with ease on his way to becoming Emperor and winning. Aside from his father, he didn't really lose anything. It was even clear that his father would Die. I also thought that the Baron's death was unsatisfying.

I never felt like he was in any danger really, at any point. There were times were it felt intense but I knew he'd win because of the quotes at the beginning of chapters.

p7ascc,"Unpopular opinion: I didn't like Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Here is why. (Warning: spoilers)","So I just finished Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" and I am somewhat disappointed after all the good things I have heard about it.

I personally didn't like the book very much. The main reason for it is Paul Atreides. He is never in any real danger because he is op in every way. Not because of his own doing or achievements, but simply because of his genes and breeding. It's too much of a Jesus story. The one chosen man who changes everything, saves everything and everyone and brings righteousness to the world.

Another thing I don't like: at the end of the book Paul has every choice he wants, because he is either the Duke or Muad'Dib. He doesn't have to keep his word at all if he doesn't want to.

And don't get me started about the 80s movie. I stopped watching it because first of all the special effects were so ridiculous. Even for that time. And secondly because of the portrayal of the Harkonnens. In the book the baron may be fat and despicable, but he is not like this inbred, lunatic monarch as which he is portrayed in the movie.

siu3gd,"Dispatch From Arrakis: My Doomed Journey with ""Dune""","I must admit at the outset here that I am not generally a reader of Sci-Fi or Fantasy. I know that avid readers of these genres will say those are two distinct entities, but in essence what I mean is that I mostly read works set on our home planet and in the present day (give or take 50 years). However, when books break through the cultural moment, I feel the need to give them a shot. I‚Äôll admit to ‚ÄúGame of Thrones'' as a major cultural blind spot for me, where I have never seen an episode, and eventually finished the first book but did not continue. 

This brings us to ‚ÄúDune‚Äù. I am a fan of Dennis Villneuve, and I also broke my ‚Äúread the book first‚Äù rule to watch the film this fall. I was blown away by the movie, and wondered if I should try to read the book to see if it would extend the experience and give me the answers to the questions the first film left me with. After purchasing a trade paperback (with a beautiful cover design) I decided to embark on a literary trip to Arrakis. After about 80 pages, I stalled out and went back to literary fiction for a little while. Brief Dune adjacent remark, ‚ÄúKlara and the Sun‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Paper Palace‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeautiful World Where are You‚Äù all connected with me in a huge way. 

This whole time though, ‚ÄúDune‚Äù stared me down, and I decided to buckle down and give it another shot. On my second attempt I have (slowly) made my way a little more than halfway through and the narrative just passed the events of the film. I should say while I am reading it, I think it is pretty good, I can see why it became a classic and a huge influence on the genre, however, I just have no compulsion to read it. Even though I don‚Äôt know where the story ends (although I can guess), my reading has been way way down as I try to make my way through without abandoning it. I am not someone who says you must finish what you start, but I do want to give it a fair shot and I want to see where it ends. Additionally, I don‚Äôt want to stick only to my genre niche, and I do want to explore what else is out there!

TLDR: That is a very long way of saying that I am not hating but not loving ‚ÄúDune‚Äù, and wanted your thoughts! Did you love ‚ÄúDune‚Äù? Should I give it up or buckle down? Do you try to read outside of your taste or stick to what you like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/siu3gd/dispatch_from_arrakis_my_doomed_journey_with_dune/,2022-02-02T17:16:13Z,16,0,books,Dune,POST
h7rvvl,"Dune is fantasy, not science fiction","I finished Dune at the end of last month and have been thinking about the genre of the book for a while.

I find the main elements that compose the essence of the story to be mostly of a fantastical and supernatural nature than the product of science fiction, relating more to ""magic"" than to thought experiments like different technology or societies. For example: the spice melange, the powers of the bene gesserit, the transformation of the reverend mother, the worms, the structures of societies as feudal (empire) or tribal (fremen) and the excessive importance of wielding a blade.

Just because there is space travel doesn't make it science fiction. It's still a great book, I would just recommend it as fantasy with elements of science fiction, rather than ""one of the greatest science fiction books of all time"" as it is frequently regarded.

6ppoh4,Anyone else struggle to get into Dune by Frank Herbert?,"I've been meaning to get into the purported masterpiece of science fiction for a while now, but frankly I'm floundering. Herbert definitely put a lot of thought into the world and cultures of Dune, as evidenced in the first chapter with the sisters and the Harkonnen - but he plops the reader right into the middle of it with few signposts to guide them. A lot of it is how things are given names that I don't understand (eg. CHOAM, Landsraad, Mentat, gom jabbor, etc.) and even when I eventually puzzle it out, there are a slew of other new things to learn about in the next page so it's hard to hold all the foreign concepts together to visualize the worlds in Dune. It all comes down to a jarring and stumbling rhythm that I can't jive to. 

Are there other readers who struggled like I am? What helped you get through it? Or, if it doesn't improve, did you put it down and walk away?

P.S. I may get torched for this, but is Dune similar to The Lord of the Rings? ie. is the world as intricate as LOTR and sometimes told at a snail pace? In all honesty, I couldn't finish LOTR and I'm hoping Dune is different, but my spidey senses are tingling...",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6ppoh4/anyone_else_struggle_to_get_into_dune_by_frank/,2017-07-26T17:36:13Z,62,42,books,Dune,POST
15ee6q0,"After Dune as the start into Sci-Fi, proclaimed to be the best sci-fi novel on the backside, why is the book considered good?","I am not an avid reader at all and just started reading novels this year. I wanted to read the 'classics' of the genres first to figure out if I would like them at all but after reading Dune as the first sci-fi novel. I like the Star Wars movies and some of the games so I thought I might like it but I struggle to even find the thing that makes this book passable. I am writing this a couple days after finishing book 1.

I read reviews about it ranging from the best thing since sliced bread to hippies that are addicted to space cinnamon but I don't get it.

The world building and the philosophical aspect might be one but it isn't explained enough nor discussed enough in the book itself but I will keep it in mind because that seems to be the thing many people agree is well done. They named things in arabic(?) for some reason, not explained, they might be religious but that isn't explained either.

Seemed to me like they overthrew Arrakis just for the sake of it or at least there is no injustice or evil to defeat (which would be told by the omniscent narrator), the main character seemingly motivated by power?? Acually just spice addiction(/s)?? The messiah does a coup on the empire for spice but just why? and what is the relevance of the story to an unexplained situation in what looks like peace? 

Then the writing is done in such a way that every single emotion is conveyed everything is very hard to keep track of and this is intentionally done?? Intersting stylistic choice but I didn't even try to keep up with it. It follows the characters of the events and some of them die for some reason explained but I cannot recall who they were or what they were in the scenes. 

The dialogue was very offputting always talking about how there is no water and the ecosystem of arrakis(where they are voluntarily, they go there), how the spice is controlled by the guilds or whatnot. It never made a connection of what was talked about to what they were doing, not that that was a whole lot, no mention about what the control of arrakis is like. 

There is also no tension since it is early on established that the mc has vision of the consequence of his actions but then is surprised he didn't forsee what was going to happen.

None of it clicked, for me it is just a coup for the control of spice, not actually an arc since the mc knew he survives the duel, no actual lesson(not seeing in the future far ahead I guess), no actual context for why this matters in the universe either, because there is no context for Arrakis in the galaxis apart from being the only planet with spice. It seemed like the first episode of star wars with the coup and galactic civil war, Naboo being the place of intrest that time and it seemed bad for the same reason, apart from being the start to the galactic war it has nothing to tell just that htere is a messiah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/15ee6q0/after_dune_as_the_start_into_scifi_proclaimed_to/,2023-07-31T11:59:11Z,34,0,books,Dune,POST

aoietg,Yet another Dune post...,"So I just finished Dune after my 3rd or 4th attempt. I liked it... but at the same time I also felt it unnecessarily difficult and, at times, mediocre. There were moments of brilliance, and the story is very interesting, but I found it hampered both by long stretches of tedium and also by completely contrived ideas, words, etc. that leave the reader confused and without context. 

Part of my dissatisfaction is probably in part due to the long time between its publication and the present, and due to how many other books, movies, shows, etc. have borrowed from it. I'm glad to have read it for sure, since I consider myself a big sci fi fan, but I don't know that I'd give it the praise so many others do. 

**  **Minor Spoilers below** **

*I found the beginning of the book amazing. From the start up until Paul and Jessica are alone in the desert. I can think of few parts of any book that I read as fast. The noble resolution of Duke Leto, the slimy schemes of Baron Harkonnen, the subtelties of the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats, etc. This is the best part of the book imo.*

*But once Paul and Jessica hit the desert after the storm, I found it so tedious. From that time until Paul rides the worm and is reunited with Gurney I found pretty meh. To finish, the last scenes with battle, the Baron, and the emperor are really great, but I found myself a bit confused and disappointed by the ending. It all happened so fast. I guess I didn't grasp the significance of Count Fenring and Baron Vlad's convo back on Giedi Prime. I didn't quite even understand all the Count Fenring stuff. It really seemed that Herbert had a great opening of the book up until Paul was crowned the Lisan Al-Gaib, but many parts of the middle and end felt rushed and not well thought out.*

** **End of spoilers** **

Anyway, that's my take. I think the reader is asked to spend too much time trying to figure out what a Baliset is, or what the Faufreluches means, and to endure lots of long, unimportant parts, while the exciting parts are short and end unresolved. Just my two cents. I'm sure I'm about to get blasted by the book's many fans. Again, I didn't *hate* it, I just don't think it's as great as it's touted to be

In book four, I find that a lot of the elements that made the preceding novels enjoyable are absent, nay -- perverted. The transformation of narrative resembles Leto's ""evolved"" form -- it's grotesque. Herbert's tone (through Leto) is pedantic, the philosophizing which made the previous books so interesting to me in this volume just weigh down on the narrative.

k64obt,The Dune audio book: Look how they butchered my boy,"This is just my rant on how god-awful the Dune book on tape is you can find on Audible.

First of all, it‚Äôs not actually Dune. It‚Äôs a dramatic retelling of Dune without the author‚Äôs actual words. The actors themselves were clearly not in the same room for the recording so conversations sound jagged and poorly timed. 

Second, they completely exclude the lore which precedes each chapter. There are a ton of really important themes and foreshadowing which get told in these parts. Also each bit is like .5 - 1 page of text. So they just excluded about 30 pages GOOD content for no reason. 

Finally, on the topic of chapters, they completelllyyy miss the point with the chapter names. In the book, there are no chapter names. Just the lore which are excerpts from different books and stories within the Dune universe. In the Audio book, they use the title and author of these excerpts as the chapter name. So you get the impression that the rest of the chapter is being told by different authors in the universe. Basically it makes it seem like the story is being told by the Data Archivist from the first episode of the Animatrix who is accessing random files to piece together a story (that reference may be lost on some but for those who know you‚Äôll understand).

‚ÄúArrakis is a one-crop planet,‚Äù his father said. ‚ÄúOne crop. It supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It‚Äôs the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.‚Äù

jbzt9e,[Spoilers] Why is God Emperor of Dune so highly rated?,"About a year and a half ago I began on a journey to read books again, having not really read much since I was a child, and decided to start with the Dune series. 
I read the first book and absolutely loved it after being recommended by a friend, and decided I'd read the first 4 books, as I had heard that GEoD (God Emperor of Dune) was arguably the best in the series. 

After reading Dune Messiah I was absolutely hooked; it expanded on the amazing plot and characters of the first and expanded a universe I was yearning to know more of, and did it all in interesting and very thought provoking ways. The ideas of pre-determination, the awful jihad to come that Paul Atreides felt he had no choice but to go toward, etc were all so unique to me that I was captivated, and had to keep reading. 

Once I got to Children of Dune, my interest waned a bit, with the first half seeming to be very good with the idea of The Prophet possibly being Paul, and his children's adventures being somewhat captivating, but the second half began to dwindle a bit for me as not as interesting in the character development department as the previous two books had been, and admittedly getting a bit tired of both Duncan Idaho, and Frank Herbert's writing style (""tried to swallow in a dry throat"" ""came into [their] awareness"" being lines written so often you could make a drinking game out of them.) 

But I held fast after seeing virtually everywhere, YouTube, reddit, my friends who've read the series, that the fourth was so good it's worth it. So I trudged on, anticipating a return to the wonderful character building and plot driven stories I had grown accustomed to in previous installments. 

Then I finally began reading. What I'm about to say might get me alot of flack, but I genuinely believe I hated this book. 

For one, there's practically no plot. Nothing happens until basically the end of the books when Leto is killed alongside Moneo, and Siona (and another Duncan Idaho üôÑ) takes over. Over the course of the entire book, all we get is esoteric talk in the vein of Paul's monologues dialed up to 11, but without any surrounding circumstances and context with which to frame them. It's like if you were stuck in a groundhog day loop of Muad'dib waxing philosophical to his Fremen for an entire book. 

I will say, however, that some of his thoughts and speeches are incredibly quotable, but it almost feels as if the book was written for the sake of quotable bits and damn an actual story. 

Then we get on to some of what I consider to be the worst bits, that I have never personally seen spoken about: the homophobia and ignorance of women.


>""All soldiers are homosexuals at heart.""


>""Oh, yes. He says that the all-male army has a strong tendancy toward homosexual activities.""
>Idaho glared across the table at Moneo. ""I never...""
>""Of course not. He is speaking about sumblimation, abount deflected energies and all the rest of it.""
>""The rest of what?"" Idaho was prickly with anger at what he saw as an attack on his male self-image.
>""Adolescent attitudes, just boys together, jokes designed purely to cause pain, loyalty to only your pack-mates...things of that nature.""
[omitting block where Idaho and Moneo both remember youthful opportunities]
>Moneo nodded. ""The homosexual, latent or otherwise, who maintains that condition for reasons which could be purely psychological, tends to indulge in pain-causing behavior - seeking it for himself and inflicting it upong others. Lord Leto says this goes back to the testing behavior in the prehistoric pack.""

In these parts, and others I cannot find quotes for atm, it's heavily implied that homosexuality is an expression of immaturity and borderline sadism (tends to indulge in pain-causing behavior). As someone who is homosexual, this part is *very* hard to get past, but I trudged on. 

Then Frank writes about Nayla having an orgasm from watching Duncan Idaho climb a cliff. 

I legitimately laughed out loud and deeply cringed at the same time over this. I stopped reading for several days, unable to continue after this part. Did he have any idea of female biology and sexualiry? Didn't he have a wife? I can't help but feel a bit sorry for her here if this is something he believes can happen. 

I think my biggest issue with all of this, especially these past two parts, is just the lack of discussion I've been able to find or have personally seen whenever the book is brought up. Countless times people swear how amazing it is, and recommend it to people who have only read the first book, which leads to those people going into the book blind to some very heavy issues within, such as myself. I went into it expecting the best book in the series, and what I got was... this. 

The discussion I do see that brings this up is often met with people being told to ""suck it up"", ""get over it"", ""you're over reacting"", etc. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/cavq9w/struggling_with_antigay_themes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

In that post, the top comments all tell OP to ignore their problems with it, despite them being legitimate concerns. 

I'm not saying that most people on this subreddit or r/Dune are outright trying to sweep it all under the rug, I'm just so confused as to why I almost never see it brought up and only ever see it spoken about with the highest of praise when to me, this was just a terrible book that I would recommend most not read.

What I don't get is, why does everyone hate them so much?

In a forward, Brian Herbert lays out an interesting theory, which is that people hate the sequels because the ""hero"" side of Paul is indelibly tarnished.  He is no longer the saviour of Dune, but instead the figurehead in whose name thousands of years of suffering is begun.

I read a book by the Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco, Norwegian Wood by Murakami, and by then I thought that I was finally ""winning"" this over, until I started reading Dune by Frank Herbert.

I'm having such a hard time focusing, UNDERSTANDING but literally UNDERSTANDING what is going on, and I feel so stupid because this book was suggested by my friend who really liked it, and she wanted to discuss it with me like we did together with Norwegian Wood, but I just can't wait for the chapter to end every time and I'm left remembering almost nothing.

My father made me watch the Dune movie when I was 12 and I didn't understand a single thing. A week ago I was walking around my town with my girlfriend and saw the Dune book in a bookshop. I thought ""why not"" and bought it.
I instantly fell in love with the style, the world and the characters. Everything felt so real!

For those who are wondering about what the story is about:
the events revolves around Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto and Lady Jessica. The Duke is gonna be te Lord of a desertic planet, called Arrakis. This world is very important, because it is the only that produces a substance called Melange. It is also known as Spice and it gives special mental abilities to its user. Due to the fact that the Melange can not be produced in any artificial way, it costs a lot of money and everyone wants it.
I loved both Paul, the Duke and Jessica, Leto in a particular way. He is a strong leader, well versed in the art of politics and intrigues, but he is a honorable man like no other in the Dune's Universe.
His wife, Lady Jessica, is a Bene Gesserit. This is a special institution which teaches, only to girls, special techniques to, put it simple, be the best spies/manipolators that the galaxy has ever seen. The Bene Gesserit School remembered me of the Envoy training from Bay City, of R.K. Morgan.
Paul starts off like a plain character, but he developes into a very depth and interesting one by the end of the story. I still prefer Leto, but Paul sure is a great one.

I am now a fan of Dune, are the other books of the saga good like the first one? I plan on getting them anyway.

11vn3us,The comparison between Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West and Frank Herbert's Dune.,"Hi people,  
I've read the whole *Dune* saga and right now I am reading *The Decline of the West.* I noticed that there are some similar motifs between these two. Of course, it's hard to compare novels to the two-volumed historiosophic work, but such things as the fall and rise of the Empires, the place of a man in history, how the history of the *Dune's* galaxy is dynamic (terraforming of the planet), religion, etc., are pretty common themes in the works of these two different authors. Did you also notice some similarities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11vn3us/the_comparison_between_oswald_spenglers_the/,2023-03-19T14:39:31Z,1,6,books,Dune,POST
emst3x,Just finished Dune for the first time and I feel like I'm missing something.,"I'm a big sci-fi fan so I felt like I owed to it myself to finally read Dune but after finally slogging through this book I just don't get what the hype is about. Sure the world building is fantastic but that can't be the only thing that people liked right? I just feel like the entire book can be summed up as: interesting but not exciting.

Things just kind of happen with no real explanation or cause. And things that you would expect to be big event get rushed through with maybe a sentence or two and then the book moves on where things that seem trivial will get pages of detail. I never had any idea where the story was going because things would just happen and the characters would monologue and then the next thing would happen. I had no idea how the book was going to end until I realised I was halfway through the last chapter and then it just kind of stopped.

The whole dropping you into the world to figure things out thing was fine in the beginning where you were still trying to get a handle on the world but it started to get old quick and began to feel lazy. When you're in the last chapter of the book and you're still having to flip to the glossary to figure out what that random word the author used means without any explanation or contextual clues it starts to get annoying.

The dialogue in the book just felt off. I can't really explain why but every time characters talked I felt like words were being said but no real information was passing between them. I found this problem got way worse in the final third where the protagonist turned into the poster boy for r/iamverysmart. I also didn't have any attachment to any of the characters. They all either felt flat or were just insufferable. Honestly I found the baron just about the only character who actually felt like a good character even if he was just an archetypical villian, at least he was something. I couldn't stand Paul. Plus the whole world seemed needlessly sexist and patriarchal but that's kind of an aside.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the book as a whole. Sure the author did a fantastic job at creating a believable world but it felt like it was at the expense of an interesting plot. This is probably an unpopular opinion but I'm glad to be finished it so I can move onto something else, I definitely won't be continuing the series.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/emst3x/just_finished_dune_for_the_first_time_and_i_feel/,2020-01-10T15:54:11Z,50,34,books,Dune,POST

jhvuqw,Dune has caught me by surprise,"Dune is a legendary book. Promoted as one of the first big sci-fi books of its time, it blends sci-fi and fantasy and touches on themes ranging from ecology to politics to anthropology. It won the first Nebula Award, and its desert worm continues to haunt fiction writing to date. Though wary of reading a book just because it‚Äôs popular, I was cautiously optimistic when I bought the 50th Anniversary Edition of Dune.

I am not surprised that it won a Nebula Award. For the time, the breadth of topics it broached with a certain level of sophistication would no doubt have been revolutionary - it did after all propel the sci-fi genre into popularity.

And yet Dune is so, so terrible. I have come to page 305 but can read no further.
(harsh opinion incoming)


1. First, I want to re-examine Dune as a sci-fi novel.  What about it makes it sci-fi? The only real sci-fi element to Dune is when it deals with ecology, which though is supposedly a core theme of the book, is actually only fleetingly discussed. *Dune is fantasy, not sci-fi.* It‚Äôs about Orientalist, Arab tribes and European medieval nobles in conflict with themselves and each other; it‚Äôs about theocratic virtue philosophies and eugenicist aristocracies. Even its writing style sits comfortably among fantasy books, but not sci-fi. Which brings me to my next point...

2. The writing is so violently, impossibly awful. I have noticed a general trend between American and European fantasy authors, though in fairness I‚Äôve read a lot more of the latter than the former: to Europeans, fantasy is more about content; to Americans, fantasy is more about writing. I have the same issue with the (awful) Game of Thrones series, which I finished in its entirety through sheer stubbornness at being so completely disappointed. Harry Potter and the Witcher are immensely popular fantasy series which read as stories set in fantastical worlds. Game of Thrones and Dune read as pretentious, inflated olde fantasie writing which seems to think more words = better, to the detriment of content. I‚Äôve never understood the appeal of writing in a manner so long-winded and convoluted that my English teachers would have scrawled its pages red and bloody with ‚Äòconstructive feedback‚Äô.

3. The story is dull. This one upsets me, because it had the potential to be good. But even when I get past the ‚Äúlad‚Äùs, ‚Äúobey‚Äùs and ‚Äúmoon-frosted‚Äùs, the characters are incredibly dull. Their humanity and emotional struggles are described in an unconvincing attempt to balance their two-dimensional characters, and they are all masterminds. They don‚Äôt feel real; they feel like chess pieces - literally, not metaphorically. Yes, the characters are the products of deep psychological training and eugenic success, but really they are bland pawns to further a mind-map DnD story that the author wants to show, an excuse to move along a plot. And that plot is hollow and threadbare: as interesting as the varied allusions to (pseudo-)philosophies is, it feels like a lazy excuse to present a story that the writer is in love with... Just because the writer thinks using Arabic and awkwardly mish-mashing European history is cool, doesn‚Äôt mean I have to, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt make for stimulating content.


Dune is like a large, enticingly wrapped Christmas present left under the tree. The sight of it makes the whole room giddy: everyone knows, it feels so light for its size that there must be something valuable there. But when you sit down then open it, your jaw hangs open in surprise; a solitary sock lies in the centre, curled fetal. You look around to see your relatives still beaming at you in expectation. You feign enthusiasm... should have asked for Asimov.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/jhvuqw/dune_has_caught_me_by_surprise/,2020-10-25T16:06:52Z,16,0,books,Dune,POST

pafm5g,(Spoilers) Dune (first book)- Question re Jessica,"Again, light spoilers for the very beginning of Dune.

So the first chapter says Jessica is Paul‚Äôs mother.

I‚Äôm only a few chapters in (page 63), where the Duke is talking to Jessica as they stand in one of the public rooms in their Arrakis mansion (they just got there). Here, the Duke thinks about how he‚Äôs glad ‚Äúthat Paul favored [Jessica].‚Äù Further, the Duke talks about how Jessica can ‚Äúresume [her] custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible‚Äù and that Jessica should be thankful the Duke never married her.

So my question: what the heck is the familial structure here? It looks like the Duke bought Jessica, sired a child (Paul) but never married her? That seems odd from a royal family perspective, no? A duke having a child (his heir) out of wedlock?

If the familial structure/relationships/history is purposely clouded now with the purpose of revealing more to me later, feel free to tell me to just keep reading!

Yes, I did get sucked in and really enjoyed the second half, but that was only after forcing myself to keep reading in the first place. Was it worth it? I genuinely don't know.

Im a firm believer in the [XKCD rule of fiction](https://xkcd.com/483/), and Dune does not do well on that front.

sdd69x,Major themes of the six original Dune books written by Frank Herbert himself,"I‚Äôve been reading through the original Dune series. I liked the first book; the second and third were OK, but it just goes downhill from there. Here are my takeaways on the major themes of each novel (in order of prevalence within each book):

1. Right and wrong; family and personal loyalty versus group or ‚Äúhouse‚Äù loyalty
2. Demonic/ancestral possession; incest
3. Incest; demonic possession; how to create a lasting religious cult with yourself as the centerpiece
4. Tyranny as a necessary means to an end, while creating a lasting religious cult with yourself as the centerpiece
5. Breeding witches versus sex witches; child trauma as a means to an end
6. A sex witch becomes a breeding witch; child rape to induce childhood trauma as a means to an end

Also, after about the first two books, every female character (and, to be fair, a handful of male characters as well) is either a breeding mare or a literal sex dominatrix.

Hunger Games was okay, but I couldn't stand Maze Runner. To me, it was a worse execution of the ideas in the Hunger Games -

""I want to get a bunch of children into a highly unlikely scenario, how do I do it?""

Hunger Games: worldbuilding that gives a cultural reason for sending children to fight to the death

Maze Runner: Amnesia.

18eyf2a,Coming back to Percy Jackson as an adult and realizing how juvenile the writing style is,"edit: for anyone who thinks this post is calling the series bad, reread it again. i was just merely surprised at how easy it is, nobody was complaining

When I was in 3rd grade I read the first series of Percy Jackson. I had read Harry Potter a couple of times by then and the following year I had read The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Maze Runner. Throughout my life I‚Äôve come back to all of those books except for Percy Jackson, which I am doing so now in preparation of the new TV show. 

I‚Äôve read Harry Potter 10 times across my life and have never felt like I was reading a juvenile book each time I‚Äôve read it, in fact there‚Äôs way more details to analyze in the first few books as you reread. And I guess I‚Äôm shocked with how easy the reading level is for The Lightning Thief. I really thought Percy Jackson would be one of those series‚Äô that could be reread with more analysis as you get older (and I know this rings true for Heroes of Olympus, just merely talking about the first 5 books) but I‚Äôm shocked with how much easier TLT is to read than Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone is. 

I‚Äôm enjoying it for sure, but I think it‚Äôs starting to become clear why I never revisited Percy Jackson the same way I did other books and that‚Äôs because I was able to easily comprehend them on first read through and that made it easier to feel like I didn‚Äôt have to go back and reread to see if I missed anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18eyf2a/coming_back_to_percy_jackson_as_an_adult_and/,2023-12-10T07:42:17Z,390,1722,books,The Maze Runner,POST

6iyjge,Just finished reading The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner Book #2),"I became a huge fan of the Maze Runner Trilogy the moment I saw the first film. Before that, I didn't know it existed. I'm sure many of you might disagree, but I loved the Scorch Trials film too. Maybe a bit more that the first movie. This was like 2 years ago, and in these past 2 months I've read the Maze Runner, and just finished The Scorch Trials minutes ago.

Now I know film adaptions like The Maze Runner usually leave some details of the books out, and make changes to the plot that they see fit, but I have never seen a film adaption have such a disregard for the entire plot of it's book like the Scorch Trials. Other than a FEW scenes that were SOMEWHAT similar to the book, the film and book have nothing in common outside the name and characters. This caught me off guard because I thought I""d at least know the general storyline like I did The Maze Runner, but the Scorch Trials movie and book were almost as if they didn't even belong to the same franchise.

BUT, I still love the movie of course. I even preferred the film up until I got to the second half of the book, mainly because I didn't like it's bizarre beginning. But once you get to the Second half, the book really picks up. The ending was incredible.

And for the movie, I liked how it put an emphasis on rebelling against WICKED, while the book was more about bowing down to them. Also, the zombie-lover side of me likes the movie's version of the Flare slightly better, but the book was so much more interesting and detailed. 

I really like both of them, but I'd have to say I prefer the book overall. It's hard to compare them since they're so different though. I'd love to know your opinions on them (or either one of them) too",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6iyjge/just_finished_reading_the_scorch_trials_maze/,2017-06-23T02:59:59Z,10,0,books,The Maze Runner,POST
2bqb1i,The Maze Runner Series -- Anyone currently reading the series or has completed the quartet.,"I'm 75% through with the first book in the series, the Maze Runner. The book is entertaining and a generally good read. I am not one to spoil things for myself, but I have read mixed reviews about the completion of the series.  
My favorite genre is the distopian future, so I naturally gravitated to these books. However, many reviews say the final books were not good and users ""read the rest for completion and not for entertainment.""  
This concerns me and has me questioning if I should continue with the series.  
  
  
Please share your thoughts on the matter.

I wanted to ask /r/books if i should read ""The Kill Order"" first or go with the order of release and read ""The Maze Runner"" first, i'm really confused and i don't know what to do, because i'm afraid that if i read ""The Kill Order"" first i will spoil something of the trilogy.

2nd3xj,Maze runner series - thoughts about the dynamic of relationship between Thomas and Teresa - (spoilers),"
After learning about the interesting plot of the movie ‚ÄúMaze Runner‚Äù about a week ago, I picked up the series on Amazon to read. A week later (last night) I was completed reading the third part of the series ‚Äì The Death Cure. I was most disappointed about the ending and let me explain to you why.

**Maze Runner**

Thomas grew very close to Teresa in the first book, which reflected in the telepathic exchanges they had throughout the first book and to me it seemed to represent an emotional bond that could overcome the effects of memory withholding device. Another indication of this was that most of the flashbacks Thomas had were specifically about Teresa. By the end of the book, they were practically (in their minds and hearts, it seemed) inseparable. 

**Scorch trials**

At the start of the second book ‚Äì Scorch Trials ‚Äì they obviously got separated and their ability to talk to each other in their minds was restricted. Soon after the second phase began, Thomas met Teresa for the first time after their separation while crossing the wasteland towards the city. Teresa was controlled by the WICKED, but her will was strong enough to interrupt the control for a moment and let her real self talk and interact with Thomas. And this is where it starts, Thomas gives little appreciation and concern about Teresa, doesn‚Äôt try to break her free, capture her, take her along ‚Äì all because of a lousy tattoo on his neck?! He just strolls along. Fast forward, Teresa speaks to Thomas telepathically saying that horrible stuff is going to happen to him, but nevertheless, he can trust her and it‚Äôs all going to be good in the end. Fast forward again ‚Äì Thomas gets kidnapped by Teresa, banged on the head, made feel betrayed, manipulated, put into a box making him think that he was going to be killed. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt happen, he wakes up in the box few days later with Teresa waiting at the door and explaining him that she was forced to do this by WICKED otherwise they would have killed him!!! 

--

Here, Ok, I understand that Thomas felt bad and all, but no one really pays attention to the fact that the greatest sacrifice here was made by Teresa, she was forced to do these horrible things to someone she deeply loved (as I understand it), she had to watch all that, hurt him, make out with another dude in front of him, make her lover feel that he would be killed by her hand. Am I really the only one who thinks this way?

**Death cure & Conclusions**

Then fast forward throughout the book into the next one, Thomas finds great mistrust against Teresa for following the orders of WICKED, but then seemingly doesn‚Äôt question Brenda after finding out that she has been working for WICKED the whole time and played his wannabe lover (that‚Äôs the actual betrayal). On the numerous encounters with Teresa, she continues to apologise to Thomas for something she shouldn‚Äôt apologise for (mind the controlling part and the only way to save his life part), I mean Brenda didn‚Äôt apologise for not telling him the truth or Gally didn‚Äôt apologise for killing Chuck since he was under the influence of WICKED and in the latter two cases that was that ‚Äì no hard feelings. Thomas continuously maintained his suspicion and anger against Teresa for no apparent reason failing to see things from a fair perspective i.e. she experienced all this horrible stuff to save his life, no other reason. 

--

Then comes the end, WICKED complex is crumbling, Thomas is fighting off a griever when Teresa jumps on to the monster to yet again ensure Thomas safety, but Thomas sees it as her redemption for what she did in the Scorch (redemption? Thomas, buddy, think about it). Then the final moments come, Teresa shoves Thomas out of harms way from a falling slab of concrete getting squashed by it in the process. In her final moments, Teresa says: ‚ÄúAll I ever cared about was‚Ä¶. ‚Äú. Obviously she meant to say ‚Äú‚Ä¶you‚Äù. Thomas in comparison to other friends he lost throughout the series (Chuck and Newt in specific) shows only a slight hint of sadness for her death. An hour later, he takes a romantic stroll with Brenda on the other side of the Flat trans and they make out. The End. 

--

Am I the only one that struggles to understand Thomas reasoning and emotional character with respect to Teresa? In my opinion, it was him who actually betrayed Teresa with his ability to grasp all the circumstances surrounding their encounters. Something you would not expect from the brightest among brightest.

Sorry for the vent and if you did read the above, please give me your thoughts.

12br47,"My thoughts on The Maze Runner, a dystopian novel by James Dashner","I was planning to leave this post as a response to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wf969/ever_heard_of_the_maze_runner/), but I started to go on and on typing, and thought a 5-month dead thread wouldn't get much notice, so instead I'm selfposting it.

This year I realized what my favourite genre is, the one over the rest. Dystopian novels.

It hit me after reading The Hunger Games trilogy, Ready Player One and Snowcrash in a row. I was obsessed with books like 1984 and Brave New World. All of them had something in common, and in no time I figured out what it was. Soon I found myself digging for some more material. I found Battle Royale, Fahrenheit 451, Clockwerk Orange and some more I can't remember right now. I loved each and everyone of them.

Last week, as I ran out of books once again, I decided to give [TasteKid](http://www.tastekid.com) a chance. Great resource to find music you like from, well... *music you like*. It has two more categories for Movies and Books, but I had never tried it. I put all three Hunger Games books and Battle Royale, and then it showed up: *The Maze Runner*.

The description of the book was confusing, almost enigmatic. English isn't my first language, so I wondered if something was wrong with me, not being able to picture what exactly was going on in The Glade. That was the hook that kept me reading in the beginning. I was trying to understand what was behind the cameras, who WICKED was, and what exactly was happening in the world if them kids were running around on a freakin' maze.

The answers came in little pieces, and boy my mind was melting trying to find the true meaning behind them.

The read went on, just like a videogame. At some moments, I wished that the tension could hold up in the air for a little longer; maybe it was because I read too fast, but for example [The Death Cure](/s ""the death of Newt""), or [The Death Cure](/s ""Teresa"") were so quick that I didn't have time to shed a tear. The only moment I could feel enough moved, was when [The Scorch Trials](/s ""Aris and her ""betrayed"" Thomas""), one of the best scenes in the whole story.

Surprisingly, in contrast to my last statement, what I loved the most was the chapter separation. The way the last sentence of them left you wanting more, and at the same time, connecting perfectly with the next one, sometimes keeping the veil, sometimes letting go in few words. When I noticed it first I just could think *""wow, thats pretty cool, nice detail""*, and then, one chapter after another, this repeated flawlessly. No room for dissapointment.

Beside from that, things like [The Maze Runner](/s ""WICKED is good""), [The Death Cure](/s ""Newt's note (seriously Tom, how could you forget about it, damn!)"") and that feeling that maybe, even in the end, everything could just have been a trick, an illusion, kept me going on and on, to the point of reading Death Cure in just two days. I wanted to solve the puzzle.

The ending didn't left me thinking a lot, probably because I reached the end in the bus back home. I was a bit sad that [The Death Cure](/s ""in the end, everything was not an illusion, that no more surprises would pop up. But hey, every story comes to an end... also, I was happy that the couple I had chosen from the beginning had worked out, or at least it was going to. It felt warm"").

Last but not least, I'll leave you with [my own image of The Maze](http://www.fake-geeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pendulum-logo.jpeg). I just couldn't picture it any other way.

My question is; now that I've seen the movie, is it okay to simply start with the second novel? Or is the first one worth reading even though I'm already aware of the plot now?

Or if you have any other recommendations that'd be cool too, I'm really just trying to pick up the hobby again.

77rekl,"Just finished reading ""The Maze Runner"" (the first three books). Is it normal to have cared more about the story than the characters? (spoilers)","I started reading a few months ago, and this is the 2nd series that I have read (the other being Michael Grant's ""Gone"" series). While I definitely enjoyed The Maze Runner, I wanted to know how you all reacted to the books. Note: I've only read the first 3 books (The Maze Runner, Scorch Trials, Death Cure), not all 5 books.

What I thought was interesting is that I cared more about the story than the characters. For example, when Aris and Teresa 'betray' Thomas in the 2nd book, my reaction was not, ""Aw, poor Thomas. I don't like Teresa/Aris now."" My reaction was, ""Wait, are they right for doing this? Are they telling the truth? I'm confused."" I wasn't attached to the characters too much. I read solely to answer the question ""What is going on and why?""

I don't think this is a bad thing, I truly did enjoy the books and found most every story told in this world interesting. But I wish I cared about the characters more. However, to me, it felt like the story was bigger than the characters (Thomas). And I wish I cared more about Thomas. But it's hard to care about a character when their story is ""I'm in a maze now, how did I get here? Oops, did I do this? Sorry, let me not choose to not remember anything so the reader stays confused."" 

Now in hindsight I can see this as Thomas's redemption story: Thomas helped to create controversial human experiments, realized they are bad, and vowed to take it down. Maybe if I read with the intention of sympathizing with Thomas instead of reading with the intention of understanding WICKED I would have enjoyed the books more. But in reading this the first time I was so focused on ""wait, who is telling the truth"" that I didn't invest into the Thomas's growth as much. Is this normal?

How did you all feel about The Maze Runner series? When reading, is it a normal thing to care about ""the story"" more than ""the characters""? Do writers make books for us to intentionally care more about the story? Any other feelings about this series you want to mention?

1bk56xm,"Are there modern ""Blockbuster"" novels (Like James Clavell back in the day)","Watching Shogun on Disney reminded me of James Clavell's novel that I read back in the 80's and the phenomenon of Blockbuster fiction that was so prevalent at the time. They weren't high literature but they had gripping plots and impressive world building and they were a thumping good read. They were also massive beefy tomes. I think the authors must have been  paid by weight.

Is there any equivalent any more? Does the era of the blockbuster novel no longer exist?

A lot of folks are confused by my use of the word blockbuster. I don't have a precise definition but the following characteristics applied:

Best selling book that everyone knew about and talked about.

1000+ pages long

Epic Saga

Not very literary but nevertheless a cracking good read.

17qplat,Contained worlds and the disappointment of their broader setting,"Okay so why is it that series such as *The Promised Neverland*, *Maze Runner*, *Attack on Titan* etc. - those built on withholding a 'world outside' - always seem to miss the landing in the design of their broader settings? The atmosphere within the walls, within the island, for AoT and that inside the facility in Promised Neverland feels so much deeper, larger than itself, that once the greater world is revealed, it feels lacking in something.  
This is all decidedly subjective of course, but could anyone explain why I feel this way? Is it really a fault on the writers' parts, or could it just be the nature of such a setup?

s32xdy,The Romance in Romance Books sucks,"In all honesty, I don't read romance that much but when I do it feels bland and lacks real chemistry. The characters simply feel like they're there just for the romance. They're one-dimensional. They hardly have lives out of their little romantic act. And then even when they do get together it's underwhelming.

On the other hand, I've read a lot of YA dystopian novels and I feel like the romance is done so much better. The relationship forms naturally and I feel myself whole-heartedly shipping the characters whereas with real romance its just like ""they got together? That's nice I guess.""

Or maybe I just have bad taste in romance idk.

Edit: You guys make a lot of good points, I guess I may have generalised romance after a few duds. As for which YA books I've read, there's Hunger Games, The Darkest Minds, The Outliers and Maze Runner. If you guys have any plot-focused romance books I'd love to read them.

a19w68,"I love YA novels. They re-sparked my interest in reading. And yet, I'm nearly a 40 year old male. What the hell.","I used to read fervently when I was a pre-teen into my teens until I was near the end of Highschool but I stopped altogether for other things.

Anyway, my 12 year old son has collected a lot of books, but he hardly ever reads them. I was having a slow period at work and thought I'd bring one to the office just to check out on slow periods. 

Two days later I finished Divergent. Then I finished the series. Then I crushed through the Hunger Games. Then I pounded through Harry Potter (oh god those are so good), and now I'm going to either read The Maze Runner or the Testing series. 

I don't know what it is, but part of me feels weird for being my age and loving these Young Adult novels. But at the same time, I think they're great in a popcorn and giv'er kind of way. I can blast through them quick. They're not nearly as shitty as people my age have made them out to be. They're just straight up fun. 

They make me feel young. I can feel teenage me salivating over these books. I would have eaten these up. All I had back then were Lord of the Rings, Discworld and a bunch of strange fantasy novels. I mostly stuck to classics like 1984, Fear and Loathing, Gatsby etc.

The books could have been redeemable if tit were play a bit schlock like. But its 100% percent dry and dead serious story and the ending to the series makes no sense.

32ch5s,You know what really annoys me about the YA genre?,"How the majority of YA books have to have some reference to 'The Hunger Games'. Fuck off Hunger Games, those books were terrible. What was a fantastic YA trilogy? The Maze Runner. Let me just go over to my copy: *""A must for fans of the Hunger Games""*. The Hunger Games wishes it could be half as good as The Maze Runner. Westerfelds *Uglies*: *Before the Hunger Games there was...*. Because even a book published before THG still has to live up to it. 

So it's not so much the books as the covers. I just dislike that a book can't stand on it's own merits, it has to be likened to something else which is, in this case, **vastly inferior**.

(Yeah, ok, I really, **really** hated the last Hunger Games novel.)

But it's true with any trend. Any book that becomes popular others have to try and steal that glory. I just want good books to stand on their own merits and not have to attempt to steal the fame of others. It's cheap. 

I'm sure there are more examples but I can't think of 'em right now.

tl;dr: when book covers reference whichever series is the most famous right now. I hate it.

immelo,Regarding dystopian future novels - how can you identify the good from the bad?,"So there is a certain niche for dystopian stories in almost every kind of medium that exists. It is a perfect way to build up the story however the author sees fit which can make almost any dystopian garbage seem possible or real, and it can be added an extra meta story to reflect a certain issue or unforeseen problem.

Many dystopian stories are built on the idea where some kind of authority takes control and everyone else somehow seems to never object against it (or perhaps the control is done in a very clever way) - Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World.

These are novels that are built upon the idea of a sort of warning if authority figures take their control too far. 

But in other scenarios, dystopian stories are done in what seems to be an epic and gripping story but somehow feels to make itself seem real or authentic - the Hunger Games sometimes fails at this, the Maze Runner, Divergent and so on. 

Interestingly enough, the titles that I just mentioned are mostly young adult novels and apparently, dystopian stories are common in YA books. 

I really like dystopian stories. They are good oppurtunity for world-building, creative liberties and adding morals in creative ways. 

But no story is perfect and some stories are either not thought out well enough or fail in making the story gripping enough",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/immelo/regarding_dystopian_future_novels_how_can_you/,2020-09-04T19:19:40Z,8,4,books,The Maze Runner,POST

Then there was Twilight that spawned 50 Shades of something and the deluge of whatever that ensued. Vampires and gray shaded settings in literature exploded. I didn‚Äôt read or care for them, but they were markedly successful. 

However, I can‚Äôt recall any successful young adult fantasy stories that were set in a wizarding school. Of course there is Percy Jackson as far as young adult fantasy is concerned - but that setting is focused on mythology and not a magic school. It also started eight years after the success of HP. You‚Äôd think in that window something would have happened.

Any thoughts? Any series that could be considered a successful copy cat? It‚Äôs actually surprising that we don‚Äôt have well known and relatively successful books like, *The Hexing Academy* and *Magician High* with B movies already and divisive ratings.

7wbs4w,Just wanted to share my thoughts on the books I've read in the last 2 weeks.,"I've been doing a lot of reading as I spend a lot of time breastfeeding my daughter and I needed a good book to get into to help pass the hours (especially overnight). Here's what I've read recently- 

Station eleven - this was a recommendation on another post to another redditor and I decided to go try it. It was great- although I felt like if the story had been expanded it could have been an epic book like The Stand or Swan Song. It just felt a bit shallow despite all the potential.  

Emergencies Only by Amanda mcclelland. A biography about one woman who works in humanitarian crises across the world.  I really liked it, but it left me feeling hungry for more stories about Ebola and what it was really like on the front lines. Also she sounded so confident and sure of herself the entire book that I felt slightly intimidated while reading. 

Try Hard by Em Rusciano. An Australian comedians biography, it was nothing special but was a nice fluffy read for a few hours. 

Thirsty by Joel Creasey.  Another Australian comedians biography, this one had some surprising levels of insight into personality flaws and good reflections, which I enjoyed. Plus he was witty and biting throughout. 

I'm now reading the fever code by James dashner, the prequel to the Maze Runner series. Also just downloaded Fahrenheit 451 after reading about it on reddit- looking forward to this one! 

Please feel free to comment any feedback about any of these books! I'd love to chat about them.

7256on,So I just finished Lorien Legacies (the I Am Number Four Series),"I honestly have no idea how Lorien Legacies isn‚Äôt big enough to be one of the major YA fiction series out there like Divergent, the Mortal Instruments, the Hunger Games, the Maze Runner, Ect. Honestly, this book series was incredible, and I‚Äôm excited because Patticus Lore  recently released the first book of the follow up series (Generation One, the beginning of the all new Lorien Legacies Reborn!) a few months back and I‚Äôm planning on reading after I get through the next 2 books on my to-read list. Anyway, I loved the plot, the character development, the detail, the plot twist and cliff hangers. These 7 books deserve so much more recognition, and certainly deserve more than that god awful parody of I Am Number Four that Michael Bay released (if you‚Äôve already seen the movie, please don‚Äôt judge the book by it, as the book was a masterpiece)

Ironically, the film was originally what got me into it when I was a freshman in high school. I really liked the concept and trailer so I watched the movie and I remember it being very good, but that was almost a decade ago. I finally read I Am Number Four (the first book of the series) earlier this year and loved it. Then, after all these years, I rewatched the film. Terrible. Even with my book bias aside, the acting sucked, the dialogue sucked, the plot was all over the place, it didn‚Äôt even seem like they attempted to include detail. I have no idea why I liked it so much back then, but I‚Äôm at least glad I did cause I wouldn‚Äôt have read the books otherwise. 

Anyway, if you‚Äôre a fan of Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, or any of those YA series I just listed, I highly recommend you give LL a shot. It‚Äôs now my second favorite series after Harry Potter. I can‚Äôt wait to read Generation One",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7256on/so_i_just_finished_lorien_legacies_the_i_am/,2017-09-24T14:04:18Z,12,12,books,The Maze Runner,POST
j6lnnm,"I‚Äôm rereading the ‚ÄòSummoner‚Äô series by Taran Matharu for the first time, I forgot how good the series was! This is a little review and comparison of some aspects to other series.","So, I‚Äôve had a lot of books sitting on my shelves during quarantine, and after rereading the Wax and Wayne trilogy of \*Mistborn\*, all of \*Inheritance Cycle\*, \*Mortality Doctrine\*, and \*Maze Runner\*, I went straight back into the adventures of Fletcher, Othello, and Sylva. One thing I immediately realized is just how hate-able the Nobles, Didric, and the Inquisitors are. Their lying, crocodile tears, and manipulative personalities reminded me of Dio Brando (\*JoJo‚Äôs Bizzare Adventure Part one: Phantom Blood\*) and Draco Malfoy (\*Harry Potter\*), some of my favorite villains, minor and major alike. I also find the magic system very interesting. It‚Äôs similar to \*Inheritance Cycle‚Äôs\* magic, although a demon is necessary to perform magic, while a dragon is not. The mana is also very balanced and doesn‚Äôt make magic outright unnecessary, but also allowing more traditional weapons, like Fletcher‚Äòs signature weapons, his bow and his khopesh, still be relevant. One problem I seem to have with some fantasy is that, when there is magic, it sometimes outshines the normal weapons too much. Another example of it being done well is \*DanMachi\*. Passing out from exhaustion is a prefect way to limit magic use, and the ‚Äúweak spell=short chant vs powerful spell=long chant‚Äù. I feel that this series hit the balance between magic and weaponry right on the mark. I also think that Fletcher‚Äôs tatoo trick was pretty clever, as when one would say ‚Äúorganic material‚Äù for your magic circle you wouldn‚Äôt normally look at the material most literally at your fingertips. Now, this series isn‚Äôt perfect, either. For example, I find that (spoilers for about 60 pages into \*Inquisition\* >!Fletcher actually being a Raleigh was somewhat forced so we could put him into political meetings. Simply getting Othello or Sylva‚Äòs POV would‚Äôve worked!<, although I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs a huge problem. It was also important to get Fletcher a say in the matter rather than us just getting information. I also think some of the bs stories that Didric gave in court we‚Äôre too bs-y and inconsistent to actually belive, but i suppose even the weakest argument can win the case if it has money and a corrupt political system, but the judge didnt seem as biased as the inquisition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j6lnnm/im_rereading_the_summoner_series_by_taran_matharu/,2020-10-07T06:01:54Z,3,3,books,The Maze Runner,POST
2ta51d,"What are the best ""easy-reading"" classics?","There is the list of books we're supposed to read and then there is the sub-list of ones we really shouldn't have missed. 

The ones that immediately tear you away from reality and submerge you into their worlds. 

The ones that create an addiction of sorts, where you can't stop. And if you're forced to stop then they're practically all you can think about until you get back to them. 


Two that come to mind are ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and ""Night.""  Their opposites for me would be ""Moby Dick"" and ""The Scarlet Letter."" At some point in our lives we should read all of these, but I would never consider the latter two easy to consume.

72ohcn,"Which book/books did you find really promising at first then, upon further reading, you realized you just didn't care for the story?","Anyone else feel this way? For me, the current book is *The Boat Runner, by Devin Murphy.* I really liked the premise but after a few chapters I realized I wasn't feeling it.

I feel like this has been happening to me more and more lately, ever since I've been trying to expand my reading repertoire. Usually I stick with thrillers and the occasional historical fiction novel and the even rarer nonfiction. Since I've expanded my repertoire I HAVE found some gems I wouldn't have ordinarily discovered, but there are still those that seem promising that I ended up not liking.

p4z1e7,I'm amazed how many knock offs of The Hunger Games there are,"I think we can all remember *The Hunger Games* and its many, many rip-offs. Young Adult dystopian novels all about teenagers overthrowing some sort of evil totalitarian government while getting in love triangles. These inundated the market for years, and they still make them sometimes.

If you want to kill an hour, check out the [Dystopian YA Novel](https://twitter.com/DystopianYA) twitter account, it‚Äôs inactive now, but still really funny.

I read a bunch of these when I was younger, and I‚Äôll admit that quarantine made me bored enough to read some more. After spending so much time on these over the years, I‚Äôve decided to compile my thoughts on them all and put them out there for Reddit‚Ä¶ Because clearly, we‚Äôre all in the target audience. 

#Tier 1: Kind of decent to good

- The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins): The inspiration for the entire dystopian YA genre. Popularity doesn‚Äôt always equal quality, but in this case it does. This is a dark, depressing story about what it‚Äôs like for a normal person to live under the thumb of a totalitarian regime and go through a war. There‚Äôs also some intelligent commentary on things like American obsession with violent media and the nature of celebrity worship. Katniss is a solid protagonist who, while she‚Äôs an accomplished archer and does some badass things, never feels like an action hero who could win the war by herself, she‚Äôs just as swept up in world events as everyone else. It‚Äôs a pity most of the copycats only took the aesthetics of this series without understanding what made it work, because this is a very solid read. If you haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet, I‚Äôd recommend checking it out.

- Legend (Marie Lu): This one is, obviously, also about overthrowing an authoritarian regime, but at least it has a twist. This one has two main characters, June, who works for the evil government and Day, who is a famous criminal. Watching June chase down Day and slowly realize that the system she‚Äôs been working for isn‚Äôt worth protecting is satisfying, if a bit predictable, and the way that the evil government gets brought down is more unique than a simple ‚Äúshoot all the bad guys‚Äù story. That said, there‚Äôs a lot of dumb stuff ranging from a character with a ‚Äúbum leg‚Äù still doing parkour like a circus acrobat to the city of Denver being covered by a giant dome. If you‚Äôre a fan of this genre then this one might interest you, if you‚Äôre not it won‚Äôt change your mind.


- Enclave (Ann Aguirre): I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm a sucker for this one since its setup reminds me of *Metro 2033*. Generations after some sort of war destroyed the surface world, a bunch of tribes survive in metro tunnels, fighting off some sort of mutated creatures called Freaks. And due to various issues with nutrition and illness, most everyone in these tribes dies in their early 20‚Äôs, so there‚Äôs an explanation for why teenagers do everything. There‚Äôs not a lot to say about this one, I just enjoyed the action scenes, horror elements, and the main romance. Hardly a literary masterpiece, but a lot of fun.

- The Maze Runner (James Dashner): A bunch of kids with no memory crammed into a maze and they have to find their way out. If that interests you, you should at least check this one out. The storyline is stupid and doesn‚Äôt make much sense, but the characters, action, and fast pace kept me from caring too much. This one feels almost like a prequel to all these other dystopias, where we get to watch the world fall apart in preparation for the evil government to rise. Not a smart series, but I enjoyed it.

#Tier 2: Mediocre to bad

- Matched (Ally Condie): In a world where all marriages are arranged, one brave girl dares to buck the trend and go after he boy she truly loves. If you‚Äôre groaning already, I don‚Äôt blame you. This series does everything you would expect it to based on the premise. The main character whose name I can‚Äôt be bothered to look up has a little personality, which is more than some, but she‚Äôs still defined by her romantic exploits and is still important to the rebellion just because the author says so. The most I can say is that this isn‚Äôt offensively bad in any regard.

- Breathe (Sarah Crossan): In *this* dystopia, everyone lives in a giant domed city because there's no oxygen outside and those inside have to pay for the privilege of breathing. At first, I thought it was refreshing to see a dystopia that was actually commenting on society rather than just saying ""totalitarianism is bad."" That quickly fell apart though. The reasons for the world being oxygen-less are extremely stupid, to put it mildly. It's told in a 1st-person POV from 3 different characters (Bea, Quinn, and Alina), all of whom have identical narration, none of whom are very likable or interesting. Bea in particular was very annoying, she spent the whole 1st book complaining about unrequited love. All the secondary characters are just plot devices that are intended to move things along or make the MC's look cool. It's only in tier 2 because I like the setup so much.

- Article 5 (Kristen Simmons): This one is more ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù than ‚Äúbad,‚Äù though it‚Äôs still bad. Rather than being in a fictional country after a vague apocalypse, it‚Äôs in the United States after a major religious movement has led to a borderline theocratic dictatorship where being a religious minority or a woman means you have no rights. Ember is a girl who gets separated from her mom and brought to a ‚Äúreeducation facility‚Äù to turn her into a proper woman. The first book is about her escaping and trying to meet her mother which, while it has issues, is a focused story that has nothing to do with any sort of generic rebellion, and the worldbuilding has more effort put into it than other crappy dystopias. But then the 2nd and 3rd books fall back into that same overdone storyline, only slightly worse than average. Why is Ember important to the rebellion? Because the author says so, she isn‚Äôt an action hero or a leader or even a propaganda mouthpiece, she‚Äôs just a normal person caught up in all this and instead of utilizing that, the story pretends she‚Äôs something else.

- Configured (Jennetta Penner): Apocalypse, new society with everyone split into different levels of intellect, eugenics is bad, blah blah blah. This one starts off strongly, with the main character already resentful of the things her government has done to her while still thinking that it‚Äôs the best way to run things and the 1st book does a good job of exploring that inner conflict. After that, the core mystery isn‚Äôt very good, and the rebellion plotline has nothing new to offer. Truth be told, I hardly remember any of it.

#Tier 3: Utter Trash

- The Testing (Joelle Charbonneau): The world has ended. Now the only kids who can have the chance to attend college and escape poverty are the ones who can pass some sort of test that kills some of them. Makes perfect sense. This one feels like someone wrote out the series described in the Dystopian YA Novel twitter account completely unironically. I don‚Äôt even have anything else to add.

- Divergent (Veronica Roth): This one is definitely the most popular *Hunger Games* rip-off, big enough that Lionsgate tried to split the 3rd book into 2 movies only to fall flat on their face. It sounds neat, if stupid, at first: In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, society is split into 5 factions that all have to work together. Then the main character girl joins Dauntless, the brave faction who does all of the fighting. Then evil dudes take over the government and they have to fight them. Then there‚Äôs other forces outside Chicago. The story? A mess with no real stakes. The cast? Blander than toast, I don‚Äôt remember a single one. The setting? Incomprehensible. Stay far away from this one.

- Delirium (Lauren Oliver): In a world where love is considered a mental illness, one brave girl dares to fall in love with a boy who's in hiding from the government. The prose of this is laughable, at one point the narrator says that someone's eyes are ""literally dancing with light"" and it only goes downhill from there. The two leads are the same thing we've seen a million times, the ordinary, plain girl and the brooding emo boy who tries not to fall for her, but still does. Why is this trash tier? Because the author clearly ran out of ideas halfway through the 3rd book and so she spends half the book on the MC leading the obligatory rebellion and the other half with her slightly-more-annoying friend who's stuck in a shitty marriage. Barf.

- Save the Pearls (Victoria Foyt): Okay, you‚Äôre going to think I‚Äôm making this up, but it‚Äôs real. This takes place in a world where radiation is cooking the Earth, forcing humanity to live underground. This also means that people with darker skin, being more resistant to solar radiation, are given higher status in society and lighter skinned people are lower in the hierarchy. White people are called ‚Äúpearls‚Äù and black people are called ‚Äúcoals.‚Äù Yeah. This one tries so hard to be anti-racist that it circles back to being extremely racist. Reading this will burn your eyes.

- Glitch (Heather Anastasiu): Nope.

- The Treemakers (Christina L. Rozelle): Kill it with fire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/p4z1e7/im_amazed_how_many_knock_offs_of_the_hunger_games/,2021-08-15T18:35:34Z,21,15,books,The Maze Runner,POST
